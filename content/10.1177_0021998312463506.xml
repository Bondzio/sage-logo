<sec id="sec1-0021998312463506"><title>Special Issue on ‘Multifunctional Composites’</title>
<p>Multifunctional composites are materials systems capable of performing two or more functions simultaneously or sequentially in time. Biological materials provide inspiration and numerous examples of integrated structural, sensing, actuation, control, and healing functionalities optimized through evolution for “system-level performance.” A similar paradigm applies for the design of synthetic multifunctional composites. Multiple functionalities are combined and optimized to enhance system performance and/or expand capabilities by eliminating parasitic redundancies between sub-system materials and functions. Multifunctional design and optimization subordinates “material property” to “system performance” in the materials development process, which creates new opportunities for materials-based advancements but also many new technical challenges.</p>
<p>The idea for this special issue was initiated by a symposium on multifunctional composites for energy performance and efficiency held at the 18th International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM-18) in Jeju Korea in August of 2011. The papers included here address a wide range of multifunctional capabilities related to structure and energy. Thomas et al. describe fiber-reinforced composites with integrated rechargeable lithium-ion cells for structure and energy storage functionality in marine applications. Nagata et al. describe the development of thin-film dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells for use as conformable energy-harvesting wing skins and novel methods for reversibly attaching such cells. Marschilok et al., in two papers, describe multifunctional battery cathodes for metal-air and lithium cells with 20–60% increases in energy capacity using three-dimensional carbon nanotube structures for current collection, material support, and reactive species access/transport. Yu et al. describe a computational methodology for simulating electromagnetic heat control in shape-memory polymer composites with embedded magnetic particles for shape recovery. Zhan et al. describe a novel method for structurally integrating brittle functional components into load bearing structures using micro-scale liquid tension forces. Kaul et al. describe carbon-nanotube-epoxy composites for enhanced heat transport and thermal management in structural joining applications. Salowitz et al. describe novel bio-inspired composite layers with embedded micro-scale sensors, actuators, and processors that can be stretched over large areas for structural damage assessment. Yagnamurthy et al. describe an epoxy-based resin system with small amounts of silica nanoparticles that achieves significant reductions in UV radiation and atomic oxygen damage for low-earth space orbit applications. Kim et al. describe a novel e-beam cross-linking process for carbon-nanotube-polymer composites to achieve electrical and thermal conductivity control and structural reinforcement. And finally, Wang and Inman describe composite spar structures with self-sensing, -actuating, and -energy storage/harvest capabilities for active control of wind gust loads.</p>
<p>My thanks to the authors for their contributions to this special issue on multifunctional composites and to the reviewers whose efforts are vital to achieving high-quality publications. I also wish to thank Dr. Les Lee, Co-Organizer of the ICCM-18 symposium, and Dr. Tom Hahn and the JCM staff for their support and assistance in bringing this special issue to fruition.</p></sec>
