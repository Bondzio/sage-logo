<abstract>
<p>This article reports the results of a study of coverage of the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris published in French newspapers, newsmagazines, and online news media in 2009. Building on a previous study of images of the liberation in Parisian newspapers at the 60th anniversary in 2004, it provides empirical evidence for the conventional wisdom that less anniversary journalism is produced in non-decennial than decennial anniversaries. In addition, the article shows that visual coverage of the 65th anniversary of the liberation was even more reductive than coverage of the 60th, concentrating almost exclusively on images of French joy and authority and forgoing more problematic representations of German occupiers, French collaborationists, and U.S. troops. Finally, the article argues that this sparse and reductive view of the liberation of Paris has the potential to affect collective memories of the event as it recedes into the past and the number of living French citizens who remember it firsthand declines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Europe and the United States, 2004 and 2005 were marked by a series of commemorations—some solemn, some festive—honoring the 60th anniversary of the events leading to the end of World War II in Europe. First came commemorations of the Allies’ landings in France on D-Day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211419356">Bumiller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764211419356">Infield &amp; Douglas, 2004</xref>), which <italic>Time</italic> magazine termed “the Greatest Day” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419356">Gibbs, 2004</xref>). Two months later, France marked the anniversary of the liberation of Paris from the Germans with speeches and outdoor musical theater and street dances reenacting the spontaneous celebrations of 60 years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). In December 2004, Americans and Europeans gathered near Bastonge, Belgium, to remember the Battle of the Bulge, the last major offensive of the Nazis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419356">Associated Press, 2004</xref>). In early 2005, survivors, veterans, and others commemorated the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Jews and others imprisoned in Auschwitz, Dachau, and other Nazi concentration camps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211419356">Dempsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764211419356">Losch, 2005</xref>). On May 8, 2005, Europeans and Americans celebrated the anniversary of VE Day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764211419356">Myers &amp; Bumiller, 2005</xref>), the day the Allies formally accepted Germany’s surrender.</p>
<p>These commemorations had the potential both to reflect society’s ideas of the long-ago events they marked and to alter accreted conceptions of World War II by adding a new layer of representation and interpretation. Similarly, journalistic coverage of the World War II anniversaries and their commemorations had the potential to both reflect and contribute to the building of “collective memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419356">Halbwachs, 1992</xref>), sometimes defined as a “set of ideas, images, feelings about the past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764211419356">Irwin-Zarecka, 2009</xref>, p. 4). As I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith 2010</xref>), for example, collective memories reflected in the visual coverage of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Paris in newspapers published in the French capital overwhelmingly painted the liberation as a joyous celebration, with France as its own heroic liberator. Other aspects of and participants in the liberation—including the German occupiers, French collaborators, and American troops from the U.S. 4th Division—were crowded out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). In addition, the chronology of historic events was muddled, especially in the special commemorative sections some newspapers published, and captions on photos frequently lacked detail about where and when archival images were made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). As a result, the visual coverage had the potential to contribute to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002764211419356">Zelizer (1999)</xref> called a “narrowing of memory” (p. 118) about the past, in which “the very tools by which we assume to remember may in fact be helping us to remember to forget” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764211419356">Zelizer, 1998</xref>, p. 239).</p>
<p>If such reductive coverage was produced in a decennial anniversary year—one of only six since the end of the occupation of Paris—how is war remembered in the media in more frequent “off years,” anniversaries that do not end neatly in a zero? The conventional wisdom is that there are fewer commemorations outside so-called major anniversaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211419356">Johnston (1991)</xref>, for example, writes that “by universal consent” (p. 6) anniversaries tied to historical figures generally are observed only in multiples of 50 years from the figures’ births or deaths. He refers to anniversaries “like the 32d or 180th” as “odd” and calls journalists’ occasional attention to them a “gimmick” (p. 5). Little empirical study, however, has evaluated how much commemoration varies between “major” anniversaries and those in “off years,” though some work has suggested that war and national trauma are less commemorated outside 1st-year, 5th-year, and decennial anniversaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002764211419356">Schwalbe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002764211419356">Wallace-Wells, 2003</xref>). In addition, no study seems to have considered whether during an “off year” anniversary of an event occurring in the recent past, outside factors—such as awareness that people who experienced an event decades ago may not be alive for its next “major” anniversary—might result in different commemoration levels.</p>
<p>The research reported on here was designed to help fill this gap in information on cycles of commemoration in the otherwise burgeoning field of memory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211419356">Kantsteiner, 2002</xref>). The study uses textual analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002764211419356">McKee, 2003</xref>) of French newspaper, news magazine, and website visuals and draws on field observations made in Paris during August 2009 to explain how the liberation was remembered publicly on its 65th anniversary. The article compares the coverage from 2009 to visual commemoration in Parisian newspapers of the 60th anniversary in 2004 and argues that the 2009 coverage was both quantitatively and qualitatively different. Finally, the article discusses the potential impact of off-year observances on collective memory and future commemorations, especially when the number of people who recall the event firsthand is declining.</p>

<title>Occupation and Liberation</title>
<p>Many of those who felt the joy of the liberation in 1944 also likely lived through the invasion of France by the Germans on May 10, 1940, the result of what are widely viewed to have been a series of tactical missteps by France after World War I. Despite warnings from Charles De Gaulle and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764211419356">Gibson, 1945</xref>), the French government, which declared war on Germany after Germany invaded Poland in 1939, had expected that a German attack would come from the east. Accordingly, it had fortified the Maginot Line along its borders with Germany and Italy. France did not, however, extend strong fortifications along the Belgian border, even after Belgium, a former French ally, reaffirmed its neutrality in 1936. In May 1940, Germany invaded Belgium and then marched through the country and entered France through the Ardennes, which had not been thought to be easily penetrable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419356">Allcorn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764211419356">Price, 2005</xref>). The French government evacuated first to Tours, then to Bordeaux, with De Gaulle, then the undersecretary for defense, slipping out to England before France officially surrendered June 22, 1940. In a settlement brokered by World War I hero Marshal Philippe Pétain, the country was split, with a French collaborationist government headed by Pétain nominally controlling the southwestern third of the country from the town of Vichy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002764211419356">Mitchell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Some historians have portrayed the French as nearly universally defiant in the face of the German occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419356">Aron, 1954</xref>); others have seen the French as virtual collaborationists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764211419356">Paxton, 2001</xref>). Still other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of the French willingness to negotiate an armistice with Germany, pointing out how “visions of war, memories of past massacres, and fears of their recurrence dominated the minds of the French” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419356">Bartov, 1997</xref>, pp. 56-57) 21 years after the end of “the war to end all wars.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419356">Cowans (1998)</xref> has written:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To understand France’s choice to cease fighting and hope for German leniency requires an appreciation of a convergence of painful French memories at that time, including memories of World War I, the Great Depression, the bitter conflicts of the Popular Front of 1936-37, and the belated effort to prepare for war. An ongoing national discussion of French decline at that time only worsened the sense of pessimism and resignation. . . . Many believed that Germany’s recent rise to power outlined the shape of things to come. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, even before France’s official surrender, De Gaulle broadcast from London on the BBC what has come to be known as the “Appel du 18 Juin,” a call for the French to resist Nazi occupation. Over time, various anti-German and anti-Vichy groups emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419356">Davies, 2001</xref>), and by the time the Allies landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944, there was an active—though hardly unified—resistance movement in the capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419356">Azéma, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764211419356">Ousby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764211419356">Veillon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764211419356">Veillon &amp; Wieviorka, 1993</xref>). Liberating Paris was not, however, the Allies’ first objective. Although De Gaulle urged U.S. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, commander in chief of the Allied forces, to send troops toward the capital, the U.S. military leadership was reluctant to engage Germans in a city so full of people and historic monuments, preferring instead to surround Paris on the west, south, and east and squeeze the Germans out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419356">Crémieux-Brilhac, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764211419356">Ousby, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Those plans changed after Parisians launched an uprising that featured a strike by police and other groups, allowing resistance forces to take over police headquarters on the Île de la Cité on August 19, 1944, and the Hôtel de Ville, the city hall, the next day. The first Allied troops—three tanks and a few dozen men from Leclerc’s French 2ème division blindée (2nd armored division)—arrived the night of August 24, with more French troops and the U.S. 4th Division following on the 25th (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419356">Crémieux-Brilhac, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764211419356">Horne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764211419356">Kitson, 1995</xref>). That night, De Gaulle gave his famous “Paris outragé! Paris brisé! Paris martyrisé! Mais Paris libéré!” speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211419356">De Gaulle, 2011</xref>) outside the Hôtel de Ville. The next day he and a contingent of French forces and dignitaries marched down the Champs-Élysées to great public acclaim, though bombardments of Paris continued until August 30.</p>

<title>Anniversary Journalism and Collective Memory</title>
<p>At the 60th anniversary of those events, in 2004, the city’s eight paid-circulation daily newspapers—<italic>Le Monde</italic>, <italic>Le Figaro</italic>, <italic>Libération</italic>, <italic>l’Humanité</italic>, <italic>Le Parisien</italic>, <italic>France-Soir</italic>, <italic>La Croix</italic>—and the English-language <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>—and two free dailies (<italic>20 Minutes</italic> and <italic>Metro</italic>) published myriad articles, photographs, illustrations, and maps related to the liberation. Such “anniversary journalism” is sometimes dismissed by journalists as overused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764211419356">King, 1997</xref>) and an easy substitute, in times of reduced resources, for more substantive reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419356">Hogge, 2009</xref>). It has been called “the last resort of a features editor” with pages to fill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211419356">Hamilton, 2003</xref>)—although some journalists perceive that news consumers “react angrily . . . if newspapers neglect anniversaries of events that greatly affected their lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764211419356">Moore, 2006</xref>). Scholars, however, have found value in studying anniversary journalism. While acknowledging that commemorative events provide journalists with an easy “news peg” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419356">Edy, 1999</xref>, p. 75), media studies scholars have viewed anniversary journalism as a potential vehicle for discussing national or organizational ideals and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764211419356">Kitch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764211419356">Taborski, 2004</xref>), for asserting a publication’s role as a public historian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764211419356">Kitch, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764211419356">2002</xref>), or for discourse and healing in the wake of traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419356">Crapanzano, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Commemorative journalism also is a worthwhile object of study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419356">Edy (1999)</xref> maintains, because it often tells not only the story of a contemporary commemoration or anniversary celebration but also the story of the historical event being remembered. Such news media interpretations of historical events often are seen as authoritative accounts, partly, Edy writes, because of journalism’s claim to factualness and partly because many news consumers may have few other sources for interpretation of events that occurred since they left school or that their “harried history instructors could not cover” (p. 72).</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that commemorative journalism offers a complete view of the past or one free from contemporary context. For example, visuals related to U.S. military involvement in the liberation of Paris were almost nonexistent in Parisian newspaper commemoration in 2004, when U.S.-French relations were strained over the U.S.-led war in Iraq and related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). In addition, journalists sometimes do not produce anniversary journalism when it would seem useful to do so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419356">Bachmann (2009)</xref>, for example, argues that Chile’s five national daily newspapers did not mark the anniversaries of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s 1973 takeover of the country until a key “irruption of memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764211419356">Wilde, 1999</xref>, p. 474) occurred in the form of Pinochet’s death in 2006 and the country’s news media were forced to assess his dictatorship.</p>
<p>Such strictures in anniversary journalism have the potential to affect how communities or nations relate to their past, namely, how they construct <italic>collective memory</italic>. That term comes from the work of French sociologist Maurice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419356">Halbwachs (1992)</xref>, who was born in 1877 and died in 1945 in the Nazis’ Buchenwald concentration camp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419356">Friedmann &amp; Mueller, 1946</xref>). He held that “our recollections depend on those of all our fellows, and on the great frameworks of society” (p. 42). Although the growing field of memory studies, loosely based around Halbwachs’ work, has been criticized as lacking conceptual and methodological clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211419356">Kantsteiner, 2002</xref>), collective memory work in the field of media studies has been fairly consistent—perhaps thanks to an influential essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002764211419356">Zelizer (1995)</xref>—in conceptualizing collective memory as something approaching “a graphing of the past as it is used for present aims” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002764211419356">Zelizer, 1995</xref>, p. 217) or “the ongoing collaborative recasting of ‘the past’—of a particular group, event, or experience—in the present” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764211419356">Hoskins, 2001</xref>, p. 336). From this perspective, collective memory can be seen as something journalistic accounts help to form, especially when the accounts are widely disseminated, and as a taken-for-granted conception of the past that is embedded into journalistic accounts about the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419356">Edy (1999)</xref> notes, “the stories of the past presented in the media, especially on television, are far more visceral than those presented in the classroom” (p. 72). For most people, media accounts also are seen more frequently than history. So media accounts that are necessarily partial or reflective of contemporary contexts may be remembered better than the more nuanced work of historians, with detrimental effects on collective memory. In addition, research showing that conversations about some aspects of a traumatic event can cause participants to forget other aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211419356">Coman, Manier, &amp; Hirst, 2009</xref>) raises the possibility that the aspects of events emphasized in anniversary journalism might come to be those most remembered or most vividly remembered and those not covered more easily forgotten.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0002764211419356" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Questions and Method</title>
<p>Previous work on collective memory and the liberation of Paris, as well as previous work on anniversary journalism, suggested the two research questions guiding this study:</p>
<list id="list1-0002764211419356" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How much commemorative journalism about the liberation of Paris was published in a non-decennial anniversary?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: How was the liberation portrayed in visuals in an off-year anniversary?</p></list-item></list>
<p>This study answered those questions by analyzing coverage of the liberation in the eight paid-circulation, general-interest daily newspapers published in Paris—the left-of-center <italic>Le Monde</italic>, the right-of-center <italic>Le Figaro</italic>, the left-leaning <italic>Libération</italic>, the Communist <italic>l’Humanité</italic>, the Catholic <italic>La Croix</italic>, the “popular” titles <italic>Le Parisien</italic> and <italic>France-Soir</italic>, and the English-language <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>, published as “the global edition of <italic>The New York Times</italic>,” its owner—which were gathered from newsstands in Paris in 2009. Also included in the analysis were the home pages of those newspapers’ websites; the home pages of two free-distribution Parisian newspapers, <italic>20 Minutes</italic> and <italic>Metro</italic>; the home page of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Rue89.com">Rue89.com</ext-link>, an online-only news and commentary site founded by former employees of <italic>Libération</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764211419356">Mackenzie, 2009</xref>); and the three principal French news magazines, <italic>L’Express</italic>, <italic>Le Nouvel Observateur</italic>, and <italic>Le Point</italic>.</p>
<p>Because the main events of the liberation in 1944 occurred August 24-26 and because most of the coverage of the 60th anniversary of the liberation in 2004 had appeared in newspapers published August 24-26, I examined newspapers and web content published on those dates, as well as news magazines dated August 20 or August 20-26, which were available on newsstands in Paris during the 65th anniversary. Mindful of the ephemeral nature of the web and the methodological issues inherent in analyzing both static print content and online content that can easily be updated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764211419356">Keith, Schwalbe, &amp; Silcock, 2010</xref>), I archived each web home page several times each day, hoping to capture, however imperfectly, at least some of the changes. Website home pages were archived at least twice a day (and up to four times) on August 24, 2009, four times a day on August 25, and once early on August 26.</p>
<p>I initially examined each editorial visual (advertising was not included in the study) in the newspapers and news magazines and on the websites, searching for evidence in the image, its caption (if there was one), and adjacent headlines, titles, and text that the visual was related to the liberation of Paris. After realizing that the newspapers, newsmagazines, and websites contained very few liberation images, I expanded the analysis to consider all the textual content in an effort to understand what news outlets that were not focusing on the liberation had been covering. This interpretive analysis was supplemented with field observations I made at commemorative events in Paris in late August 2009. The resulting argument, that of an American academic who has lived in Paris twice and visited France 16 other times over 26 years, was developed from a close reading of the content as I made note of emergent themes.</p>

<title>An Anniversary All but Forgotten</title>
<p>The most prevalent theme to emerge from coverage of the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris in Parisian media was one of the potential for forgetting, evident in the contrast between coverage of the liberation in 2004 and 2009. In 2004, the city’s eight paid-circulation and two free daily newspapers published 217 liberation-related photographs, illustrations, and maps on a <italic>single day</italic> of the 60th anniversary commemorations, August 25, 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>, p. 137). In 2009, the larger number of media examined in this study—the eight paid-circulation daily newspapers and their websites, the websites of the two free dailies, the independent online news site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Rue89.com">Rue89.com</ext-link>, and the three major French newsmagazines—published only 11 liberation-related still images and one multimedia presentation over <italic>three days</italic> around the 65th anniversary.</p>
<p>It was not only visuals of the liberation that were missing; most of the media outlets examined also did not mention the 65th anniversary of the liberation in text. The newsmagazines <italic>L’Express</italic>, <italic>Le Nouvel Observateur</italic>, and <italic>Le Point</italic> took no note at all of the liberation. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419356">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764211419356">2</xref>.) Neither, on any of the days studied, did the print versions of <italic>Le Monde</italic>, <italic>Libération</italic>, or the <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>. Online, the anniversary was absent on all three days, at least at the times pages were archived, from the home pages of the websites of <italic>Le Monde</italic>, <italic>Libération</italic>, the <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic>, <italic>Le Parisien</italic>, and <italic>Metro</italic> and from <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Rue89.com">Rue89.com</ext-link></italic>. Of the news outlets that did mark the anniversary—<italic>Le Figaro</italic>, <italic>L’Humanité</italic>, <italic>La Croix</italic>, and <italic>France-Soir</italic> in print and online; <italic>Le Parisien</italic> in print; and <italic>20 Minutes</italic> online—only <italic>Le Figaro</italic> made note of the anniversary on all three days of the study.</p>

<p>When the anniversary of the liberation <italic>was</italic> discussed in print, mentions were sometimes very brief. For example, <italic>Le Parisien</italic>’s coverage of the liberation on August 24, 2009, was limited to two one-paragraph stories about commemorative events planned for the next day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764211419356">“Hommage aux résistants parisiens,” 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764211419356">“La prefecture fermée demain,” 2009</xref>). On August 25, <italic>Le Figaro</italic> “covered” the anniversary with a single archival photo and caption on the op-ed page, and <italic>France-Soir</italic> mentioned the anniversary only in connection with President Nicholas Sarkozy’s schedule for the day, noting in nine words that it included “célébration du 65<sup>e</sup> anniversaire de la libération de Paris” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764211419356">“L’agenda présidentiel,” 2009</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>Why was the coverage of the 65th anniversary of the liberation so sparse? This contrast in anniversary coverage between 2004 and 2009 reflected to some extent the difference in the number of liberation-related commemorative events. In 2004, the liberation’s 60th anniversary was observed in scores of events in and around Paris. Then-President Jacques Chirac spoke at ceremonies at the Place de la Concorde, police headquarters, and the Hôtel de Ville; there were dances at the Place de la Bastille and in the Luxembourg Gardens; and an outdoor musical called “Liberty-Liberté” was staged on streets blocked to traffic around the Place de la Bastille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). In contrast, in 2009 there were just three main liberation commemorations in Paris: a speech by Sarkozy at police headquarters that was not open to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002764211419356">Najafi, 2009</xref>); a public event honoring veterans of the resistance at the Place du 18 Juin 1940 in Montparnasse, followed by a military presentation in the Jardin du Atlantique; and a public military presentation and ceremony honoring the resistance in front of the Hôtel de Ville (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211419356">Bourgeay, 2009</xref>). It is striking, however, how little coverage these 65th anniversary events received. Only <italic>Le Parisien</italic> published information about any of the events the day before, giving Parisians time to plan to attend those open to the public, and it mentioned only the Hôtel de Ville event and Sarkozy’s speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764211419356">“Hommage aux résistants parisiens,” 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764211419356">“La prefecture fermée demain,” 2009</xref>). None of the media outlets published photos or stories after the fact about the public event in Montparnasse, which drew only a few dozen spectators (possibly as a result of the lack of advance coverage), or the Hôtel de Ville ceremony, which drew several hundred. Sarkozy’s speech was slightly better covered, with a story and photo in <italic>Le Figaro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764211419356">Leclerc, 2009</xref>); a story in <italic>L’Humanité</italic> criticizing the president for using the liberation speech to push a political agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002764211419356">Staat, 2009</xref>); and a photo in <italic>France-Soir</italic> and a summary and photo on its website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764211419356">“Sarkozy: La sécurité, ‘premier droit’ de français,” 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One also might be tempted to argue that breaking news stories developing in France and Europe crowded out coverage of the liberation anniversary, and there was, in fact, a great deal of interesting news around that date. Sarkozy, who had spent 25 days vacationing at Cap Negre in the South of France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764211419356">Jeudy, 2009</xref>), returned to work August 25, meeting first with his cabinet and then with the presidents of French banks, for whom he outlined a new plan to limit bonuses paid to traders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419356">Giacometti &amp; Houchard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002764211419356">Visot, 2009</xref>). In addition, the French Socialist Party’s “université d’eté” gathering in the seaside resort of La Rochelle was grabbing headlines as the media debated the future of the political left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211419356">Durand, 2009</xref>). Unemployment remained high in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211419356">Delberghe, 2009</xref>). Elsewhere in Europe, Greece was fighting huge brushfires on the outskirts of Athens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419356">Carassava &amp; Bilefsky, 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, concern about the H1N1 virus, called “grippe A” in French, was spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419356">Barbier, 2009</xref>), after six deaths in France’s overseas “departments,” such as New Caledonia and Reunion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002764211419356">Valdés, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>But a similar amount of news was breaking in France and around Europe in 2004, when the 60th anniversary received much more coverage. For example, separatist tensions were running high in Georgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764211419356">Myers, 2004</xref>); the Summer Olympics were underway in Athens, Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764211419356">Sachs, 2004</xref>); and the 35-hour workweek was being threatened in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419356">“35 heures: le sujet brûlant de la rentrée,” 2004</xref>). The United States was reeling from revelations about the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211419356">Crampton, 2004</xref>), and the battle for the U.S. presidency between Sen. John Kerry and incumbent George W. Bush was making headlines both in the United States and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002764211419356">Newman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>So more likely a factor, in a year that was unusually rich with decennial anniversaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764211419356">West, 2009</xref>), is that by the time the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris came around, Parisian editors had already had their fill of anniversary journalism. Among the anniversaries marked in 2009 were the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China; the 40th anniversaries of the moon landings, Woodstock, and <italic>Sesame Street</italic>; and the 20th anniversaries of Tiananmen Square and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some of the Parisian news media, in fact, were still displaying multimedia packages or photo galleries from these anniversaries on their websites in August 2009. For example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://20Minutes.com">20Minutes.com</ext-link> featured slide shows on the Woodstock and Tiananmen Square anniversaries, as well as two retrospectives on the life of pop singer Michael Jackson, who had died 2 months earlier. LeMonde.com featured a video of the building of the Berlin Wall, tied to the 20th anniversary of its fall, and LeParisien.com offered a link to an Agence France Presse story on the 50th anniversary of the British Motor Co.’s Mini car.</p>
<p>Some commemorative articles even focused on World War II. The newsmagazine <italic>L’Express</italic>, for example, devoted five pages to a story with nine archival photographs on the Phoney War, the period between September 3, 1939, when Great Britain and France declared war on Germany after the invasion of Poland, and May 10, 1940, when Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419356">Hecht, 2009</xref>). <italic>Le Monde</italic>, meanwhile, marked the <italic>anniversary</italic> of a <italic>commemoration</italic> by reprinting on August 25, under the standing headline “il y a 50 ans dans Le Monde” (50 years ago in <italic>Le Monde</italic>) seven paragraphs from a memoir of a woman who had returned to Paris after being released from a provincial Gestapo prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419356">Auscher, 2009</xref>). The piece originally was published in 1959, 15 years after her return to Paris.</p>
<p>Decennial anniversaries also occurred in 2004, of course, when observances of the liberation of Paris received greater coverage. That year marked the 90th anniversary of the start of World War I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419356">Hawley, 2004</xref>), the 60th anniversary of D-Day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419356">Gibbs, 2004</xref>), the 30th anniversary of the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764211419356">“Nixon Resigns,” 2004</xref>), and the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419356">Amanpour, 2004</xref>). However, for sheer outpouring of decennial anniversaries of events that working editors might have experienced firsthand—and thus feel some nostalgia about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764211419356">West, 2009</xref>)—2009 outpaced 2004.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that there was more at work in the lack of liberation coverage than editors suffering from anniversary fatigue. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211419356">Frijda (1997)</xref> has noted, commemoration of traumatic events, such as wars, “rests, to a large extent, on the emotions of those who suffered from the remembered events or lost people in them” (p. 103).In 2004, people who would have been at least 10 years old at the time of the liberation, and thus likely to have strong memories of it, made up about 12% of the population of metropolitan France, a number that had fallen to 8.8% by 2009. (Population par sexe et groupes d’âges quinquennaux, série longue depuis 1991, 2011). Almost certainly, few, if any, members of that age group were still working in 2009 in positions responsible for planning mainstream media content. Even the children of people who lived through the occupation as adults would have been, in 2009, past or nearing the then- minimum French retirement age of 60. So it is possible that younger editors were less interested in the liberation or perceived that their audiences were less interested. It is also possible that editors’ perceptions about reader interest was a factor in the surprising lack of multimedia or photo gallery projects on the liberation, which would seem, technically, to be an ideal venue for displaying images that users might want to enlarge and pore over.</p>
<p>The overall lack of coverage may further be explained, at least in part, by humans’ psychological need to structure time into manageable chunks. Commemorating at exact time intervals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211419356">Frijda (1997)</xref> writes, reflects humans’ need “to bring order into the amorphous flow of time, to structure it, and to mark their own position in the flow” (p. 108). One way of establishing such a structure over time is to conceive of some anniversaries as “bigger” than others, with the gaps between significant cultural commemorations growing to 50 or 100 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211419356">Johnston, 1991</xref>) as the commemorated event recedes into the long-ago past. This ordering of time enables the development of journalistic routines around the use of commemorative content. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764211419356">Shoemaker and Reese (1996)</xref> have described in their framework of a hierarchy of influences on media content, it is less likely that individual journalists influence news media content than it is that content is produced through routines, developed over time for their efficiency. They write:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The standardized, recurring patterns of news and entertainment content result in large part from these routine practices. These routines insure the media systems will respond in predictable ways and cannot be easily violated. They form a cohesive set of rules and become integral parts of what it means to be a media professional. (p. 106)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such routines about anniversary coverage, perhaps embedded at a level where they were followed almost unconsciously, may have allowed Parisian journalists to “know” that a 5-year anniversary did not require extensive visual or textual coverage.</p>

<title>Images of Liberation: Emphasis on Authority and Joy</title>
<p>The small amount of coverage of the 65th anniversary of the liberation was matched by the limited scope of the visuals used. The three categories of liberation images that rarely appeared in 2004—Germans, French collaborators, and Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>)—were either completely absent from the 2009 visual record (Germans and French collaborators) or shown in a single instance (Americans). Two types of images that were frequently seen in 2004 coverage, close-ups of joyous young women and resistance forces actively fighting, also were rare studying 2009. However, the most striking aspects of the visual coverage of the 60th anniversary—the portrayal of French authority and joy as what the liberation was essentially about—was duplicated in the 65th anniversary images.</p>
<p>Of the 11 liberation-related single images used in newspapers and on the websites, 6 in some way reaffirmed French strength. For example, on August 25, 2009, <italic>Le Figaro</italic> published on its opinions page a stand-alone, uncredited vertical image of De Gaulle, who served as president of France from 1959 to 1969, leading a parade down the Champs-Elysèes on August 26, 1944. In the image, he was followed by military officers, civilians, and what appears to be a tank from the French 2ème division blindée. The Arc de Triomphe loomed behind De Gaulle, with its opening framing his head like a halo or crown. On August 26, 2009, the home page of <italic>La Croix</italic> featured another uncredited, stand-alone photograph of the parade, this one horizontal and taken from a point farther east on the Champs-Elysèes. Though the wider frame put De Gaulle in the middle of a large group of marchers, it also emphasized his height—variously reported as 6 feet, 4 inches and 6 feet, 5 inches. The image tended to reinforce the idea of De Gaulle as a strong leader and the French people, his followers, as a unified group, though that was far from an accurate description of the resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419356">Azéma, 1993</xref>). French authority and joy also was on view in <italic>Le Parisien</italic> in a photograph showing the arrival of the 2ème division blindée on the Champs-Élysées on August 25, 1944. The image, published with an August 25, 2009, story about anniversary commemorations, melded conceptions of French power and joy, evoking joy through the crowds lining the thoroughfare and authority through the images of tanks and reference to De Gaulle in a banner stretching along the north side of crowd that read “Vive De Gaulle.”</p>
<p>Another type of French authority was on display in images of the current president, Sarkozy, used with stories about his speech at police headquarters in the August 26 editions of <italic>Le Figaro</italic> and print and web editions of <italic>France-Soir</italic>. Sarkozy is not as imposing physically as De Gaulle was, and he is shown leaning into a handshake in two of the photos and toward a podium in another. Yet, the images of the embodiment of French governmental power, appearing alongside text explaining Sarkozy’s law-and-order political agenda, had the effect of reinforcing the authority of, if not France, at least the Elysée Palace. It is interesting to note, however, that the cropping of the images, none of which is more than two compact-newspaper-format columns wide, leaves them depicting Sarkozy standing either alone or facing a small group, a marked contrast to the more formal and imposing images of De Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées leading the nation into the future. The contrast likely was the result, however, of the differing choreography of the events. The 1944 parade was a public and stately occasion, designed to be photographed, while Sarkozy’s 2009 speech was a limited-access appointment during a busy day for the president.</p>
<p>Five of the six remaining single liberation images that appeared in the newspapers and websites studied featured French resistance fighters or military veterans. (A sixth liberation-related visual, a traffic map in <italic>Le Parisien</italic> on August 25, showed the location of the Paris city hall, where a liberation commemoration was expected to snarl traffic.) <italic>L’Humanité</italic> accompanied a story critical of Sarkozy’s liberation speech with an uncredited, black-and-white archival photograph showing a dozen men standing behind a barricade across the Rue St. Jacques in the city’s Latin Quarter, an image of the type that appeared fairly often in the 2004 coverage. <italic>Le Parisien</italic> featured small contemporary photographs of two veterans of the conflict who were profiled in short stories: Eugene Battestini, 85, a former member of the 2ème division blindée who was struck August 25, 1944, by a bullet that left him a paraplegic, and Cécile Rol-Tanguy, 90, the widow of Henri Rol-Tanguy, an important leader of the communist resistance. These photographs provided an essential and poignant counterpoint to the images of heads of state, offering evidence that the French authority displayed in images of leaders was dependent on work by ordinary French men and women. The images of Battestini and Rol-Tanguy also served as reminders that firsthand experience of World War II is slipping away. Upon viewing the photos, it is impossible to avoid wondering whether Battestini and Rol-Tanguy will be alive to tell their stories at the 70th anniversary of the liberation.</p>
<p>There was no such ambiguity in the single multimedia presentation on the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764211419356">“Il y a 65 ans, Paris libéré,” 2009</xref>) found in the study. Posted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://LeFigaro.com">LeFigaro.com</ext-link>, it consisted of nine black-and-white archival photographs from 1944 and just over a minute of a video montage attributed to France’s l’Institut National de l’Audiovisuel that strongly reinforced themes, present in coverage of the 60th anniversary, of the French in charge of their own liberation. The presentation opened with a still image of tanks from the 2ème division blindée rolling into Paris at the Porte d’Orleans, as Gen. Leclerc watched, followed by an image of celebration at the Hôtel de Ville. Other still images showed the cover of the first post-liberation issue of Le Figaro, which had been suppressed by the Germans; crowds gathered on the Champs-Elysées; crowds crouching behind what appears to be the basin wall of a fountain after sniper fire from fleeing Germans; De Gaulle leading the parade on August 26, 1944; a soldier leaning down from a tank to kiss a woman; a toddler in a woman’s arms, eating what the caption describes as white bread, largely unavailable during the occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211419356">DiMuzio, 2009</xref>); and an American Jeep parked in front of the Eiffel Tower, with four soldiers—the first post-liberation tourists?—gazing at the iconic structure.</p>
<p>The video montage embedded into the presentation after the first two still images followed a similar narrative arc. It began with tanks entering Paris as Leclerc watched and then moved to images of cheering crowds, followed by an excerpt from DeGaulle’s “Paris libéré!” speech. The second half of the video was devoted to the parade of August 26, 1944, and showed surging crowds, women climbing onto tanks parked along the Champs-Elysées, and De Gaulle leading dignitaries along the avenue. A moment of comic relief was provided by a soldier who appears to be an American shouting into a microphone in heavily accented French, “Le peuple de Paris est bonne et jolie,” to great applause. Again, French authority, represented in the images of tanks entering the capital, dissolved into French joy, which dissolved into a representation, in the images of De Gaulle, of French authority and resolve.</p>
<p>Because so few 65th anniversary images were published, there was less chance in 2009 for the temporal and spatial muddling seen frequently in 2004, when Parisian newspapers published many archival photographs without information about where and when they were taken and sometimes published images of pre-liberation fighting next to or after images of events of August 26, 1944, celebrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419356">Keith, 2010</xref>). One striking example of chronological muddling did exist, however, in visual coverage of the 65th anniversary. The vertical image of De Gaulle leading a march down the Champs-Élysées described previously was published in Le Figaro as part of a standing opinion-page feature called “Ce jour-la” that is roughly equivalent to the “today in history” features some U.S. daily newspapers once published. The image was printed as the feature photo for August 25, 2009, even though it depicted an event that occurred on August, 26, 1944.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Such a single muddling of chronology is unlikely to have great effect on collective memory about an event. However, the Parisian news media’s coverage of the liberation and its commemorations during the non-decennial anniversary of 2009 does hold the potential for affecting future coverage, both in quantity and quality.</p>
<p>The study found a scant amount of attention paid to the liberation during an anniversary year that ended with a five, empirical evidence of the conventional wisdom that events should be most remembered at “round number” anniversaries. If that coverage is viewed by journalists as sufficient, then even less attention may be devoted to remembering the liberation and covering commemoration activities during anniversaries that end in something other than zero or five. That could in turn set a very low bar for anniversary coverage in even decennial years, when any greater amount of attention might by contrast seem to be appropriate recognition of an important historical moment. Thus, new journalistic routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764211419356">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>) about the importance of remembering World War II in the media might evolve as the commemorated event recedes into the past.</p>
<p>Just as important as the quantity of coverage in 2009 is the quality. Five years earlier, the French news media’s copious visual coverage of the 60th anniversary had turned the complex story of the liberation, with its many participants and facets, into a reductive narrative of French authority and joy, rarely featuring visuals of liberation actors who were more problematic for France: the German occupiers, collaborationists, and American troops. In 2009, the sharp reduction in the quantity of coverage necessarily resulted in a further reduction in how the liberation was portrayed. The categories of images that were rare in 2004 disappeared almost altogether in 2009. Also gone were images of resistance forces actively fighting and one category of “joy” portrayals: those of French women exulting.</p>
<p>This reductive portrayal has the potential to imprint itself on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764211419356">Hirsch (2001)</xref> refers to as “postmemory.” She writes about this type of memory—held by “children of victims, survivors, witnesses, or perpetrators” of a trauma and mediated through “representation, projection, and creation” (p. 220)—mostly in connection with the horror of the Holocaust. It would seem, however, that the concept of postmemory might be applicable even to a mostly joyous occasion, such as the liberation of Paris, and to the children of the people who lived through it—if the joyous event were preceded by deprivation and trauma, such as the occupation. If subjects viewed as inappropriate are virtually “erased” from contemporary accounts of the joyous outcome—as Germans and French collaborators were in Parisian media coverage of the 60th and 65th anniversaries of the liberation—then it would seem that over time, these reductive accounts might come to compete in the minds of the second generation with elders’ recollections of what the events meant.</p>
<p>There is much room for future research on this and related topics. To gain better understanding of cycles of commemoration, especially those related to war, it would be useful to repeat this study first on a liberation anniversary that ends in some number other than zero or five to determine whether there was even less coverage than on the 65th anniversary in 2009. In the longer term, it would be useful to evaluate visual depictions of the liberation of Paris in Parisian newspapers from the decennial anniversary years not studied in this work: 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984, 1994, and 2014. Such work should help determine whether the lack of media attention to the 65th anniversary was the result of a crowding out by competing anniversaries, a generationally driven decline in interest in World War II, or merely the result of a human and journalistic tendency to organize time into blocks neatly divisible by 10. Looking beyond the liberation of Paris, it would be worthwhile to compare media coverage of decennial and “off-year” anniversaries of other events—particularly those centered on trauma, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001—to determine whether visual (and textual) commemoration follows reliable patterns over time and across cultures.</p>
<p>This would be important work because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419356">Edy (1999)</xref> has noted, for some members of generations removed from any event, media representations serve as the most easily accessible account of history, helping to shape collective memory. When media accounts are sparse and reductive, they limit our understanding of the original event, which would seem to be especially problematic where war is concerned. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419356">Cowans (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419356">Bartov (1997)</xref> ably argue in discussing the relationships between France’s devastating World War I history and its early World War II decision making, any nation’s contemporary experience with war and conflict is informed by its past military engagements. How its citizens remember past wars and the events associated with them frames how future conflict will be understood.</p>
