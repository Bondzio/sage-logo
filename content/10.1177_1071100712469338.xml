<p>I first met Mr G a number of years ago when he sought out a consultation for treatment of a diabetic foot ulcer. He was a successful businessman who was able to retire in his midfifties to pursue his passion for golf. His major concern was that the prescribed treatment involving nonweightbearing precluded his ability to play golf. I realized that the ulcer was ischemic, so I referred him to one of my vascular surgery colleagues, who performed an angiogram and determined that his peripheral vascular disease was nonreconstructable. He regained his good spirits when he returned to the golf course less than 6 weeks following a successful below-knee amputation.</p>
<p>I didn’t hear from Mr G for over 4 years, when he presented with an ischemic foot ulcer on his remaining foot. I now sent him to a vascular surgeon fresh out of fellowship, who performed a successful angioplasty that kept Mr G on the golf course for 3 more years when progression of his vascular disease necessitated a second below-knee amputation. The picture highlights his successful return to the golf course less than 3 weeks following uneventful below-knee amputation. I received a heartwarming letter from his wife 4 years later following his death from a heart attack. She told me how appreciative Mr G was for the number of rounds of golf he was able to play thanks to my reconstructive amputation surgery.</p>

<p>What does the saga of Mr G have to do with outcomes and registries? What does Mr G teach us about the necessity for the registry that the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) is spending so much of the membership’s capital? In the modern era of measuring outcomes, what do we learn from Mr G? The vascular surgeon objectively measures outcomes based on graft patency and limb salvage. The metrics of a patent bypass graft and successful limb salvage are associated with a favorable outcome, and graft occlusion and amputation are associated with a poor outcome. The orthopaedic surgeon measures outcomes based on amputation wound healing and successful prosthetic limb fitting. A healed amputation wound and the ability to walk in the house would be the metrics associated with a favorable outcome. Mr G was not willing to undergo a prolonged limb salvage course of treatment. He was happiest (favorable outcome) when he got back on the golf course with a prosthesis. If he had undergone vascular bypass surgery and been limited to household walking, the vascular surgeon would have recorded his outcome as a success. If he underwent amputation and was successfully fit with a prosthesis and then only able to walk in the house, the orthopaedic surgeon would have recorded his treatment as a successful outcome. Mr G would have rated each of these outcomes as a failure. The ability to return to the golf course with bilateral amputations was the only favorable outcome according to Mr G.</p>
<p>Hence, outcome data are meaningful only if they measure relevant metrics. We need to ensure that the outcome information that we obtain from the treatment of patients like Mr G will be relevant and provide us the information to make correct patient care decisions. How will PROMIS and the AOFAS registry ensure that we collect appropriate patientcentric information?</p>
<p>Much effort has been taken to ensure that PROMIS asks the correct questions. Based on Mr G’s responses to the initial questions, the questionnaire will select queries that are relevant to Mr G’s needs. It is obvious that we cannot use the same outcome questions to determine efficacy of ankle replacement for rheumatoid arthritis as we would be required in evaluating lateral ankle ligament reconstruction in athletes. For that matter, we need different queries when evaluating treatment of ankle instability in workers’ compensation laborers as compared with professional athletes. The PROMIS system uses psychometric algorithms to select appropriate banks of questions to ask Mr G, based on his responses to introductory queries. If done correctly, the registry then collects meaningful information that answers appropriate questions.</p>
<p>We then use these collective data to assist the health system in allocating resources for both treatment and product development. Information such as this is crucial to assist us in determining relative resource allocations. As this information evolves, it tells us whether we should focus development of devices to assist in performing ankle arthroplasty or ankle fusion. Information like this will also help us avoid the unfortunate experience of our hip arthroplasty colleagues who may have done a significant disservice to a number of their patients by implanting metal-on-metal hips.</p>
<p>The AOFAS has decided to expend significant resources to develop a meaningful registry. The FootForum views this effort as essential to advancing the science of caring for our patients. In addition, this information is crucial to support our efforts in dealing with a market-driven health care system where, so often, we perceive that the payers are trying very hard to restrict our ability to care for our patients.
