<p>Our public schools are a problem and compensation is a central issue. I fully appreciate the cost and tax implications but I also am aware that when the performance of our students is compared with other countries the US is now no better than average. That has long term implications for our economy.</p>
<p>I certainly am not suggesting that pay alone is a solution but my experience has convinced me that it is part of the problem.</p>
<p>First, for those who have not followed the media coverage of the comparisons with other countries, here are the facts, based primarily in data compiled by the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD), a 34 country, Paris based organization that does studies for government.</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712469488" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The US scores on reading, mathematics and science are average among a list of 65 countries. Canada, Japan, Korea, and Australia are among the countries that score consistently higher.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We rank 14<sup>th</sup> in the world in the percentage - 42% - of 25-34 year olds with education beyond high school. The highest is Korea where 65% have more than a high school education.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We rank 28<sup>th</sup> in the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among all 34 countries that support the OECD, an average of 30% of the cost of higher education comes from private sources, while in the US 62% is private funding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The odds of someone with parents who have low levels of education attending college are only 17%, while the average in the 34 countries is 33%. Only two countries are worse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The US spends 7.3% of our GDP (including both public and private sources) on all levels of education. Among the 34 countries, the percentage is higher in only four countries – Denmark, Iceland, Korea and New Zealand. In dollars we spend over $15,800 per student.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In light of the performance of US students, it may be surprising to learn that US teachers devote more hours actually teaching than the average country – 1,100 versus 782 for primary teachers, 1,070 versus 704 for middle school teachers, and 1,050 versus 658 for high school teachers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The final point is that the salaries of US teachers (with 15 years of experience and a BA/BS degree) are comparatively low. Elementary teachers in the US are paid 67% of the average pay of other workers with the same education, while in other OECD countries the average is 82%. High school teachers earn 72% while in other countries the average is 90%.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The bottom line is the US is spending a lot of money but we are not getting the results we need to remain a leader in fields requiring a world class education.</p>
<p>From a different source, a recent interim report released by the National Academy of Engineering documents the continuing demand for STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – specialists, and the small fraction of college graduates with degrees in these fields. Teachers are known to pay an important role in career choice. It would be decidedly advantageous to have teachers with a passion for these fields who can inspire and guide students into these fields.</p>
<p>One of the reasons of course is that these occupations are well paid in our economy. The problems schools have recruiting teachers in these fields is well documented. There have been experiments to provide higher salaries and incentives to math and science teachers but it is unlikely public schools will ever compete strictly on salary. It should be a national priority to find ways to recruit and retain well qualified people in these fields.</p>
<p>On a different issue, one of the profound changes in our workforce over almost half a century is the widespread acceptance of women in virtually every occupation. That means fewer talented women are opting for a career in education. There was obviously a time when teaching was one of a handful of professional careers open to women, and our schools and generations of students benefited from that. That is certainly less true today.</p>
<p>The final point is that in those countries with the best school systems – Singapore, Finland and Korea − 100% of the new teachers each year are recruited from the top third of the year’s college graduates. In the US only 23% come from the top third. Research also shows that the evidence that academic success is a predictor of teaching effectiveness is mixed. It’s more than earning high grades. However, our country cannot continue to lead the world if students learn from poorly educated teachers.</p>
<p><italic>We have a problem and compensation is a thread that runs through all of the discussions related to recruiting and retaining effective teachers. It is also true that experts agree raising teacher pay levels and switching to pay for performance will help to make the career more attractive to well qualified graduates and contribute to improved performance.</italic></p>
<p>The country has to decide how important improved school performance is. I am certainly very much aware that the country has not emerged from the recession. There is evidence that state and local governments layoffs and downsizing has leveled off. Some public employers are once again hiring. We as a country need to invest in better schools.</p>
<p>My purpose in drafting this editorial is to encourage the compensation community to support efforts to develop more effective compensation systems in our public schools.</p>

<title>The Base Pay Problem</title>
<p>Teacher salary schedules are a remnant of an era that ended long ago. The single schedule, pay-everyone-alike idea dates to the early years of the last century. Linking teacher salaries to higher educational levels was then seen as important to upgrading the teaching profession.</p>
<p>The basic salary system model has been unchanged, except for periodic increases, for roughly 100 years.</p>
<p>An important point is that research has not confirmed that teachers with advanced degrees are better teachers. Why are teachers paid more simply because of the added education?</p>
<p>Significantly, neither starting salaries for new graduates nor the ceiling on salaries are aligned with market pay levels. Both are determined through collective bargaining and the budgetary limitations of state and local government.</p>
<p>Teacher unions have played a role throughout. They are of course democratic organizations where policies are determined with a goal of gaining member support. It is generally true that the more active union members are older, with several years of job experience. They naturally focus more on what happens to the higher salaries and benefits, and less on starting salaries.</p>
<p>The argument for increasing starting salaries for hard-to-fill fields like math and science is certainly not new. The answer far too often has been to assign someone who little if any background in these subjects as the teacher. Unions have generally opposed any change in the standard salary schedule.</p>
<p>A final point is that school systems save money when an experienced teacher retires or resigns since they can normally hire a replacement new graduate. School systems may receive applications from former teachers or teachers from other districts but those individuals by law or labor agreement would have to start at the salary dictated by their experience. New graduates cost less.</p>

<title>Paying Teachers for Performance</title>
<p>This is without question the major stumbling block. Picture the peasants behind the barricades in the French revolution or the Texans at the Alamo. The unions have been fighting this losing battle for over a decade but beachheads have been secured. The most prominent proponent is the Secretary of Education, Arnie Duncan.</p>
<p>If you followed the recent teachers’ strike in Chicago, pay for performance was at the heart of that clash. As I write, there is an article in the <italic>New York Times</italic> about a similar clash in Newark where a local union leader agreed to a pay for performance provision in a new contract but now there is a possibility that union members could vote against it.</p>
<p>A little over a decade ago I served as a consultant to a school district in the Philadelphia suburbs that adopted a pay for performance policy. The issue went to arbitration. I was asked to testify and was grilled by two union representatives. I was certain I saw hatred in their eyes. The school district won but after two years the policy was terminated. The reward was a bonus for high performing teachers and the union persuaded the recipients to not accept the money!</p>
<p>The popular basis then for measuring teacher performance was the gain in student test results, now referred to as value added. The argument is that each student should show a gain in mastery of a subject of one year. That makes sense for all students, including those who start low. Unfortunately it is applicable only to academic subjects where testing at the beginning and end of the school year makes sense.</p>
<p>This was early in the struggle to move to pay for performance. A lot of experimental approaches have been tried but there is still no consensus on how to evaluate teacher performance.</p>
<p>There is, however, evidence that pay for performance can contribute to improved results. In a recently reported experimental study by a team of economists, they found that when teachers stand to lose money, student performance is significantly higher. In the experiment teachers were given a lump sum at the beginning of the year. At year end those teachers whose students exceeded learning goals were awarded more money. Those teachers who failed to reach the goals had to pay back a portion of the funds. (In England the government has been arguing for a similar approach to executive bonuses where the idea is referred to as ‘earnback.’)</p>
<p>An aspect of the problem is that for years teacher evaluations have been meaningless. Every teacher expects to be rated at the highest level – and usually are. Ratings have no consequences.</p>
<p>The situation with school principals is no different. There have been several movies depicting the positive impact of outstanding principals. Their leadership can be instrumental in creating a great school. At their worst they can destroy the learning environment. Their performance and their impact is too often an afterthought.</p>
<p>Again there has been research both on defining the role of principals – too often they have far too little say on what happens in a school – and the potential for cash rewards. Their leadership can be instrumental.</p>
<p>Another of my clients was the Miami Dade County Public Schools. Today there are 380,000 students attending 415 institutions of learning, including 195 elementary schools. The school populations range from the very rich to the extremely poor. I helped them redefine the salary system for their non-teaching staff. The people in the system administration offices knew by name the best principals. Their schools consistently performed at high levels, and the principals were credited with creating that success.</p>
<p>The final point is that there is wide interest in paying teachers for performance in other countries. I recently finished a report on pay for performance for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). That organization recently released a report on the practices in its 34 member countries. Roughly half reward teachers in some way for the performance of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368712469488">
<title>Outstanding Teachers Stand Out</title>
<p>It seems that virtually everyone remembers one or more teachers who inspired them to love a subject or to realize their potential. They stand out in our memories and had an impact on our lives.</p>
<p>Although I have not seen it discussed in research reports, teachers no doubt are like workers in other organizations – they have a very good understanding of who among their co-workers are the most effective. If asked, they can identify their outstanding co-workers. In the typical organization 15 -20% of the workers are recognized by co-workers as high performers. They also know when a co-worker is inadequate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the HR policies and practices in our public schools are for the most part indifferent to teacher performance. Performance appraisals are a minor irritant that are completed perfunctorily; the ratings have virtually no consequences. One widely cited report on teacher evaluations is entitled, “The Widget Effect”, to highlight the official indifference.</p>
<p>The most troubling aspect of this reality is that ignoring teacher performance impacts the performance of students and that impact carries over to their success in life. We know this as a society and yet we do nothing about it. Poor teachers can have a deleterious impact on generations of students and nothing is done to prevent it. They can cost the country the potential contribution of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>We as a country need to improve the performance of our schools. There are many excellent schools of course. My children had the benefit of attending schools in one of the best districts in my state. But the high school I attended not many miles from my home was far different. And those in our inner cities are too often even worse.</p>
<p>At some point we need to recognize the importance of investing in our schools. We need to develop our schools into work places that are ‘best places to work.’ Higher salaries are part of that but we are already spending more than virtually any other country.</p>
<p>It may be useful for educators to look to our great hospitals and consider the philosophy, policies and practices that are relevant to becoming what is now known as a “magnet” hospital. Hospitals can also suffer from indifferent or perfunctory employee performance. At some point hospital leaders realized the key was creating a work environment where people were committed to providing excellent care. Now hospitals commit to meeting the standards for recognition as a magnet facility, and those that are successful highlight that in their advertising. Both hospitals and schools are similarly dependent on the performance of their people.</p>
<p>We need to develop strategies that lead to improved teacher performance. Pay for performance should be part of that strategy. Frankly I am very concerned about allowing academics and educational specialists to control this important change initiative. The ‘answers’ I have seen are, in my opinion, far too complex; they require teachers to be rated on far too many issues to be practical and accepted. There is a large body of knowledge on planning performance systems. The ‘experiments’ with pay for performance are typically local. They should be encouraged and members of the compensation community should play a role.</p>
