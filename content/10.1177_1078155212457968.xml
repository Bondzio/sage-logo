<p>Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas that can range from mild interstitial pancreatitis to severe pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis and concomitant multiorgan failure. It is typically rapid in onset but mild and self-limiting. The incidence of acute pancreatitis in the United States is approximately 44 cases per 100,000 adults per year. The clinical presentation includes elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, mild to severe epigastric pain often radiating to the back, and inflammatory changes visualized on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Biliary stones and alcohol consumption are the most common causes of pancreatitis, with each accounting for about 30-40% of cases. Trauma to the pancreas resulting from abdominal injury or post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may also cause pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, vascular abnormalities, and infection are much less common causes of pancreatitis, each contributing to less than 1% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212457968">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212457968">2</xref></sup> Drug-induced pancreatitis is also relatively uncommon, with reported incidences ranging from 0.1% to 2%. Some medications associated with pancreatitis include tetracyclines, sulfonamides, furosemide, and corticosteroids. In oncology patients, pancreatitis may occur due to medications or metastases to the pancreas. There are several reports of pancreatitis secondary to the use of chemotherapy, including paclitaxel, ifosfamide, vinorelbine, cisplatin, cytarabine, tretinoin, and <sc>l</sc>-asparginase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212457968">3</xref></sup> Published case reports have suggested that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may cause pancreatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212457968">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212457968"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212457968">6</xref></sup> Herein, we report two cases of TKI-induced pancreatitis in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that resolved with discontinuation of the therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155212457968" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient 1</title>
<p>A 69-year-old female diagnosed with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma was started on sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily 10 weeks status post nephrectomy. Approximately 10 days after initiation of sorafenib, the patient presented to the emergency center of a tertiary care cancer center with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and emesis. Laboratory studies performed in the emergency center were significant for elevated amylase (244 U/L) and lipase (1014 U/L). Both amylase and lipase were normal at baseline prior to initiation of sorafenib. Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia were eliminated as possible causes as the patient’s triglyceride (104 mg/dL) and calcium (9.1 mg/dL) levels were within normal limits. An abdominal x-ray and ultrasound revealed a diffusely enlarged pancreas and a single air-filled loop of small bowel consistent with a sentinel loop in the setting of pancreatitis.</p>
<p>The patient’s past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Of note, the patient had no history of pancreatitis or significant alcohol use, and she had no family history of pancreatitis. In addition to sorafenib, the patient’s home medications included enalapril 10 mg orally daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally daily, and glyburide-metformin 2.5/500 mg orally twice daily. The patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and was admitted. Treatment with sorafenib was discontinued, intravenous hydration was started, and the patient was not allowed oral intake. In addition, she received a single dose of hydromorphone 1 mg intravenously, after which she required no additional pain medication. Over the next 24 h, the patient’s symptoms improved, and she was able to resume oral intake. Serum amylase and lipase levels trended down over the next several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212457968">Figure 1</xref>). After a 6-week break from therapy, the patient was started on sunitinib 37.5 mg orally daily for 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off. The patient remained on sunitinib without recurrence of pancreatitis for approximately 20 months before being lost to follow-up.

</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212457968" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient 2</title>
<p>A 59-year-old female diagnosed with metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma 11 years status post nephrectomy was started on sunitinib 37.5 mg orally daily continuously without scheduled breaks. Approximately 4 weeks after initiation of sunitinib, the patient presented to the emergency center of a tertiary care cancer center with nausea, emesis, and inability to maintain oral intake. Laboratory studies performed in the emergency center were significant for elevated amylase (159 U/L) and lipase (400 U/L). Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia were ruled out as potential causes. Abdominal imaging was limited, since the patient was unable to receive contrast due to elevated serum creatinine (6.0 mg/dL). Adenopathy in the peripancreatic region was seen on abdominal ultrasound.</p>
<p>The patient’s past medical history was significant for hypertension, gastric reflux, and seasonal allergies. She had no history of pancreatitis or significant alcohol use, and there was no family history of pancreatitis. In addition to sunitinib, the patient’s home medications included metformin 500 mg orally twice daily (for treatment of malignancy), metoprolol succinate 25 mg orally daily, esomeprazole 40 mg orally daily, and monteleukast 10 mg orally daily. The patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and was admitted. Treatment with sunitinib was discontinued, intravenous hydration was started, and the patient was not allowed oral intake. The patient also received 2 doses of ondansetron 4 mg intravenously. She required no pain medication. Serum amylase and lipase levels trended down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155212457968">Figure 2</xref>), and her symptoms improved over the next several days. Eight weeks after discharge from the hospital, the patient had resection of a retroperitoneal mass, splenectomy, pancreatectomy, and lymph node dissection. Imaging 5 months post resection revealed pulmonary metastases, as well as a lesion in her distal femur. The patient’s current treatment plan is to initiate axitinib therapy, another oral TKI.

<sec id="sec4-1078155212457968" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sorafenib and sunitinib are oral TKIs approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. The etiology of TKI-induced acute pancreatitis is not well understood, but possible explanations include effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and gastrointestinal motility. VEGF may play a role in regulating the cell cycle of acinar cells; therefore, inhibition of VEGF may lead to acinar cell apoptosis and the release of autodigestive enzymes. TKIs may decrease gastrointestinal motility, leading to reflux of the duodenal contents into the pancreatic duct and activation of pancreatic acinar cell digestive enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212457968">7</xref></sup> In a phase I trial of sorafenib, 3 out of 69 patients developed grade 3 pancreatitis at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 months after initiation of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212457968">8</xref></sup> A phase I trial of sunitinib reported asymptomatic elevations in amylase and lipase in about 5% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212457968">9</xref></sup> Five case reports of TKI-induced pancreatitis were identified with a literature search of PubMed (1948-January 2012), Ovid (1948-January 2012), and Scopus (1960-January 2012) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212457968">Table 1</xref>). In these case reports, symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the TKI and none of the patients in these reports were re-challenged with a TKI.

<p>The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in our reported patients was supported by laboratory findings (elevated amylase and lipase), abdominal imaging, and clinical symptoms (epigastric pain, nausea, emesis). It is likely that the pancreatitis was secondary to TKI use, since no evidence was found to support other etiologies. Although alcohol consumption and biliary stones are responsible for more than 80% of pancreatitis cases, neither patient had a history of alcohol use, and both had normal ALTs (a predictor of biliary pancreatitis). Less common causes like hypertriglyceridemia and hypercalcemia were also ruled out. In addition, the pancreatitis resolved after discontinuation of the therapy. Based on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, a causal relationship between TKI use and pancreatitis was probable in both patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212457968">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, TKIs may cause acute pancreatitis in a small number of patients. The pancreatitis associated with TKIs seems to be mild and reversible upon discontinuation. TKI therapy should be interrupted or discontinued in patients who present with elevated pancreatic enzymes with no other etiologies.</p>
