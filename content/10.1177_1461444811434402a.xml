<p>In <italic>Games of Empire: Global Capitalism and Video Games</italic>, Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter look at the history and structure of the games industry through a theoretical lens shaped by ‘autonomist Marxism and poststructuralist radicalism (and from critics of both)’ (p. xxx). As the title suggests, the topic is a very broad one. Just like the ‘Empire’ they – following the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811434402">Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2000)</xref> – describe as a new type of imperialism with no outside (p. xix), the authors try to include as many facets of capitalism and power structures in the games industry as possible. The introduction provides the basic theoretical background and (re-)defines important terms such as Empire, immaterial labor, and multitudes. The authors mainly use the theoretical work of Hardt and Negri, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Félix Guattari to analyze digital games as ‘exemplary media of Empire’ (p. xxix). Empire is discussed as both structuring the games industry and as a trope of game contents.</p>
<p><italic>Games of Empire</italic> combines macro, meso and micro perspectives by applying the refined theory of Empire to the video games industry in general (chapter 1), individual companies and hardware products (chapters 2 and 3), specific games (chapters 4–6) and player practices (chapters 7 and 8). The first chapter, ‘A Workers’ History of Videogaming’ (p. 3), focuses on the roots of digital games in the ‘military-academic-industrial complex’ (p. 7) and the importance of immaterial labor. Although the authors note that the creation of the first digital games was a form of ‘transgression’ (p. 8), thus echoing Friedrich Kittler’s bon mot that all media are essentially abuses of military technology, the history of computer and video games is characterized as a set of conflicts (between companies, employers and employees, digital rights management and piracy) that eventually leads to a stratification and unification of the medium and its market. The conflict lines within and around large game companies are illustrated by the example of <italic>Electronic Arts</italic> (EA) in chapter 2. Tracing EA’s history, as it transformed from a collective of video game artists in the 1980s to become the biggest computer and video game company in the early 21st century, Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter document how the idea of work, authorship and the commodification of creative work have changed over the last decades. EA is one of the ‘huge transnational corporations’ that according to the authors ‘construct the fundamental fabric’ (p. 39) of Empire. The ‘cognitive capitalism’ (p. 35) that companies like EA established brings along a ‘cognitariat’ (p. 53), composed mostly of young male workers who face the constant threat of outsourcing, often suffer from miserable workplace conditions and are lured into the industry by a ‘work as play’ (p. 55) ideal that dates back to the hacking origins of digital games but has been subverted and misused by the large gaming companies.</p>
<p>The following chapter uses the market introduction of the Xbox and the entry of Microsoft into the console market as a case study for the inter-corporate rivalries (in this case between Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo). Chapters 4 to 6 employ a micro-perspective by looking at specific games and their relation to the concept of Empire. Chapter 4 discusses <italic>Full Spectrum Warrior</italic> and similar military-themed shooters as a new type of militarization and a banalization of war. Chapter 5 is the most interesting chapter among these three and also the one that is also most directly related to the core subject of the book. Focusing on the enormously successful MMORPG <italic>World of Warcraft</italic>, the authors deal with the control of (virtual) populations in massively multiplayer online games and development of parallel economies like power leveling services and gold farming. The third case study in chapter 6 examines representations of the ‘Imperial City’ (p. 153) in the <italic>Grand Theft Auto</italic> series. After analyzing the games industry (chapter 1 and 2) and its products (chapters 3–6), chapter 7 shifts the perspective towards the players as consumers. Deviant playing styles, independent developments (such as modding or indie games), and games with political content that aim at real social change and alternative modes of licensing (copyleft and creative commons) are conceptualized as strategies of ‘countergaming’ (p. 191) that can provide means for the ‘process of overcoming Empire’ (p. 218) in the realm of digital games. Before summarizing the arguments of the previous chapters and providing an outlook on open questions, the last chapter (8) briefly touches on a number of topics that are associated with capitalism and video games, but are not at the core of the book’s main line of argument. These brief sections on Coltan mines, e-waste and the stock market as a game (pp. 222–227) illustrate one of the major weaknesses of the book. In their attempt to include as many aspects of their topic as possible, the authors sometimes lose their focus. Repeated references to the violence debate (pp. xxv and 156) or too-detailed descriptions of game narratives (e.g. in chapter 6) cause some abrupt breaks in the otherwise consistent line of argument.</p>
<p>While the overall structure of the book is well thought out, some of the chapters could have been replaced by more fitting examples. Instead of the militarization chapter (for a more detailed discussion of the military-entertainment complex see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811434402">Huntemann and Payne, 2010</xref>), an extra section on intellectual property rights, for example using the cases of user-generated content in <italic>Little Big Planet</italic> or <italic>Spore</italic> or the thrilling story behind the game <italic>Tetris</italic> would have been interesting. Other subjects that are at the core of the capitalist structures of games and the games industry include in-game advertising and cross-media adaptations (film to game and vice versa), the practice of societal roles and consumption in <italic>The Sims</italic> or the recently hyped concept of gamification. That most of these are mentioned by the authors, especially towards the end of the book, indicates that they are aware of these additional facets, but that they could simply not fit them into the limited space of one book.</p>
<p>Despite some shortcomings, <italic>Games of Empire</italic> is a highly relevant and generally well-written introduction into the role of digital games in the system of global capitalism. Although some chapters (especially chapters 4 and 6) could have been left out or replaced by more appropriate case studies, the book is an important contribution to the field of game studies. The somewhat frayed end of the book shows that there is much more to explore around the subject of global capitalism and digital games. While <italic>Games of Empire</italic> is an ambitious and interesting start, a follow-up is not only an option, but almost mandatory considering the multiple lines of recent developments in the games industry from free-to-play and micropayment business models to the success of indie games such as <italic>Minecraft</italic> or the ongoing replacement of the boxed products market by digital (online) distribution.</p>
