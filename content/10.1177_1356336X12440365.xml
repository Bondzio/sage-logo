<abstract>
<p>Adventure-physical education has been proposed to promote adolescents’ physical development, but little is known about physical activity levels during such lessons. Using the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time, we observed students’ (ages 11–14 years) physical activity levels in co-educational classes during 43 adventure-physical education lessons at seven public schools. The mean percentage (±SD) of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 28.3% (±16.3%). The greatest percentage of lesson time was spent in two activities—high elements (24.1% ± 36.5%) and initiatives (22.3% ± 32.4%). When data were aggregated across all lessons, 40.0% of the time in high elements and 13.7% of the time in initiatives was spent in MVPA. Of all MVPA time, 31.5% occurred in high elements and another 12.6% in initiatives. Compared with traditional physical education lessons, less time is spent in MVPA during adventure lessons. Efforts to increase MVPA should target high elements and initiative activities.</p>

<p>Regular physical activity improves adolescents’ cardiorespiratory fitness, strengthens their bones and muscles, and reduces their body fat (US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440365">2008</xref>). Beyond these physical benefits, physical activity is associated with improvements in adolescents’ social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356336X12440365">Field et al., 2001</xref>), self-concept and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356336X12440365">Calfas and Taylor, 1994</xref>), and reductions in their symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356336X12440365">Rothon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440365">Sallis et al., 2000</xref>). Adolescents’ physical activity is also positively related to their academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440365">Singh et al., 2012</xref>) and has been shown to enhance executive functions such as cognitive flexibility and creativity, which are important for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356336X12440365">Diamond and Lee, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Physical activity levels decline dramatically in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356336X12440365">Sallis, 2000</xref>). Only 18% of US adolescents are physically active on a daily basis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440365">2010</xref>). It is recommended that adolescents be moderately to vigorously active for at least 60 minutes a day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440365">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356336X12440365">Strong et al., 2005</xref>) and school-based physical education has been suggested as a key setting for achieving this goal because of its potential to reach large numbers of youth (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356336X12440365">2001</xref>). Physical education in schools provides the primary setting where adolescents develop the movement skills and knowledge to be physically active throughout their lives and young people who participate regularly in physical education have a reduced risk of becoming overweight in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356336X12440365">Menschik et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One measure of the quality of physical education is the percentage of lesson time students spend in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440365">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440365">Simons-Morton et al., 1994</xref>). Despite the potential of physical education to promote adolescents’ MVPA, research has shown that students get relatively little physical activity there. The majority of these studies have measured physical activity by directly observing students during physical education lessons. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440365">Simons-Morton et al. (1994</xref>) observed 56 middle school physical education lessons and found the percentage of lesson time students spent in MVPA was 16.1%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al. (2000</xref>) observed 430 middle school lessons and found the percentage was 48.5%. In a study of middle school girls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al. (2006</xref>) observed 431 lessons and found the percentage of time spent in MVPA was 37.9%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440365">Senne et al. (2009</xref>) conducted a case study that examined students’ (grades 6–8) physical activity levels at one school in North Carolina. The percentage of lesson time students spent in MVPA was 32.5. Similar results have been reported in studies of physical education lessons in schools outside of the USA. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440365">Chow et al. (2009</xref>) observed 238 lessons and found the percentage of time spent in MVPA was 34.8% for secondary school students in Hong Kong, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356336X12440365">Mersh and Fairclough (2010</xref>) observed 30 lessons and found the percentage of time spent in MVPA was 59.7% for boys and 46.1% for girls attending secondary schools in England.</p>
<p>Based on the low levels of physical activity observed in physical education lessons, there have been recent calls to improve the quality of physical education in US secondary schools by focusing on having students engage in MVPA for at least 50% of a lesson’s duration (US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440365">2010</xref>). Similar efforts to improve physical education have been suggested in other countries such as Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356336X12440365">Australian Government Preventive Health Taskforce, 2010</xref>). One approach physical education teachers might use to promote students’ MVPA is to utilize those types of curricular activities that require students to engage in demanding physical movements. For example, physical education activities such as running for fitness and circuit training have involved the highest levels of MVPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440365">Chow et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, adventure-physical education has been proposed to develop students’ motor skills and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440365">Prouty, 1990</xref>), and may afford high levels of MVPA. Adventure-physical education involves activities designed to produce a perceived risk to physical safety to promote students’ physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and moral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356336X12440365">Dort et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356336X12440365">Table 1</xref> contains operational definitions of the most common types of activities in adventure-physical education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356336X12440365">Prouty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356336X12440365">Rohnke, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356336X12440365">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356336X12440365">Wurdinger and Steffen, 2003</xref>). These activities are of two broad kinds: 1) ones that require specialized climbing equipment (e.g. belay ropes, harnesses, and carabiners) and 2) ones that do not require such equipment. Adventure physical-education programmes that have invested in specialized climbing equipment often refer to the activities as a “challenge course” or “ropes course,” and these courses can be set up inside schools’ gymnasiums or outdoors on school grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356336X12440365">Wurdinger and Steffen, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>One type of adventure activity that does not require climbing equipment is trust activities, during which students learn to take responsibility for the safety of themselves and classmates. An example of a trust activity is where students work in pairs with one as the faller and the other as the spotter (catcher). The faller leans/falls forward towards the spotter, trusting that the spotter will support (catch) him or her so the faller does not hit the ground. Partners start close together and the activity is repeated with increasing distances between the faller and spotter. Another type of activity that does not require specialized climbing equipment is low elements, an example of which is the tire traverse. In the tire traverse, a group of students work together to move across the top of a series of six to eight tires which are distanced about three feet apart and suspended two to four feet off the ground by ropes hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>A type of adventure activity that requires specialized climbing equipment is high elements. An example of a high element is where students climb a vertical climbing wall while encased in a harness and attached to a belay rope. The belay rope acts as a safety line and another person, called the belayer, secures the opposite end of this rope in the event the climber falls. Prusik climbing is another example of a high element activity. For prusik climbing, students work independently to climb a rope that is attached to the ceiling of a gymnasium and hangs down vertically. Students wear a harness for this activity and utilize two prusik slings. Each sling is made out of accessory cord and its ends are joined to form a continuous circle of cord that is about 30 inches long. One sling (top prusik) is attached to the climbing rope at about waist height and then clipped to the student’s harness with a carabiner. This sling acts as the student’s safety line (self-belay), thus a separate belayer is not required. The other sling (bottom prusik) is attached to the climbing rope at about knee height and is used as a foothold during the climb. To ascend, the student stands in the bottom prusik releasing his or her weight off the top prusik, which is then moved up the rope and secured at about chest height. The student then sits down putting all body weight on the top prusik, then moves the bottom prusik up. The student descends by reversing the pattern.</p>
<p>While the physical activity levels of students have been examined in a variety of physical education contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356336X12440365">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">2006</xref>), to our knowledge no studies have investigated physical activity levels in adventure-physical education. At the same time, there is the potential for adventure activities to promote students’ physical activity. The physical movements that students perform during high elements, low elements, and trust activities may engage students in MVPA. For example, scaling a vertical climbing wall, prusik climbing, and crossing the tire traverse, involve pulling with the arms, pushing with the legs, and supporting one’s own weight. In addition, many trust activities require students to catch, lift, and pass their classmates.</p>
<p>Three studies have investigated physical fitness outcomes in adventure-physical education, but none of them described students’ physical activity levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356336X12440365">Fersch and Smith (1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356336X12440365">1978b</xref>) conducted evaluation studies of Project Adventure, the first programme to infuse adventure activities into school-based physical education. They did not use a concurrent comparison group, but found that students’ scores increased on several measures: 1) sit-ups, 2) 300-yard run, 3) 50-yard run, 4) pull-ups (males), and 4) flexed arm hang (females). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356336X12440365">Quimby (1982</xref>), however, found no significant differences in students’ fitness measures (mile run, skinfold measurements, sit-ups, and sit-and-reach) between a Project Adventure class and a traditional physical education class. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356336X12440365">Gehris et al. (2011</xref>) investigated the effects of a unit of adventure-physical education on high school students’ physical fitness. Four items from the FITNESSGRAM test battery were administered: 1) right-angle push-up, 2) curl-up, 3) modified sit-and-reach, and 4) the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER). No significant differences in fitness scores were found among students in an adventure class compared with students in a weight training class and a health class.</p>
<p>Determining how much physical activity occurs in adventure-physical education lessons is complex because the lessons involve a range of different activities (e.g. games, initiatives, trust activities, low elements, high elements, and skills). It is not known how much time is devoted to these different activities, how much of the time spent in each activity involves MVPA, and in which activities the largest proportions of MVPA time occur. This information can help inform efforts to promote students’ MVPA during adventure-physical education lessons.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to describe students’ physical activity levels during adventure-physical education lessons. We had three primary research questions: 1) what is the percentage of time students spend in MVPA during adventure-physical education lessons?, 2) what is the percentage of time spent in each type of adventure activity that involves MVPA?, and 3) what is the distribution of all MVPA time across the types of adventure activities?</p>

<title>Overview and setting</title>
<p>This descriptive study was conducted with a convenience sample of seven public schools from five different school districts located in and around Philadelphia, PA, USA. Five of the schools were in suburban settings and included grades 6–8. Two of the schools were in urban settings, one of which included grades K-6 and the other included grades K-8. Only lessons involving students in grades 6–8 (ages 11–14 years) were involved in this study. All the schools had lessons of adventure-physical education which were taught to co-educational classes. A total of 136 students (66 males, 70 females) of whom 95 were White (70%) and 41 were non-White (30%) participated in the study. We directly observed the physical activity levels of students during their adventure-physical education lessons. Students and their parents or guardians provided written informed consent. An institutional review board approved the research protocol.</p>
<p>Lessons were observed at three schools during the spring of 2009, three schools during the fall of 2009, and one school during the spring of 2010. Across the seven schools, we observed approximately one to two classes per school and four lessons per class for a total of 43 lessons in 11 classes. Teachers conducted their lessons according to their customary practice. Across the seven schools, the adventure-physical education lessons included activities from each of the major categories of adventure-physical education: games, initiatives, trust activities, low elements, high elements, and skills. Six of the schools had ropes course apparatuses, such as vertical climbing walls, cargo nets, and prusik climbing ropes, and at five of these schools the apparatuses were located indoors.</p>

<sec id="section3-1356336X12440365">
<title>Physical activity levels during lessons</title>
<p>The data collected for this study were physical activity levels during adventure-physical education lessons. We used a direct observation technique called the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 1991</xref>) to collect this data. SOFIT involves an observer watching a physical education lesson and making hand-written, periodic recordings of students’ activity levels, the lesson context that is taking place, and the actions of the teacher. The SOFIT has been validated as a lesson-level measure of physical activity using heart rate monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440365">Rowe et al., 1997</xref>) and accelerometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440365">Scruggs et al., 2003</xref>) and has been used extensively in studies involving grades 6–8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356336X12440365">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">2006</xref>). In accordance with the SOFIT protocol, we observed four students per lesson. We chose two males and two females in each lesson so that our lesson-level measures reflected an even number of assessments from males and females. Once a student had been selected for observation, the student was not eligible for selection again until all other students in the class had been observed once. Each observation epoch lasted 20 seconds with the first 10 seconds spent observing the student’s physical activity level and the next 10 seconds recording the level. The same student was observed for four consecutive minutes (12 observation epochs) then the next student was observed. This process was continued for the entire length of a lesson.</p>
<p>In each observation epoch, three types of observations were made: 1) the student’s physical activity level was recorded and categorized as either lying down, sitting, standing, walking, or vigorous; 2) the lesson context was recorded as either management, knowledge, fitness activity, skill drills, or game play; and 3) the type of teacher promotion was recorded as either promotes in-class activity, promotes out-of-class activity, or no promotion. All observations were made by the lead investigator.</p>
<p>The lead investigator was trained in the use of the SOFIT by watching an instructional video provided by the developers of the SOFIT. The investigator then used the SOFIT to independently code videotaped segments of three physical education lessons involving elementary and middle school students, which were created and coded by the developers of the SOFIT. For the videotaped segments, the investigator’s coding achieved greater than 85% agreement with the coding of the SOFIT developers in all three SOFIT areas: physical activity, lesson context, and teacher promotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356336X12440365">
<title>Type of adventure activity</title>
<p>We developed a fourth area of assessment—type of adventure activity—which was also recorded during each observation epoch in the administration of the SOFIT. To establish a protocol for this additional assessment area, we first identified, through a literature review, the main types of activities (games, initiatives, trust activities, low elements, high elements, and skills) occurring in adventure-physical education, and we developed operational definitions for each (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356336X12440365">Table 1</xref>). A list of the six activities and operational definitions was then sent to five university and public school instructors of adventure-physical education for review. Based on this feedback, a seventh type of activity, debriefing, was added to code for activities during which the teacher asks questions to have students reflect on what they learned from doing a particular adventure task. Finally, the lead investigator prepared a videotape consisting of three, approximately 15-minute, segments from different adventure lessons and coded each of the segments. This videotape was sent to one of the developers of the SOFIT, Thomas McKenzie, PhD, who coded each segment. The agreement between the investigator’s scores and Dr McKenzie’s scores for all three segments was at or above 85% across all four areas—physical activity, lesson context, teacher promotion, and type of adventure activity. Based on suggestions from Dr McKenzie (personal communication, 1 July 2009), an eighth type of activity, not-adventure, was added to code for instructional and management tasks that were not adventure activities, such as running laps as part of a warm-up and reviewing for tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356336X12440365">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The SOFIT is primarily designed to characterize physical activity lessons, and all the results we report from the SOFIT data reflect aggregation of those data at the level of the lesson (<italic>N</italic> = 43). Using PAWS Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), we calculated descriptive statistics for the percentage of lesson time spent in 1) each of the five SOFIT activity levels, 2) MVPA (sum of the proportion of time spent in “walking” and “vigorous” activity levels), 3) each of the five SOFIT lesson contexts, 4) each of the three SOFIT types of teacher promotion, and 5) each of the eight types of adventure activity.</p>
<p>We also examined the relationship between activity level and the type of adventure activity. For these analyses, we aggregated all the SOFIT data across all 43 lessons. We considered only two categories of activity—MVPA (walking or vigorous) and inactive (lying down, sitting, or standing). As such, the proportion of time spent in MVPA and inactive added up to 100%. For each type of adventure activity (e.g. for all of the time spent in high elements across all 43 lessons), we calculated the percentage of time spent in MVPA versus inactive. For the time spent in MVPA, we calculated the percentage of lesson time spent in each of the eight types of adventure activities, and we did the same for the time spent inactive.</p>

<p>The mean (±SD) percentage of time spent in MVPA in each lesson was 28.3% (±16.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356336X12440365">Table 2</xref>). This amount is equivalent to approximately 13 minutes and 25 minutes of a scheduled 45-minute and 90-minute physical education class, respectively. The greatest proportion of lesson time was spent standing (45.0% ± 17.0%), followed by sitting (25.9% ± 18.3%). For lesson context, teachers dedicated the largest proportion of lesson time to fitness activities (36.0% ± 33.1%). Teachers spent 1.3% (±4.9%) of lesson time promoting in-class physical activity and 0.8% (±4.6%) of lesson time promoting out-of-class physical activity. The largest proportion of lesson time was spent in high elements (24.1% ± 36.5%) followed by initiatives (22.3% ± 32.4%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this was the first study of students’ physical activity levels during adventure-physical education lessons. Consequently, we discuss our results in relation to studies of physical activity levels in traditional physical education lessons. We found that the proportion of time spent in MVPA (28%) was lower than reported for traditional physical education lessons (32% to 48%) observed with the SOFIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356336X12440365">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440365">Senne et al., 2009</xref>), and less than the 50% that has been recommended (US Department of Health and Human Services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440365">2010</xref>). The adventure activities in which the most time was spent were high elements and initiatives. High elements was also the adventure activity during which the largest proportion of time was spent in MVPA (40%). This value was similar to the time spent in MVPA reported for traditional physical education activities such as basketball (37%), badminton (40%), and fitness training involving running (39%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440365">Chow et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, across all the MVPA time in the lessons we observed, the greatest proportion occurred during high elements. Teachers spent less than 2% of lesson time promoting physical activity, which is similar to findings from traditional physical education lessons (2%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The educational significance of our findings lies in the types of adventure activities that teachers might use to engage students in MVPA. Our findings suggest that teachers might consider focusing on high elements if they wish to increase the proportion of lesson time that students spend in MVPA. Although these activities had the lowest ratio of inactive to MVPA time, there is room to further decrease this ratio and increase students’ MVPA. We observed several occasions where students were inactive because they were waiting in line to climb, and their physical education teacher was doing the belaying. If students are taught to belay, they may have more MVPA. With students belaying each other, teachers could offer multiple stations of high elements. Having multiple stations available would afford students more opportunities during a lesson to climb and belay, both of which require physically demanding movements that may increase their MVPA.</p>
<p>For teachers who, out of safety concerns, want to perform the belaying of high elements, a station approach that involves prusik climbing may be one way to increase students’ MVPA. At one school, teachers belayed at a vertical wall while students performed prusik climbs at stations of climbing ropes. Each student used two prusik slings attached to the climbing rope; one sling was connected to their harness by a carabiner and the second served as a foothold. The sling secured to the harness acted as a self-belay, so students were able to climb without the assistance of a second belayer. Based on observations at this same school, another practice teachers might consider to promote MVPA is the use of Instant Activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440365">Graham, 1992</xref>). For example, students at this school entered the gymnasium at the start of class and immediately went to a cart for their equipment (harnesses, prusik slings, and carabiners). The students then assembled their harnesses and began either swinging activities on the gymnasium ropes or prusik climbing. Further research is needed to determine the types of high elements that best promote students’ MVPA and the instructional approaches that should be utilized to this end.</p>
<p>Another implication of our study is that strategies should be developed for utilizing initiative activities to promote students’ MVPA, particularly because teachers dedicated a large proportion of time to these types of activities. One strategy might be for teachers to reduce the amount of time they spend managing students and equipment during initiatives. However, teachers spent less time (12%) in management during our observed lessons compared with traditional physical education lessons (26% to 46%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440365">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440365">2006</xref>). Another approach might be to have students work in smaller groups (e.g. pairs or groups of four) than traditionally recommended for initiatives (e.g., 10 to 15 people) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440365">Rohnke and Butler, 1995</xref>) so they spend less time standing and waiting for group members to move. For example, students might work in pairs on initiatives like All Aboard and TP Shuffle, both of which require students to balance together on top of an object. For All Aboard, partners could work together to stand atop one medicine ball and for TP Shuffle partners could move on top of two or more medicine balls. Such modifications to these initiatives would allow teachers who do not have the funds to offer high elements alternative ways to potentially increase students’ MVPA.</p>
<p>A key practical suggestion from our study is that teachers should offer more encouraging feedback to students about their physical activity during adventure-physical education lessons. Students may achieve higher levels of MVPA if teachers spend more time providing such feedback. For example, teachers might provide encouragement about the physical movements students perform during adventure activities (e.g. “That’s the way to use your legs, you can do it” or “Pull hard with your arms”). Interventions in physical education that have improved students’ physical activity have included this type of explicit feedback and instruction from teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440365">Dudley et al., 2011</xref>). Teachers may have spent such a small proportion of time encouraging physical activity during these lessons because they were encouraging students to understand and achieve non-physical goals. We can only speculate about this possibility because the SOFIT domain of activity promotion is only for assessing the promotion of movement. The non-physical benefits of adventure-physical education, such as the development of social skills, have been noted by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356336X12440365">Stiehl and Parker, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440365">Dyson (1995</xref>) observed the encouragement and advice students gave to each other during adventure activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440365">Hastie (1995</xref>) found that adolescent males commented about the fun they had helping their friends during adventure activities, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440365">Humberstone (1990</xref>) noted that males and females offered each other encouragement and support during an adventure programme.</p>
<p>Having teachers focus on the non-physical benefits (e.g. social development) of adventure-physical education, and not just the physical benefits, may be another approach to increase students’ MVPA. For example, students may be more motivated to participate in adventure activities that promote their MVPA if they feel a sense of closeness with their fellow classmates and if those classmates provide support and encouragement during the activities. Studies have shown that students’ motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440365">Ntoumanis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440365">Standage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440365">Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440365">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356336X12440365">Barr-Anderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440365">Sallis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440365">Wallhead and Buckworth, 2004</xref>) in physical education are associated with their physical activity. Therefore, if teachers focused on encouraging social development within adventure-physical education, this might increase students’ MVPA by enhancing their motivation and enjoyment. Further research is needed to clarify mechanisms in adventure-physical education lessons linking students’ physical activity levels, social development, motivation, and enjoyment. Understanding these relationships might inform the ways in which teachers should engage students during lessons, especially with regard to emphasis on social versus physical benefits.</p>
<p>Although this is the first study we know of that describes physical activity levels during adventure-physical education lessons, the study had several limitations. We had no internal control group or condition with which to compare our physical activity levels. Our physical activity observations involved a convenience sample of a small number of middle schools, classes, lessons, and students. Our sample was not large enough to assess physical activity at the student level to compare, for example, the physical activity levels of males and females. While teachers were asked to conduct their adventure-physical education lessons according to customary practice, they may have altered activities and their behavior when being observed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first description of physical activity levels in adventure-physical education lessons. Students’ levels of physical activity during adventure-physical education lessons are lower than those reported for traditional physical education lessons, and less than recommended. To increase students’ physical activity levels, teachers might try to focus on high elements because this is the type of adventure activity in which the majority of MVPA occurs and there appears to be room for further increases in MVPA during the time spent in high elements. Alternatively, teachers might attempt to increase students’ MVPA by modifying initiative activities because a large portion of time is spent in these activities and the majority of that time is inactive. Providing encouraging feedback may be another strategy for teachers to promote students’ MVPA during adventure-physical education lessons.</p>
