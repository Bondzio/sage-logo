<abstract>
<p>The regulation of assisted living in the United States calls out for the attention of policy researchers, particularly in light of projected demographic changes reflecting dramatic increases in the nation’s senior population, the industry’s continued strong presence, and persistent concerns over related quality and consumer protection issues. Despite these factors, few comprehensive studies have been done on the development of regulatory policy for this relatively young industry that is a vibrant part of the health care services area in the United States. To address this issue, this article provides a systematic accounting and investigation of the regulatory environment and related policy development surrounding assisted living across the United States during a decade of formidable growth in the industry. Drawing on theories of institutional dynamics and policy formation, the findings reveal that, in terms of adopting regulatory schemes addressing key issues of quality and consumer protection, states do not always follow patterns that would be predicted under current models. Unanticipated patterns illustrating resistance to or movement away from isomorphism appear linked with a number of organizational pressure mechanisms that have evolved to limit the actual extent of this homogeneity. The findings lead to assertions that some mechanisms typically posited as contributing to isomorphism may actually work against this process under certain conditions, a result not currently evident in the literature.</p>

<p>Proposing a new model of residential care for the frail elderly in the United States, entrepreneurs in the late 20th century introduced a business innovation known as assisted living. Assisted living was marketed as the perfect residential care solution for older Americans whose physical and/or cognitive challenges rendered them unable to live alone but were not severe enough to require nursing home placement. By the mid-1990s, with the United States Census Bureau projecting that the demographic cohort of people aged 65 and older would grow to 20% of the population by 2030, investors on Wall Street became so motivated for related developments that their actions rendered assisted living the most rapidly growing form of residential long-term eldercare and supportive services in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711413076">Hawes, Rose, &amp; Phillips, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Amid the exponential growth of the assisted living industry in the eldercare market during the 1990s, media attention began to mount concerning industry problems ranging from neglect and abuse to fraud and misleading marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711413076">Fallis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711413076">Goldstein-Eagan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711413076">McCoy &amp; Appleby, 2004</xref>). Although assisted living is regulated at the state level, news reports and constituent complaints became so notable that a number of federal policy makers initiated several formal investigations state regulation and industry practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711413076">U.S. General Accountability Office [GAO], 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413076">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413076">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Only with the dawn of the 21st century has the research community begun to catch up with the industry itself, but even so, little systematic or comprehensive work concerning the development of assisted living regulatory policy exists, with the primary initiative to date occurring via the federal government’s “A National Study of Assisted Living for the Frail Elderly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711413076">Hawes, Phillips, &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>). In fact, many stakeholders have expressed that state regulatory approaches are extremely confusing even to those with expertise in the assisted living field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413076">Stoil, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although assisted living is an important component of health care service provision in the United States and regulatory authority rests with each state to sculpt its own administrative scheme, very little research on its regulation exists. As a contribution to filling the knowledge void, this research examines the development of various models of assisted living regulation across the United States during a decade of formidable growth. In providing a systematic accounting and investigation of the regulatory environment and related policy development surrounding the industry, several general questions underlie the examination:</p>
<list id="list1-0095399711413076" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How has the assisted living regulatory terrain evolved since states first began regulating the industry?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Under what conditions have the states adopted assisted living regulations?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What issues do states emphasize in regulating the industry?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With such questions being particularly salient in light of the industry’s youth, continuing concerns over quality and consumer protection, and the increasing proportion of older Americans, attention to the institutional dynamics surrounding the development of assisted living regulation in the states provides a preliminary step to understanding the context in which this new industry is evolving in the policy arena. Accordingly, sociological institutionalist theories are particularly instructive for developing an analytical framework for understanding the regulatory and policy environment surrounding the assisted living industry as it grew during a decade of formidable growth.</p>
<sec id="section1-0095399711413076">
<title>Theoretical Approach</title>
<p>Research traditions surrounding the dynamics of policy change evidence interest in myriad facets such as policy learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413076">May, 1992</xref>), prospective policy transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711413076">Mossberger &amp; Wolman, 2003</xref>), the role of advocacy coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413076">Sabatier, 1988</xref>), innovation diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711413076">Savage, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413076">Walker, 1969</xref>), policy reinvention during and after initial diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413076">Glick &amp; Hays, 1991</xref>), and policy change with termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711413076">Hogwood &amp; Peters, 1983</xref>). The institutionalist approach has been used to explain the policy and administrative environments surrounding organizational change, ranging from federal administrative agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711413076">Maynard-Moody &amp; Herbert, 1989</xref>) to museums to school districts to prison systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413076">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711413076">Lodge &amp; Wegrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413076">Rowan, 1982</xref>). Hence, to examine the development of the assisted living regulatory terrain, including the conditions inherent to that development and related regulatory issues, an institutionalist perspective can provide analytical insight into the development of regulatory policy concerning a new industry such as assisted living.</p>
<p>The institutionalist approach rests on the assertion that organizations direct their behaviors and structures toward legitimacy within their respective fields. Grounded in Weberian notions of bureaucratization and rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711413076">Scott, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711413076">1995</xref>), related arguments posit that, in conjunction with the pursuit of legitimacy, organizational change reflects processes that make organizations more similar—isomorphic—over time. Hence, with similarity comes legitimacy for the organization within its environment. Accordingly, within an organization’s life cycle, earlier stages of existence might evidence diversity in approach and form, but later stages, once the organization is well-established, evidence a tendency toward homogenization with others organizations within the environment (compare with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413076">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Under the institutionalist approach, the process of homogenization is largely initiated through the influence of pressure mechanisms. Such mechanisms can include coercive state action, the influence of related professional norms within an organization’s environment, as well as pressure to conform to or mimic perceived successful organizational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711413076">DiMaggio, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413076">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>). Ambiguity and uncertainty in an organization’s environment may trigger movement toward isomorphism. This is particularly true when combined with the latter pressure mechanism. Thus, in the pursuit of legitimacy, uncertainty encourages imitation, that is, the adoption of proven models as a rational response to uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413076">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711413076">March &amp; Olsen, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>These kinds of issues point to the institutionalist approach as a fruitful avenue for investigating assisted living regulation. With a solid entry into the 21st century as an industry, assisted living in all likelihood will continue to grow, and understanding the dynamics of the regulatory terrain surrounding it is crucial for policy makers and other stakeholders in the American eldercare system.</p>

<title>Method and Data</title>
<p>Exploring the development of assisted living regulation is a complex endeavor that turns on a conceptual understanding of assisted living as organizationally distinct from nursing homes and board-and-care facilities. This conceptual distinction is a particularly significant point because official definitions remain in flux. In keeping with the working definition of assisted living mentioned previously, assisted living is understood to be a residential facility providing 24-hr oversight and other supportive services, excluding skilled medical care, and operating with a philosophy reflecting respect for resident dignity, independence, privacy, and safety. As dictated by the previously mentioned research questions, the principal analytical areas in this research include (a) the evolutionary dynamics of the assisted living regulatory terrain since the first states began regulating the industry, (b) the conditions existing as state regulatory schemes have developed, and (c) the issues that states have emphasized in regulating the industry.</p>
<p>To examine the institutional dynamics surrounding the development of assisted living regulation across the United States, the following reflects a longitudinal perspective, utilizing data on regulatory adoption for years beginning in 1994 and ending with 2004. This time frame was chosen because 1994 heralded the beginning of concerted state attempts to address assisted living as an industry separate from nursing homes and board-and-care, and the beginning of exponential growth in the industry. In addition, it marked increased scrutiny of facilities for quality and consumer protection problems. The year 2004 reflects a generally accepted end point for the formative years of assisted living development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711413076">Kane, Chan, &amp; Kane, 2007</xref>). In practical terms, data for the even years in this period were assessed, as examining issue areas for every other year allowed consideration of regulatory lag time—the time between initial passage and implementation.</p>
<p>To understand the institutional environment in which assisted living regulation evolved, first, a general picture or map of the regulatory terrain is developed as a basis on which to build a more detailed analysis. The regulatory terrain is analyzed in terms of 10 key issue areas that are categorized to capture integral concerns of quality care and consumer protection as outlined by industry representatives, consumer groups, and government officials. Delineated in a comprehensive report issued by the Assisted Living Workgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW; 2003</xref>), a collection of nearly 50 assisted living stakeholder groups such as the Alzheimer’s Association (AA), the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA), the Consumer Consortium of Assisted Living (CCAL), and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA), these 10 areas represent the analytical dimensions by which development of related regulatory schemes across all 50 states is tracked, especially in light of the ambiguity attached to official definitions of assisted living. These analytical dimensions have been identified as the basic issues addressed in regulatory schemes—although any given state might include additional features within their regulatory approaches. A preliminary analytical consideration was whether a state required the licensing of facilities, such that if it did not license assisted living, it was scored as 0 for all analytical categories; if the state only certified assisted living facilities rather than licensed them, all variables were still coded as 0, as the majority of assisted living stakeholders have recognized and agreed on the importance of licensing. Then, in mapping the assisted living terrain from 1994 through 2004, each state’s assisted living regulatory scheme was examined in terms of the 10 issue areas:</p>

</list>
<p>Although consumer groups and providers often vary in the extent to which they believe states should regulate assisted living facilities, there is broad agreement that, at the very least, some minimal standards are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW, 2003</xref>). Thus, this research used that standard as a basis for analytical delineation. The “minimum standards” reflect those articulated in conjunction with those provided via the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW (2003)</xref>, a federal government initiated collection of representatives from government, public and private sector assisted living groups and facilities, medical professionals, and consumer advocates. Analysis was based on a simple dummy variable scoring system that was used to indicate regulatory content and presence according to the various dimensions. At each time point, when a regulatory scheme included an issue area as described above, it was coded as a 1. If the regulatory issue was absent, the variable was coded as a 0. Together, these scores were then utilized to depict larger patterns in assisted living regulation over time.</p>
<p>Data for the issue areas were determined by content analysis and by referencing and indexing the state laws and regulations themselves. In addition, surveys regarding select components of regulation conducted by the National Academy of State Health Policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711413076">Mollica, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413076">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711413076">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413076">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711413076">2003</xref>), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711413076">National Center for Assisted Living (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413076">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711413076">2004</xref>), and the American Association of Retired Persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413076">Edelstein &amp; Gaddy, 2000</xref>) were also utilized.</p>

<title>Regulatory Dimensions and Issue Areas</title>
<sec id="section4-0095399711413076">
<title>Philosophy</title>
<p>One of the most distinctive characteristics of assisted living touted by providers is that their facilities operate under a distinct philosophy. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413076">ALFA (2008)</xref>, the largest organization representing the industry, posited that in addition to assisted living being “a special combination of housing, personalized supportive services and health care designed to meet the needs—both scheduled and unscheduled—of those who need help with activities of daily living,” assisted living also includes a distinct operational philosophy characterized by respect for resident independence, safety, personal choice, and dignity. However, across the states, there has been no agreement on the meaning and use of the term; consequently, defining assisted living is part of the problem. Other organizations, providers, interest groups, and consumers may include as components of the philosophy a respect for resident privacy, independence, safety, individual choice, and aging-in-place. Resident privacy itself anticipates two characteristics, one that is structural and another that is behavioral. Structural privacy indicates that residents will be living in apartment-like, rather than dormitory-like, units. In cases where two residents share a room, that sharing must be entirely voluntary. This requirement proved awkward in mapping state regulation of assisted living. As of 2004, 17 states licensed facilities that would fit the industry-defined definition of assisted living facilities in the same category as those that clearly would not fit the industry-defined definition, particularly because they were so dormitory-like or un-private. Technically, dormitory-like facilities are not assisted living, as defined by ALFA and the majority of consumers. Nevertheless, the average consumer in one of these 17 states would have no idea until personally inspecting a facility that it was more like a college or prison dormitory than a private, homelike residence.</p>
<p>Privacy also can take the form of behavioral privacy—the discreet use of medical and other care information in an environment where many other residents and staff live and work. Being able to provide a homelike environment that is also structured to ensure privacy for residents is yet another challenge. For example, Sunrise Assisted Living’s architecture integrates business areas into the overall residence structure, creating a homelike atmosphere. However, it also creates an atmosphere in which it is difficult to discuss individual resident issues and business concerns privately. On visiting, it is not unusual to see a care manager or administrator discussing a resident’s private information in an open atmosphere, thereby negating the promise of privacy. This inconsistency should come as no surprise. Any individual who has lived in a shared residence situation—for example, in a family or with acquaintances under one roof—is aware that privacy is sacrificed. Consequently, despite advertising the importance of resident privacy, the nature of a shared environment does not lend itself to such. Nevertheless, in terms of an operational philosophy, a number of trade organizations have emphasized privacy as an important component and selling point.</p>
<p>Another philosophical component advertised in many assisted living facilities is the encouragement of independence. Assisted living facilities over the past decade have enlarged the pool of eligible potential residents to include the most frail. As a result, encouraging independence can become more and more difficult for staff. Indeed, where it is inappropriately stressed, frail residents may hurt themselves. Yet, in many cases, extremely frail residents are near or at the same level of disability as patients in a nursing home. At the point of contracting, many potential residents are unaware that the facility is more akin to a nursing home than an independent living residence and are surprised to see the wide range of resident abilities present. Consequently, staff walk a fine line in encouraging independence while also effectively meeting the needs of frail residents. Without adequate training and staff numbers to cope with this delicate balancing act, the inevitable instances of neglect can occur.</p>
<p>Safety and choice are other critical components of the assisted living philosophy that are emphasized as distinguishing the industry from nursing home and board-and-care facilities. Residents are promised that they and their possessions will be safe in the assisted living environment and that they will be actively consulted for their preferences on a variety of issues such as care and service. For purposes of this study, a state that included in its licensing scheme a recognition that assisted living (or equivalent term) facilities that operated under a philosophy that included two or more relevant components were treated as having a regulatory scheme that addressed the role of assisted living philosophy in a facility’s formal operations.</p>
<p>Another philosophical component involves allowing a resident to age-in-place. The first challenge involving the ability to provide for aging-in-place reflects a long-understood premise that making a frail individual undergo the stress of moving contributes to the health and well-being of that individual in the long term. For example, researchers have found that individuals with dementia who relocate from their own homes to nursing homes are associated with an increased risk of mortality immediately following admission, a result that occurred regardless of the health of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413076">Anehensel, Pearlin, Levy-Storms, &amp; Schuler, 2000</xref>). Consequently, promising potential residents that they will be able stay in a particular facility when in reality that facility is only equipped and licensed to provide a certain level of care has proved problematic. Indeed, it has been one of the main consumer protection criticisms. Facilities that attempt to keep residents beyond their ability to provide care risk failing to meet legal levels of care responsibilities.</p>
<p>A regulatory scheme was coded with a “1” if it identified that facilities subject to its provisions were those that operate under a distinct value system or philosophy emphasizing the components listed above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0095399711413076">
<title>Services</title>
<p>Providing services is at the heart of assisted living operations and being able to provide services to residents is not only relevant to satisfying contractual expectations but also to maintaining the health and welfare of residents. Consequently, the characteristic “services” for this research addressed whether a regulatory scheme at a minimum, required facilities provide the services for which residents have contracted. If a regulatory scheme included such a provision it was coded as “1.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0095399711413076">
<title>Admission</title>
<p>The decision to admit a resident is a serious one for both consumer and provider. Facilities differ in how they determine the eligibility of a prospective resident for admittance. Some facilities are more rigid in limiting the number and type of health and/or psychological frailties, whereas others allow people whose infirmities reach the level typically seen in nursing homes. Historically, the first assisted living facilities limited themselves to accepting residents with only slightly more limitations than those in traditional board-and-care settings. But as more facilities entered the market, more advertised themselves as having the ability to accept residents with greater frailties and cognitive challenges. Even those that did not advertise themselves this way often began accepting such residents though they did not have the capabilities to meet the needs of such residents. Consequently, the framing characteristic “admission” reflects the presence or absence in a state regulatory scheme of a provision addressing the admission standards in a facility. At a minimum, the regulatory scheme had to require that facilities in the state only admit residents for whom they have the ability to care and provide services. That being said, a number of states go well beyond that providing detailed descriptions of the types of infirmities a facility advertising itself as assisted living can and cannot include in potential residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0095399711413076">
<title>Retention/Discharge</title>
<p>For a regulatory scheme to be scored as having “retention/discharge” provisions, it must, at a minimum, have explained generally what conditions could precipitate the need to discharge a resident (e.g., required discharge if the facility could no longer care for the resident), required facilities provide a reasonable amount of notice to the resident of the need to discharge (no less than 2 weeks), and required facilities provide an explanation to the resident for the reason for discharge. A number of states have provisions detailing specific conditions for discharge as well as time schemes for discharge and relocation assistance.</p>
<p>Admission and discharge policies are intricately linked with the philosophical component of aging-in-place previously mentioned. Discharging a resident as he or she becomes more frail leads to violations of the promise to provide for aging-in-place. The result of this contradictory situation is a bevy of wrongful death and negligence lawsuits, violation of contract complaints. A further response on the part of the industry has been the inclusion in contracts of negotiated risk agreements, which basically shield providers from most legal challenges after a resident has been hurt or contractual promises have been violated. Consequently, observing if states have addressed discharging residents reflects an issue of concern in the aging-in-place component that ostensibly makes assisted living different from traditional board-and-care and nursing homes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095399711413076">
<title>Medication Administration Oversight</title>
<p>For a regulatory scheme to be scored as addressing “medication administration oversight,” it must have, at a minimum, a requirement that residents be able to self-administer medication and, if not able, qualified staff were required to oversee administration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0095399711413076">
<title>Staffing</title>
<p>Critical to being able to meet the needs of residents is having sufficient staff. Accordingly, though a few states have actual staffing ratios, any specification of a state requirement that facilities have staff sufficient to meet the needs of residents resulted in a coding score of 1. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413076">U.S. Government Accountability Office (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413076">2004)</xref> revealed that insufficient numbers of staff are significant problems in assisted living. Consequently, for ensuring quality of care, staffing is a prime issue category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0095399711413076">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Along the same lines, another problem that has been highlighted by various stakeholders is a concern about insufficiently trained staff and administrators in assisted living facilities (GAO, 1999). Accordingly, for a regulatory scheme to be scored as addressing training, it had to, at a minimum, require that staff and administrators have sufficient training to meet the needs of residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0095399711413076">
<title>Alzheimer’s/Dementia Provisions</title>
<p>Many professional and consumer groups have articulated concerns that the regulation of assisted living often treats residents having Alzheimer’s disease or a type of dementia the same way as residents not having such challenges. Increasingly over the past two decades, health researchers have discovered that patients with these illnesses have very specific needs, from types of building structures to oversight of social relationships. More recently, researchers have found that more than half of residents of assisted living suffer from dementia or other psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711413076">Rosenblatt et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, the need for regulatory schemes to address this category appropriately is paramount. A regulatory scheme was scored as addressing Alzheimer’s and dementia residents if it had separate provisions governing building structures, staff training, types of staff, and resident monitoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0095399711413076">
<title>Criminal Background Checks on Staff and Administrators</title>
<p>Crimes ranging from petty theft to sexual abuse—perpetrated by staff members—have been found in assisted living facilities, and the subject of ensuring that individuals with criminal histories are not hired in care settings continues to be a passionate issue for many assisted living stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711413076">Crooks Caring for Seniors, 1998</xref>). Consequently, this research looked to determine whether a state specifically required criminal background checks for both administrators and staff. Merely requiring a facility check a state elder abuse list was insufficient to be scored as having a criminal background check requirement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0095399711413076">
<title>Inspections/Monitoring</title>
<p>The assisted living industry itself in recent years has recognized a role for state inspections of facilities. State inspections may not absolutely protect residents from quality and consumer protection problems, but they can represent an obstacle for a facility that otherwise might go unchecked with such problems. Consequently, for a regulatory scheme to be scored as having a provision addressing monitoring/inspections it had to, at a minimum, require regularly scheduled (e.g., quarterly, biannual, annual, etc.) inspections.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0095399711413076">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In general, for the regulatory characteristics studied, the states have progressively adopted more provisions in their regulatory schemes over time; the policy domain has expanded precipitously since 1994. The increase in adoption initially was slow, but in 1996, there was a spike in regulatory activity across states that heralded a moderate but continual increase through 2004, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095399711413076">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section15-0095399711413076">
<title>Analytical Dimensions</title>
<p>In terms of specific provisions within the 10 analytical dimensions, the number of states with regulatory schemes containing each such has also increased, though some provisions within certain dimensional categories have been adopted in larger numbers over others. Three areas in particular evidence a distinct lag in adoption: operational philosophy, separate treatment concerning Alzheimer’s/dementia residents, and criminal background checks for employees. For example, the number of states specifying an assisted living operational philosophy in the regulations or rules has increased to 30 while seven other regulatory areas have been adopted by 40 more states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095399711413076">Figure 2</xref>). Although this increase has not been at the rate of other provisions, as will be discussed below, it is still a marked increase from 1994, when fewer than 10 contained such a provision.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0095399711413076" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><p>Number of states with provisions addressing regulatory issue areas</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0095399711413076-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The following results reflect regulatory adoption in the following order of issue areas: services, admission, retention/discharge, medication administration and management, staffing requirements, training, Alzheimer’s/dementia treatment, criminal background checks, and monitoring.</p>
<sec id="section16-0095399711413076">
<title>Services</title>
<p>There has been an increase in the number of states that also include provisions addressing the types of services that assisted living facilities are permitted to provide under licensing. Again, in 1994, fewer than 10 states had provisions of this nature, but that number had jumped to 35 in 1996, and by 2004, the majority of states had provisions addressing service provision. The typical regulatory scheme requires that a facility provide services appropriate to its residents. Hence, in most cases, a specific list of medical conditions or even less specific categories of conditions that would require services beyond those offered in assisted living are not provided in the regulations or rules of most states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0095399711413076">
<title>Admissions</title>
<p>Regarding regulations concerning admission, while 30 states in 1994 addressed the types of residents a facility could admit, by 2004, nearly all had. Again, this provision reflects a minimum. To be scored as having the provision, a state must have had at least the requirement that only residents with conditions a facility was licensed to serve could be admitted. Indeed, most states use such general language in their provisions as opposed to providing categories of conditions that would render a possible resident ineligible for admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0095399711413076">
<title>Retention/discharge</title>
<p>Retention and discharge is a subject that has also increased its presence in state regulatory schemes during the period under investigation. The marked increase for this provision came in 1998 when the number of states having such provisions nearly doubled from that in 1996. By 2004, all but 10 states had provision(s) addressing the issue. At a minimum, such provisions generally discuss what conditions precipitate the need to discharge a resident (e.g., required discharge if the facility could no longer care for the resident), as well as a requirement that facilities provide a reasonable amount of notice to the resident of the need to discharge (no less than 2 weeks) and that such facilities provide an explanation to the resident for the reason for discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0095399711413076">
<title>Medication administration and management</title>
<p>Furthermore, there has been a dramatic increase since 1994 in the number of states including regulatory provisions concerning medication oversight. As of 2004, all but one state had provisions addressing this issue area. Nevertheless, though the majority of states now have regulatory provisions specifying the basic medication provision, the typical provision requires that facilities have qualified personnel be available to aid in administrating medication when a resident herself cannot. Hence, regulatory provisions tend to be generally worded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0095399711413076">
<title>Staffing requirements and training</title>
<p>Staffing issues are at the forefront of many reports of quality problems in assisted living. Between 1994 and 2004, an increasing number of states adopted regulatory provisions specifying, at the very least, that sufficient staffs are available to meet the needs of residents. Although nearly all states had some type of staffing provision by 2004, the extent and level that facilities must maintain reflect vague and “flexible” standards, and whether states can impose specific ratios remains hotly debated. However, the structure of future regulation regarding staffing issues will most likely evidence further specification.</p>
<p>Related to staffing numbers is the subject of training staff members, including administrators and direct-care staff. Assisted living stakeholders and, particularly, policy makers and consumer activists have identified the need to ensure that administrators and staff are trained sufficiently to perform their responsibilities. The number of states throughout the study period that have implemented provisions mandating that employees have, at the very least, training sufficient to meet the needs of residents has increased markedly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0095399711413076">
<title>Alzheimer’s/dementia treatment</title>
<p>In addition to staffing problems, another frequently cited quality problem involves facilities providing care to residents with Alzheimer’s and related cognitive impairments such as stroke-related dementia. Although this issue area evidenced an increase in the number of states creating provisions treating Alzheimer’s/dementia as requiring distinct regulatory provisions, only half the states by 2004 had implemented it. This has proved of considerable concern to organizations such as the AA, which has reported than half or more of all elderly assisted living residents suffer from Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413076">AA, 2003</xref>). Indeed, one study of assisted living facilities in Maryland found that 68% of their elderly assisted living residents had dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711413076">Rosenblatt et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0095399711413076">
<title>Criminal background checks</title>
<p>Criminal background checks are another important component of quality and consumer protection that first became the subject of debate in nursing home care after reports of abuse and other crimes. Similar reports have manifested in terms of assisted living, and states have varied in their efforts to implement a comprehensive criminal background checks for administrators and staff. Although the number of states with such a provision has doubled, the number still just barely reaches a majority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095399711413076">Figure 2</xref>). Many of the states that have not adopted such provisions have either limited their checks to reviews of state abuse registries or limited them to administrators only. As a variety of types of crimes have been linked with direct care staff and administrators, the latter situation does not meet minimum requirements in light of quality and consumer protection. In addition, state abuse registries do not record histories of other crimes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0095399711413076">
<title>Inspections and monitoring</title>
<p>Finally, monitoring has also evidenced an increase in the number of states implementing it. The number of states between 1994 and 2004 incorporating this provision increased from 26 to 45 indicating that increasingly states are including provisions that require making inspections beyond simply responding to complaints alone. More and more they are setting schedules for inspecting agencies, such as yearly or biyearly inspections, to oversee facilities, often in unannounced conditions.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that although, from 1994 through 2004, states increasingly adopted regulatory schemes with provisions addressing the 10 issue areas of quality and consumer protection discussed here, not all 10 areas show similar rates of adoption. In particular, a recognition that assisted living is distinct from other forms of long-term care by virtue of, among other things, an operational philosophy has not been recognized in state regulatory schemes. Although the largest professional organization representing assisted living facilities (primarily for-profits) has always marketed assisted living as being distinct from other long-term care options by virtue of a distinct operational philosophy (e.g., valuing privacy, resident independence, resident choice, a homelike environment, safety, and respect, among other characteristics), it is interesting that state regulatory schemes do not include this as part of their regulatory schemes.</p>
<p>Similarly, two other issue areas remain as laggards in the adoption evolution of state regulatory schemes: separate Alzheimer’s/dementia provisions and criminal background checks. Although resident complaints, inspection reports, and litigation have often referenced problems in these areas, they continue to resist isomorphic pressures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the overall increasing regulatory isomorphism throughout 1994-2004, three issue areas stand out as resistant to homogenizing pressures: operational philosophy, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia provisions, and criminal background checks. Although many states have adopted regulations in these areas, they do not evidence the clear trend toward isomorphism in content that is apparent in the other categories. That is, while they reflect horizontal isomorphism, there is less evidence of vertical isomorphism. Regulations in these issue areas exhibit, across several states, distinct operational philosophies in the assisted living industry, distinct needs both in physical structures and daily care of dementia and Alzheimer’s residents, and varying emphasis on criminal background checks for staff.</p>
<p>Resistance toward more comprehensive isomorphism among regulatory approaches in these areas arguably reflects tensions among the various forces within the environment. Indeed, beyond merely reflecting tensions among them, these pressure mechanisms actually work against isomorphism without jeopardizing the pursuit of legitimacy. Although previous research has indicated that where organizations operate in environments fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty, organizations often mimic each other to establish a sense of legitimacy, in the case of assisted living regulation, the lack of a common definition accepted by all stakeholders actually works against increased isomorphism.</p>
<p>Policy adoption patterns and the extent to which certain issue areas have been incorporated into state regulatory schemes are part and parcel of the institutional environments in which they occur. As institutionalist arguments posit, over the life cycles of organizations, through the interplay of certain pressure mechanisms in their environments, organizations tend to move toward similarity or isomorphism in structure, policy, and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711413076">Scott &amp; Meyer, 1991</xref>). That is, they adopt already institutionalized models in the pursuit of legitimacy (compare with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711413076">Mizruchi &amp; Fein, 1999</xref>). In the case of assisted living, using the data discussed above, an increase in homogenization of the regulatory schemes is clearly apparent, as expected, yet a closer examination reveals several regulatory areas that appear resistant to the pattern. The resistance to such isomorphism is not what one would predict using traditional expectations regarding the phenomenon. Indeed, it appears that in some contexts, rather than contributing to it, pressures that in the current literature, would lead to isomorphism, can actually operate counter to the development of isomorphic policy content. Consequently, consideration of such outcomes must be examined in turn.</p>
<sec id="section25-0095399711413076">
<title>Isomorphic Pressure Mechanisms and Resistance to Isomorphism</title>
<p>A basic tenet in the institutionalist approach regarding organizational development is that, in an attempt to gain legitimacy within their environments, organizations tend to adopt models that already have been proved—legitimated—within the field. Such adoption of similar models thereby decreases uncertainty and projects legitimacy within the environment. The case of assisted living has revealed an interesting and unexpected pattern in that uniformity in regulatory patterns is not a foregone conclusion. Pressure mechanisms acting as resistors to isomorphism appear in several forms in the regulation of the industry but a common theme among most is conceptual ambiguity and lack of consensus among influential stakeholders organizations such as those representing for-profit assisted living providers and those representing conditions and medical professionals such as the AA.</p>
<p>The lack of uniform definition among stakeholders leads policy makers to adopt standard approaches to the problems that arise and to look to existing models as “lessons learned,” both directly and indirectly legitimating their actions as risk avoidance strategies and rational responses to related issues. With assisted living, the lack of state agreement as to what constitutes “assisted living” is a potent pressure mechanism aiding in resistance to more complete homogenization in regulatory schemes.</p>
<p>Inconsistency in defining assisted living remains an issue for policy makers, researchers, consumers, and interest groups. There is no uniform legal definition of assisted living across all states, and even definitional elements concerned fundamental by related national-level professional organizations had not been integrated into most regulatory schemes despite large numbers of facilities in each state advertising themselves as “assisted living.”</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[A]ssisted living is a residential care environment supplying 24-hour oversight with some services (short of skilled medical care officially required in nursing homes), guided by an operational philosophy that reflects respect for the privacy, independence, dignity, and safety of residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711413076">AAHSA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413076">Consumer Consortium on Assisted Living, 2008</xref>).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For example, even though the ALFA, which is the industry’s largest membership organization, formulated a definition, it has not been adopted across regulatory schemes or among even a majority of facilities around the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413076">ALFA (2008)</xref> posited that an assisted living residence is “a special combination of housing, personalized supportive services and health care designed to meet the needs—both scheduled and unscheduled—of those who need help with activities of daily living” and maintains that ALFA members should adhere to a specific philosophy of care. However, it does not require that any facility advertising itself as assisted living adhere to any specified standard and it recognizes that there are a wide variety of assisted living models operating across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413076">ALFA, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The failure of stakeholder groups and government to reach definitional agreement is not just evidenced by the lack of widespread adoption of the ALFA definition of the term. The ALW, formed at the behest of the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging in 2001, issued a report in 2003, after a year-and-a-half of discussion revealing that the nearly 50 stakeholder organizations making up the ALW could not reach a consensus on the definition of assisted living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, the term <italic>assisted living</italic> continues to be used liberally among all types of facilities. Many former board-and-care homes that did virtually nothing to change their methods of operations and services have reclassified and advertised themselves as assisted living. This might not be a problem for consumers if only the types of services assisted living facilities provided were consistent and reliable, but after the boom of the 1990s, the market experienced a backlash from over supply, causing investors to back off. With the dip in development from oversupply, many facilities began accepting much more frail residents while continuing to identify themselves as assisted living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711413076">Goldstein-Eagan, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Responding to industry variation, regulatory efforts work hand in hand with this situation. Thus, state schemes are in keeping with basic characteristics reflected in the working definition of assisted living employed here as well as in addressing typical concerns that arise irrespective of facility type. Accordingly, resulting regulations reflect patterns of increasing similarity in the face of industry variation, indicating coherence in approach and expectation. Although on one hand the lack of uniform definition signals uncertainty and ambiguity, such features themselves on the other hand allow the industry to function as a loosely coupled adaptive system, evolving in reaction to the changing market environment.</p>
<p>The lack of a uniform adoption of a definition of assisted living both in facilities themselves as well as state regulatory schemes indicates that no definition has been uniformly considered legitimate, as previously mentioned. This is interesting in that the small number of states that have adopted provisions recognizing distinct assisted living operational philosophies either had some of the largest proportions of 60-and-older populations or saw early establishment of assisted living facilities (California, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, Maryland). Hence, the strength of legitimacy often associated with large numbers (such as states with large 60-and-older populations) and earlier adopters (states hosting the earliest collections of assisted living facilities) simply was not enough to move a majority of states toward recognizing a uniform assisted living operational philosophy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0095399711413076">
<title>Competing Stakeholder Professions</title>
<p>Are there countervening professional tensions preventing the adoption of regulatory provisions recognizing assisted living as having a distinct operational philosophy? In this case, it appears that a wide variety of stakeholders with a wide variety of professional interests may be a primary pressure mechanism. As previously mentioned, the ALW was formed as an ad hoc collection of assisted living stakeholders at the behest of the Senate Special Committee on Aging to find a consensus on key quality and consumer protection issues in assisted living. The ALW included leaders representing various stakeholder groups associated with assisted living, such as medical and residential development professionals, long-term care professionals, regulators, and consumer advocates, totaling almost 50 organizations. In terms of defining assisted living and recognizing a distinct operational philosophy, the group was not able to find a consensus shared by all stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW, 2003</xref>). The participating professional organizations, which represented every facet related to stakeholder interests in assisted living, had such varying goals and constituent members that no consensus on a shared definition that could be required for purposes of regulation and general industry standards could be reached. In fact, such professional pressures have actually mobilized against or prevented the widespread adoption of regulatory provisions defining a consistent assisted living operational philosophy. For example, the Assisted Living Federation Association, the largest provider organization, has a membership primarily of for-profit organizations and has publicly stated that it does not share the motivations of the ALW, claiming fundamentally different motivations than those presented and agreed on by other organizations participating in the ALW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711413076">Willging, 2003</xref>). It claims that consensus reached by other ALW participants such as those representing residents, certain medical issues (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), and caregiving employees does not sufficiently reflect its principles of consumer choice and state regulatory flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711413076">Willging, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, regarding regulatory provisions for Alzheimer’s and dementia treatment in assisted living facilities, 1994-2004 encompassed not only an era of growth in the industry but also in the scientific knowledge base concerning these conditions. Although organizations such as the AA were actively collecting and disseminating relevant information, scientific data explaining the nature and patterns of Alzheimer’s related behaviors, as well as treatments, were still in a state of dynamic investigation—the Food and Drug Administration approving the first drug for treating Alzheimer’s in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711413076">Allday, 2006</xref>). Although such organizations were disseminating the latest knowledge on the needs of affected patients, market forces were also advocating for an overall flexibility in state regulatory schemes on related issues. Hence, two stakeholder organizations, the AA and the primarily for-profit membership, ALFA, tended to be at odds with each other in defining not only assisted living for purposes of definition but also on legally mandated provisions concerning physical structures, staff, and treatment of Alzheimer’s/dementia residents in assisted living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413076">ALW, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Until 2000, academic and professional research wrestled with obtaining data that would be helpful in understanding the assisted living industry and the resident consumers it targeted. Researchers in the 1990s—e.g., those associated with federal government’s mandated <italic>National Study of Assisted Living for the Frail Elderly</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711413076">Hawes, Phillips, &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>)—were still trying to establish a profile of the typical assisted living resident, and the extent to which Alzheimer’s and dementia residents were being admitted simply was not known.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0095399711413076">
<title>State Regulatory Authority Meets Federal Pressures</title>
<p>Also, both direct and indirect pressure effects are evident in consideration of federal-level actions. As previously mentioned, assisted living is not regulated by the federal government. However, the federal government began investigating the industry in the mid-1990s in the wake of consumer complaints and dissatisfaction, resulting in various reports documenting problems related to quality and consumer protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711413076">U.S. Government Accountability office, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413076">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413076">2004</xref>). On that basis, by the end of the 1990s, several senators had publicly commented that, if reports of quality and consumer protection problems with assisted living did not diminish, they would not rule out the possibility of federal intervention and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711413076">McCoy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711413076">U.S. Government Accountability Office, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413076">1999</xref>). Although not overtly declaring federal regulation as imminent, the message was clear—and, by 2004, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095399711413076">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095399711413076">2</xref>, the average number of adopted regulatory provisions across all states had increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Thus, as more and more states adopted regulatory schemes, increasing isomorphism occurred among them. In 1994, two states—California and Florida—had regulatory schemes that included provisions reflecting all 10 of the basic issues examined here. These states have some of the largest senior (60-and-older) populations in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711413076">Census Bureau, 2003</xref>). Hence, not surprisingly, they also have some of the largest numbers of residential care facilities for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711413076">Hawes et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, three states had nine of the 10 regulatory provisions studied: Georgia, Oregon, and Virginia. Georgia, like California and Florida, has a large 60-and-older population. In 1994, in response to public pressures, Oregon was investigating cost-effective alternative residential care options for state-supported individuals who did not need nursing home care but were placed there for lack of alternative. Responsive cost considerations were an important element in their early adoptions of assisted living regulatory provisions. Virginia represents a different kind of case altogether, reflecting a kind of “legacy effect.” It is the birthplace of assisted living, having hosted Sunrise Assisted Living’s early development of facilities heralding and setting the stage for the industry itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0095399711413076">
<title>Policy Priorities and Cost Concerns</title>
<p>A common factor hindering the development of new regulatory provisions is cost. Public institutions work with limited resources, resources that are tied to the policy priorities of multiple actors. One area of resistance to homogenization seems particularly linked to the pressure-debate created by cost versus policy priority. One of the fundamental concerns voiced about requiring background checks for employees of assisted living, as in many industries, reflect concerns that such efforts could be costly to implement. Thus, for example, while ALFA, the largest professional organization representing assisted living industry providers, lists criminal background checks among its core recommendations for industry operational principles, it stresses that these must be cost-effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413076">ALFA, 2008</xref>). Again, although often framed in terms of public service, assisted living is a for-profit industry in most instances (most providers are not nonprofit), and regulatory developments are made against the backdrop of profit motivations and market competition relative to consumer responses and demands. In tight economic periods, many legislators may be reluctant to add an administrative cost to assisted living facilities if such costs could effectively threaten the very existence of the business. Nevertheless, high profile investigations into consumer protection and quality issues (including wrongful death litigation, elder-abuse charges, etc.) may provide a strong enough impetus for policy makers to institute a requirement in the area of criminal background checks. But, as regulation is on a state-by-state basis, such high profile revelations may serve to limit the extent of otherwise costly added regulation.</p>
<p>Of course, assisted living is still a relatively young industry and, as related arguments suggest, over time, institutional dynamics may result in overall isomorphism in response to changing coercive and normative pressures. Indeed, as predicted, state regulatory schemes have evidenced movement toward similarity in general when explored in reference to such pressures. However, importantly, we still find that, at least in the short term, some of those same pressures can also operate in opposition to isomorphism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Understanding the development of assisted living regulation is a complex endeavor and an institutionalist approach is well-suited for the task. The research presented here is an early step in what promises to be a prolific field of inquiry. Although an initial foray into the challenge, it advances the discussion of institutional theory in revealing that traditional expectations on isomorphism do not always hold true. The findings evidence that though state regulatory schemes, in terms of issues related to quality and consumer protection, have increasingly included provisions addressing basic identified issue factors typically identified as pressure mechanisms that move organizations toward isomorphism over time, factors exist that actually serve to inhibit it. In addition, the findings reflect the extreme complexity that may underlie policy diffusion issues surrounding the evolution of regulation associated with specific industries.</p>
<p>A key issue that can inhibit movement toward isomorphism involves competing notions among stakeholders in defining a product—in this case assisted living—offered by an industry. There is still no unifying definition of assisted living across all states among regulatory schemes despite the industry having existed in the United States since the mid-1980s. Although some states have emphasized the role of specific assisted living operational philosophies for their importance in differentiating assisted living from nursing homes and board-and-care facilities, the effort has not proved widespread. The reluctance of states to use the term <italic>assisted living</italic> may be related to a lack of consensus among stakeholder groups as well as difficulty in measuring commonly proposed operational philosophy components such as “encouraging resident independence” and “valuing privacy.” How would an inspector measure if a facility was “encouraging resident independence” consistent with assisted living? Although developing a measurement tool for purpose of evaluation would be possible, it would take at least some agreement among policy makers and assisted living experts, with subsequent political approval. Given that influential industry groups have advocated for light regulation with freedom for individual assisted living providers to negotiate with potential residents as they choose, it is not entirely surprising that this analytical dimension did not reflect momentum toward isomorphism.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this conceptual ambiguity continues to plague researchers, policy makers, and other stakeholders. Generalizing about state regulation of assisted living is particularly difficult when states oversee facilities based on different definitions and standards. In terms of the 10 basic analytical dimensions, states have increasingly adopted associated provisions for their regulatory schemes throughout the period reviewed, during the industry’s formidable growth, but the nature of that adoption phenomena has been limited. An area for future research would be to detail the actual degrees of difference between regulatory provisions on issues directly related to quality and consumer protection issues, an excellent context for hypothesis testing within the context of institutionalist research.</p>
<p>Relatedly, we also need to know if, among state schemes with intense oversight and more comprehensive regulation on quality and consumer protection categories, there is a correlation with fewer complaints or inspection violations. These areas are ripe for future research, although preliminary indications reveal that data for many states on quality and consumer protection complaints and sanctions are often incomplete and/or unreliable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, data gathered through state legislative audits, typically collected during investigations by independent auditors, could prove a wealth of information for understanding institutional factors influencing the administration of state regulatory schemes related to assisted living. For example, of those states that have conducted such evaluations preliminary indications reveal that even when an agency fully intends to follow regulations (through, for examples, program monitoring, yearly inspections, enforcement protocols, etc.), a lack of funds, resources, and qualified staff hinder them. Although not all states have carried out such assessments, these audits still are a rich reserve of data in an otherwise sparse field of resources concerning assisted living regulation.</p>
<p>For stakeholders concerned with avoiding federal intervention and regulation, one possible approach might be the creation and adoption of a uniform assisted living statute, a statute that has been formulated in a manner similar to model statutes for other state regulatory topics by the National Conference of Commissioners for Uniform State Laws. The activities of the ALW and the Center for Excellence in Assisted Living mirror the early organization of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute whose efforts, beginning in the 1940s, resulted in the creation of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC was created after policy makers and businesses noted the need for uniform laws governing commercial transactions that crossed state lines. Once the UCC was created, it was up to each state to introduce and ratify it. All states (except Louisiana) now have their own versions of the code, providing some degree of confidence for businesses that similar laws will be applied to their transactions. In applying this concept to assisted living, the fact that it is cross-jurisdictional in nature lends itself to a similar approach. Thus, pursuing an agenda for the development of an assisted living version of the UCC might be a future option, should current efforts fail to address quality and consumer protection problems.</p>
<p>These points lead one to wonder about the future of assisted living and policy development overseeing its regulation. Although conceptual ambiguity has confounded consumers, researchers, and policy makers, it need not continue. States can continue to regulate eldercare residential providers as they see fit, but all stakeholders should have ready access to a clear, complete, and transparent statement of each state’s regulation of facilities at the time a potential resident visits, not contracts with, a facility. This point-of-contact accessibility to information core to evaluating the decision to contract with a provider removes much of the confusion that has been created by the difficulty with which consumers and others have had in obtaining information on basic principles of resident rights, whether they be under current state law, or also offered as part of the contractual understanding between providing and resident. With the increase in America’s elderly population, the assisted living industry has created a pattern of admitting and retaining the frailest of the frail, looking in some cases very similar to the nursing home industry—but not as regulated. True, policy makers, consumers, industry representatives, interest groups, and others still have not reached a definitional consensus. However, as discussed previously, even that conceptual ambiguity, though initially playing an integral role as a pressure mechanism hindering otherwise predictable isomorphic tendencies, need not hinder effective policy that allows consumers and other stakeholders to feel confident that assisted living can provide quality residential care without the myriad consumer protection problems that have plagued it for so long. Moreover, in any case, with the dramatic growth in numbers of “the oldest old,” assisted living is likely to remain an eldercare fixture in the contemporary United States. Understanding how policy makers and other stakeholders continue to work with this industry is essential for further policy development and the provision of health care services to a continuing aging population seeking this popular residential care choice. This research is an initial step in providing that understanding as well as an initial step for expanding on traditional models used to explain institutional isomorphism.</p>
