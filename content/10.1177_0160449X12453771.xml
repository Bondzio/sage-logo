<p>This article extends discussions of gender, race, and union leadership by considering the experiences of women of color, white women, men of color, and white men who <italic>already</italic> occupy union leadership positions. Using interviews with 124 stewards from ten trade unions, the authors examine the daily experience of steward work, as told by stewards themselves. The authors find that gender and race interact to shape stewards’ leadership experiences and that stewards craft leadership styles that respond to their particular gendered and raced experiences. Finally, the authors consider the implications of their findings for unions interested in facilitating the leadership of underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>As union membership declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>), national and international leaders seek to respond to a changing workforce and economy. In keeping with trends in the labor force more generally, women of all races and men of color make up ever greater proportions of rank-and-file union membership. In 2010, 45.7 percent of union workers were women, and if current trends persist, this figure will increase to over 50 percent by 2020. And while the proportion of union workers who were white men dropped significantly—from 51.7 to 44.8 percent—between 1983 and 2010, representation among nearly all other race-gender categories either rose or held steady during this same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>, 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160449X12453771">Schmitt and Warner 2009</xref>). Despite the burgeoning representation of white women and people of color in union <italic>membership</italic>, these groups continue to be underrepresented in union <italic>leadership</italic> positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X12453771">Cobble and Michal 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X12453771">Fletcher 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X12453771">Gray 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>These are not new trends; scholars have been noting them for the past several decades. In response, many have examined the barriers to, especially, women’s leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X12453771">Gray 1993</xref>). But what happens when these barriers are overcome, when “nontraditional” (i.e., not white men) leaders emerge within labor unions? Do gender and race cease to matter once an individual achieves a position of leadership? These questions are underexplored, and they are what we seek to address in this article.</p>
<p>Understanding the experiences of union leaders who are women and/or people of color (in addition to those of white men) is important for several reasons. First, unions need members, and as noted above, these members must come from a labor force increasingly composed of women and/or people of color. Unions will likely only be able to keep the members they have, and continue to attract new ones, if their leadership reflects their membership. Second, because race and gender have informed their work experiences differently than for white men, white women and people of color bring new concerns and ideas to the labor movement, which are likely to reflect the issues that are most important to their constituents. Third, unions are powerful institutions, representing 13.1 percent of the U.S. workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>, 5); affecting wages, working conditions, and family-friendly policies for their members as well as workers and workplaces more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160449X12453771">MacGillvary 2009</xref>); and playing a major role in political campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160449X12453771">Center for Responsive Politics 2011</xref>). Thus, achieving gender and race parity in the leadership ranks of these powerful organizations is an important issue for those concerned with gender and race justice more generally.</p>
<p>Examining the leadership experiences of union <italic>stewards</italic>, as we do here, is particularly important. As the lowest level of formal union leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160449X12453771">Bok and Dunlap 1970</xref>, 173; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160449X12453771">Cook 1962</xref>, 333; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160449X12453771">Friedman 1982</xref>, 34–35), the shop steward position is where we are most likely to find union leaders who are women and/or people of color. Moreover, the steward position is the entry-level stepping stone to all other union leadership positions, including those at the highest levels. This means that the experiences of leaders at this level could very well provide clues as to why certain stewards progress—or don’t—to more powerful leadership positions, as well as to how they might experience these higher level positions.</p>
<p>Using interviews with 124 stewards from ten trade unions, we examine the daily experience of steward work, as told by stewards themselves. We ask what stewards do for their unions, employers, and constituents each day; whether they feel they have been treated differently for any reason; how they view their own leadership styles; and how their leadership experiences could be improved. We examine how the answers to each of these questions vary (or not) by gender and race. Finally, we consider what our findings suggest about how gender and race matter in labor unions, and the implications of this for women stewards and/or stewards of color moving into higher-level leadership today and in the future. We find that the work stewards did on a day-to-day basis, and the resources they needed to complete this work, were largely consistent across all race/gender subcategories. However, stewards were treated differently based on race and sex category as they carried out this work, leading stewards of color and white women to engage in additional practical and emotional labor—and to approach leadership in qualitatively different ways—compared to their white men counterparts.</p>

<title>Gender and Race Representation in Unions</title>
<p>In 2010, union membership totaled 14.7 million workers, or 11.9 percent of U.S. employees. Both the number and proportion of workers who are union members have fallen (from 17.7 million workers, representing 20.1 percent of employed workers) since 1983, the first year these data were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>, 1). As union activists and scholars look for ways to reverse this decline, they have recognized potential in the other side of unions’ changing membership: As Bill Fletcher Jr. (2000, 104), former education director and assistant to the president of the AFL-CIO put it, “The working class is becoming browner and more female,” and current union membership rates reflect this trend. Women’s membership rates (11.1 percent) are nearly on par with men’s (12.6 percent), black workers have higher membership rates (13.4 percent) than white workers (11.7 percent), and Asian and Latina/o workers are not far behind (at 10.9 and 10.0 percent, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>, 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner’s (2005)</xref> study of gender and union strategies suggests that women of all races will continue to comprise greater proportions of union membership, as recent organizing victories have come disproportionately from units in which women, especially women of color, predominate. This, in combination with the decline in men-dominated unionized manufacturing jobs, the growth in women-dominated service industries and public sector jobs, and the high rates of organizing successes in these latter jobs, has resulted in “women . . . becoming not just the majority but perhaps as much as 60% of new workers organizing each year” (p. 451).</p>
<p>White women and workers of color have not experienced the same success in becoming union leaders as they have in becoming members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X12453771">Cobble and Michal 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X12453771">Fletcher 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X12453771">Gray 1993</xref>). Among the ten national unions with large numbers of women members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X12453771">Cobble and Michal (2002</xref>, 237) analyzed, women constituted between 4 and 39 percent of officers and executive board members in 2000. In each case, the percentage of women leaders fell far short of the percentage of women members. When women <italic>are</italic> leaders, they are generally relegated to lower-level positions: “women officers are more often secretaries, secretary-treasurers, or treasurers, and less often presidents. They serve in the smallest locals [and] derive less of their income from union work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160449X12453771">Chaison and Andiappan 1987</xref>, 282). But even at the lowest levels, women’s leadership rates do not approximate their membership rates: 35 percent of campaigns in units with mostly women members have <italic>no</italic> women paid organizers; and of lead organizers, 21 percent are women, 22 percent are workers of color, and 7 percent are women of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner 2005</xref>, 455). Unfortunately, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner’s (2005)</xref> analysis, data on race and union leadership are exceedingly rare.</p>

<title>Women, People of Color, and Union Leadership</title>
<p>Clearly, white women and workers of color are not proportionately represented in union leadership. But is this a problem? These workers will surely experience union benefits simply by virtue of being members. Most obviously, union members earn more—28 percent more in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>, 2)—and have “access to a workplace justice procedure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>, 459), both of which may be especially important to workers who are women and/or people of color, since they are most likely to experience discrimination on the job. But the available research suggests that there are important advantages to increasing the representation of these groups in the leadership, as well as the rank-and-file, of unions.</p>
<p>White women and workers of color may bring something new to the table as leaders. For instance, because their experiences inside and outside of work are likely to differ from white men’s (and others’), leaders who are women and/or people of color may choose to prioritize issues that have traditionally been ignored (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160449X12453771">Gwartney-Gibbs and Lach 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160449X12453771">Cranford (2007a</xref>, 361) notes that under white men’s leadership, “unions have historically mobilized men around a family wage that could support a stay-at-home wife/mother and children.” We would expect this agenda to look much less enticing to women, as it was often used as justification to exclude them from union jobs. Instead, we might find women leaders focusing on securing family-friendly workplace policies and higher pay for women-dominated positions—issues that are more likely to reflect their workplace and family realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160449X12453771">Foerster (2004)</xref> notes that black leaders in the multiethnic labor union she studied integrated changes that took into account the diverse cultural needs of their constituents, such as scheduling meetings around various religious holidays and offering foreign-language training. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160449X12453771">Gwartney-Gibbs and Lach (1993</xref>, 310) found that women workers are more likely to experience “difficulties in the workplace—often loosely called personality conflicts—that are not covered by the union contract. . . . [T]hese everyday, subtle occurrences in work setting eat away at women workers, causing them intense ‘emotional labor’ that can interfere with their main tasks.” Perhaps because of experiences such as these, women tend to place greater priority on interactional justice, as opposed to the two forms of organizational justice emphasized by men leaders: distributive and procedural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Women’s leadership styles, in addition to the issues they prioritize, differ from men’s. Compared to men’s, women’s leadership is described as organized around an orientation of care and help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X12453771">Gray 1993</xref>); more participatory, involving talking <italic>with</italic> rather than <italic>to</italic> constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X12453771">Cranford 2007b</xref>); and less hierarchical and more collaborative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X12453771">Eagly and Carli 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>). Research on gender and leadership has increasingly focused on women’s somewhat greater tendency toward transformational leadership, characterized by behaviors such as role-modeling, mentoring, and fostering trust and confidence among subordinates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160449X12453771">Bass 1985</xref>). This style is contrasted with men’s somewhat greater tendency toward transactional leadership, characterized by a more traditional reward and punishment system, and laissez-faire, or hands-off, leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X12453771">Carli and Eagly 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X12453771">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and van Engen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X12453771">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and van Engen’s (2003)</xref> meta-analysis of research on leadership styles suggests that the styles more commonly practiced by women are in fact the most effective. While the differences between women and men may be small, this research suggests that women are just as likely as, if not more likely than, men to engage in the most effective leadership behaviors, and other studies confirm that greater concentration of high-level women leaders is associated with greater financial success among large companies in the United States and Europe (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X12453771">Carli and Eagly 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner (2005)</xref> supports the assertion that women’s union leadership has been particularly successful and suggests that the interaction of race and gender may be important. She found that the extremely high organizing win rates (82 to 89 percent) in units with predominately women of color are at least partially dependent on having an organizer who is a woman of color.</p>
<p>Thus, as leaders, white women and people of color may be particularly valuable to their unions as they seize on the overwhelming organizing momentum among nontraditional membership groups. These groups’ increased representation in union leadership may have wider implications as well; there is evidence to suggest that such a change may impact broader efforts to achieve gender and racial justice. Perhaps most obviously, unions help minimize economic inequalities by equalizing pay for individuals with the same job classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X12453771">Cobble and Michal 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X12453771">Kaminski and Yakura 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X12453771">Needleman 1993</xref>). As a result, the gendered wage gap is lower for unionized women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X12453771">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>). As mentioned above, leaders who are women and/or people of color may be particularly attuned to these issues and thus more committed to prioritizing them in their agendas. Alternately, participating in union activism, especially from within a racially and/or gender segregated unit, may help foster awareness about racism and sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X12453771">Hurd 1993</xref>); once acquired, this awareness (and perhaps activism) likely extends beyond the workplace and union. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160449X12453771">Foerster’s (2004)</xref> research shows that solidarity and understanding across race and culture is sometimes facilitated through class-based union activism, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160449X12453771">Lamm (1975</xref>, 232) argues that black union leaders can simultaneously serve their constituents as well as their wider community by “opening more jobs for blacks, influencing the union . . . to give blacks a greater voice, using the union resources to benefit the community, and seeking to influence the international union and labor movement to improve the condition of blacks in our society” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160449X12453771">Fletcher 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160449X12453771">Marable 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160449X12453771">Wong and Narro 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>The Union Steward and This Study</title>
<p>We agree with the above scholars that labor unions’ leadership should reflect their membership; in other words, unions need more leaders who are women and/or people of color. Their findings about leadership in relation to gender and, to a lesser extent, race underscore the potential benefits of increased representation of white women and people of color, document the lack of such representation, and highlight potential reasons for this disconnect. Elsewhere, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160449X12453771">Roby (1995)</xref> has analyzed gender and racial variations in union workers’ paths to steward leadership and offered recommendations to unions seeking to recruit leaders who are women and/or people of color.</p>
<p>Far fewer studies have considered the socially constructed effects of gender and race once a leadership position is achieved, particularly by listening to what union leaders have to say about their own experiences. Because of this gap in contemporary research, we offer an analysis of the rich, extensive data stewards provided Roby in the mid-1980s. At the time, union scholars were noting many of the same trends that dominate the literature today, suggesting that these data still bear relevance to the current situation. Moreover, these members, who occupied steward positions some two and a half decades ago, would have constituted the pool from which today’s highest-level leaders would likely have been drawn. Consequently, their experiences in the 1980s may tell us something important about why we continue to see gender and race inequalities in union leadership. Finally, union scholars frequently bemoan the continued lack of data on gender and, especially, race in relation to union leadership (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X12453771">Briskin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X12453771">Cobble and Michal 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray 2001</xref>), suggesting that our data based on a large, diverse sample of stewards will help to fill an important gap in the existing literature.</p>
<p>There are many levels of union leadership, each of which could lend valuable insight into the experience of leadership. Our analysis focuses exclusively on union stewards because of their important role in the workplace and because the steward position is the first—and a necessary—step toward higher-level union leadership. Stewards are union members and employees who are elected by others in their workplace or appointed by the union to represent their coworkers and the union. In many unions, a steward’s primary role is to handle the initial step or steps of worker grievances. In most unions, stewards also have political, educational, and organizational responsibilities. Working side by side with others in the factory, hospital ward, or kitchen, stewards represent their coworkers before management; communicate between the members and the union; serve as relatively independent leaders of their constituents; and, in handling grievances, interpret and extend the negotiating process and contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160449X12453771">Cook 1962</xref>). Over the past decades, women and people of color have constituted an increasing (although not representative) proportion of most unions’ stewards. However, stewards’ experiences of leadership are vastly underexplored. This is unfortunate, as these experiences could lend valuable insight into why stewards are or are not interested in pursuing higher-level leadership positions—and, for those who are, how the training, experiences, and relationships they developed as stewards affect their chances of achieving such positions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0160449X12453771" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article is based on data from a larger study that Roby conducted on women’s and men’s paths to becoming and experiences as trade union stewards. Before and during the study, she participated in local and national meetings of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the West Coast Trade Union Women’s Institutes, international union conventions, trade union stewards’ meetings, and labor studies classes. In addition, she toured dozens of workplaces, interviewed local chief executive officers and regional officers at the unions in the sample, and led workshops for union groups.</p>
<p>The data discussed here derive primarily from in-depth interviews with stewards conducted between July 1985 and August 1986. Roby and assistants interviewed 124 stewards from ten unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160449X12453771">1</xref></sup> She included women, men, white stewards, and stewards of color in the sample in order to examine interactions of race and gender in stewards’ experiences of leadership. She oversampled stewards who were women and/or people of color to ensure a meaningful number in the sample. Just under half (48 percent) of the stewards interviewed were women; 43 percent were people of color. Twenty-four percent of the total sample were black, 14 percent were Latino/a, 3 percent were Asian American, and two stewards were Native American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160449X12453771">2</xref></sup> Half of the black, half of the Latino/a, half of the Native American, 49 percent of the white, and none of the Asian American stewards were women.</p>
<p>This sample of stewards was drawn from fourteen locals of ten major international unions representing industrial and service workers in the larger San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland metropolitan areas. These locals were diverse in that some had members in predominantly manual work, others in predominantly nonmanual service work; two were public sector unions and eight represented private workers; some were thought of as progressive, others as conservative; some had memberships composed predominantly of men, others had mostly women members, and yet others had nearly equal numbers of women and men; similarly, the locals’ memberships ranged from those composed predominantly of people of color to those that were predominantly white.</p>
<p>The interviews took place in locations of the interviewee’s choosing; usually her or his home or union hall, but sometimes a workplace or restaurant. They lasted an average of just over three hours and were generally completed in one session, although some continued over two or three meetings. The interview schedule consisted of approximately half open-ended and half closed-ended questions. Both authors coded and analyzed the open-ended responses to identify and sort responses into emerging themes. Both authors also analyzed the closed-ended data to determine the relative frequencies and percentages of given responses by various subcategories of the sample. Below, we discuss the results of these findings in relation to stewards’ experiences of leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160449X12453771">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Union Steward Job as an Everyday Experience</title>
<p>On average, stewards said they were directly responsible for eighty-nine union members. The daily work they engaged in on behalf of these constituents was varied; however, there were certain activities, responsibilities, and skills that stewards consistently identified as the most frequent and important.</p>
<p>In their descriptions of their last work day, stewards reported three activities far more frequently than the others. First, more than a third of the respondents listed handling grievances. Stewards cared about protecting workers’ rights, and they knew that showing people how the union could benefit them personally was crucial to securing their involvement in union activities and actions. But dealing with grievances was often an arduous, multistep process involving several parties; much of stewards’ work had to do with investigating the facts relevant to a grievance and following up on unresolved grievances. Second, many, mostly women, respondents reported dealing with members’ problems that were not formal grievances, perhaps reflecting some stewards’ professed commitment to dealing with members’ issues <italic>before</italic> they escalated into formal grievances. These problems were varied, and some were more serious than others, ranging from child care conflicts, to vacation scheduling issues, to the quality of toilet paper. Finally, stewards spent time during their last work days keeping members informed. This often involved attending meetings to get or relay important information, and 28 percent of respondents reported attending at least one steward-related meeting during their last work day.</p>
<p>The responsibilities and skills respondents identified as most important for their steward work corresponded with their most frequent activities. For instance, given the amount of time and effort stewards invested in dealing with grievances and other problems, it is not surprising that 65 percent saw their main responsibility as advocating for workers, making sure their rights were understood and enforced. Relatedly, stewards were committed to keeping members informed, with over a quarter (27 percent) identifying this as one of their most important responsibilities. In their last day of work, some stewards posted or passed out information, and others spoke with members about union matters or personally filled them in on information they had missed. In addition to providing general information in these ways, stewards frequently found themselves answering individual members’ questions and/or offering advice during, and sometimes after, their last work days. Advocating for and informing members required that stewards themselves were informed, particularly in relation to having a solid understanding of the contract and relevant policies and procedures. When asked about the most important skills for a steward, a large proportion (over 38 percent) of the stewards collectively, and of each race-gender subgroup, identified communication as most important, followed closely by being able to work with people—specifically, workers and/or managers.</p>
<p>Stewards’ descriptions of their last work days were consistent with their responses about their most important steward responsibilities, skills, and knowledge. Their responses to all of these questions, and others, emphasized the importance of handling grievances, keeping members informed, and being able to effectively communicate with members and management. These responses were fairly consistent across the various gender-race subgroups.</p>

<title>Discrimination and Emotional Labor</title>
<p>Some stewards reported that they were treated differently by company representatives, union members, and/or others throughout the course of their daily steward activities based on factors such as gender and race. Not surprisingly, stewards of color (24 percent collectively, 30 percent of black stewards, and 17 percent of Latina/o stewards) were more likely than white stewards (6 percent) to report differential treatment based on race. And women (27 percent) were much more likely than men (5 percent) to report differential treatment based on gender. Black women (20 percent) were less likely than white women (35 percent) to perceive discrimination based on gender; they were also less likely (27 percent) than black men (33 percent) to perceive discrimination based on race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160449X12453771">4</xref></sup> However, the conflated and compounded character of their experience of discrimination comes to light when we look at these categories in combination: women of color were the only respondents who reported notable rates of gender <italic>and</italic> race discrimination.</p>
<p>Stewards then described <italic>how</italic> they were treated differently. The most extreme cases of differential treatment involved withholding promotions based on race or overt sexual harassment. More often, stewards said they were not taken seriously, assumed incompetent, made to feel that they did not fit in, or assumed to embody certain stereotypes. The quotes below, representing many such responses, give a sense of how differential treatment imbued some stewards’ daily experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of times [men] don’t appreciate opinions or suggestions from a female as strongly . . . as they would from a male counterpart. . . . I have felt that some of the issues I’ve put before [the committee] weren’t looked at as realistic [unlike] some of the issues that were put to them from the . . . male counterparts. . . . For instance . . . I raised an issue about the chairs and a male counterpart raised an issue about their raingear. . . . Both of them are health related, safety related. . . . I had a question about the chairs that [are] causing us to have health problems, as far as our backs and necks and all that. And I don’t think . . . that it was treated as seriously as it was with the problem of the raingear. . . . They got all brand new raingear within a matter of months. . . . My issue was not looked into in a serious manner. (Dana, black, IBEW)</p>
<p>When I first got involved . . . I was always what you might call “on display.” No matter where I went I was always the only Black guy . . . I was always mentioned. . . . Everybody always [knew] Terry was at the meeting, Terry was this, Terry was that. I looked around and said, “My God, I don’t see too [much] black participation. I don’t want to be used as window dressing. . . . But I guess you have to start somewhere.” Maybe with me some more will come. (Terry, black, UFCW)</p>
<p>I think because I’m relatively young and single, there’s some ways that I get treated differently. . . . Because of my age . . . a lot of men are more open to . . . talk to me . . . because they like to talk to young women. And I would also say though that it works against me, because that’s seen. Sometimes in as much as I’ve been effective . . . people will say, “Well, why? Because he likes her,” or things like that. (Carol, white, IBEW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This last quote illustrates how stewards could see differential treatment as working for them, against them, or both. While one white man said his differential treatment involved being “treated better,” it was mostly a few women stewards who mentioned receiving special treatment, which each attributed to gender. For instance, Joyce, a white CWA steward, explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think in most of my meetings with male management, I’m treated a little differently in a positive way . . . because I’m a woman. . . . If I walk into a meeting with another male steward . . . they’re all gruff and grumble and can hardly say hello to each other. And if I walk in, I might see a smile crack and a hand extended to shake my hand. They just seem to be more relaxed with me. . . . I think . . . they’re used to seeing so many men around that when they see a female it’s like a breath of fresh air. I think it’s an advantage. And like it or not, most of the management in my company is still male.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Joyce intimates, the special treatment she received from men in her workplace stemmed from her token status. In other words, the “gendered nature” of the organization included a management force comprised almost entirely of men, a situation from which this individual woman could benefit by virtue of standing out as unique, special, or “a breath of fresh air” (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160449X12453771">Acker 1990</xref>, 139, 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160449X12453771">Martin 2003</xref>). And as Carol suggested in the quote above, “special” treatment didn’t necessarily flow forth as a result of being a woman per se, but of being a woman who is young and attractive to men—factors that could simultaneously lighten the interactions a woman had with men colleagues and discredit her. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray’s (2001</xref>, 120) analysis suggests that the discrediting element of women leaders’ “special” status follows them up the leadership ladder: “Many women who make it to the top positions in labor unions report being accused of ‘sleeping with’ the boss to get ahead, a charge never made about men.”</p>
<p>Despite noted exceptions, the majority (83 percent) of respondents who reported differential treatment saw this as a problematic aspect of their experience as stewards. For most of these stewards, differential treatment was a pervasive feature of their daily steward work rather than an intense isolated incident. Stewards had a variety of methods for dealing with this perceived discrimination. Most commonly, they either directly confronted the person/people treating them differently (27 percent) or ignored instances of differential treatment (13 percent). Other strategies included seeking solidarity (for moral and practical support) with others who experienced similar treatment; establishing good relations with management, so management would side with the victim when complaints of discrimination emerged; and/or developing strategies for addressing their issues “quietly” to avoid having their causes identified with and tainted by their particular race and gender statuses—a tactic that contributed to many stewards’ “background” style of leadership, as discussed below. Stewards also frequently reported working harder to demonstrate their competence, a strategy that is regularly observed or recommended in response to discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X12453771">Carli and Eagly 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160449X12453771">Yoder 2001</xref>). Indeed, when offering advice to union women seeking high-level positions, Sandra Feldman, then-president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, “Be better than anyone”; and Gloria Johnson, then–national president of Coalition of Labor Union Women, passed on words of wisdom from her African American father: “You can’t be just as good; you have to be better” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray 2001</xref>, 126). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X12453771">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and van Engen (2003)</xref> see this by-product of the glass ceiling as one potential explanation for why women tend to display effective leadership skills at higher rates than men: only the best women (and, presumably, men of color) are able to achieve and maintain leadership positions, whereas white men may be able to get by as leaders with less effective styles and skillsets. While identifying exceptional competency as an effective strategy for women leaders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160449X12453771">Yoder (2001</xref>, 820) simultaneously identifies this as “an unfair requirement” that puts the onus of responding to discrimination on the targeted individual’s ability and willingness to do more and be better than her more privileged peers.</p>
<p>Regardless of their particular strategy for responding to differential treatment, doing so added another layer of practical and/or emotional labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X12453771">Hochschild 1983/2003</xref>) to some stewards’ days. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160449X12453771">Franzway (2000)</xref> identifies unions as “greedy institutions” requiring high levels of practical and emotional labor from leaders, and among our sample these requirements were heightened for white women and people of color, who routinely had to navigate sexism and/or racism (sometimes in combination with heterosexism, ageism, and other factors) as they attempted to carry out their duties and establish themselves as competent leaders. In fact, in the course of responding to open-ended questions, some respondents cited gender and race discrimination as a major hindrance they had faced as stewards. They also identified discrimination as something that had made them feel incapable as leaders. Thus, discrimination may be at least partly to blame for the fact that women stewards (74 percent) were much more likely than men stewards (56 percent) to report that they had been made to feel incapable of leadership—and that women of color (80 percent) were especially likely to say they had been made to feel incapable.</p>

<title>Stewards’ Perceptions of Their Own Leadership</title>
<p>When asked whether they always, sometimes, or never thought of themselves as leaders, only 17 percent of the women replied that they always thought of themselves as leaders, while over double the proportion of men—37 percent—gave this response. Conversely, nearly 17 percent of the women, but less than 5 percent of the men, said they never thought of themselves as leaders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X12453771">Eagly and Johannesen-Schmidt (2001)</xref> point out that common conceptions of effective leadership, associated with agentic attributes such as assertiveness and confidence, coincide with normative conceptions of masculinity but conflict with normative conceptions of femininity. The perceived incongruity between femininity and leadership can lead to discrimination toward women leaders in a number of ways: women may be dismissed as potential leaders because of their supposed unsuitability for such roles, and women who are leaders may be evaluated less favorably than men because women’s agentic leadership behaviors tend to elicit negative responses from others. This may shed light on why the women in our study were so much less likely than the men to think of themselves as leaders. First, through their routine accomplishment of femininity, these stewards likely behaved in ways contradictory to common conceptions of “leadership” behavior. Second, they picked up on others’ negative evaluations of them—in response to their enactment of untraditional leadership styles that are less likely to conflict with normative femininity, or their enactment of agentic behaviors deemed suitable for leaders, but not for women—further undermining their self-confidence as leaders.</p>
<p>When stewards described themselves as leaders there were several areas of overlap in their responses, although women and men tended to offer somewhat different descriptions of themselves as leaders, as did white stewards compared to stewards of color. For instance, 13 percent of women stewards described themselves as helpful, but only one man steward framed his leadership style in this way. Also, a number of women stewards but none of the men pointed out their emotional connections to and care for their constituents. In fact, one white man made it a point to say, “I’m not irrational. I don’t get emotionally involved in the things I deal with. I keep cool” (Jim, IBT). In contrast, and like a number of other women, Sylvia, a Latina UAW steward, said, “I’m very people oriented. . . . Your emotions . . . how you feel, those things are [as] important to me as how you’re gonna produce. . . . Those are the things that I want to get to first. Because usually those are the underlying things to whatever . . . problem I have to deal with.” Both of these tendencies may help these women to be effective leaders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X12453771">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and van Engen (2003)</xref> found “helpfulness,” or fostering others’ potential, providing encouragement, and so forth are associated with transformational leadership, a style that is both highly effective and consistent with normative conceptions of appropriate behavior for women. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160449X12453771">McCauley (2004)</xref> identifies being in touch with one’s emotions as one of the characteristics of successful leaders.</p>
<p>With the exception of one man of color, women of color and white women were also the only stewards to say that they tried to avoid the limelight of leadership; 11 percent of women stewards volunteered that they preferred to stay in the background or avoid overt displays of leadership: “My way [of] leading is really to be in the background. So . . . I wouldn’t really be recognized as the leader per se, but I would be able to get things done in my fashion. In other words, I really don’t want people to know that I [am] in full control. I kinda like to let them think . . . it’s their idea” (Barbara, white, AFGE).</p>
<p>While not shying away from visible leadership, a larger group—17 percent of women <italic>and</italic> men stewards—relayed that they took a more democratic, compromising (rather than forceful or aggressive) approach to leadership: “[My leadership style] wouldn’t be dominant. To me, leadership isn’t a military command type leadership. I’m more for the consensus type leadership. And . . . developing participation and . . . support from all the individuals. I’m not interested in really leading through force” (Al, white, CWA). While this type of response was common among all groups of stewards, white stewards were especially likely to offer it (they provided eleven of the sixteen such responses) and white <italic>men</italic> (27 percent) in particular characterized their leadership style as democratic. However, only men stewards suggested that these traits might be weaknesses rather than strengths, as this white UAW steward’s response suggests: “I’m a little bit too easygoing. That’s a negative, I’d say” (Larry). The only man of color to describe his leadership this way framed it as a possible weaknesses, referring to himself as “democratic” and elaborating that he “may sometimes not be as forceful as [he] should be” (Ben, black, AFGE).</p>
<p>Fourteen percent of white stewards (but only one steward of color) said they led by example, although Todd, an IBEW steward, was one of the few who elaborated on what he meant by this: “[I’m a leader] by example more than any other way. . . . By trying to do the best job I can with my skills. Just trying to set the example that the work is there . . . explain what has to be done, and more or less just expect that the people who are qualified to do the work are gonna do the work.” Notably, a similar proportion of stewards of color (18 percent), and one white woman, described themselves in a way that contrasted with this hands-off, lead-by-example approach; several of the stewards of color said that they were particularly strong-willed, strong-minded, and/or opinionated. Moreover, whereas the former (white) group of stewards tended to talk about bringing together the varying viewpoints and positions of their constituents, the latter (nonwhite) group tended to describe themselves as unwilling to back down from their own positions and opinions, as is evident in Mary’s and Eric’s self-descriptions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a takeover type of personality. If I see something that is wrong or could be done some other way, I’ll just take the initiative and go do it. And I’m quick to point out other people’s faults. (Mary, black, AFGE)</p>
<p>I’m very firm. Assertive. I’m not afraid to express . . . my views. (Eric, Asian American, UFCW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These stewards proudly claimed to be strong-willed, and none indicated that these traits were anything but positive in the context of leadership.</p>
<p>Along with helpful, democratic, and strong-willed, one of the most frequently offered descriptors was motivating. Almost all of the stewards who said that they motivated others were men (17 percent of men and 3 percent of women stewards described themselves this way). Several stewards explained that they had a special ability to organize workers and encourage them to take action, as is evident in Adam’s self-description: “I’m usually a morale-booster. . . . I try to show them that I’m for them. [We’re] all going for one goal, whatever that might be, whatever situation comes up” (white, IBEW).</p>
<p>Thus, we see several variations in how stewards describe themselves as leaders. Women in each race category seemed to view their leadership as a service to others, emphasizing their care for these constituents. They were more likely to say they wished to offer their service from the background, without drawing attention to their leadership role. Men did not seem to share this concern about avoiding the limelight of leadership; in fact, many described themselves asserting their leadership directly as motivators. Women and white men alike often described themselves as “democratic,” although men alone were conflicted about whether this was a positive trait. It would seem, then, that women and men enact and/or describe their leadership in ways that are consistent with normative conceptions of appropriate attitudes and activities for members of their sex category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160449X12453771">West and Zimmerman 1987</xref>), with women framing their leadership in terms of helpfulness and care and men framing theirs in terms that emphasize assertiveness and devalue less assertive leadership. Women of color reported a unique combination of these styles, with many saying they took a “background approach” to leadership and emphasizing characteristics such as “caring,” “helpful,” and “democratic” as well as a need to be assertive in order to see results. This underscores their need to navigate leadership in a way that is viewed as appropriate for members of their sex category while at the same time “doing leadership” effectively in a context that routinely discounts the leadership credibility of “people like them” on the basis of race as well as gender. More generally, it reminds us that all stewards were simultaneously negotiating race and gender—in addition to many other social statuses—as they managed their steward responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160449X12453771">West and Fenstermaker 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>While the women’s leadership styles allowed them to simultaneously enact leadership and conform to standards of femininity, their tendency to lead from the background without calling attention to their efforts and achievements may have served as an obstacle to advancing to higher-level leadership positions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray (2001</xref>, 127) advises, “To get ahead, it is important to be visible. This often means taking risks.” Many of the women in our study were not comfortable taking these risks, and even viewed visibility as a hindrance to effectively getting the job done, fearing ideas directly acknowledged as coming from a woman would not be implemented.</p>
<p>Gender and race interact to produce somewhat different responses within, as well as between, groups of women and men stewards. For instance, white men were by far the most likely group of stewards to describe an easygoing, hands-off, and/or democratic leadership approach. Elements of this leadership style are considered highly effective by leadership scholars. For instance, role-modeling is an important aspect of transformational leadership, an effective leadership style when enacted by women or men. But the “hands-off” approach some white men described could verge on laissez-faire leadership, a particularly <italic>ineffective</italic> leadership style more commonly displayed by men than women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X12453771">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and van Engen (2003)</xref> suggest this is because men’s privilege allows some to advance as leaders despite poor leadership skills. We would add that white men, in particular, may benefit from gender and race privilege as they achieve and maintain leadership positions in spite of laissez-faire tendencies.</p>
<p>In contrast, stewards of color were more likely to describe their leadership styles as strong, direct, and uncompromising. Above, we noted that stewards of color and white women often perceived that they were treated as incompetent and/or not taken seriously as a result of racial and/or gender prejudice. Given this aspect of their daily experience, it may not be surprising that some of these stewards would find it necessary to strongly assert their leadership authority in order to achieve results.</p>

<title>Improving the Experiences and Increasing the Representation of White Women and People of Color in Union Leadership</title>
<p>When asked what they would have liked to have known when they started, many stewards took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the position. Men, in particular (but some women as well), frequently recalled how they had been taken aback by the poor attitudes, dependency, and apathy of their constituents; nearly a quarter of them (23 percent) brought this up without prompting. The stewards also often described difficulties with management (17 percent). Many wished they had known how to deal with management when they started. Some noted the need to know how to navigate management’s manipulations or win their struggles with management, portraying a negative relationship between the union and management. Others simply wished they had felt more confident in approaching management. This response was almost exclusively offered by white women, and white women were also most likely to cite lack of confidence as their major initial hindrance. Not surprisingly, then, white women were also much more likely than others to say they wished they had had more self-confidence or courage, or had been able to offer themselves encouragement, when they first started, providing two-thirds of such responses. This corresponds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray’s (2001)</xref> finding that women union leaders identified lack of self-confidence as a major roadblock to achieving upper-echelon leadership positions, but adds another layer by recognizing this predominantly as a white women’s problem. Women of color—along with their men counterparts—also frequently pointed out problems with management as a hindrance, but they framed the sources of these problems as external rather than an internal confidence issue: managers refused to cooperate, were antagonistic, or actively discriminated, according to these stewards. Women and men of color were also more likely to experience these difficulties in their interactions with constituents.</p>
<p>Other stewards wished they had known things that would have helped them get their jobs done more effectively. For instance, 10 percent of the stewards said they would have liked to have known more about the contract and/or specific policies and procedures. Not having this knowledge was a major hindrance to some stewards when they started. In fact, stewards, especially white stewards, most frequently (26 percent) cited increased knowledge and training as factors that could make them more effective. The stewards who were specific about the kind of knowledge/training they wanted identified, among other things, knowledge of grievance processes, the law, negotiations/bargaining, and, most of all, the contract. Some respondents said they had been unclear about what they were supposed to be doing when they became stewards. These stewards, all but one of whom was a person of color, wished they had known what their roles and responsibilities were from the start.</p>
<p>Another difficulty that commonly took stewards, especially men stewards, by surprise when they started was the level of time and involvement they had to invest in fulfilling their responsibilities. Aside from knowledge/training, stewards mentioned time more frequently (20 percent) than any other factor as something that could make them more effective. The quotes below illustrate how some of the stewards envisioned using this extra time to more effectively carry out their duties:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d like to have a lot more time to . . . be with the grievant to make his grievance clearer to him, and show him . . . where I’d done my research. (Lynn, white, IBEW)</p>
<p>I just wish they could negotiate something in the contract where we’d have more time to do our research and to type up the necessary correspondence that goes along with filing complaints or requesting to meet with management. ’Cause we’re not supposed to do it on company time. (Veronica, black, CWA)</p>
<p>I’d like to have a little bit more time . . . to be able to walk freely through the shop and . . . see what the needs of some of the guys are. I mean . . . you can wait until an individual is feeling rotten enough where they’ll come talk to you, but I’d rather be in a position where I could wander around a little bit more and find out what’s really going down with some of these guys before they get in a real panic situation. (Paul, white, IAM)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During their last work day, stewards reported spending an average of 0.84 hours during, and 0.54 hours outside of, their regular working hours doing steward work. Many stewards indicated they would be willing to take on even more union responsibilities if they had the time.</p>
<p>When offering advice to their former selves, stewards emphasized the negative, things to beware of. But these responses, in combination with others throughout their interviews, produced useful ideas for how to improve stewards’ experiences of leadership. Three factors emerged time and again throughout the interviews as crucial in determining the character and quality of union stewardship for any given individual: stewards generally agreed on the need for time, high levels of training, and a skillset for mediating relations between workers and management. Stewards’ responses reveal that initial training about basic responsibilities and expectations may foster the success of new stewards of color in particular, and that training on how to confidently communicate with management may be especially crucial to white women stewards’ experiences. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160449X12453771">Yoder (2001)</xref> points out the importance of legitimizing women—and, we would add, men of color—leaders by making sure their qualifications and skills are openly acknowledged by superiors. This legitimization could in itself boost women’s confidence; perhaps more importantly, it could encourage their followers to view and address them as competent leaders, leading to sustained reinforcement of their legitimacy as leaders.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>In their Center for Economic and Policy Research report on <italic>The Changing Face of Labor</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160449X12453771">Schmitt and Warner (2009</xref>, 22) conclude by noting, “In the next decade, the rise of women to majority status in the labor movement and the likely continued influx of racial and ethnic minorities into unions are likely to be among the most important developments for organized labor.” The trajectory and tenor of these “important developments” depend largely on whether unions respond to their diversified membership with a diversified leadership. Gender and race parity among union stewards is the first step toward this diversified leadership: high-level union positions are rarely to never achieved by individuals who have not first gained this lower-level union leadership experience. The experiences of the union stewards in this study provide insight into how gender and race shape leadership experiences at this important level as well as data for considering why the low-level union leaders of the 1980s did not advance to higher-level positions in equal rates with respect to race and sex category.</p>
<p>Recognizing that unions need leaders who are women and/or people of color to drive the organizing momentum among, and effectively represent the needs and interests of, these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X12453771">Bronfenbrenner 2005</xref>), some union scholars have turned their attention to the barriers hampering the development of a union leadership that accurately reflects the racial and gender diversity of unions’ rank-and-file membership (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X12453771">Gray 1993</xref>). In this article, we have extended this line of investigation to consider the experiences of those individuals—women, men, blacks, Latina/os, whites, Asian Americans, and Native Americans—who have already achieved an entry-level union leadership position, asking how race and gender interact in the everyday experiences of union stewards.</p>
<p>We found overall consistency in the “nuts and bolts” of stewards’ work: stewards’ daily duties, and what they needed in order to fulfill these duties, did not radically vary by race and sex category. But gender and race did interact in significant ways, leading stewards to experience these daily duties differently. For instance, women stewards’ emphasis on their care for their constituents often led them to deal with problems that fell outside the normal boundaries of steward work. In addition, white women and stewards of color described having their authority undermined as others refused to regard them as competent leaders. Such racism and sexism added an extra layer of emotional labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X12453771">Hochschild 1983/2003</xref>) to some stewards’ already intense, emotionally charged work as they sought to blow these acts off as not really affecting them, or to remain professional, courteous, and helpful to their offenders while seething inside. It could also make their work difficult on a more practical level by hampering their efforts to promote their agendas or affect change. In these cases, stewards had to fight harder to have their opinions considered or find “quieter” methods to push through changes without calling attention to their involvement. The specific character of given incidences of bias varied by individual, but also by race and gender, as we can see in the tendency for women of color and white women stewards to sometimes be treated as “special” due to the perceived nonthreatening nature of their particular token status, while men of color were more likely to be greeted with aversion or hostility.</p>
<p>Our interviews with union stewards demonstrate that race and gender do indeed matter in the everyday experiences of these union leaders, even once barriers to achieving a low-level leadership position have been surmounted. Although all the stewards had the same basic responsibilities, gender and race nevertheless interacted to shape their experiences as leaders. The resulting differences in stewards’ experiences of leadership were problematic when they worked to create situations in which white men alone were privileged as the “natural,” expected union leaders in their workplaces, allowing them to take a laidback but direct and visible approach to leadership without undermining their authority or calling into question their competence. Conversely, their counterparts who were women and/or people of color often had to work harder to establish themselves as legitimate leaders and found it necessary to navigate leadership styles that responded to their particular raced and gendered positions in the union/workplace. Thus, not only did leaders who were women and/or people of color often engage in additional work to circumvent the effects of sexism and racism, they also found it necessary to approach leadership in qualitatively different ways as a result of these factors. Some of their strategies for doing this allowed them to effectively advocate for their constituents while simultaneously hindering their own chances of advancing up the leadership ladder. For instance, letting others take credit for a steward’s ideas may remove the “stain” of association with a woman and/or person of color, thereby increasing the likelihood of implementation; at the same time, such tactics render the steward’s leadership invisible, reducing her or his chances of being promoted to higher-level leadership positions when the opportunity arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X12453771">Gray 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is highly conceivable that the extra burdens white women and people of color face in these low-level positions could deter them from pursuing more demanding levels of leadership. Moreover, the fact that white women and people of color confront frequent resistance to their establishment as legitimate, effective leaders at the steward level suggests that—in addition to potentially making future leadership less desirable—sexism and racism could negatively affect their chances of achieving, and success in, the higher-level positions they do pursue. Relational perspectives on leadership emphasize that effective leadership depends on appropriate enactment of the leader-follower relationship by parties on either end of this relationship; in order to be successful, leaders need followers to acknowledge their authority and competency and act accordingly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X12453771">Uhl-Bien, Maslyn, and Ospina 2012</xref>). Social constructionists add that these parties bring to the leader-follower relationship taken-for-granted social understandings—understandings that often rest upon stereotypes about women and people of color that associate “people like them” with characteristics seen as incongruent with effective leadership (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X12453771">Carli and Eagly 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X12453771">Uhl-Bien, Maslyn, and Ospina 2012</xref>). As low-level leaders, stewards who are women and/or people of color face being evaluated in light of these stereotypes by their constituents as well as those above them in the leadership ranks. This may be one reason why so few women, and possibly men of color, from this cohort of stewards advanced to the upper echelons of union leadership in the ensuing decades.</p>
<p>Our findings could be useful to those advocating for increased representation of white women and people of color in union leadership, as they suggest that interventions directed at gender and race justice are necessary even after members of these groups achieve lower-level leadership positions. These interventions must be enacted at an organizational level, as our findings show that individual strategies for navigating leadership responsibilities in the midst of discrimination—in addition to unfairly putting the onus of responsibility on the target of the discrimination—may allow the leader to achieve the union’s goals through extra work and exceptional competence without receiving the recognition necessary to advance. Several specific examples of possible interventions emerged in our interviews, including additional and/or more effective trainings on steward responsibilities, workshops to build self-confidence, supervisors’ direct legitimization of minority leaders to validate their competence and reinforce their authority, and policies to effectively and immediately respond to instances of discriminatory treatment. We are confident that further study of this issue would yield additional proposals to foster positive leadership experiences among stewards of all races and sex categories. Without such interventions, the problematic aspects of white women’s and stewards of color’s experiences of leadership could affect whether they want and are able to obtain higher-level union positions that carry the power to make broader changes in union platforms, policies, and procedures. In other words, if unions want to have white women and people of color physically represented among their leadership ranks at all levels and, perhaps more importantly, if they want to take advantage of the experiences, perspectives, and passions these new leaders bring to the table, they must pay attention to the experiences of those who have already navigated union leadership.</p>
<p>This study addresses an important gap in the literature by addressing gender <italic>and</italic> race in relation to union leadership by considering the experiences of a diverse group of individuals who had achieved low-level leadership positions. Our findings show some of the ways race and gender interact to shape leadership strategies and experiences, and these interviews with stewards in the 1980s may also help explain why members of some of these race-gender groups filtered into higher-level position in the period following the study at much higher rates than others. Analyses of today’s stewards are needed to see how the experience of leadership has changed, or not, for entry-level union leaders and to get a glimpse of prospects for gender and race parity among tomorrow’s high-level leaders. We hope that future studies will also extend beyond a gender and race framework to consider other factors—including individual-level factors, such as sexuality; and structural factors, such as the specific union and workplace contexts in which leadership takes place—that may play an important part in shaping experiences and outcomes of leadership.</p>

<p>Given that unions controlled the data, Roby was only able to randomly sample stewards from a minority of unions. For other unions, a union staff member sampled stewards based on the purposive criteria of race, gender, years in union, and years as stewards that Roby gave her or him. Roby conducted over half of the interviews; Marcy Howe, Lynet Uttal, and Mike Webber, sociology students with union experience, conducted the remainder. Each of the interviewers was trained in how to interview, record summaries of interviewees’ responses on the interview schedule, and tape-record the interviews. The ten unions were the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), The Communication Workers of America (CWA), the Hotel Employees, Restaurant Employees Union (HERE), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM—The Machinists), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT—The Teamsters), the International Ladies Garment Worker’s Union (ILGWU), the Service Employees Industrial Union (SEIU), the United Automobile Workers (UAW), and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).</p>

<p>While we refer to the specific race categories of the individuals we reference throughout our findings, when analyzing patterns in our data we sometimes merely distinguish between white stewards and stewards of color. This aided our analysis by allowing us to focus on the comparisons and contrasts between respondents who belonged to a race category (white) common among union leaders and those who belonged to race categories (black, Latina/o, Asian American, Native American) much less commonly represented. When we do present findings according to the specific race categories of stewards of color, we focus solely on the black and Latina/o subgroups, as we did not have enough Asian Americans or Native Americans in our sample to present collective results for them.</p>
