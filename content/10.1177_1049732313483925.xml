<abstract>
<p>A thorough understanding of the environmental and structural factors that precipitate unsafe sexual practices is necessary for HIV/AIDS-prevention research among high-risk population groups like commercial sex workers. I examined how poverty contextualizes sexual health behavior, including condom compliance among commercial female sex workers in a red light district in Calcutta, India. For my research I did an ethnographic study and conducted in-depth interviews of 37 commercial female sex workers. I found that poverty, instead of serving as a catalyst for poor health choices among sex workers, acted as an impetus for pursuing safe sex practices and remaining healthy. The results indicate that sex work, poverty, and health do not always have a paradoxical relationship.</p>

<p>Since the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, researchers conducting many intervention implementation studies tend to focus on an individualistic paradigm while examining high-risk sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>). HIV risk behavior is conceived to be the result of either poor information or illogical choices with regard to health, and is often attributed to individual characteristics of their target audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana, Basu, Rotheram-Borus, &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>). Many HIV/AIDS prevention and intervention models are formulated on theories centered on the individual. Such models repudiate the impact of contextual factors in HIV/AIDS transmission and typically obscure the critical role played by sociocultural and economic issues in determining health choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313483925">Seidel, 1993</xref>; Wojcicki, &amp; Malala).</p>
<p>It is often found that an increase in awareness on the part of the audience does not always precipitate desired results like implementation and maintenance of positive health behavior. This is especially true in HIV/AIDS intervention programs among high-risk populations like commercial sex workers, among whom the lack of correlation between sexual knowledge and sexual behavior has been noted repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313483925">Abdool Karim, Abdool Karim, &amp; Nkomokazi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313483925">Campbell, Mzaidume, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313483925">Schoepf, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313483925">Varga, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313483925">Wilson, Sibanda, Mboyi, &amp; Msimanga, 1990</xref>). Exclusion of the contextual elements that shape the lives of the sex workers can result in the absence of involvement of the sex workers in the realm of campaign development and implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313483925">Seidel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki, &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Sex workers are traditionally treated as target audiences and passive recipients of information in HIV/AIDS behavior-change interventions centered on an individualistic paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313483925">2009</xref>). Consequently,<disp-quote>
<p>recent public health calls highlight the need to move beyond a sole focus on individual-level risk to an understanding of risk as negotiated interactions, embedded in contextual factors, gendered power dynamics, and access to resources. As such, a conceptual shift from individual-focused HIV prevention, such as behavior change communication, to environmental–structural HIV prevention emerged in the 1990s, particularly among female sex workers and their male clients. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313483925">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>, p. 659)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A thorough understanding of the environmental and structural factors that affect sexual health behavior is necessary for HIV/AIDS prevention research and an effective formulation of intervention programs. The ability of sex workers to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is often conditioned by contextual factors like economic deprivation, violence, discrimination, criminalization, and legal persecution. I have drawn on the implications of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313483925">Connell’s (1987)</xref> integrative theory of gender and power to elaborate on one of the structural factors contextualizing sexual health behavior among commercial sex workers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313483925">Connell (1987)</xref> identified three major structures that shape gendered relationships: the sexual division of labor, the sexual division of power, and the structure of cathexis. The sexual division of labor and the sexual division of power emphasized the characteristics of economic inequities and power differentials between the two sexes, whereas the structure of cathexis was intended to address the affective component of relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313483925">Wingood and DiClemente (2000)</xref> noted, “From a public health and psychological perspective, it is these gender-based inequities and disparities in expectations that generate the exposures, or acquired risks, and the risk factors that adversely influence women’s health. Connell’s seminal work on gender and power has direct relevance for understanding issues with regard to women’s health” (p. 541).</p>
<p>The sexual division of labor produces economic inequities that increase socioeconomic risk factors for women for poor health practices and enhance adverse health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313483925">Wingood &amp; DiClemente, 2000</xref>). The power differentials precipitated by the sexual division of labor are exacerbated by economic inequities and increase the behavioral risk factors for poorer health outcomes. Conventional social norms and affective attachments reinforce traditional gender stereotypes and acceptable notions on female sexuality, and often limit a woman’s agency toward attaining positive sexual health. For a commercial female sex worker the social taboo against female sexuality can effectively marginalize and disempower her on account of her choice of profession and limit her means. Financial deprivation can additionally increase the sex worker’s behavioral risk factors for unsafe sexual practices for the sake of monetary gain.</p>
<p>Poverty thus remains one of the primary causes of precipitating behavioral risk factors that increase adverse health outcomes. Poverty is identified as one of the structural barriers for attainment of positive health practices like condom compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa &amp; Obregon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu (2008)</xref> observed,<disp-quote>
<p>Poverty causes poor health, it necessitates an urgency to work to counter poverty and be healthy. Poverty also leads to unsafe sex at work, undermining the very logic of being able to work and be healthy. Very importantly it points to a local rationalization that articulates a provision of financial structures as primary to one’s health and HIV/AIDS practices. Poverty as a structural barrier thus exists in a dialectical tension or rather in a cyclical interconnect with sex work. It is also situated in and continues to perpetuate a culture about being poor, the need to cope with poverty, and the necessity of continually being engaged in work to resist poverty so as to ultimately provide for one’s health and children. (p. 248)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Financial deprivation and lack of access to equitable resources exacerbate unsafe sex practices and enhance the risk of infection transmission. The sex workers can follow unsafe sex practices such as sex without condoms for the sake of greater monetary compensation from clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313483925">Sobo, 1993</xref>). In her struggle to sustain her family and dependents the sex worker might find it a rational economic strategy to risk infection for the sake of greater payment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>). Poverty also negatively affects condom negotiation with clients who might insist on forfeiting protection measures for the sake of pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313483925">Amaro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313483925">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>; Wojcicki &amp; Malala). Insisting on condom compliance can result in losing clients, which in turn might cause starvation for the sex worker and her family.</p>
<p>The incentive to adhere to safe sex practices thus diminishes significantly in the face of realities like extreme poverty. Social ostracization and stigmatization on account of women’s choice of profession is common among commercial sex workers. Such stigmatization can cause depression and mental health morbidity that can significantly constrain motivation on the part of sex workers to stay healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313483925">Cornish, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>). Poverty can intertwine with stigma to form a structural barrier toward establishing positive health practices and limiting access to health care resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313483925">Wingood and DiClemente (2000)</xref> observed that pressing financial needs, gendered power inequities, and stigmatization can also lower women’s self-efficacy to negotiate and adhere to condom use.</p>
<p>Thus, a better understanding of the sociocultural and economic factors such as poverty that precipitate unsafe sexual practices is necessary for HIV/AIDS prevention research and an effective formulation of intervention programs targeted toward high-risk and marginalized groups such as commercial sex workers. In this study I explored how a structural barrier to health (such as poverty) can influence sexual health practices of commercial sex workers in a red light district of Calcutta, India. A red light district is a specifically demarcated area comprising neighborhoods where sex workers solicit clients and the commercial sale of sex takes place in residences owned or rented by the sex workers. The red light district in Calcutta is the site of the Sonagachi Project, which is a peer, outreach-based and community-oriented HIV/AIDS intervention initiative undertaken among commercial sex workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">Basu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313483925">Basu &amp; Dutta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313483925">Jana &amp; Banerjee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>). A brief description of the Sonagachi Project follows.</p>
<p>With a population of more than 50,000 sex workers, Sonagachi is the largest red light district of South and South-East Asia. The Sonagachi Project started in 1991 to ascertain and arrest the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS among sex workers in and around the Sonagachi district in Calcutta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>). The Project was initially funded by a national health care research institute and later by the state-based West Bengal AIDS Prevention Council (Jana et al.). The Project was initiated by a group that comprised a local physician and social service professionals of Calcutta. From 1995 onward, the Project was spearheaded by the sex workers themselves, who acted as peer outreach workers (Jana et al.).</p>
<p>Mobilization of sex workers as peer educators who disseminated information and awareness among colleagues was the initial activity of the Project. Gradually the Project evolved to promote work on community development and intervention at different levels, to handle crises and environmental barriers faced by the sex workers. The philosophy of the Project is encapsulated in “Three ‘R’s: Respect, Recognition and Reliance. That is respect and recognition for sex workers and their profession, and their rights, and reliance on their understanding and capability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313483925">Jana &amp; Banerjee, 1999</xref>, p. 11). The original aim of the Project was to disseminate awareness information about STDs and HIV/AIDS among sex workers, and arrest the infection incidence among the latter population.</p>
<p>Statistics from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313483925">UNAIDS Global Reference Group on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights 2003</xref>) and the National AIDS Control Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313483925">NACO, 2009</xref>) of India show a significant reduction in the incidence of HIV infection and a significant increase in condom usage in Sonagachi after the Project was implemented. In addition to the targeted goals, the Project achieved outcomes like unionization of the sex workers and establishing micro credit societies and vocational training centers for the sex workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313483925">Jana &amp; Banerjee, 1999</xref>). The union of the sex workers is called Durbar Mahila Samanway Committee (DMSC), which has offices in the heart of Sonagachi itself. The DMSC comprises central and branch management committees selected through elections conducted every 2 years. The Sonagachi Project continues in Calcutta as a peer-outreach and participation-based program, under the guidance of the sex workers.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732313483925" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>I used ethnographic research extensively for this research, in conjunction with other conventional research methods like semistructured interviews and participant observation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313483925">Evans and Lambert (2008)</xref> argued that ethnographic research can delineate the dynamics of context, agency, power, and participation that are specific to a program. Ethnographic research can also examine the complexities of intervention implementation in ways that might not be possible with conventional techniques of project reporting.</p>
<p>Observation of actual intervention practices through ethnographic research can reveal insights that are difficult to articulate, and can emphasize “important points of convergence from intervention theory or planning documents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313483925">Evans &amp; Lambert, 2008</xref>, p. 467). Ethnography of communication is a political tool for listening to the voices of the marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313483925">Madison, 2005</xref>). The suggested methodology thus situates the possibility of discerning and documenting subaltern voices in the realm of structural linkages between colonialism and knowledge, thereby delineating subaltern communication processes and their transformative potentials.</p>
<p>The period of data collection for my research was between December 2010 and January 2011. Prior to the formal data-gathering phase, I spent 2 months in Sonagachi during October and November of 2009, interacting with the sex workers. This was done to establish an amicable working relationship with the sex workers. Between 2009 and 2011, I stayed in touch with the members of the sex workers’ union over email and telephone. Project documentation including research articles, internal project reports, unpublished manuscripts provided by DMSC members, and best-practice synopses that were published by DMSC. These reports provided data on the rates of condom compliance and HIV/AIDS and STI infection among the sex workers in the area.</p>
<p>The sex work sites that I visited included north Calcutta neighborhoods that comprise the heart of the red light district. There were concentrated pockets of sex work zones amid regular neighborhoods in these areas. At the entrance of each neighborhood the sex workers stood in colorful garb and painted faces, soliciting the clients. This practice was colloquially referred to as “standing at the gates,” and signified the presence of sex work sites within the neighborhood. Interviews were conducted with DMSC committee members, peer educators, and nonpeer sex workers from these areas.</p>
<p>Participant observation formed a part of my research strategy, as I spent extended periods with the sex workers in Sonagachi. Participant observation “combines participation in the lives of the people being studied with maintenance of a professional distance that allows adequate observation and recording of data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313483925">Fetterman, 1998</xref>, pp. 34-35). I spent a considerable period of time during the day with DMSC members, observing them pursuing their project work in their offices and respective outreach sites. Prolonged interaction with the sex workers in their own settings allowed me to develop a rapport with the women, which facilitated free and open conversation with them.</p>
<p>Prior permission was obtained from the DMSC central governing committee before the commencement of any research work and interviewing. This permission was obtained by sending an application letter drafted in Bengali and addressed to the Central Management Committee of DMSC. The Temple University Institutional Review Board also granted approval before the start of all research activities. I conducted a total of 37 interviews of commercial female sex workers. The DMSC central management authorities selected and recruited the interview participants. Among the 37 participants, 30 were either current or past members, of DMSC administrative committees or peer outreach workers.</p>
<p>Most of the interview participants seemed heavily involved in the daily operations of DMSC and various other project work. Because DMSC conducted the participant selection, there was a lack of nonpeer sex workers and those uninvolved in the administrative work of the union. I considered this to be one of the drawbacks of the study, as it resulted in a less-than-representative picture of sex workers in Sonagachi. I could not, however, access the sex workers without the cooperation and permission of the union. The participants were interviewed in the DMSC offices and in project sites within Sonagachi and adjoining areas. No incentives were given and participation was purely voluntary.</p>
<p>I used semistructured interviews with open-ended questions. Semistructured interviewing is regarded as a heuristic device, because such a strategy offers respondents a chance to develop their own thoughts outside a research question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313483925">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 2003</xref>). I had a basic guideline for questioning. From previous research I had distinguished poverty as a contextual factor affecting sexual health behavior of commercial sex workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa &amp; Obregon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313483925">Amaro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313483925">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>). I initiated conversations on the topic of the impact of poverty on condom compliance and health care choices of the participants. I did not, however, want to limit the conversations to answers to my questions.</p>
<p>I encouraged the participants to enhance my knowledge by raising topics that I had not taken into account. Each of the interviews lasted on average between 20 and 30 minutes. All communication took place in Bengali, which is my native language and also the native language of the participants. The interview questions and answers were recorded with pen and paper in Bengali. No videotaping or audiotaping was performed. The transcripts of the interviews differed markedly from each other and were reflective of the personalities of the women.</p>
<p>I translated the transcripts of the interviews to English and these amounted to 167 pages of translated text. No personal information such as age, family background, years in the profession, or health status were asked. Some of the women mentioned their age during conversations and others did not. Although I presume that names given by the participants were their actual names, the prevalent practice in Indian sex work sites of sex workers using pseudonyms cannot be overlooked.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Global HIV/AIDS intervention campaigns often emphasize condom compliance yet do not focus on sociocultural and structural factors such as poverty, violence, and stigmatization that can affect condom negotiation and safe sex practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa &amp; Obregon, 2000</xref>). Contextual factors like economic deprivation, violence, discrimination, criminalization, and legal persecution often restrict the ability of sex workers to protect themselves from STIs and HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu, 2008</xref>). Economic adversity significantly constrains the power of men and women to take control of their sexual health and restricts the ability of high-risk populations like sex workers to negotiate condom use and safe sex practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313483925">Dutta-Bergman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313483925">Lupton, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732313483925">
<title>Poverty as a Structural Barrier</title>
<p>Poverty perpetuates a state of ill health for the sustenance of life, which in turn is threatened by diseases like HIV/AIDS. The Indian sex worker is often the head of her household and quite frequently a single mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, money is a basic necessity for the sex worker to sustain her progeny and sometimes even extended family members for whom she is the sole source of income. In her constant struggle to make ends meet, safe sex practices and positive health-care-seeking behavior might not be priorities for a sex worker.</p>
<p>The goal of the sex worker is ultimately to provide for her family and children—to survive—albeit in unhealthy circumstances. A ready accessibility of condoms thus does not ensure the implementation and compliance of safe sex practices. The causes are several. The sex worker can decide to bargain for more money for condomless sex. In an article on South African commercial female sex workers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki and Malala (2001)</xref> noted that most of the women interviewed had fair access to condoms, but<disp-quote>
<p>[m]any of the same women argued that if they were offered more money from clients (or boyfriends), then they would not use condoms. This was the most common reason given for choosing not to use condoms. Many women viewed the possibility not to use condoms as a chance to make more money. For example women reported doubling the price without condoms. (p. 109)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The client can refuse to pay for insisting on condom use, in which case the sex worker is left with a tough choice that includes foregoing her income or engaging in unsafe sex. For the sake of feeding her family and herself, she might consistently choose the latter option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313483925">Preston-Whyte, 1999</xref>). An insistence on condom use can trigger a drop in the number of clients. This drop entails significantly reduced income for the sex workers, thus rendering survival a struggle. The fallout is “increased hours on the job and increased desperation to attract clients, often leading to sex workers relenting to clients’ demands for unsafe sex, which increases their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">Basu, 2010</xref>, p. 422).</p>
<p>Although sex work is seen as a way out of poverty for the sex workers and their dependents, the cycle of STIs and HIV/AIDS resulting from unsafe sex practices is perpetuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>). Thus poverty is a structural impediment for establishing and achieving safe sex methods and positive health practices. Healthy living attains a lower priority when risky sexual behaviors are adopted for the sake of sustenance. Sex work becomes a cause of risk to sex workers’ health while ensuring the survival of the women and their families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">Basu (2010)</xref> put it succinctly:<disp-quote>
<p>When monetary worries multiply with fewer clients, concerns about health become secondary. Health and HIV are contextualized in terms of a future state of being, with the more immediate need to earn money to feed family members and promote the health of children often leading sex workers to give in to unhealthy practices.

<title>At the Sonagachi Project</title>
<p>The contextualization of health behavior among sex workers by poverty was evident in the interviews with the women of Sonagachi. For example, a participant elaborated on the need for money:<disp-quote>
<p>One has to live. One’s family has to live and one needs money to live. So when it is a bit of extra money to not use condoms it is a hard choice for us sex workers. You can get HIV/AIDS or STIs, but the extra money will bring a day’s food to your hungry children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Poverty has a serious impact on health behavior and decision making related to safe sex practices and implementation of HIV/AIDS-prevention practices in Sonagachi. The difficulties of condom compliance and implementation of consistent safe sex practices—while being subject to severe economic deprivation—were evident in the interviews.</p>
<p>Many of the sex workers recounted the obstacles of sustaining safe sex while eking out bare subsistence for themselves and their families. A participant commented,<disp-quote>
<p>It is very difficult, as you see. A girl can convince one customer to use condoms but not all who come to her in a single night. There will be some who will refuse to wear a condom. They will go to the next girl who will do it for him without the condom. Then what is a girl to do? Insist on condoms and lose on a night’s earnings?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interviewed women shared their knowledge about the potential hardships that an average sex worker can confront in the face of grinding poverty. Insistence on safe sex can result in losing a night’s earnings from some of the clients fixed on “skin-to-skin contact,” a euphemism for penetrative sex without condoms.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was not the clients who served as the barriers to the attainment of safe sex practices. The pimps who lived off the income of many sex workers put pressure on them to have condomless sex for greater monetary compensation. If the woman managed to ignore the pimp’s instructions and not earn the extra money, she was subjected to vindictive and punitive measures. A participant noted,<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes the pimps would come and say that this client has given good money so you need to make him happy. Well, that often means don’t insist on condoms. If the girl still does not relent and manages to make the client use a condom, he might complain to the pimp of being cheated. The pimp can implement retaliatory measures such as beating up the girl in question or cutting her out of all future transactions with customers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The madams, referred to as the <italic>malkins</italic>—literally meaning owners—also influenced negotiation of safe sex practices in their own quest for sustenance. A participant elaborated on the ramifications of a potential confrontation with a madam:<disp-quote>
<p>Even if the sex worker says no to unsafe sex her malkin might not oblige. The madam might want to receive a full payment from the client, and the full payment will not come unless the sex worker agrees to sex without condoms. Now who shall she listen to? If she insists on safe sex she might lose the client and her malkin might turn her out of the establishment, leaving her starving and helpless.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the sex workers’ low economic status and resultant dependence on clients, pimps, and brothel owners affect their ability to negotiate safe sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313483925">Campbell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313483925">Chattopadhyay &amp; McKaig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313483925">Varga,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313483925">Wojcicki &amp; Malala, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313483925">Wood &amp; Jewkes, 1998</xref>). The interviews with the women at Sonagachi also revealed that sexual decision making and health behavior are impinged on by the exigencies of poverty. Considering the fact that the rate of condom usage in Sonagachi was 97% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313483925">2009</xref> (NACO), the question remains how such a significantly high adoption and usage rate is consistently maintained. The significantly high rate of condom usage is especially relevant because poverty and deprivation run as common themes through the sex workers’ lives in Sonagachi.</p>
<p>Basu, who conducted research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">2010</xref>) on sex workers’ health discourse in Sonagachi, noticed that<disp-quote>
<p>[p]overty is a consistent material artifice; it constitutes a canvas or a broad structure that frames the lives of members of this sex worker community, existing in its material causes and manifestations, such as lack of money, inability to live healthily, a constant struggle to make ends meet, and the need to practice sex work. Simultaneously, poverty permeates the community’s local communicative fabric through talk about being poor. (pp. 420-421)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One is confounded with the statistics of near-perfect condom adoption and usage and the sheer material manifestation of poverty in the red light district of Calcutta. Previous research consistently indicates poverty to be a structural barrier for negotiation of safe sex practices, yet in Sonagachi this was not the case. I ventured to question the disjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313483925">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The Ability to Say “No”</title>
<p>My interviews with the sex workers showed that poverty, instead of functioning as a barrier to condom compliance and safe sex practices, served as an impetus on the part of the workers to stay healthy. It was because of poverty that the women could not afford to indulge in unsafe sex practices that might cause illness and deprive them of their daily income. This happened in the following two ways. First, in Sonagachi, the peer outreach program successfully impressed in the minds of the sex workers the fatal outcome of contracting HIV/AIDS. Also greatly emphasized was the debilitating effect of common STIs, which could incapacitate the women and prevent them from plying their trade. Almost all of the sex workers in Sonagachi functioned as daily wage earners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313483925">Jana et al., 2004</xref>). A few days of illness could result in heavy financial losses, which could put the survival of the worker’s family at stake.</p>
<p>Second, it was the status of the sex workers as mothers and sole wage earners of their families that compelled them to protect themselves from unsafe sex. Of the 37 women interviewed, 32 had children and all were primary breadwinners for their respective families. Nine of them said that they supported extended families such as nephews, nieces, in-laws, and cousins. The sex workers’ status as mothers and sole sustainers of their families was articulated and reiterated throughout our conversations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu (2008)</xref>, who conducted research with sex workers in a similar setting, made comparable observations on the sex workers’ identification primarily as dutiful mothers and sustainers. The narratives showed that in the sex worker community in Sonagachi, “health is communicated in relation to the local context of living” and this included “cultural notions of motherhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313483925">Basu, 2008</xref>, p. 426). Basu called such contextualization “localocentric vocalizations” on health that impinged on the sex workers’ ability to remain healthy themselves. Basu noted that poverty and the status of being the sole breadwinners for their families caused the sex workers to deprioritize their health and indulge in unsafe sex practices.</p>
<p>My conversations with the sex workers, however, show exactly the opposite. The women could not afford to get ill or die, for that would mean death for their dependents, many of whom were young children. The sex worker has to live and be healthy for her family members to survive and be healthy. Hence, sex without condoms was not even an option. One participant’s statement articulated the stance of the Sonagachi women succinctly:<disp-quote>
<p>I am a sex worker and the sustainer of my family, I am proud of it. If something happens to me, if I am stricken with a fatal disease, there will be nobody to look after my family. This is how it is and nobody knows it better than us sex workers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant voiced the sex workers’ responsibility in a similar fashion:<disp-quote>
<p>I am a mother, I bear the responsibility of my children. I feed them, clothe them, try my best to give them a good education and good life. If I fall ill and lose a few days’ worth of income they will starve. If I die they will die too. I cannot afford to not use condoms; that would mean courting death for us all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The pressing need for safe sexual behavior was articulated by another participant:<disp-quote>
<p>If we get infected with HIV/AIDS our clients will avoid us like lepers. Who will feed me and my family then? My partner will leave me, society will not help, and there are no philanthropists in this world. My children will starve to death. I need to be alive; I need to be healthy for the sake of myself and for the sake of my children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Undoubtedly these were localocentric articulations of health contextualized by poverty and motherhood, but the latter factors served as an impetus to eschew unsafe sex practices—not to indulge in them. Poverty and their status as sole generators of income caused the sex workers and their respective families to depend exclusively on the daily wages of the women for survival. In the absence of resources, social security, or alternative viable means of earning, a day’s absence from the profession could result in hunger and misery. The women repeatedly asserted that they could not afford ill health even for a day, and they could not afford to die, so safe sex and the use of condoms was not an option, it was a necessity. For the sake of their families they could emphatically say “no” to unsafe sex. Poverty thus was an impetus for engaging in positive health behavior and practices.</p>
<p>Finally, the unionization of the sex workers in Sonagachi provided them with means of minimizing the harassment and exploitation stemming from external agencies like pimps, brothel owners, clients, and the police. The formation of the DMSC provided an important platform through which they could directly raise their immediate concerns against oppression. The participants noted that the sex workers’ collectivization, and their endeavors to proactively ameliorate their security, generated empathy among law enforcement and government agencies. The local pimps and brothel owners also refrained from indulging in direct confrontation with individual sex workers because they feared retaliation from a collective group. Law enforcement agencies remained apprehensive of massive demonstrations by DMSC and vocal protestations by the sex workers in cases of violence, extortion, and arbitrary incarcerations.</p>
<p>The participants pointed out that unionization also enabled the sex workers of Sonagachi to access legal recourse in case of acts of violence. Several lawsuits were noted to be filed by DMSC in the last decade against individuals who had assaulted the sex workers at various times. The union also maintained a process of negotiation with the key stakeholders of the sex work industry, namely with the pimps, brothel owners, clients, law enforcement agencies, and members of local political parties. One of the main goals of such negotiation was to emphasize the status of sex work as a legitimate labor industry that sustains the stakeholders.</p>
<p>It was stressed that lack of condom compliance and safe sex practices can result in an epidemic of STIs and HIV/AIDS among the sex workers, causing death or debilitation among them. A dead or ill work force was noted to be in nobody’s interest because it would result in a loss of income for all. As one participant put it, “We tell them [pimps] if we catch AIDS we die. And that means you die too.” Such proactive strategies by the sex workers’ union were noted by participants to have facilitated a reduction in the incidence of harassment against sex workers, which in turn caused the lowered STI and HIV/AIDS infection rates and higher condom compliance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Context refers to the “local surroundings within which cultural members enact agency,” and “context, thus, foregrounds meanings emerging from participant spaces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">Basu, 2010</xref>, p. 416). The articulation of health as an individual responsibility, as suggested by top-down communication models, is subject to reevaluation. It is apparent from the current research that contextual factors can frame health behavior, and structural attributes like poverty can influence sexual health practices of sex workers. The contexts of risk and vulnerability are affected by distal social structures such as gender inequalities and power.</p>
<p>Researchers in previous studies identified poverty as a structural barrier hindering the negotiation of safe sex practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313483925">Airhihenbuwa, 2007</xref>). My observations of the interviewed sex workers, however, indicate that poverty can serve as an impetus to remain healthy and pursue positive health attributes like condom compliance. Poverty precludes the possibility of becoming ill and remaining ill, because long-term sickness entails loss of income for prolonged periods, which puts entire families in danger of starvation. The lives of the Sonagachi sex workers were centered on their roles as mothers and primary income generators for their families. The proposition of loss of economic potential because of disease, and the awareness of the possible life-threatening nature of HIV/AIDS, inspired the sex workers to avoid getting infected at all costs.</p>
<p>Thus, sex work, poverty, and health do not have a paradoxical relationship, because poverty ensures that the sex worker does not eschew safe sex practices and endanger her health and life:<disp-quote>
<p>Structural factors and, by inference, approaches, are sometimes passed over by the health sector as being too broad, too diffuse, and outside the remit of health programming. Often this is a reaction to the fact that risk and vulnerability can be, and often are, linked to distal, society-level factors such as gender inequality or social marginalization, that are beyond the control of individual health-service providers or clients. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313483925">Gupta, Parkhurst, Ogden, Aggleton &amp; Mahal, 2008</xref>, p. 767)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relation of structural factors to HIV and STI risk and vulnerability is complex and variable, as was evident in this study. Poverty does not result in precipitating high-risk behavior and adverse health outcomes among the sex workers of Sonagachi.</p>
<p>Among sex workers across the globe, poverty often intertwines with distal social factors like gender inequities and stigmatization to form a structural barrier to health. In Sonagachi, the structural barrier of poverty was overcome by the sex workers not by changing distal social factors, for such would have been logistically impossible to achieve. Instead, the sex workers of Sonagachi engaged with the obstacles at a local, proximal level through community mobilization, peer outreach intervention, and HIV and STI education. The content of the interviews bears the practical implications of this research.</p>
<p>In light of the current findings I would emphasize the need to reassess dominant theoretical and praxis-related notions on HIV/AIDS intervention research among sex workers. This entails that “dominant approaches to HIV/AIDS campaigns, which promote condom use, health checkups, HIV awareness, and HIV screenings need to be refocused to understand and include local cultural constructions and needs in the sex worker community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313483925">Basu, 2010</xref>, p. 428). The findings reveal that high-risk marginalized populations like sex workers can engage with and overcome structural barriers to health in highly gendered sectors of labor like commercial sex work. The Sonagachi model of peer-outreach-based community mobilization, HIV/STI education, and unionization of sex workers can perhaps be replicated to form successful HIV/AIDS interventions in commercial sex work sites in South Asia and other parts of the developing world.</p>
