<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>I Humphreys, C Phillips</bold></p>
<p>Swansea University</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Mood problems affect people with multiple sclerosis. The aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioural treatment for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Those with low mood were invited to take part in a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of attending an adjustment group with a waiting list control. Outcomes were assessed 4 and 8 months after randomization, blind to group allocation.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Of the 311 patients identified, 221 (71%) met the criteria for low mood and 151 (68%) agreed to take part. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to compare the two groups, correcting for baseline mood and disability. At four months, group allocation alone was a significant predictor of the primary outcome measure, the GHQ-12. At eight months, group allocation alone was no longer a significant predictor for GHQ-12 scores but was when baseline GHQ-12 and Guys Neurological Disability Scale scores were controlled for. Cost data also showed the groups were cost effective. There was a decrease in the intervention group total costs compared with an increase in the control group costs, which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, 95% confidence levels −932 to −54).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Patients receiving treatment were less distressed and had less depression and anxiety. Group treatment led to a reduction in costs of £493 per patient.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This group intervention would be cost effective to implement in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Communication and low mood (calm) study: a randomized controlled trial of behaviour therapy for low mood in people with aphasia after stroke</title>
<p><bold>NB Lincoln, SA Thomas, MF Walker, J Macniven, H Howarth</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Low mood is common in people with aphasia. Studies of psychological treatments have excluded people with aphasia. Our study aimed to evaluate behaviour therapy for low mood in stroke patients with aphasia.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> This multicentre trial recruited patients with aphasia from hospital and community settings. Mood was screened using the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (SADQ-H10) and Visual Analog Mood Scales sad item (VAMS). Patients with low mood were randomly allocated to receive up to three months of behaviour therapy from an assistant psychologist, or usual care. Blind outcome assessments of mood (SADQH-21, VAMS), self-esteem (Visual Analogue Self-Esteem Scale; VASES) and leisure activities (Nottingham Leisure Questionnaire; NLQ) were completed three and six months after randomization.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> One hundred and five patients were randomized (66 men, mean age 67 years) at a median of nine months post stroke. Groups were comparable at baseline. Results were analysed using hierarchical linear regression controlling for baseline values of each outcome variable and severity of language impairment. At three months allocation to behaviour therapy was a significant predictor of VAMS sad (beta = −0.224, <italic>P</italic> = 0.033) and VASES (beta = 0.275, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) scores. Group allocation was not a significant predictor of scores on the SADQH-21 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.052) or NLQ (<italic>P</italic> = 0.275). At six months group allocation was a significant predictor of the SADQH-21 (beta = −2.23, <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) but there was no significant effect of group allocation on VAMS sad, VASES or NLQ.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Psychological interventions can be adapted for those with aphasia.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This trial showed that behaviour therapy improved mood in aphasic stroke patients with low mood.</p>

<title>Service evaluation of holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation: impact on dysexecutive symptoms and carer strain following acquired brain injury</title>
<p><bold>R Goodwin</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>A Bateman</bold></p>
<p>The Oliver Zangwill Centre for Neuropsychological Rehabilitation</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Deficits in executive functioning are common following acquired brain injury. Patients encounter problems in everyday functioning, and their families experience significant strain. While literature confirms benefits of cognitive rehabilitation for executive dysfunction, this study is unique in evaluating the effectiveness of holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation specifically on executive functioning deficits and carer strain.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Sixty-six chronic acquired brain injury outpatients (62% males; age: 18–61 years; time-since-injury: 0–20 years) attended 24-week holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation. A repeated-measures design determined the effect of rehabilitation on executive functioning and carer strain, as part of service evaluation. Outcome measures comprised the dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX/DEX-I) and Carer Strain Index, applied pre- and post-rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Repeated-measures <italic>t</italic>-tests indicated rehabilitation benefited clients and carers in 5/6 DEX/DEX-I, and 2/3 Carer Strain Index subscales (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Results showed significant improvement in items sampling (e.g. clients’ planning and insight, and carers’ personal upset and lifestyle adjustments). However, items covering, for example, clients’ aggression and carers’ financial strain did not improve. Secondary analysis showed an effect of aetiology on rehabilitation, demonstrated on the DEX-I metacognitive scale.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Neuropsychological rehabilitation is effective in reducing client and carer reports of dysexecutive behaviours and carer strain. Rehabilitation can benefit acquired brain injury clients and their families, even after the spontaneous recovery period. Also implicated is the importance of considering aetiology in practice as results on the DEX-I metacognitive scale were masked by aetiological group differences.</p>

<p><bold>C Palmer</bold></p>
<p>University College London</p>
<p><bold>P Whitehead, A Drummond</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Predischarge occupational therapy home visits are an accepted part of a patient’s care pathway after stroke, despite limited research to support their effectiveness. This study aimed to explore their value by obtaining the perceptions of experts who influence this practice.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Six semi-structured interviews were completed with experts who were defined as an influential and/or a lead figure in occupational therapy home visiting and/or stroke rehabilitation. Experts included both academics and clinicians from a range of professional backgrounds. Thematic analysis was used. Analysis progress was discussed and agreed by the research team.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> The main issues raised by the experts were; different purposes for completing home visits and the cost implications of these visits.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Two potentially competing responsibilities of protecting patients from harm and facilitating independence in meaningful activities were reported. The experts concern about risk averse practice is particularly noteworthy as there is limited evidence to indicate home visits reduce safety risks for patients. Perceived expense may have resulted in a reduction in the number of visits being completed, it is therefore vital that further research identifies the cost and effectiveness of these visits.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study reports the experiences of experts who are directly and indirectly responsible for developing home visiting practice after stroke. The experts believed that home visits have an important role in stroke rehabilitation but identified that an evidence base is required to support home visit decisions. This will assist in the provision of an equitable home visiting service after stroke.</p>

<p><bold>C Gaynor</bold></p>
<p>Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust</p>
<p><bold>F Nouri, M Walker</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Recent evidence has helped to establish key components of effective early supported discharge services within the stroke rehabilitation pathway. However, less is understood about the challenges of implementing these services in practice. The current study addresses this gap, and investigates how best to organize and deliver early supported discharge services.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> We adopted a multi-method, qualitative approach to data collection and analyses, employing; interviews, observation, and documentary data. Findings are based on a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with service commissioners, service managers, physicians, therapists, nurses and allied healthcare professionals (<italic>n=</italic>42), working in and around three local early supported discharge services.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Early supported discharge can be accessed after varying lengths of acute, inpatient stays, meaning that hybrid systems for different patient cohorts may operate within the same service. The nature, intensity and duration of rehabilitation also varies, depending on individual patient therapy needs and rehabilitation goals. Collaboration between acute staff and early supported discharge team is critical for eligibility decisions, especially more complex patients. The multidisciplinary team nature of early supported discharge is cited as a positive feature, and is manifested through: interdisciplinary working, shared team roles, and composite rehabilitation sessions. Having stroke specialist healthcare professionals within the early supported discharge team is also seen favourably. Shared job roles, staff rotations and joint training sessions are forwarded to meet the challenges of spanning the professional and organizational boundaries between acute, early supported discharge and community services.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ongoing research provides insights into how to implement effective early supported discharge services within an integrated stroke care system, for the benefit of patient and carer groups.</p>

<title>Stroke and social identity: an exploration of stroke survivors’ views and perceptions</title>
<p><bold>JJ McAdam</bold></p>
<p>University of Manchester, University of Central Lancashire</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Stroke survivors are vulnerable to fundamental changes in their identity. Less is known about changes to social identity (how we define ourselves in relation to others) post stroke. This issue may be relevant to stroke survivors’ rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Fourteen stroke survivors were recruited from three stroke clubs. A combination of semi-structured interviews and a focus group were used to collect data, using a phenomenological approach. Data were analysed by thematic analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Participants experienced a loss of social identity post stroke. This was instigated through loss of: social activity, friendship and independent status. In addition, participants experienced social isolation through: reclusiveness, invisible disability and social barriers. Stroke survivors negatively redefined their social identity based on these experiences. Participants, however, were able to maintain positive social identity through strong social support from family, friends and stroke clubs. Furthermore, stroke clubs offered an opportunity to rebuild social identity and social confidence through new friendships, shared understanding and positive group evaluation.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> In this study, stroke survivor’s perceptions of social identity were damaged due to changes in friendships, social relationships and social isolation from others. However, strong support from family, friends and membership of stroke clubs helped to preserve and rebuild social identity. Stroke survivors may benefit from raised awareness of these issues.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It is clear that stroke survivors face difficult issues relating to their social identity post stroke. More research is required to understand the consequences of these findings.</p>

<title>Evaluation of a new instrument to assess competencies in chairing case conferences</title>
<p><bold>RJ O’Connor</bold></p>
<p>University of Leeds</p>
<p><bold>ED Playford</bold></p>
<p>UCL Institute of Neurology</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The case conference is one of the main generic interventions in rehabilitation practice: clinical trainees should develop their skills through receiving feedback on their performance. The case Conference Assessment Tool (cCAT) is an assessment developed and evaluated to score a trainee’s performance on the key elements of chairing a case conference and provide structured feedback to trainees. The aim of this project was to assess the psychometric properties of the cCAT.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Rehabilitation clinicians experienced in participating in case conferences attended a training workshop to learn how to use the cCAT. They then watched recordings of simulated case conferences and rated the performance of the trainee using the cCAT. Data were analysed using RUMM2030.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Clinicians from six centres across the UK were recruited; 171 cCATs were completed. Data quality was high with few missing items. The item-trait interaction for the data indicated that there was no deviation from the measurement model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.592). Mean person location was 0.736 (SD = 2.477) and person separation index was 0.945, indicating good reliability. All seven items had ordered thresholds and the person-item threshold distribution was satisfactory.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Following feedback from the workshops, a final version of the cCAT was developed. It has been adopted as an assessment for speciality trainees in rehabilitation medicine. Future work will explore its utility for trainees in other clinical fields, and in communication and leadership skill training for undergraduate students.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The cCAT is a reliable, valid and unidimensional assessment that spans the range of competencies required to chair a case conference.</p>

<p>Keele University</p>
<p><bold>ID Swain</bold></p>
<p>Bournemouth University</p>
<p><bold>AD Pandyan</bold></p>
<p>Keele University</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Most existing reviews of electrical stimulation for stroke rehabilitation conclude that unambiguous support for the use of technology is lacking. There are many confounders identified in existing reviews but none have specifically explored the effect of time after stroke. The aim of this specific review was to study the variations of effect size over time when electrical stimulation was used for upper limb stroke rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A search strategy that included multiple terms for stroke and arm and electrical stimulation was applied to AMED, Cochrane Library, Compendex, CSAIllumina, EMBASE, Medline, PeDRo, PyscInfo and Web of Science (last search September 2011). Potentially relevant papers were selected and screened by two researchers. Data were extracted from randomized controlled trials (with equivalence at baseline) that had blinded assessors and measured activity. Effect sizes were calculated and the change over time was studied.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Eleven of 102 potentially relevant papers were selected. Time post stroke varied from 2 to 164 weeks. Effect sizes varied from 0.01 to 2.18. Effect size exponentially reduced with time (coefficient=−0.018; constant=0.978; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.573).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> It is possible that secondary complications associated with prolonged lack of activity (e.g. contractures, atrophy, learned non-use) may contribute to the reduction in effect sizes documented in studies recruiting chronic stroke patients. It is unlikely that the findings of this review are confounded by a natural recovery process as all selected studies used a randomized controlled trial design. Further research is needed to verify the findings of this review.</p>

<p>Sheffield Hallam University</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Community rehabilitation and intermediate care for older people has grown over the last decade but is known to be different across the country. This research investigates the nature and needs of patients receiving these services. We have collected consistent data from 11 care teams from across England over a minimum of 12 months at each site detailing more than 6000 patients.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Information was collected for every service user including: level of care need, therapy outcome measures and health-related quality of life. These data were explored using descriptive statistics to describe community care service users and differences of patients’ needs between services.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> The admission scores show that there are variations between teams regarding the levels of dependency of patients admitted. Patients were discharged at different points in their recovery. Each team differered in types of patient need. The average age of people being admitted to services also varied (10.6 years) The most common diagnosis on admission was stroke, followed by fracture and postoperative care. The most common recorded purpose for the intervention was mobility, followed by activities of daily living/coping, nutrition and assessment.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> While it is clear that across all teams it is possible to predict the range of patient characteristics and the most common reasons for admission. Each team has a set of local circumstances which determine the balance of needs of their patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Benchmarking these services allows local discussion to determine reasons for differences and possible unmet need.</p>

<title>Predischarge occupational therapy home visits: What is national practice in stroke units?</title>
<p><bold>P Whitehead, K Fellows, N Sprigg, A Drummond</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Predischarge home visits are commonly completed with patients as part of their rehabilitation following stroke. In the 2006 National Sentinel Stroke Audit they were reported to be completed with 73% of patients admitted to a stroke unit. However, little is known about national practices and procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A questionnaire was designed, piloted and posted to occupational therapists in 184 stroke units in England. Acute, rehabilitation and mixed stroke units were included. Topics covered: the number of visits completed, reasons for completing home visits, time taken, and home visiting procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Results/Findings:</bold> Eighty-seven questionnaires were returned, a 45% response rate. Stroke units completed a mean of 7.10 (SD = 6.93, range 0–27) predischarge home visits in April and May 2011 combined (i.e. approximately one per week). On average, home visits took half a day (mean 223 minutes, range 100–570) to complete, including travel time, organizing and writing up. The main reason for conducting visits was to ‘assess or practice activities of daily living in the home environment’.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> There is considerable variation in the ranges reported, indicating that there are differences in practice between stroke units. However, overall it appears that the number of home visits has decreased. Although home visits are reported to be completed in order to identify safety issues, there is currently no robust evidence to demonstrate they are effective.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Given the amount of occupational therapy time spent on predischarge home visits, further research is needed in this area.</p>

<p><bold>J Harris</bold></p>
<p>University of Dundee</p>
<p><bold>P McCrone</bold></p>
<p>King’s College London</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Process utility from providing informal care indicates the extent to which carers value their caring role. This was investigated in a UK-wide survey of respite/replacement care use by carers of adults with long term neurological conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Carers (<italic>N</italic> = 142) rated their happiness from 0 = completely unhappy to 100 = completely happy before and after considering a hypothetical scenario: ‘Suppose a person chosen by you and the person you care for were to take over all your caring tasks free of charge. This person would provide all necessary care at the home of the person cared for from now on.’</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> On average, carers believed they would be significantly happier if someone else took over their role (median 80, interquartile range (IQR) 50–90) than they were currently (median 50, IQR 40–75; <italic>z</italic> = −4.07; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Nonetheless, 24% believed their happiness would diminish. Stepwise regression showed 33% of perceived change in happiness could be explained by Zarit Burden and GHQ-12 scores.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Successive governments have stated a commitment to empower carers to have a life outside caring, but some need respite/replacement care to achieve this. Most study participants believed that delegating their role to others would make them happier but some did not. Previous experiences of receiving care may have influenced ratings and some carers may prefer to delegate care intermittently. Findings are not necessarily generalizable.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Determining the value of care processes as distinct from outcomes is important in service evaluation. The development of flexible and accessible respite/replacement care services could increase carers’ opportunities for participation and promote their well-being.</p>

<title>How helpful do low back pain patients find multidisciplinary group rehabilitation in addressing their concerns about work?</title>
<p><bold>C Coole, A Drummond</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>PJ Watson</bold></p>
<p>University of Leicester</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Low back pain is a major cause of sickness absence and work disability. Combined physical and psychological treatment programmes are recommended for persisting back problems, and clinical trials have shown significant reductions in sickness absence through group treatment. However, we know little about patients’ perceptions of how such programmes address their concerns about work. A greater awareness of their experiences may inform the design and content of treatment programmes.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A qualitative approach using thematic analysis was used. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 19 back pain patients, approximately two months after attending group multidisciplinary back pain rehabilitation. All had been concerned about their ability to work due to low back pain.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Five main themes were identified. These were: changed cognitions about working with back pain including increased confidence and adaptation to the health condition; the ability to apply self-management tools such as pacing and medication at work; the experience of the treatment approach, including the opportunity to compare oneself with others; the variability of the work-related help received; the barriers to accessing rehabilitation including work demands and delayed referral.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Multidisciplinary rehabilitation can reduce patients concerns about working with back pain and should be made more accessible and available. Its helpfulness may be limited by the patients’ own ability to apply self-management tools to their work; individually targeted work-related interventions and greater communication between clinicians and patients’ employers are indicated.</p>

<title>Goal setting as a method for identifying patient selected items in measuring arm function</title>
<p><bold>S Ashford, D Jackson, L Turner-Stokes</bold></p>
<p>King’s College London</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Following stroke or brain injury, goals for rehabilitation of the hemiparetic upper limb include restoring active function if there is return of motor control or, if none is possible, improving passive function, and care for the limb. To inform development of a patient reported outcome measure (PROM) of active and passive function in the hemiparetic upper limb, investigation of functional goals was undertaken.</p>
<p><bold>Method</bold>: Using a prospective observational cohort design, functional goals determined between patients, their carers and the clinical team were assigned into categories by two raters. The resulting items were compared with those identified in a previous systematic review of upper limb functional measures.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings</bold>: Participants comprised 9 males and 7 females of mean (SD) age 54.5 (15.7) years. Fifteen had sustained a stroke and one a traumatic brain injury. Goals were assigned to five categories: passive function, active function, symptoms, cosmesis and impairment. Two passive function items not previously identified in the systematic review augmented the review items to inform a new Arm Activity Measure (ArmA).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion</bold>: The use of this methodology had three primary functions: (1) a novel and clinically relevant method of identification of new items by patients and carers, (2) confirmation of passive function items identified in the systematic review and (3) ensuring that items relevant to the proximal upper limb were considered for inclusion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Analysis of goals important to patients and carers revealed items for inclusion in a new measure of arm function and increased its construct and ecological validity.</p>

<p>University of Salford</p>
<p><bold>A McGovern</bold></p>
<p>Greater Manchester &amp; Cheshire Cardiac and Stroke Network</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> National guidance mandates that patients with stroke should be screened for mood problems using a validated tool, however clinicians report difficulties in selecting the most appropriate from the number available. To be able to recommend a tool for clinical practice we assessed the psychometrics and evaluated the clinical utility of mood screening tools for stroke.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Mood screening tools that were validated for stroke and had a sensitivity &gt;0.8 and specificity &gt;0.6 had been previously identified from literature searches of all major databases. Clinical utility of these tools (time to administer; cost and training requirements) was now assessed using a previously validated tool.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> The following tools provided psychometrically robust data (sensitivity &gt;0.8 and specificity &gt;0.6) and met the criteria outlined above, indicating they were feasible to use in clinical practice: the Yale Question, Geriatric Depression Scale (15-item), Patient Health Questionnaire (2- and 9-item versions), Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (21-item). They are freely available to use and can be completed in less than 5 minutes with minimal training for staff.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion</bold>: The tools identified are feasible to use in clinical practice and sensitive and specific to mood problems following stroke. The Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire is the only tool that meets these criteria and is suitable for patients with cognitive difficulties. The Depression Intensity Scale Circles was suitable for those with language difficulties, but has slightly lower sensitivity.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Robust mood screening tools that are appropriate for clinical practice with patients following stroke have been identified.</p>

<p><bold>Method</bold>: Design: Consensus workshops. Participants: Staff working in ten inpatient stroke units and five early supported discharge teams. Procedure: Stroke-related impairments were extracted from the literature and presented to the participants, who selected the domains that needed to be measured to reflect the essential elements of rehabilitation and be known by all members of the multidisciplinary team. Analysis: Themed content analysis classified responses and member checking was employed to ensure trustworthiness and obtain consensus.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings</bold>: Seven core domains were identified: Independence in activities of daily living, mood, cognition, nutrition, communication, swallowing and falls risk. Seven further domains were selected by the early supported discharge teams for community-based rehabilitation: balance, extended acitivities of daily living, mobility, self-medication, upper limb function in everyday life, skin integrity and visual function.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The essential domains included a mix of impairments and activity limitations. Those selected for hospital-based rehabilitation settings continued to be considered important for community settings, with additional emphasis on function and safety. Participation-related domains were not chosen as they were considered impossible to measure.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The functional domains considered essential to measure in stroke rehabilitation practice have been identified. Systematic reviews will identify the most robust tools to measure each domain.</p>

<p>Keele University</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Forceplates are used for measuring postural sway, an outcome measure for postural stability. Most valid and reliable forceplates need a laboratory set-up and therefore are limited to mainly research application. However, the load cell-based forceplate system is a less expensive and portable alternative. This is a study exploring the validity and reliability of one such commercially available system.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> The load cell-based forceplate system was mounted on a laboratory-graded forceplate (AMTI). Data were collected simultaneously from both forceplates with subjects in quiet standing. Four trials each were collected with a 10-second break in between. Signal correlation and coefficient of variance (CV) was used to determine validity and reliability respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings</bold>: Twenty-eight healthy participants (mean age 26 years, SD = 5) volunteered for the study. Signal correlation between sway measured by the respective systems was always greater than 0.9. The mean centre of pressure vector path lengths (COPL) for 28 subjects were 1.21 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 1.81 × 10<sup>3</sup> for the load cell-based forceplate system and laboratory-graded forceplate respectively. CV values from the mean COPL for the load cell-based forceplate system and laboratory-graded forceplate were 2.84% and 2.03%, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The load cell-based forceplate system demonstrated a high concurrent validity in measuring postural sway and both the load cell-based forceplate system and the laboratory-graded forceplate were found to be reliable in measuring postural sway with test–retest measurements.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The load cell-based forceplate system, being valid, reliable, portable and less-expensive instrument compared to the laboratory-graded forceplates, can be recommended for use in healthcare settings and research. Further work is needed to convert units of measurement of the load cell-based forceplate system from changes in mass to a change in displacement.</p>

<title>Evaluation of a group exercise class for stroke survivors demonstrates high attendance rates and positive changes in Timed Up and Go scores</title>
<p><bold>RJ Allen</bold></p>
<p>University of Nottingham</p>
<p><bold>LA Connell</bold></p>
<p>University of Central Lancashire</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> A novel community stroke team exercise class for stroke survivors is implemented in current practice to engage participants in ongoing rehabilitation and aims to increase independence and reduce re-referral into therapy. However, the evidence to support such interventions is sparse.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A retrospective service evaluation was conducted to determine efficacy of the intervention. Weekly group exercise based on a well-established falls prevention programme was delivered to two groups (<italic>n=</italic>9 per group) for 12 weeks. Timed Up and Go was used to provide a basic measure of balance and mobility; a score of less than 20 seconds is associated with walking speeds giving sufficient community mobility. Timed Up and Go was recorded at week 1 and week 12.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> A statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) mean decrease in Timed Up and Go of 7.37 seconds (confidence interval (CI) 4.44–10.29) from week 1 (<italic>m</italic> = 23.3 seconds, SD 13.3) to week 12 (<italic>m</italic> +16.0 seconds, SD 8.3) indicating a positive effect on Timed Up and Go for the duration of the exercise class. All participants completed at least 75% of the exercise sessions with 62% attending all sessions.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This well-attended exercise class demonstrates that group exercise is a feasible method of rehabilitation delivery in clinical practice. Although the study is small and uncontrolled, the initial analysis is positive.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted to investigate the intervention further and if found effective could be a cost-effective long-term management intervention for community-dwelling stroke survivors.</p>

<p>Northumbria University</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Video interaction guidance is an intervention designed to enhance communication within relationships by promoting reflection on successful elements of communication. This paper reports on some early evaluative data from a project implementing video interaction guidance within a specialist autism service provider in North-East England. The broad aim of the project is to equip the workforce of the service provider to be better able to build relationships with their service users.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A qualitative design with thematic analysis (Grounded Theory) was used. Four staff members from the service provider who had received video interaction guidance gave semi-structured interviews describing their experience of video interaction guidance. Three staff members were interviewed by an interviewer familiar with video interaction guidance but not involved with the project; for comparative purposes, one staff member was interviewed by a video interaction guidance practitioner from the service provider. A coding framework was developed by the first author, and refined by a team of five researchers including the second author and the main interviewer.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> Two overarching themes emerged from the data. This paper focuses on one of those themes – the ‘normalization’ of the service user. All participants reported improvements in their relationships and communication with service users which led to an altering of their perception of service users as individual people.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This is discussed in relation to prominent theoretical literature on normalization (e.g. Wolfensberger) and stigma (e.g. Goffman).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The data suggest that video interaction guidance has the potential to help facilitate a reframing of people’s perceptions of individuals with potentially stigmatizing conditions.</p>

<title>Neuropsychological rehabilitation for bipolar disorder: a single-subject research design</title>
<p><bold>F Loschiavo-Alvares, C Sediyama, L Pimenta, F Neves, H Corrêa, LF Malloy-Diniz</bold></p>
<p>Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive deficits are commonly found in neuropsychiatric diseases, and are related to impairment in productive skills, social and daily performance. The cognitive functions most impaired by the impact of multiple episodes of mood disorder and medication are verbal memory, attention and executive functions which are intrinsically related to functional performance. In studies of bipolar disorder patients’ persistent cognitive deficits are found not only in the phases of mania and depression, but also the remission of symptoms. Since such findings predict a lower quality of life they are therefore relevant to the proposed interventions in neuropsychological rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A single-subject A1-B1-A2-B2 . . . experimental design was used to investigate the efficacy of neuropsychological rehabilitation techniques according to attention, memory and executive functions impairments. The application of techniques were applied to EMB, a person with bipolar disorder, in order to give the capacity to perform her relevant activities more efficiently, and to monitor her mood variations.</p>
<p><bold>Results/findings:</bold> EMB showed positive results in qualitative measures (visual inspection of the data) and in quantitative measures (paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparisons of the baseline, interventions and follow-up (one month) phases.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This is still a preliminary study in neuropsychological rehabilitation applied to psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar disorder, which used a single-subject research design. The results above showed that individuals with bipolar disorder can benefit from a neuropsychological rehabilitation intervention, and the chosen design was sensitive enough to detect the functional gains resulting from proposed intervention.</p>
