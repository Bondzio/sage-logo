<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The four human histamine receptors—hH<sub>1</sub>R, hH<sub>2</sub>R, hH<sub>3</sub>R, and hH<sub>4</sub>R—belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (IUPHAR database [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/FamilyMenuForward?familyId=33">http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/FamilyMenuForward?familyId=33</ext-link>]). GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that characteristically consist of 7-transmembrane (7TM) alpha helices. hH<sub>1</sub>R and hH<sub>2</sub>R are successful drug targets in the treatment of allergy and peptic ulcers, respectively. The hH<sub>4</sub>R gene was cloned in 2000, and the encoded receptor protein shares 37% amino acid similarity with its closest homolog hH<sub>3</sub>R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112451922">1</xref></sup> but less than 20% similarity with hH<sub>1</sub>R and hH<sub>2</sub>R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112451922">2</xref></sup> hH<sub>4</sub>R induces immune cell chemotaxis toward histamine, which strongly links this receptor to inflammatory processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112451922">3</xref></sup> Diseases such as pruritus (itch) and rheumatoid arthritis could potentially be treated with specific hH<sub>4</sub>R-modulating ligands,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057112451922">4</xref></sup> and numerous synthetic hH<sub>4</sub>R ligands have been identified during the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057112451922">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057112451922"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112451922"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112451922"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057112451922"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112451922"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057112451922"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057112451922">12</xref></sup> Importantly, these receptor ligands are metabolized upon in vivo administration. On one hand, this may result in pharmacologically active metabolites, responsible for the actual therapeutic effect. Pro-drugs, inactive compounds that are converted into biologically active metabolites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057112451922">13</xref></sup> are widely used and include drugs such as morphine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057112451922">14</xref></sup> diazepam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112451922">15</xref></sup> and hydroxytamoxifen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112451922">16</xref></sup> In addition, pharmacologically active metabolites prolong the mode of action of drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057112451922">17</xref></sup> In contrast, addition of chemical groups to improve hydrophilicity and subsequent clearance by the kidneys can sometimes have undesirable effects. Parent drug molecules can be converted into dangerous metabolites via subtle chemical changes. Risks of metabolite formation include toxicity, change or loss of selectivity and/or functional activity, deposition/accumulation of metabolites, irreversible metabolite action, and acquired ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057112451922">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057112451922"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057112451922">20</xref></sup> Despite these significant in vivo issues, a limited amount of data is published on metabolic products of ligands and their pharmacological properties. This is related to the elaborate and costly processes of metabolite production or synthesis, purification, identification, and finally pharmacological analysis. The required safety experiments are for this reason often postponed until a later phase (ADME) in the drug discovery process before entering clinical trials. As drug metabolites are also very important for in vivo action, metabolic profiling at an early stage in drug discovery is desirable. However, this requires integrated analytical and pharmacological methodologies. Single-compound solutions can be readily analyzed in various analytical or pharmacological assays, but compound mixtures (e.g., metabolic mixtures) need to be chromatographically separated before analysis. A relatively new approach for efficient mixture profiling is the so-called nano-fractionation or high-resolution fractionation approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057112451922">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087057112451922"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087057112451922">23</xref></sup> In this approach, mixtures are separated by liquid chromatography (LC), identified in parallel by mass spectrometry (MS), and analyzed in a biochemical assay after high-resolution fractionation. This type of fractionation actually tailors the fractionation to peak shapes of eluting compounds and enables accurate correlation of identity to bioactivity. However, this approach has been demonstrated only for robust biochemical/biophysical experiments and not for cell-based signaling assays. Therefore, we have now developed an integrated methodology that incorporates the use of analytical separations and mass spectrometric identification techniques in parallel with pharmacological analysis to characterize hH<sub>4</sub>R ligand metabolites after microsomal incubations. The high-resolution fractionation in multiple plate reader formats decouples fractionation from downstream pharmacological (cell-based) assays and consequently allows multiple independent end points to be investigated and correlated. The methodology is suitable to characterize metabolites of lead candidates early in the drug discovery process. This article reports the development, evaluation, validation, and miniaturization of high-resolution fractionation followed by the in-line, cell-based, signaling-driven, cAMP-responsive element β-galactosidase (CRE β-gal) reporter gene assay, whereas the full structure identification of metabolites is discussed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087057112451922">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Liquid Chromatography for the High-Resolution Fractionation Approach</title>
<p>Fractionation of (metabolic) compound mixtures was performed using a Gilson 215 liquid handler controlled by in-house written software (“GilsLua”; source code available upon request). The liquid handler was modified to support polyetheretherketone (PEEK) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tubing on the movable arm and was programmed to fractionate eluents into 96- or 384-tissue culture plates. The connecting PEEK tubing (internal diameter of 500 µm) exiting the UV detector to the high-resolution fractionation housed a silanol-deactivated silica capillary (internal diameter of 250 µm). This capillary tip contacted the edges of the wells during high-resolution fractionations to avoid hanging drops.</p>
<p>For the separations, 100-µL injections were performed in combination with chromatographic separations using a Shimadzu LC-20AB gradient pump (Duisburg, Germany) with a Waters (Milford, MA) xBridge C18 column (5-µm particles, 4.6 × 100 mm) and guard column. Separations occurred at 30 °C; mobile phase A was an H<sub>2</sub>O–ACN–formic acid (95%-5%-0.1%) mixture and mobile phase B an H<sub>2</sub>O–ACN–formic acid (5%-95%-0.1%) mixture. The flow rate used was 0.6 mL/min with the following gradient: 5 min at 2% B, in 15 min to 20% B, then in 15 min to 83.3% B, and then in 15 min to 98% B, finalized by 5 min at 98% B. UV detection of eluting compounds was at 210 nm with a Kratos Analytical (Manchester, UK) Spectroflow 757. After fractionation, 96-well tissue culture plates in low resolution (20 s/well) and high resolution (5 s/well) or 384-well tissue culture plates in high resolution (2.5 s/well) were subjected to different solvent evaporation approaches. Custom in-house plate lids were fabricated and used to prevent loss of frozen liquid from the well plates during evaporation under vacuum (20 mbar). Resulting dried high-resolution fractions were then reconstituted in 100 µL 50 mM Tris buffer or used directly for postfractionation cell seeding in cell culture medium.</p>
<p>During the optimization phase, we developed a script that allowed for heart-cutting chromatograms (e.g., fractionate only a selected time frame) to capture 8-min windows of a chromatographic separation in a single 96-well plate (5 s/well) or two chromatograms in one 384-well plate (2.5 s/well).</p>

Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (5 activity units per mL) was added, followed by 100-µM compounds at room temperature (RT). Directly before the start of the incubations, 30 mM NADPH in 50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> buffer was prepared and the NADPH solution (10% [v/v] as compared with the starting total incubation volume) was added to the tubes at 37 °C. After 30, 60, and 90 min, additional NADPH (same volume, but a 10-mM concentration) was added to the incubations. After 2 h, 200% (v/v) as compared with the starting total incubation volume of ice-cold acetonitrile was added to all tubes followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13 000 rpm for protein precipitation. The supernatants were then transferred to new tubes and evaporated in a Savant SpeedVac (Holbrook, NY).

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Pharmacological analysis of newly designed and synthesized drugs is the first step in drug discovery. However, after in vivo administration, P450 enzymes in the liver metabolize drugs. An early assessment of possible metabolite formation and function is very important. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize a methodology to screen metabolites of potential drug molecules for pharmacological activity. A chromatographic separation approach with high-resolution fractionation was followed by a cell-based hH<sub>4</sub>R signaling assay in SK-N-MC cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087057112451922">28</xref></sup> Mass spectrometry identification was performed in parallel. We used a standard mixture to evaluate and optimize the compatibility of the analytical and pharmacological parts and to eventually validate the new methodology. Furthermore, the functional assay was miniaturized into a 384-well format for a rapid, more efficient, and cost-effective profiling. Finally, the potential of the optimized methodology was demonstrated for analysis of hH<sub>4</sub>R ligand metabolite mixtures that were formed upon incubation with liver microsomes.</p>
<p>The hH<sub>4</sub>R is a Gα<sub>i</sub> protein-coupled receptor that inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and consequently decreases cAMP production in cells, resulting in decreased cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)–driven (reporter) gene transcription. The SK-N-MC cells were stimulated with 1 µM forskolin to directly increase adenylyl cyclase activity, which is required to detect inhibitory effects of Gα<sub>i</sub> protein activity. This setup allows measurement of both hH<sub>4</sub>R-mediated agonist and inverse agonist responses (traces “a” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112451922"><bold>Figs. 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112451922"><bold>4</bold></xref>). Competitive hH<sub>4</sub>R antagonists were identified in the presence of the agonist histamine (30 nM, EC<sub>80</sub>; traces “b” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112451922"><bold>Figs. 3</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112451922"><bold>4</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Optimization of the CRE β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay Readout</title>
<p>SK-N-MC cells were seeded 24 h or 48 h before ligand stimulation in 96-well plates at 50 000 or 30 000 cells/well, respectively, to obtain a semi-confluent monolayer. Culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with 1 µM forskolin and the standard mixture of hH<sub>4</sub>R ligands. After a 6-h incubation period, the cells were lysed and the enzymatic β-galactosidase reaction with ONPG was performed at RT. However, the reaction was too slow to be measured on the same day as the ligand stimulation but too fast to allow overnight incubation (data not shown). Freezing (–20 °C) the plates denatured the β-galactosidase enzyme, whereas storage at 4 °C overnight slowed product formation but allowed convenient measurement after an additional 2- to 3-h incubation step at RT the next day.</p>

<title>Evaporation to Minimize Traces of Mobile Phase Constituents</title>
<p>The first objective was to make the chromatographic separation procedure compatible with the downstream CRE β-gal assay. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry require ACN and FA in the mobile phase. Different evaporation strategies were explored to minimize or exclude traces of mobile phase constituents and to determine the most efficient method. The 96-well plates with fractionated (20 s/well) standard mixture were subjected to three different methods and evaluated using the CRE β-gal assay: (I) direct transfer to the assay plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>), (II) evaporation under medium vacuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 1b</bold></xref>), and (III) evaporation with a nitrogen flow on a heating block at 60 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>). For approaches II and III, the constituents of the wells were redissolved in the same volume as the original fractions with 50 mM Tris-HCl and subsequently added to the cells. Evaporation under vacuum reduced the background signal and resulted in a smoother graph compared with no evaporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>b</bold></xref>). The limited capacity of only four plates per vacuum pump and desiccator and, moreover, a nonreproducible evaporation time of 24 to 48 h as well as sputtering effects (solvent sputtering sometimes out of the wells) made us decide not to continue approach II. Instead of our vacuum evaporation approach, a vacuum centrifuge could be used instead, when available. The large fluctuations caused by edge effects (more evaporation of ACN and FA) seen in approach I (but also approach II) made this approach not optimal for combining chromatographic separations to cell-based signaling assays. A 96-well nitrogen-blowing device supplemented with a heating block removed solvents after a few hours of evaporation. The drawback of this method was the edge effect fluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 1c</bold></xref>), possibly due to noncomplete evaporation of FA. Furthermore, the low throughput of one plate per run and the difficulty in creating a uniform flow over the wells prevented further testing. Finally, a freeze-drying method was tested, which had very high capacity and could be completed in an overnight run. For this, the fractionated plates were directly submitted for freeze-drying. During the freeze-drying process, the initiated evaporation cools down the solvents in the wells until they freeze (within ~5 to 15 minutes). After that, the complete freeze-drying process begins at RT until complete dryness the next morning. Our custom plate lids with a small 3-mm hole above each well facilitated freeze-drying and prevented the frozen contents of the wells to be ejected as frozen columns. Due to the combination of high capacity, convenient overnight freeze-drying, speed, and acceptable edge effects, the freeze-drying method was chosen for further optimization of the protocol. A subsequent high-resolution fractionation (5 s/well) was implemented, now over four 96-well plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2a</bold></xref>). To maintain the same concentration in the wells (resolution now increased fourfold from 20 s/well to 5 s/well), four repeated injections of the standard mixture were fractionated over the same plates. Although agonists and inverse agonists can be distinguished in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Figure 2a</bold></xref>, edge effects are still visible. FA can cause these effects, but also other constituents in the CRE β-gal assay might be responsible, such as the volatile reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. One way to cope with the edge effects was by correcting them using an algorithm. For this, the background signal from a plate column (eight wells) was measured, and subsequently the individual well deviations from the column mean were calculated. This correction was then applied to all columns of the plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2b</bold></xref>) and to all experiments performed in a 96-well format. To detect hH<sub>4</sub>R antagonists, an EC<sub>80</sub> concentration (30 nM) of the agonist histamine was added to each well of the same standard mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2c</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Direct Plating Minimizes Pipetting</title>
<p>Routinely, freeze-dried fractions are redissolved and subsequently added to the preplated cells. However, this requires an additional pipetting step with associated error and time issues. Therefore, our next objective was to minimize the number of pipetting steps between fractionation and the CRE β-gal assay. To this end, the cells were seeded directly in the freeze-dried plates without prior redissolving of fractionated compounds/metabolites, so-called direct plating. An additional advantage was that the complete well content was used for screening, resulting in higher compound/metabolite concentrations. To ensure similar cell densities as in the preplating protocol, the cells were seeded at ~80 000 cells/well in 100 µL/well. The advantage of this protocol was that it provided more consistent compound amounts per well, circumvented an aspiration and pipetting step, allowed easier automation, and the entire assay could be performed within 24 hours. A potential concern of the direct plating approach is the redissolving capacity of the fractionated metabolite mixtures. Since we used compounds that contained protonated nitrogen atoms and their relatively polar metabolites, we did not have solubility problems. When working with very nonpolar compounds, however, or compounds known to have difficulty dissolving in aqueous solution, adding a small amount of 10% DMSO into the wells (with, for example, a contactless micropipetting/spotting robot or by post–column infusion during separation) before fractionation will ensure good solubility since a film layer of DMSO will be formed in the wells after evaporation. Cell morphology and adherence were monitored by microscopy. No decrease in cell viability or adherence was apparent between normal and direct plating. Furthermore, the CRE β-gal assay was also not affected by this direct plating method. We performed the CRE β-gal assay for the ~10- to 30-min time frame (two 96-well plates) of the chromatographic run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2d</bold></xref>). The direct plating protocol gives similar results as the transfer plating protocol. Concentration-response curves of the hH<sub>4</sub>R agonists histamine, clobenpropit, and clozapine were analyzed in the direct plating protocol to evaluate their potency values. The pEC<sub>50</sub> values (histamine, 8.1 ± 0.02; clobenpropit, 7.7 ± 0.1; clozapine, 6.8 ± 0.02) were comparable with previously reported data in the same SK-N-MC cell line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087057112451922">26</xref></sup> The introduction of direct plating of living cells in freeze-dried plates requires less manipulation and is a major advantage for both assay duration and the ability to automate the process by use of robotics. For our purposes, it is also very well suited for hyphenation approaches to chromatographic separations. Moreover, the direct plating protocol yields higher compound concentrations in the wells as compared with the transfer plating approach.</p>

<sec id="section14-1087057112451922">
<title>Miniaturization of the CRE β-Galactosidase Assay</title>
<p>The direct plating approach allowed miniaturization of the assay into 384-well plates as well as a further increase in fractionation resolution to 2.5 s/well (previously 5 s/well). Moreover, this resulted in an entire chromatographic fractionation run on a single plate. After freeze-dry evaporation, 20 000 cells/well were added in 50 µL/well serum-free culture medium to achieve similar compound concentrations and assay conditions as in the 96-well format. The fractionation was performed in an outward spiraling motion to keep ligands close to the center of the plate and to have stable background signals. This spiral fractionation also minimized edge effects and omitted the need for correction of these. The 384-well CRE β-gal assay results of the standard mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>; chromatographic time frame of 13–29 min was recorded) were comparable to those obtained in a 96-well format (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2d</bold></xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 3a</bold></xref>, agonist mode; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 2c</bold></xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112451922"><bold>Fig. 3b</bold></xref>, antagonist mode).

<p>One 384-well plate can accommodate a 16-min fractionation collection at 2.5 s/well. Considering that parent drug and its metabolites generally elute within 10 min on the column used by us, two metabolic profiling runs of 8 min can be analyzed on the same plate. Consequently, one complete functional characterization can be performed on a single 384-plate, with one run in agonist (without histamine) and the other in antagonist mode (in the presence of 30 nM/EC<sub>80</sub> histamine).</p>

<p>Four hH<sub>4</sub>R ligands were selected based on (I) high activity of the parent ligand in the functional assay and (II) at least one active metabolite. The four ligands represent a selection of different scaffolds known as tricyclic dibenzodiazepines (clozapine), quinoxalines (VUF10148; ligand 1), and sulfonamide-substituted quinazolines (VUF11488; ligand 2 and VUF10519; ligand 3).

Previous research has shown that desmethylclozapine (norclozapine) is the predominant metabolite of clozapine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087057112451922">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087057112451922">31</xref></sup> Norclozapine was identified as a partial agonist for dopamine D<sub>2</sub>–dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization via Gα<sub>q/o</sub>. Interestingly, clozapine was not active in this assay. In contrast, at 5-HT1a, norclozapine appeared to be a partial agonist with higher efficacy than clozapine, as measured in [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTPγS, ERK1/2 phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087057112451922">32</xref></sup> Other metabolic products reported are clozapine N-oxide, a hydroxylated metabolite and a protein-reactive metabolite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087057112451922">33</xref></sup> Previously, several methods have been reported in which clozapine and its metabolites were identified. In agreement with our results, the majority of methods measure clozapine and norclozapine, and only a few approaches identify clozapine N-oxide as well (e.g., Volpicelli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087057112451922">33</xref></sup>).

<p>As shown for the four hH<sub>4</sub>R compounds used to demonstrate the methodology in the miniaturized 384-well format with the direct plating approach, the data readily allow assessment of bioactivities of the metabolites. Moreover, the freeze-dried well plates can in theory be used in other different cell-based and/or biochemical assays. Although the current results show the application of our approach to the identification of metabolites of four model compounds, the system can easily be applied to other agonists/antagonists of the H<sub>4</sub> receptor. The MS identification strategy is very much independent of the bioactivity assessment, meaning that any commonly available strategy of MS identification of metabolites can be applied to identify other ligands and their metabolites as well.</p>
<p>In summary, we developed a new high-resolution in-line methodology for the functional analysis of biologically active GPCR ligand mixtures, specially focused on metabolic mixture analysis. Analytical separation strategies and high-resolution fractionation techniques were combined with a mammalian cell-based hH<sub>4</sub>R signaling assay. Hyphenation of the analytical part with the cell-based hH<sub>4</sub>R signaling assay was achieved after a number of evaluation, optimization, and validation steps. First, we minimized traces of mobile phase constituents by a freeze-dry evaporation step. Second, a direct plating protocol was introduced to minimize liquid handling. Finally, we miniaturized both the analytic fractionation (2.5 s/well) and CRE β-gal assay to 384-well formats. The optimized methodology was demonstrated with four hH<sub>4</sub>R ligand metabolic mixtures. These data readily allowed rapid assessment of altered bioactivities (functional efficacy) for the metabolites formed. Parallel mass spectrometric analysis was done to identify metabolite structures and correlate them to their bioactivities.</p>
