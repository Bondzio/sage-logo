<p>Cardiac injuries include direct penetrating wounds to the pericardium and to the heart itself. They are of high emergency, and the prognosis depends on the location, the importance of the lesion, and mainly the early management.<sup>

<title>Pediatric Surgery Department of the Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital</title>
<p>Lomé, with a population of 837,437 (Metro population 1,570,283), is the capital and largest city of Togo. Located on the Gulf of Guinea, Lomé is the country’s administrative and industrial center and its chief port. The pediatric surgery department is the only department where children from 0 to 15 years are operated. This service does not have its own operating theater, so adults and children are operated in the same theater. This department has three qualified pediatric surgeons. There is no specialized pediatric anesthetist. However, there are four anesthetist physicians in the team working in the operating rooms, but they are trained in general anesthesia (adults and children). It is not possible to perform diagnostic procedures or examinations such as chest x-ray or cardiac ultrasonography in the operating room. To realize those examinations, the patient is obliged to move to the radiology department or to go in some private clinics in the town in order to realize cardiac ultrasonography.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 10-year-old male child, a student, was admitted to the surgical emergency unit of Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital on April 16, 2012, with a penetrating traumatic injury on the left part of the chest caused by a knife. When quarreling with his younger brother aged six years, the victim was stabbed with a table knife of medium size with a pointed end. It is likely that the wound bled abundantly before the child was admitted to the surgical emergency department two hours after the chest trauma.</p>
<p>Upon his admission at Surgical Emergencies Service, the child’s heart stopped beating twice, probably because of cardiac tamponade. Emergency resuscitative care was rapidly started (wide bore intravenous cannula, colloid administration, ABO blood grouping and cross match, blood transfusion, and administration of adrenaline).</p>
<p>Following initial resuscitation, the clinical examination was noteworthy for:</p>

</fig>
<p>We diagnosed a cardiac injury complicated by hemopericardium. A thoracotomy was immediately indicated. Because of the emergency and the very precarious technical platform, no paraclinical tests were done (no chest x-ray, no cardiac ultrasonography, and no chest computed tomography). At 1.5 hours after admission and approximately 3 hours following the occurrence of the injury, the victim was in the operating theater where resuscitation and intensive care were continued.</p>
<p>Inspection of the injury confirmed a 2-cm linear wound, deep, with well-defined edges, localized at the fourth left intercostal space. We suspected that the knife had penetrated the heart. We proceeded to perform an anterior intercostal thoracotomy, starting by enlarging the traumatic wound. Hemostasis was achieved progressively, and the wound was held open by a self-retaining retractor because of the lack of an appropriate-sized Finochietto rib spreader (the one available was too big for the child). Upon opening the pericardium, exploration revealed a left ventricle injury with black blood spurting out. It was a 1.5-cm single injury of the left ventricle. We achieved a myocardiorraphy with 3-0 polypropylene sutures, using multiple widely spaced stitches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135113481043">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>There was a large collection of black blood within the mediastinum. It was aspirated, and the chest was then copiously irrigated with saline solution. Two drains were left in place when closing the chest; one in the pericardial space and the second in the mediastinum. The patient was hospitalized for 72 hours in the surgical intensive care unit before being transferred to the pediatric surgery department’s ward. After the intervention, the patient received a blood transfusion (500 cm<sup>3</sup> of packed red blood cells, type O+), antibiotics (ceftriaxone), and antalgics (paracetamol). The drains were removed 48 hours after thoracotomy. The early postoperative period was favorable.</p>
<p>An electrocardiogram performed 16 days after the operation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no extrasystoles. Twenty days after operation, the wound was healed and the patient was authorized to go home. He was followed up three months after release from the hospital; no complications and aftereffects were noticed. An echocardiogram performed approximately seven months after the injury showed no abnormalities in relation to the cardiac trauma.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Penetrating injury to the heart is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113481043">7</xref>
</sup> In children, it is dramatic and frequently fatal. Cardiac wounds have been reported more frequently in boys than in girls, with a mean age of 12 years in the study of Göz et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135113481043">8</xref>
</sup> Various causes of cardiac injury other than knife wounds were reported such as gun injuries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135113481043">4</xref>
</sup> and accidental impalement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135113481043">6</xref>
</sup> Cardiac injury is a medicosurgical emergency, which should benefit from very early management. An early diagnosis might reduce the mortality of cardiac injuries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113481043">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135113481043">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Even in developed countries with well-equipped hospital structures and specialized teams, cardiac injuries often had a bad prognosis and the rate of mortality among children with cardiac injuries was 5.9% in the report of Göz et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135113481043">8</xref>
</sup> Survival depends on many factors: timely transport and admission to hospital, the hospital equipment level (cardiovascular surgery platform), and the location and extent of the injury to the pericardium and to the heart itself, especially with respect to the coronary arteries.</p>
<p>The time interval from injury to admission and surgical management (3.5 hours) was relatively short in our case, compared to Nwiloh et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135113481043">10</xref>
</sup> who reported the case of a patient operated three days after a cardiac injury. The relatively short time interval from injury to treatment of our patient stands in contrast with realities in developing countries in general and with sub-Saharan countries in particular. In fact, in developing countries, there is very often too much time wasted before the patient is admitted to the hospital for definitive management. There is very often a late management because of the lack of financial means; medical care must be paid for by the parents.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious value of paraclinical diagnostic studies such as chest x-ray and cardiac ultrasonography, the limited availability of such studies in poorly resourced environments may significantly delay definitive treatment. This requires that diagnosis must often be reached expeditiously on the basis of clinical examination. Therefore, the surgeon may be required to reach a decision to proceed with urgent thoracotomy in cases of penetrating chest trauma without the benefit of imaging studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135113481043">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The vital prognosis of cardiac injuries can be ensured by an early diagnosis, the resuscitation intensive care, and the urgent thoracotomy. Our case report shows that it is possible to save a patient having a cardiac injury even in underprivileged classes like ours.</p>
