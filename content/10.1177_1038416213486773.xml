<abstract>
<p>It is important to understand the factors that can contribute to quality of life in retirees. Accessing latent benefits, which are generally associated with paid employment, has been shown to increase quality of life. It is proposed that meaningful leisure may act as a substitute for paid employment in retirees. A sample of 123 male and female participants living in 8 different retirement villages in Queensland, Australia, were assessed using the Latent and Manifest Benefits Scale, the World Health Organisation Quality of Life scale and the Meaningful Leisure Activity Questionnaire to examine the role of meaningful leisure activity on access to latent benefits and perceived quality of life. Results showed that during retirement, access to the five latent benefits of time structure, shared experiences, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity is positively related to quality of life. Results demonstrated that only collective purpose mediated the relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life. Further, meaningful leisure was positively related to quality of life. The implications of these results are discussed.</p>

<p>Foundational and contemporary career theories identify retirement as an important stage in a person's career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1038416213486773">Super, 1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1038416213486773">1990</xref>). Retirement typically marks the end of a person's paid employment; however, many people go on to use the skills and experiences developed during employment to enable a meaningful transition into retirement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1038416213486773">Gallagher (2004)</xref> refers to this as a renewal process. Retirement can be a time of great happiness, relaxation and personal growth, a time which allows “re-engagement with the opportunity for self exploration and self enhancement as well as the integration and interaction of life roles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1038416213486773">Chen, 2011</xref>, p.33). Research, however, also shows that retirement can be a career stage that is characterized by psychological distress and a lowered perception of life quality as people move into a time of potential physical decline and a life stage where they feel they are no longer contributing meaningfully to society, engaging in purposeful activities and report a decline in social contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1038416213486773">Nuttman-Shwartz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Australia, the number of retirees is growing faster than any other group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1038416213486773">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2006</xref>). As such, it is becoming increasingly important to understand factors that can help sustain or improve quality of life in retirees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213486773">Bowling and colleagues (2002)</xref> conceptualize “quality of life” in retirement as physical and mental well-being and functioning, independence and control, good material circumstances and a supportive external environment. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda's (1981)</xref> Latent Benefit Theory and meaningful leisure in promoting quality of life during retirement.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1038416213486773"><title>Latent benefit theory and its application to retirement</title>
<p>In her seminal research on the relationship between employment and life quality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda (1981)</xref> found that employment provides five functions that are important contributors to well-being: (1) time structure, (2) shared experiences, (3) identity, (4) collective purpose and (5) enforced activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda (1981)</xref> suggested that beyond the manifest function of income, employment also offers latent benefits such as an activity around which people have to structure their time (e.g., around work hours), contacts with people outside immediate family and a sense of purpose transcending one's own. She argued that employment also defines aspects of identity and creates tasks that provide a sense of enforced activity as most jobs require people to stretch themselves by engaging in tasks and responsibilities that they might not ordinarily choose to engage in. There is considerable evidence to support this theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1038416213486773">Creed &amp; Macintyre, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1038416213486773">Creed, Muller, &amp; Machin, 2001</xref>). The research generally shows that, without employment, many people have lost a major activity around which to structure their time, they have less access to social contacts, engage in few activities that contribute to a bigger social purpose and they lose their professional identity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda's (1981)</xref> theory also suggests that when people have limited access to the latent benefits of employment, this leads to an increase in psychological distress which has again been supported empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213486773">Evans &amp; Haworth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1038416213486773">Haworth &amp; Ducker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213486773">Hepworth, 1980</xref>). This latent benefits theory has considerable implications to understanding quality of life upon retirement.</p>
<p>Although the latent benefits theory has not been directly applied to retired samples, existing research does suggest that when retirees have access to one or more of the latent benefits, this is positively related to quality of life. For example, the latent benefits of activity and sociality have each been positively related to life satisfaction during retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1038416213486773">Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1038416213486773">Nimrod, 2007</xref>), adjustment to retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1038416213486773">Rosenkoetter &amp; Garris, 1998</xref>), well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1038416213486773">Litwin &amp; Shiovitz-Erza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1038416213486773">McKee, Harrison, &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486773">Rowe, 2001</xref>) and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213486773">Bowling et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1038416213486773">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213486773">Gabriel &amp; Bowling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1038416213486773">Janssen, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1038416213486773">Bowling et al. (2003)</xref> found “social relationships” to be the most common theme identified by elderly people as contributing to good quality of life, followed by “social roles and activities” and other “activities done alone.” However, to date, there has been no research that has applied the full latent benefit theory or the five latent constructs to retirement. As such, whilst we know about the positive impact of one or two of the latent benefits on quality of life during retirement, the research in this field has not explored the relationship between quality of life and all five latent benefits. The current study will apply the latent benefit theory to retirement. On the basis of past research, Hypothesis 1 is proposed.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: During retirement, access to the five latent benefits of time structure, shared experiences, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity will be positively related to quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1038416213486773"><title>The role of leisure on quality of life during retirement</title>
<p>In considering the application of the latent benefit theory to retirement, the question arises as to whether retired people can find other activities, once they are no longer in paid employment, that are able to provide them with access to the five latent benefits. Certainly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda (1981)</xref> acknowledged that there must be institutions other than employment that provide the same latent benefits. She suggested that leisure and volunteer activities were two potential substitutes to employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213486773">Evans and Haworth (1991)</xref> suggested that the way in which leisure activities might promote psychological health when people are without employment is by partially fulfilling the latent benefits of employment nominated by Jahoda. This raises the question as to whether leisure might be an avenue that provides retirees with time structure, shared experiences, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity.</p>
<p>The beneficial role of leisure upon outcome measures such as well-being, life satisfaction and quality of life has received considerable research attention in the field of retirement studies. Interestingly, the research suggests that it is not leisure in and of itself that promotes quality of life, nor is it simply the frequency with which leisure is engaged in, but rather it is the nature of, or meaning attached to, leisure that promotes quality of life during retirement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1038416213486773">Russell (1987)</xref> found that frequency of participation in recreational activity had no significant positive relationship to life satisfaction in retirement, whereas recreation satisfaction did. These findings were supported in a later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1038416213486773">Russell (1990)</xref>, suggesting that measuring the value individuals place on their activity is far more important than simply enumerating frequency of participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213486773">Lennartsson and Silverstein (2001)</xref> found that engagement in “meaningful” and productive activities can promote health and decrease mortality later in life.</p>
<p>In line with the above researchers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486773">Waters and Moore (1999)</xref> argued that an objective indicator of leisure, such as leisure frequency, has little bearing on mental well-being. For this reason, they developed the Meaningful Leisure Activities Questionnaire which allows participants to not only list their most meaningful leisure activity but also to rate how important, social, satisfying, rewarding and interesting that activity is and how much they believe other people appreciate their involvement in that activity. In a sample of unemployed people, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486773">Waters and Moore (1999)</xref> found that the meaning attained through leisure activities was significantly related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda's (1981)</xref> five latent benefits. Moreover, meaningful leisure, through its direct effect on latent benefits, had an indirect and positive effect on psychological health in unemployed participants. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486773">Waters and Moore (1999)</xref> did not use a retired sample, both unemployed and retired samples share a similar situation of a life without employment and thus are dependent on finding other activities with which to meaningfully fill their time in order to foster a high quality of life. The research described above, leads to hypothesis 2.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Meaningful leisure will be directly and positively related to quality of life in a retired sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1038416213486773"><title>The relationship between meaningful leisure and latent benefits</title>
<p>Given the established relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life, researchers have turned their attention to what underpins this relationship to gain a better understanding about what it is about meaningful leisure that promotes quality of life. This type of inquiry is important in terms of its potential practical applications. For example, it is useful to be able to educate retirees that leisure, particularly meaningful leisure, will be a beneficial activity to engage in during retirement. However, it is more instructive to be able to assist retirees to identify the underlying elements of an activity that are likely to make the leisure meaningful. This idea supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486773">Csikszentmihalyi's (1997)</xref> argument that, “leisure won't improve quality of life unless one knows how to use it effectively” (p. 65). Csikszentmihalyi suggests that without goals and without social interaction, people begin to lose connection. Further, Csikszentmihalyi suggests that humans feel best when involved in activities that produce “flow” because there are clear goals, rules and immediate feedback which make it clear how well the individual is succeeding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle (2001)</xref> argues that leisure is meaningful when it allows satisfaction of social needs such as affiliation, close relationships, status, cooperation, competence and altruism. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle (2001)</xref> maintains, leisure is intrinsically motivated, because it provides its own rewards such as perceived freedom from restraints. Interestingly, components of intrinsic motivation including self-determination, competence and challenge have been found to be positively related to quality of life in individuals aged 57–92 years living in retirement communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1038416213486773">Guinn, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we build on the arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486773">Csikszentmihalyi (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle (2001)</xref> and combine their argument with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486773">Jahoda's (1981)</xref> latent benefits theory to suggest that leisure will be perceived as meaningful if it fulfils the five latent benefits of time structure, shared experiences, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity. Under this logic, we argue that not all leisure activities during retirement will promote quality of life. For example, whilst watching television may give a sense of relaxation and may even be educational, if it is a retired person's main leisure activity, we would not see it contributing significantly to a person's quality of life as it is unlikely to be an activity that contributes to the person's identity nor a sense of collective purpose. Instead, we suggest that when a leisure activity (e.g. studying at the University of the 3rd Age, belonging to the local environmental group, Church) provides people with a reason to structure their daily/weekly routine, it allows them to contribute to a purpose beyond themselves. Further, it obliges them to engage in activities they otherwise might not engage in, allows them to share the activity with others and contributes to their identity. Thus, leisure that is meaningful is then likely to have a positive contribution to quality of life. The five latent benefits align with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486773">Csikszentmihalyi's (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle's (2001)</xref> notions that leisure is most meaningful when it has elements such as social interaction, status and purpose built into it.</p>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Access to the five latent benefits will mediate the relationships between meaningful leisure and quality of life.</p>
<p>As discussed, meaningful activity provides benefits that can help improve quality of life. In the current study, we suggest that this may be due to the fact that meaningful leisure provides retirees with access to the latent benefits that typically come with employment. We also propose that access to the latent benefits of employment (time structure, social contact, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity) will be positively associated with quality of life. This study is the first to empirically test the interrelationships between meaningful leisure activity, latent benefits and quality of life during retirement. Following the literature above, this study adopts a phenomenological approach and assesses the subjective meaning people attach to leisure rather than following the traditional research approach of assessing the frequency with which people engage in leisure.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1038416213486773" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the study were 123 residents of eight different retirement villages in Queensland and were residing in “independent living,” or “self-care” units, which provide the lowest level of care in retirement living. The villages selected shared similar socio-economic<?tlsb?> status, accommodation, facilities, management and community living environment. The final sample of retirees included 52 men, 64 women and 7 not specified. The mean age of retirees was 80.0 (SD = 7.11), with an age range of 56–96 years. The mean age of years in retirement was 21.6 years (SD = 9.5) with 94% being voluntarily retired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1038416213486773" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was cross-sectional and involved distributing questionnaires to each of the retirement villages. A pilot study was conducted to test the appropriateness of the survey. Participation was voluntary and completed questionnaires were accepted as an expression of consent. As such, there is no way for the researchers to determine whether there was a selection bias on the sample. It may be that those residents who were engaging in more meaningful leisure self-selected into this study. This methodological flaw needs to be considered when examining the results of the study.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1038416213486773"><title>Quality of life (Australian WHOQoL-BREF)</title>
<p>The WHOQoL-BREF devised by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1038416213486773">WHOQOL GROUP (1998)</xref> was used to measure quality of life. The Australian WHOQoL-BREF is the shortened version of the WHOQoL-100 and is suitable for populations where long testing is inappropriate, such as the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213486773">Murphy, Herrman, Hawthorne, Pinzone, &amp; Evert, 2000</xref>). It is a 26-item questionnaire measuring the broad ranging concept of quality of life, in regard to four domains of physical health, social relationships, environment and psychological well-being, as well as two global items. Each item is measured on a five-point Likert scale from “Not at all or very dissatisfied” to “Extremely or very satisfied.” An example of a global item is “How would you rate your quality of life.” Scores range from 1 to 100 with a higher score indicating better quality of life. The total quality of life was used for this study. Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranges from .68 to .87 for each of the domains, and each domain has excellent test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213486773">Murphy et al., 2000</xref>). Three items in the WHOQoL-BREF were reverse scored.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1038416213486773"><title>The Latent and Manifest Benefits Scale</title>
<p>The Latent and Manifest Benefits Scale (LAMB; Muller, Creed, Waters, &amp; Machin, 2005) was used to measure access to the latent and manifest benefits usually attributed to employment. It is regarded as a reliable and valid measure and has been used in a number of international studies with a large number of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1038416213486773">Muller &amp; Waters, 2012</xref>). The latent benefits are collective purpose, social contact, status, time structure and enforced activity, and the single manifest benefit is financial strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213486773">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). It is a 36-item questionnaire, based on a seven-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 1 to 7, where 1 is the least access to the benefit and 7 is the greatest access. Sample items include, “I often have nothing to do” (Time Structure) and “I often meet new people” (Social Contact). Financial strain was omitted from this study as it was considered that many retirees would not like to answer questions about money and it would significantly reduce participation. Further, we were primarily interested in the latent benefits and their relationship to quality of life. Each sub-scale has sound internal reliability, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from .76 to .93.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1038416213486773"><title>The meaningful leisure activities questionnaire</title>
<p>The meaningful leisure activities questionnaire (MLAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486773">Waters &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>) was used to assess the degree of meaning that individuals attach to leisure, covering two domains of solitary and social leisure activities. Participants were asked to nominate their most meaningful social activity (activities done with friends) and solitary activity (activities done alone) in the last month. Respondents were then asked to rate these activities along six dimensions which were sociality, satisfaction, feedback from others, importance, goal achievement and interest. Each item was answered on a seven-point Likert scale, for example 1 (“Not important”) to 7 (“Extremely important”). An example item would be to rate their activity on “How social would you rate this activity in the sense of doing the activity with other people? (Sociality).” The total scores for self-nominated social and solitary meaningful activities were combined to form a total score for meaningful leisure activity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was α = .81<!--[placement id="ACD486773-fig1"]--></p>

<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: During retirement, access to the five latent benefits of time structure, social contact, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity will be positively related to quality of life.</p>
<p>A correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between five latent benefits (time structure, social contact, identity, collective purpose and enforced activity) and quality of life. Furthermore, quality of life scores were regressed onto the five latent benefits (F [5, 117] = 4.442, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.160), however, only collective purpose significantly predicted quality of life scores, <italic>b</italic> = 0.401, <italic>t</italic>(117) = 2.460, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015, 95% CI [0.078, 0.723].</p>

<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Access to the five latent benefits will mediate the relationships between meaningful leisure and quality of life.</p>
<p>The criteria set out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1038416213486773">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> was used to determine whether there was a mediating effect of the latent benefits on the relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1038416213486773">Figure 1</xref>). The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between Meaningful Leisure and Quality of Life scores (c path, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), between Meaningful Leisure and Collective Purpose (a path, <italic>p</italic> = 0.045) and between Collective Purpose and Quality of Life scores (b path, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1038416213486773">Table 3</xref>). However, after controlling for the effects of the mediator (Collective Purpose), Meaningful Leisure remains predictive of Quality of Life scores (c' path, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), suggesting support for partial mediation (i.e. both Meaningful Leisure and Collective Purpose predict Quality of Life Scores). As none of the other latent factors were found to have a significant relationship with both Quality of Life scores and Meaningful Leisure, they do not meet the criteria for mediation.

<sec id="sec14-1038416213486773" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to empirically test the interrelationships between meaningful leisure activity, latent benefits and quality of life during retirement. The study found support for Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2 and partial support for Hypothesis 3.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1038416213486773"><title>Latent benefits and quality of life</title>
<p>Results indicate that retirees have access to the latent benefits of employment and that a greater access to latent benefits is related to a greater perceived quality of life, thus supporting Hypothesis 1. Of the latent benefits, collective purpose was found to be the only significant unique predictor of quality of life. This result could be explained because of the community atmosphere that is fostered by living in a retirement village, consistent with the research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213486773">Creed and Watson (2003)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1038416213486773"><title>Meaningful leisure and quality of life</title>
<p>In the current study, meaningful leisure was directly and positively related to quality of life in the retired sample. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486773">Csikszentmihalyi's (1997)</xref> idea of “flow,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1038416213486773">Stebbins' (2004)</xref> notions of reward and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle's (2001)</xref> ideas of identity and purpose help to explain the relationship between greater internal meaning and better quality of life. These elements have been shown to provide opportunities for self-determination and self-development, achievement, confidence and competence, feelings of affiliation, belongingness and social support, which can subsequently help to improve quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1038416213486773"><title>Latent benefits as a mediator between meaningful leisure and quality of life</title>
<p>The importance of meaningful leisure lies with the fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle (2001)</xref> argues, that leisure is intrinsically motivating because it provides its own rewards such as perceived freedom from restraints. Components of intrinsic motivation, similar to the internal meaning prescribed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486773">Waters and Moore (1999)</xref>, have also been found to be positively related to quality of life in individuals living in retirement villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1038416213486773">Guinn, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486773">Csikszentmihalyi (1997)</xref> suggested, humans feel best when involved in activities that produce “flow” because there are clear goals, rules and immediate feedback which makes it clear how well the individual is succeeding. As these are very similar to the aspects of meaningful leisure, this helps to explain why it is such an important predictor of quality of life. Additionally, meaningful leisure was correlated with total latent scores, highlighting its link between enforced activity, time structure, social support, collective purpose and identity. This further supports the argument that meaningful leisure improves quality of life and is related to increased access to some of the latent benefits. Meaningful leisure could arguably be acting as a substitute for employment in terms of its ability to provide access to some of the latent benefits. Furthermore, purposeful use of spare time, such as involvement in meaningful leisure activity, may play a buffering role to prevent experiences of psychological distress, which may emerge from being unemployed or retired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1038416213486773">Winefield, Tiggemann, &amp; Winefield, 1992</xref>). Employment inevitably provides the benefits of time structure, enforced activity and collective purpose and when an individual is no longer working, he or she must actively seek such structure and purpose. Hence, in the present study, involvement in activities high on internal meaning most probably provided access to the latent benefits, which subsequently promoted perceptions of high quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1038416213486773"><title>Why was purpose so important?</title>
<p>Retirees who have a sense of purpose in their lives have better quality of life. Collective purpose offers retirees meaning. In the positive psychology literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1038416213486773">Wong (1989)</xref> argues that successful aging is related to a zest for life and clear meaning and purpose. He proposed that personal meaning is the hidden dimension of successful aging, because having a positive meaning and purpose in life will not only add years to one's life but also add life to one's years.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1038416213486773">Seligman (2002)</xref>, in his work in positive psychology, would also endorse the view that without exception, happy people were more likely to demonstrate altruism. The importance of altruism is also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486773">Argyle (2001)</xref>. Conceivably, altruism is a component of collective purpose, doing things for a bigger purpose transcending one's own. In his more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1038416213486773">Seligman (2011)</xref> highlights the importance of “purpose in life or meaning,” as one of the five elements along with positive emotion, engagement, relationships and accomplishment (PERMA) which people need to flourish. Together, purpose and meaning are positively related to quality of life and fostering such will have positive psychological benefits for retirees.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1038416213486773"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Strengths of this study relate to the importance of measuring subjective meaning of an activity rather than trying to measure activity participation as an objective construct. Previous studies have measured activity participation by enumerating frequency of involvement and by providing a list of activities that participants may or may not be involved in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1038416213486773">Glass, de Leon, Marottoli, &amp; Berkman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213486773">Lennartsson &amp; Silverstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1038416213486773">Litwin &amp; Shiovitz-Erza, 2006</xref>). This study, however, acknowledged that leisure activity may mean something different to each individual, and the meaning ascribed to an activity varies depending on the intrinsic motivations and goals of the individual. Hence, the MLAQ was used to assess the meaning that each participant attached to their leisure rather than the frequency in which they engaged in leisure.</p>
<p>There were some methodological limitations in the current study, which future researchers would benefit from addressing. Namely, future researchers could broaden the scope of the study to include retirees from the general population and individuals who are more recently retired. There may have been some selection bias in the current sample given all participants were residing in, albeit a variety of, retirement villages. In addition, future researchers exploring predictors of quality of life in an aged population may benefit from using a quality of life scale aimed at older adults, such as the WHOQoL-OLD Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1038416213486773">Power, Quinn, &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>) or the Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213486773">Bowling, 2009</xref>). These questionnaires were in the process of being developed at the time of data collection in the current study and have recently been demonstrated to have adequate levels of reliability and validity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1038416213486773"><title>Future endeavours</title>
<p>As the aging population continues to grow, greater stress is placed on existing systems including the economy, policies, programs and services, which will need to change to support the changing values, behaviours and attitudes of an older population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1038416213486773">Rosenkoetter &amp; Garris, 1998</xref>). Determining which, if any, benefits a retired individual is lacking will help the management of retirement villages to initiate interventions to improve conditions and experiences in the village and consequently increase residents’ quality of life. In general, local councils and government agencies could provide a wider variety of meaningful leisure activities for all retirees and aim to ensure that retirees have a sense of purpose in their lives. Furthermore, identifying such factors can lead to creating preventative measures to preserve health and arguably decrease health-care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1038416213486773">Rosenkoetter &amp; Garris, 1998</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec21-1038416213486773"><title>Theory and practice</title>
<sec id="sec22-1038416213486773"><title>Theoretically, what is the significance of this study?</title>
<p><bold>Answer: </bold>The literature demonstrates that employment offers individuals several latent benefits that improve perceived quality of life. Without employment, it has been shown that people lose a major activity around which to structure their time, they have less access to social contacts, engage in few activities that contribute to a bigger social purpose and they lose their professional identity. Thus, quality of life can be diminished during unemployment. The research has also shown that quality of life can be improved via engagement in meaningful leisure activities. Prior to the current study, the question remained as to whether or not individuals in a different form of unemployment (i.e. retirement) have access to these latent benefits and how this may be related to participation in meaningful leisure and overall quality of life. This study is the first to empirically test the interrelationships between meaningful leisure activity, latent benefits and quality of life during retirement. Results in the current study indicate that retirees have access to the latent benefits of employment and that a greater access to latent benefits is related to a greater perceived quality of life. In addition, meaningful leisure was directly and positively related to quality of life in the retired sample, and collective purpose mediated the relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1038416213486773"><title>Does access to the five latent benefits explain the relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life?</title>
<p><bold>Answer: </bold>No. In the current study, only collective purpose mediated the relationship between meaningful leisure and quality of life. The importance of having meaning and a sense of purpose has long been acknowledged as a major contributor to successful aging and survival more generally. Having a sense of purpose is argued, on an existential level, to provide individuals with a reason to survive. Such reasons may include doing so for the benefits of others (i.e. altruism) in order to transcend one's own potential losses or despair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1038416213486773"><title>What are the practical implications of this study?</title>
<p><bold>Answer: </bold>As the aging population continues to grow, greater stress is placed on existing systems including the economy, policies, programs and services, which will need to change to support the changing values, behaviours and attitudes of an older population. Determining which, if any, latent benefits a retired individual is lacking will help the management of retirement villages to initiate interventions to improve conditions and experiences in the village and consequently increase residents' quality of life. This may include providing opportunities for retirees to engage in meaningful leisure activities that encourage a sense of purpose.</p>
