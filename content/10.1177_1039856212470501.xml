<abstract>
<sec id="section1-1039856212470501">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine which psychiatric symptoms were associated with a defence of unsoundness of mind for serious violent offences.</p></sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856212470501">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>The study included psychiatric reports provided by forensic psychiatrists from the High Secure Inpatient Service for patients found to have a mental health defence by the Mental Health Court between June 2004 and June 2009.</p></sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856212470501">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The defence of unsoundness of mind was invariably associated with psychotic symptoms. All reports concluded that the patient was deprived of knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act. Patients found to be additionally deprived of the capacity to understand their actions suffered delusional beliefs about the identity of the victim. The symptoms that resulted in a small number of patients being considered deprived of the capacity to control their actions were mixed, but approximately a third suffered passivity phenomena.</p></sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856212470501">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Psychiatrists should be specific about how the patient’s symptoms link to any deprivation of capacity. Report writers could comment upon the presence or absence of Axis II conditions and the likely impact of any substances in the patient’s system at the time of the offence.</p></sec>

<body>
<p>The insanity defence has been a controversial area that has engaged the minds of not only those working within psychiatry and the legal system but also the whole community due to the reverberating impact of violence. In law, the moral question of blameworthiness is at issue.</p>
<p>Pivotal to the insanity defence in all jurisdictions is the presence of a mental condition. It is this criterion that leads the courts to consult with mental health professionals, with the caveat that what constitutes a mental condition in the insanity defence is not necessarily a medical or psychiatric diagnosis but a legal conception.</p>
<p>The Australian context draws extensively from English case law, in a judgement delivered in 1843 and referred to as the M’Naghten Rules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212470501">1</xref></sup> articulated as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he jury ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that, to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved, that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212470501">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Disease of the mind was clarified in <italic>R v Radford</italic> (1985) as:<disp-quote>
<p>… an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind, be it of long or short duration and be it permanent or temporary, which can be properly termed mental illness as distinct from the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli … [and] such a condition may be evidence of mental illness if it involves some abnormality and is prone to recur.” (based on King CJ’s statement in <italic>R v Radford</italic> (1985)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212470501">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Australia, “wrong” does not mean “contrary to law”. Rather, as set out by Dixon J in <italic>R v Porter</italic> (1933), this term refers to “wrong having regard to the standards of reasonable people”. Dixon J’s direction in <italic>R v Porter</italic> is also noteworthy for the wide interpretation adopted of the notion of knowing that an act is wrong. His Honor directed the jury:<disp-quote>
<p>The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212470501">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Research concerning the mental health defence has been sparse despite the fact that this legal doctrine has been extant in Western civilization for more than 2000 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212470501">5</xref></sup> We found no previous studies evaluating the specific psychiatric symptoms associated with deprivation of the capacities relevant to determining unsoundness of mind.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212470501">
<title>The mental health defence in Queensland</title>
<p>Focusing upon the Queensland context, the relevant statute under Section 27 of the Queensland Criminal Code is expressed as:<disp-quote>
<p>A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of doing the act or making the omission he is in such a state of mental disease or natural mental infirmity as to deprive him of capacity to understand what he is doing, or of capacity to control his actions, or of capacity to know that he ought not do the act or make the omission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212470501">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The test with regard to deprivation of any of the three capacities is on the balance of probabilities. In addition, “the state of mental disease or natural mental infirmity” does not apply to a person who has, “to any extent intentionally caused himself or herself to become intoxicated or stupefied…whether his or her mind is disordered by the intoxication alone or in combination with some other agent”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212470501">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The matter is determined by the Mental Health Court (MHC), which adopts an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial approach. The judge makes a decision after considering the totality of the evidence and the advice of two assisting psychiatrists. Those individuals found to be not guilty on the grounds of unsoundness of mind can be placed under a Forensic Order (FO), the conditions of which vary depending on the patient’s potential risk to the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212470501">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Queensland, if an individual is charged with an offence and is under either an Involuntary Treatment Order (ITO) or FO, the mental health service must arrange for the patient to be examined by a psychiatrist as soon as possible. The psychiatrist then provides a report to the Director of Mental Health (according to Section 238 of the Mental Health Act 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212470501">4</xref></sup> and hence the term “238 reports”) which contains information on the patient’s mental condition and the relationship, if any, between the patient’s mental illness and the alleged offence. The Director of Mental Health then makes a decision whether to refer the matter to the MHC.</p>
<p>Patients who have committed a serious violent offence are transferred to the High Secure Inpatient Service located at The Park Centre for Mental Health in Wacol, Brisbane, Australia.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study sample included psychiatric reports provided by forensic psychiatrists from the High Secure Inpatient Service for patients found to have a mental health defence by the MHC between June 2004 and June 2009. The reports were read independently by two psychiatrists (the authors of this paper), who extracted data in a de-identified form from each report. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee for the West Moreton South Burnett Health Service District.</p>

<p>The majority of patients suffered more than one psychiatric symptom at the time of the offence. Thirty-five patients (87.5%) were reported to have suffered delusions. Of these patients, 91.4% suffered persecutory delusions and 5.7% suffered religious delusions. Nineteen patients (47.5%) were reported to have suffered hallucinations, of which 31.6% suffered command hallucinations and 36.8% suffered persecutory hallucinations. Nine patients (22.5%) were reported to have suffered formal thought disorder. Five patients (12.5%) were reported to have suffered severe mood disturbance. Three patients (7.5%) were reported to have suffered passivity phenomena.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1039856212470501">Table 3</xref>, only a minority of reports (25.0%) commented on an Axis II diagnosis (or lack thereof) for the patient. Five percent of reports included an Axis II diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. However, based on the information provided in the reports, the authors’ consensus opinion was that a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder or traits was indicated in 33.3% of cases (<italic>n</italic>=39, one report excluded due to insufficient information).</p>

<sec id="section10-1039856212470501">
<title>Intoxication</title>
<p>Thirty reports (75%) included a discussion of whether intoxication was likely to have contributed significantly to the offence. In 51.3% (<italic>n</italic>=37) of cases, there was reliable evidence that the patient had alcohol or illicit substances in their system at the time of the offence, including five cases where the patient had used amphetamines, seven cases where the patient had used alcohol and 11 cases where the patient had used marijuana. In such cases, the authors concluded that patient’s psychotic illness was sufficient to cause the deprivation of capacity and the effects of the substance did not contribute significantly to the deprivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856212470501">
<title>Capacities deprived</title>
<p>Every report concluded that the patient was deprived of the capacity to know the wrongfulness of the act at the time of the offence. Some reports indicated that the patient was also deprived of additional capacities. Eight patients (20.0%) were considered to be deprived of control. The capacity for understanding the nature and quality of the act was least commonly deprived (four clinical cases, 10.0%). This is perhaps not surprising, given that the capacity to understand the act is traditionally related purely to understanding the physical nature of the act, not to its moral or legal consequences. There was no clinical case in which an individual was deemed to be deprived of all three capacities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856212470501">
<title>Psychiatric symptoms suffered by those deemed to be deprived of the capacity to know they ought not do the act</title>
<p>In a minority of reports (37.5%), the conclusion that the patient was deprived of the capacity to know that they ought not do the act was straightforward because the patient perceived themselves to be under imminent threat from the victim and that they were acting to defend their own lives. Many reports (45%) followed Dixon J’s direction in <italic>R v Porter</italic> and indicated that the patient was unable to reason “with a moderate degree of sense and composure” or “unable to reason about the wrongfulness of their actions” and was therefore deprived of the capacity to understand the wrongfulness of their actions.</p>
<p>Of the 13 clinical cases where only one psychiatric symptom was identified as leading to the deprived capacity to know that they ought not to do the act, 61.5% involved persecutory delusions entailing a sense of threat from the victim.</p>
<p>A small number of reports did not make an explicit link between the patient’s symptoms and the deprivation of their capacity to understand the wrongfulness of their actions, instead using general statements such as “the extent of the illness” or “the degree of the symptoms” was sufficient to deprive the patient of the capacity to understand the wrongfulness of their actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1039856212470501">
<title>Psychiatric symptoms suffered by those deemed to be deprived of the capacity to understand the act</title>
<p>Five reports concluded that the patient, in addition to being deprived of the capacity to know they ought not do the act, was also deprived of the capacity to understand their actions. All five reports concluded that the patient was deprived of the capacity because the patient held delusional beliefs about the identity of the victim. In three of the five reports, the patient believed the victim to be non-human and therefore the patient was deprived of the capacity to understand that they were inflicting harm on another human being. For example, a patient charged with the attempted murder of a stranger suffered a delusion that he was stabbing a “gay zombie rapist”. A second patient, who murdered his girlfriend, believed that he was “the chosen one”, and was fighting a battle between good and evil where the victim was an evil spirit that was going to kill him. A third patient, who murdered his parents, believed the victims were imposters, duplicated by heavenly equivalents.</p>
<p>Perhaps more controversially, two reports held that patients were deprived of the capacity to understand their actions despite their delusions regarding the victim’s identity still rendering the victim human. In the first case a patient, charged with the sexual and physical assault of his mother and suffering mania with psychotic features, held the delusion that his mother was simultaneously both his girlfriend and an undercover police officer there to gather evidence about him in order to put him in jail. In the second report a patient, charged with the attempted murder of a stranger, hallucinated that the victim had called him a faggot and held the delusional belief that the victim may have been involved in killing his sister. Thus, in neither case did the patient perceive himself to be under immediate physical danger from the victim, and the patients’ delusions did not deprive them of the capacity to understand that they were committing violence against a person.</p>

<title>Psychiatric symptoms suffered by those deemed to be deprived of the capacity for control</title>
<p>Eight reports concluded that the patient was deprived of the capacity to control their actions in addition to being deprived of the capacity to know that they ought not do the act. Three of the eight reports came to that conclusion on the basis of the patient suffering passivity phenomena at the time of the offence. In the first case, a patient charged with the rape and murder of his daughter reported, “Then Satan stepped in, then it was like I had no control over anything I was doing. There was a force driving me. Never felt anything like it in my life. A voice, an urge, an impulse.” The report further noted that the patient’s indifference to the victim’s sibling witnessing the offence also indicated his deprived capacity for control. In the second report, a patient who murdered his parents felt that his body had been taken over by a delusionary brother. The author further noted that the lack of planning/premeditation in the killing and failure to attempt to conceal the consequences of the act also indicated he was deprived of control. The third report involved a patient charged with murdering her son who experienced being controlled by “the angel Jeremiah”.</p>
<p>The other five reports that concluded that the patient was deprived of a lack of control did not involve the patient suffering passivity phenomena. The first indicated that, because the offence was committed in the presence of a witness, this was evidence that the patient was deprived of the capacity for control. This report concerned a man with persecutory delusions about his pregnant wife who:<disp-quote>
<p>was so consumed with his psychotic beliefs at the time of the offence that, even with the arrival of his mother at the time of the third [gun] shot, the patient was so driven by the decision to proceed that he was unable to control his subsequent actions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another report referenced the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia to support the opinion that the patient was deprived of the capacity to control his actions:<disp-quote>
<p>It is evident from the history that the patient has suffered from problems with behavioural control and that he exhibited sustained loss of volitional capacity in his day to day functioning. His overall functioning was significantly affected by disorganizing effect of his mental illness. It is likely that perceived threats and fear at the time of the alleged offence would have caused a loss of behavioural control…to the point of having no ability to prevent himself from acting.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another report relied on patient self report to support the author’s opinion that the patient (charged with arson and the murder of her landlord) was deprived of the capacity to control her actions: “…the patient reported that, ‘everything was out of control…couldn’t stop it…had no control…beyond right and wrong’.”</p>
<p>Two report writers did not explain the rationale behind their conclusion that the patient was deprived of the capacity to control their actions.</p>

<sec id="section15-1039856212470501">
<title>Additional considerations</title>
<p>Twelve reports discussed the behavior of the patient around the time of the offence to reinforce their opinion that the patient was deprived of one of the three relevant capacities. Behaviors discussed included: a lack of a getaway attempt, a lack of planning of the offence, failure to attempt to conceal relevant evidence, committing the offence in the presence of witnesses, self-incriminating confessions made to the police and the absence of a non-psychotic motive.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The defence of unsoundness of mind in Queensland is invariably associated with psychotic symptoms at the time of the alleged offence.</p>
<p>In this sample, all reports concluded that the patient was deprived of knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act. A third of these reports were clear-cut in this regard because the patient perceived themselves to be under imminent threat from the victim and the patient believed they were acting to defend their own lives. A further 50% of the reports found the patient’s capacity to understand the wrongfulness of the act was deprived because the patient was unable to reason “with a moderate degree of sense and composure”, which is based on a broad notion of knowing an act is wrong as per the directions of Dixon J to the jury in <italic>R v Porter</italic>.</p>
<p>Patients found to be additionally deprived of the capacity to understand their actions were those that suffered delusional beliefs about the identity of the victim. The psychiatric symptoms that resulted in a small number of patients being considered deprived of the capacity to control their actions were mixed, but approximately a third suffered passivity phenomena at the time of the offence.</p>
<p>Where possible, we recommend that psychiatrists be specific about how the patient’s symptoms link to any deprivation of capacity. We recommend that patients be considered to be deprived of the ability to understand their act only when their psychotic symptoms deprive them of the ability to understand that they are causing physical harm to a human victim. A deprived capacity to control should be restricted to those suffering passivity phenomena at the time of the offence. In forming their opinion, report writers could consider the behavior of the offender at the time of the offence, such as: getaway attempts, planning of the offence, attempts to conceal evidence, the presence of witnesses to the offence, self-incriminating confessions made to the police and any non-psychotic motives. Report writers could comment upon the presence or absence of Axis II conditions and the likely impact of any substances in the patient’s system at the time of the offence.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are limited by the fact that all psychiatric reports considered were provided by psychiatrists working in the one clinical service, the High Secure Inpatient Service. Furthermore, the study did not review the actual MHC decision in relation to the ultimate legal determination of the deprived capacity. A fuller understanding of the issues could be gained by a follow-up study looking at the MHC transcripts and 238 reports for patients who were not given a defence.</p>
