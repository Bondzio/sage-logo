<abstract>
<p>The 2010 NHS White Paper <italic>Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS</italic> proposed that the principle of ‘shared decision-making’ would become the norm so that patients could routinely participate in choices over their healthcare. In order to make decisions, both doctors and patients need information. Clinicians can draw on evidence-based guidelines, trials, books and personal experience, but not all these resources are suitable for the public and the constraints of a standard consultation can make explanations challenging. Traditionally, patient education materials have been used to describe diagnoses and treatments. However, some situations require patients to deliberate carefully on a range of different therapies, all of which carry risks and benefits. For these cases there are now specially designed ‘decision aids’ that assist patients to consider the options and come to an agreed plan with their doctor. Although widely available, these tools are not routinely used in clinical practice. The aims of this paper are to explain the ideas behind decision aids, how they may be used and where to access them. We will also review the evidence for their effectiveness and discuss challenges to incorporating them in consultations.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738012469357"><title>What is a patient decision aid?</title>
<p>A patient decision aid (also called simply a ‘decision aid’, ‘informed decision aid’ or ‘brief decision aid’) is a tool to help physicians and patients consider different medical options related to a specific medical scenario. They provide accessible, evidence-based information on what choices are available together with their respective risks and benefits. The choices are presented in the form of lists or sections of a website, together with a detailed explanation. Likely outcomes are described and presented numerically or pictorially to demonstrate the relative probabilities. The more complex decision aids go beyond decision support through describing risks and benefits. Some offer guidance on weighing risks and benefits according to personal priorities. The ‘values clarification exercise’ is one example of such guidance. No patient decision aid, however, is designed to be used in isolation from medical input. Before embarking on a decision aid the doctor must ensure that the tool fits the diagnosis as well as highlighting any possible differentials. Clinicians are also key to checking patients’ understanding, discussing remaining concerns and ensuring the preferred decision is appropriate in the medical context.</p>
<p>The number of decision aids has been steadily growing in the last two decades. These have been produced by a range of different organisations, and have been aimed at various medical decisions from screening to major surgery. The expansion and diversity of decision aids has led to a formalisation of their definition. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration describes them as ‘tools designed to prepare clients to participate in making speciﬁc and deliberated choices among healthcare options’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1755738012469357">IPDAS, 2005</xref>). The broad aims of decision aids have also been summarised in the Cochrane review of their effectiveness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738012469357">Box 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1755738012469357">Stacey et al., 2011</xref>).

<sec id="sec3-1755738012469357"><title>Conceptual background</title>
<p>The development of patient decision aids draws heavily on the shared model of medical decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1755738012469357">Charles et al., 1999</xref>). This style of consultation can be seen as an enhanced form of informed choice where information flows between doctor and patient in both directions so that the discussion and ultimate decision is a collaborative one. A definition of shared decision-making is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738012469357">Box 2</xref>. Greater involvement of patients in decisions over their care has been a gradual trend over recent decades and reflects changes in attitudes to personal autonomy and medical authority. Whilst respect for personal autonomy provides a strong ethical argument for shared decision-making, proponents of the process cite clinical benefits as a further incentive. One such proponent, the Kings Fund, argues that shared decision-making results in improved patient outcomes and reduces unwarranted variation in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738012469357">Coulter and Collins, 2011</xref>).

<p>At present the major UK organisations producing decision aids are NHS Direct, Patient.co.uk, the National Prescribing Centre and the Cardiff University Decision Laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.optiongrid.co.uk">www.optiongrid.co.uk</ext-link>). Under development are also 36 new tools from an organisation called Totally Health, commissioned by the Department of Health as part of its QIPP ‘Right Care’ programme. The earliest decision aids came in a range of formats, such as leaflets, audio cassette and video, but the vast majority are now internet-based. Some (such as on Patient.co.uk and the National Prescribing Centre) are still intended to be printed but others (such as NHS Direct) are fully interactive, incorporating patient stories and tools to guide choices.

<p>The most complete repository of publically available decision aids is held by the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute at decisionaid.ohri.ca. Although tools are now available internationally in various languages (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.thedecisionaidcollection.nl">www.thedecisionaidcollection.nl</ext-link>) their use is most established in the USA. A major producer has been the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation, a non-profit organisation that promotes shared decisions in healthcare. Commercial organisations also now exist that produce proprietary decision aids as well as a range of educational materials (for instance Health Dialog <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.healthdialog.com">www.healthdialog.com</ext-link> and Health Wise <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.healthwise.org">www.healthwise.org</ext-link>). A selection of the commercial tools can be accessed via the Ottawa repository, but are likely to be aimed at an American audience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1755738012469357"><title>When is a decision aid appropriate?</title>
<p>Use of a decision aid is most appropriate when choice is likely to be strongly influenced by a patient’s attitude to different benefits and harms. This particularly applies when no single option has clear superiority, or all carry risks, and a trade-off needs to be made between them. Real world examples would include hormone replacement therapy, the management of knee osteoarthritis and screening tests for prostate cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1755738012469357">O’Connor and Stacey (2005)</xref> have described these treatments as ‘grey zone’, contrasting with ‘white zone’ (clear benefit over harm) and ‘black zone’ (clear harm over benefit). In ‘grey zone’ treatments, achieving a clear understanding of the individual’s priorities can be crucial to guiding therapy, since patients evaluate potential outcomes differently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738012469357"><title>How to use a patient decision aid</title>
<p>Different types of decision aid need to be used differently. Interactive, web-based decision aids are likely to be too time-consuming for use during a consultation, but may be ideal for patients to use either before or following discussion with a doctor. Other decision aids are briefer and are a useful adjunct to a consultation when printed off and used face to face. Ultimately the approach will vary depending on the patient and the decision involved. For choices around medication, the National Prescribing Centre suggests using a five-step method (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012469357">Box 3</xref>).

<p>The use of decision aids as an adjunct to promote shared decision-making is also described in a paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1755738012469357">Elwyn et al. (2012)</xref>. It divides the process into three stages and proposes use of decision aids in the second part—'option talk'—to support the transition from initial preferences to informed preferences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738012469357">Fig. 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec7-1755738012469357"><title>Evidence for effect of decision aids</title>
<p>Although decision aids have only relatively recently become accessible to clinicians, their effectiveness has been under evaluation since the late 1990s. Early studies which looked at patient acceptability showed mostly positive results, with later trials testing the impact on patient understanding of risk. Two early reviews, which summarised key studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738012469357">O’Connor et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1755738012469357">1999b</xref>) found that decision aids performed well, compared to usual care, in terms of educating patients on therapeutic choices and their respective risks/benefits. Some of the included trials also assessed how prepared patients felt to make a decision by producing a ‘decisional conflict’ score; results also showed a slight superiority of decision aids over usual care.</p>
<p>Later Cochrane reviews have confirmed that decision aids improve patient knowledge scores and better prepare patients to make an informed choice. They have also synthesized the evidence base as to which aspects of decision aids are particularly beneficial. For example, a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1755738012469357">Stacey et al. (2011)</xref> showed that more detailed decision aids were superior at raising patient knowledge than simpler ones. In addition, risk perceptions were more accurate when decision aids included expressed probabilities; this effect was strongest using numbers rather than words. Other aims of decision aids are to help patients communicate their preferences and participate more in medical decision-making and evidence shows that consultations involving decision aids are more patient-led. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738012469357">O’Connor et al. (1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1755738012469357">1999b</xref>) found that, compared to usual care, they significantly increased levels of patient participation. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1755738012469357">Stacey et al. (2011)</xref> found that they increased the likelihood of shared decision-making and reduced levels of passive decision-making.</p>
<p>Whilst the impact of decision aids on patient education and participation appears to be broadly positive (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012469357">Box 4</xref>), the evidence for the effect on patient actions is more mixed. In the 2011 Cochrane review, lower rates of elective surgery (coronary revascularisation for ischaemic heart disease, orchiectomy for prostate cancer and mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer) were found amongst patients exposed to decision aids. In contrast, rates of other operations, such as child circumcision, have not shown an effect. Similarly, the review identified evidence for reduced uptake of PSA screening, but trials relating to prenatal and breast cancer genetic testing showed no difference. Regarding medication use, the picture is similarly unclear. One trial by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012469357">Thomson et al. (2007)</xref> for decisions around anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation found significantly fewer patients opting for warfarin after using a decision aid (4 of 16 intervention patients compared to 15 of 16 controls). However, this result has not been replicated, and the majority of trials relating to medication show no difference in uptake. Neither do decision aids appear to significantly alter general or condition-specific health outcomes.

<sec id="sec8-1755738012469357"><title>Challenges to implementation</title>
<p>Despite emerging evidence of benefit, ethical motivation and political support, use of decision aids (and shared decision-making more generally) is not routine practice. A review of physician attitudes towards the two concepts highlighted some possible barriers to implementation. Physicians were concerned that decision aids took too much time, were not applicable to their patient groups and did not accurately reflect their patients’ clinical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738012469357">Gravel et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly the latest Cochrane review did not find evidence for an increase in consultation length when a decision aid was used. Also, with over 500 decision aids currently available, it seems likely that many clinical scenarios would be applicable. However, patient characteristics may well inhibit their use. Most are English language only and all require reading ability. Similarly, the growing number of internet-based decision aids will only be suitable if both doctors and patients have technological ability and access to the required IT resources.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest challenge for practitioners is knowing what is available and where to find it. Decision aids are produced by different organisations and distributed via different websites. Each producer has addressed different medical scenarios and the tools themselves vary considerably in level of detail, length and style. Consequently, routine use of decision aids by practitioners will require a reasonable level of prior familiarity in order to select one that fits both the medical context and the patient’s abilities.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1755738012469357" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Decision aids can enhance a patient’s knowledge of their options, reduce their level of uncertainty and ensure that their values are incorporated into decision-making. They promote patient participation in consultations and increase the likelihood of shared decision-making. Some trials have shown they affect patient choices—for example reduced uptake of major surgery—though their effect in other areas such as genetic testing and medication is less clear.</p>
<p>Increased patient participation in medical decisions has a strong ethical basis on grounds of autonomy and is supported by recent social trends and government legislation. Greater use of decision aids is one way doctors can facilitate a shared style of medical management and ensure that treatment options reflect patients’ priorities. They are designed for use within the context of a shared medical model and support, but do not replace a physician’s general consultation skills. Prior familiarity with the range of tools available can help match the style, length and format to the patient’s characteristics and clinical situation.</p>
