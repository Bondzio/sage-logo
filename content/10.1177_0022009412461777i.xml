<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777i"><title>Stephen Lovell, <italic>The Shadow of War: Russia and the USSR, 1941 to Present</italic> (The Blackwell History of Russia Series), Chichester, West Sussex &amp; Malden, MA, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, xiii + 370 pp.; £19.99 pbk; ISBN 9781405169585</title>
<p>There is much scholarly debate going on amongst historians writing on the Great Patriotic War (the Soviet term for the Second World War) and the post-war USSR – both currently growing fields of research. However, textbooks or broad narrative accounts focusing on the postwar period are still rather rare, which makes Stephen Lovell’s <italic>The Shadow of War</italic> a welcome addition to the literature.</p>
<p>Lovell criticizes the traditional division of the postwar period into ‘late-Stalinism’, ‘thaw’, ‘stagnation’, ‘<italic>perestroika</italic>’ and post-Soviet ‘transition’. The problem with the existing periodization, he maintains, is that it organizes the postwar period into a decline narrative of the USSR whilst using labels influenced by political agendas of contemporary participants and observers. Upon a closer look, Lovell argues, the divisions between the policies during wartime and postwar reconstruction, or ‘Khrushchev’s thaw’ and ‘Brezhnev’s stagnation’ were not clear-cut, and many trends continued to manifest themselves throughout these years, even if one General Secretary succeeded another.</p>
<p>Rather than offering an alternative periodization, the book seeks to examine the history of the USSR and Russia from the outbreak of the war in 1941 to Putin’s presidency in the 2000s as a whole, and to trace the developments, ruptures and continuities of this period. Each of the book’s chapters examines a certain sphere. Chapter 2 looks at political and governing institutions. Chapter 3 is a study of the developments in Soviet economy. Chapters 4 and 5 explore social structures and cultural developments. Chapter 6 focuses on the relationship between center and periphery, while Chapter 7 zooms in on nationality policies and explores the idea of Soviet national identity. The last two chapters examine the Soviet Union in an international context, with Chapter 8 looking at geopolitical interests and the Cold War and Chapter 9 charting the transition from a relative isolationism to a growing international outreach.</p>
<p>The organization of the narrative by topics helps to focus our attention on issues that are often left on the margins of textbook coverage. For example, Chapter 7 – in which the relationship between Soviet center and periphery is explored – takes the reader from the government’s seat in Moscow to the distant Far East, demonstrating the impacts of the GULAG amnesty on the development of these localities and their economies, an important issue seldom addressed in textbooks. Similarly, while the discussion of Soviet national republics usually centers on the war and on the late 1980s, Lovell looks also at the less studied period in between. He traces the impact of wartime territorial expansion, resettlement policies, and Russo-centric discourse on the social and political fabric of the postwar years. The nationalities chapter thus becomes a good illustration of Lovell’s argument that scholarly treatment of the war as a distinct and separate period tends to obscure the wartime origins of many tendencies in postwar politics and society. Beginning the narrative in 1941 allows, as he shows, a better assessment of the long-lasting impacts of the war – an event of epic significance – in all realms of life.</p>
<p>The book builds on the most recent studies of the Soviet post-war era but, at the same time, does not neglect the important ‘classic’ issues in the field. The most interesting example for this is the chapter on Soviet notions of ‘public’ and ‘private’, which invites the reader to transcend the traditional binaries and to think of ‘a Soviet life that was deeply embedded in various types of ‘collective’ yet not necessarily antipathetic to small-group solidarity and personal self-interest’ (140). In his exploration of how these two apparent binaries coincided and were simultaneously manifest, Lovell builds on work dealing with such diverse subjects as Soviet material culture and consumption, youth activities, homemaking, film and literature, as well as his own extensive research on Soviet postwar culture and vacation homes.</p>
<p>The interconnectedness of government policies, economic developments, society and culture was especially strong in the Soviet context. Even though Lovell deftly carries out the separation into categories, his organization of the themes sometimes obscures the bigger picture. For example, discussing the Soviet war efforts in Chapter 2, Lovell writes: ‘The main – though not the only – reason the Soviet system was able to function so relatively well in wartime was its extensive use of coercion.’ (26) The same chapter also introduces the readers to the high figures of wartime enrolment in the Communist Party. However, these rising numbers of Party members and other sources of wartime popular mobilization become understandable only throughout the later chapters, where the reader gradually learns about the regime’s tolerance of religion, wartime propaganda, and rhetoric of patriotism and nationality. By contrast, a combined discussion would have highlighted the interconnectedness of wartime coercion and mobilization more effectively.</p>
<p>These reservations notwithstanding, the book’s unique structure is an advantage. Lovell’s questioning of the existing tag-lines in postwar historiography and illumination of somewhat neglected areas, developments and ideas are an important and timely contribution to the field. The breadth and structure of the account also make it an important asset for those seeking to expand their understanding of postwar European history and within a larger international context.</p>
