<p>In <italic>Selling Fear: Counterterrorism, the Media, and Public Opinion</italic>, Brigitte Nacos, Yaeli Bloch-Elkon, and Robert Shapiro take on the topic of the politics of fear by investigating in three directions: first, how the Bush administration made strategic public statements about the risk of terrorism after 9/11 and presented its counterterrorism efforts; second, which frames, language and sources the media used to cover the topic; and third, what public attitudes were concerning risk, the policy responses to it, and the President himself. The aim of the book is to shed light on the relationship between these three domains, both empirically and conceptually, based on content analysis of three years’ worth of television news (from October 2001 to December 2004) and of the data collected in five years of opinion polls (September 2001–December 2006).</p>
<p>The book is organized into seven chapters, where the central ones are dedicated to distinct issues dealt with by network television news programs: the threat of terrorism, curbs on civil liberties in the name of national security, the promotion of the Iraq war, terrorism prevention efforts, and preparedness for new terrorist attacks. In each of these chapters the issue is thoroughly introduced, the media coverage is analyzed with particular attention to the role that the President and other administration officials played in influencing the dominant frames and the language of the news media, and an assessment is made of the effect of this portrayal on public opinion, based on poll analysis. In their study of public opinion, the authors also seek to interpret the differences in attitudes between subgroups based on political partisanship, race, gender, and in a few cases education and age.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the series of particularly rich introductions to the issues with which each chapter opens. Here there are telling and engaging snapshots of the relationships between the political elite and the media. In general, the dynamics between official statements and media coverage, or better, the reproduction and the amplification by the media of the Bush administration’s message, are depicted clearly and interpreted convincingly in this book. The two theoretical concepts used to explain the lapdog role of the media are Herman and Chomsky’s propaganda model and Bennett’s “news indexing”; both models stress the decisive influence that political- (and in the case of Herman and Chomsky) also economic and financial- elites exert on decisions made by the media. The selling of fear and of the Iraq War are the two most striking instances where the media have uncritically accepted the frames and adopted the language chosen by the government’s news management. At the same time, news programs have failed to inform the public, for example by giving air time to different perspectives, on these and other issues.</p>
<p>The relationship between media coverage and public opinion, the other topic of the book, is unfortunately more vaguely conceptualized. In the introduction the authors do mention hypotheses such as agenda-setting, framing and priming effects of news content, as well as the influence of the latter on the public’s policy preferences, but these notions are not taken up in the following discussions or in the conclusions. Each analysis is carried out by comparing trends in public opinion (concern about terrorism, presidential approval, agreement to military action against Iraq, etc.) with the trends in (and the kind of) media coverage of the corresponding topic, and then interpreting the results. Here few generalizations or references to the theory appear. This is partly due, as the authors say, to the lack of sufficient time series data for public opinion, thereby ruling out multivariate statistical analysis of cause-effect relationships. But it is also due to the lack of competing hypotheses or theoretically-grounded questions against which the results of each analysis might be compared. The impression given is that, all in all, the only implicit or explicit hypothesis is that media content has an effect on public opinion. Without further specifications, the road is open to <italic>post-hoc</italic> explanations of the strong or weak co-variations between, for example, news about the likelihood of a war against Iraq and public support for the war, or between demographic variables and opinions, which add only idiosyncratic understandings of the formation of public opinion or confirm well-known differences in attitudes between sub-groups.</p>
<p>The relationship between the media and the public is an empirical field which presents many theoretical and methodological hazards, and the fact that the very concept of public opinion as measured by the polls is not explicitly elaborated in the book does not help. Remember Pierre Bourdieu: do people have something like “an opinion” about facts that are beyond their direct experience, or do they choose what sounds like the most reasonable answer according to the discourses they are most exposed to? Or, excerpting from the book: should we consider data from the polls as indicators of the state of public opinion which, in a state of apprehension, can increase support for restricting liberties, fulfilling “the goals of its terrorist enemy” (p. 90)? Or should we consider the polls as a validating tool for a construct named “public opinion”—that is, as a stamp which ostensibly certifies the sentiment of the people? The authors themselves claim, for example, that the Bush administration used poll data to maintain that the public supported the war. In the same vein, the authors hint at times that pollsters take their cues from the media when they decide what questions to include in their polls, so that by reporting survey results the media make the public itself part of the issue. However, a choice between these two possible conceptualizations—public opinion as an objective fact or as a construct—is never discussed and the reader is left with some confusion about the phenomena analyzed in the book.</p>
<p>Apart from these drawbacks, <italic>Selling Fear</italic> presents a study that is designed with rigor, uses comprehensive data sets, shows a compelling understanding of how the Bush administration manipulated coverage for its own purposes, and gives striking evidence of the news media’s compliance with this strategy.</p>
