<abstract>
<p>The investigators quantified the relationship between the genetic polymorphism of <italic>HMGCR</italic> (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering effects of atorvastatin in a prospective clinical study. Twenty-four healthy participants were grouped into <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 GG (n = 13) and AA (n = 11) genotypes and given atorvastatin (20 mg/d) for 14 days. Serum levels of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine kinase (CK) were measured before (day 1) and 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 28 days after dosing initiation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were taken on days 14 through 16. The levels of LDL-C in the GG group were significantly higher than in the AA group at all observation times, with mean differences of 18% to 33% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The area under the LDL-C–time curve and the minimum value of LDL-C in the GG group were 24% and 23% higher than in the AA group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). There was no significant difference in other lipids, CK, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 GG genotype was quantitatively documented to be a significant determinant for higher LDL-C level in basal state and possibly in response to atorvastatin.</p>

<body>
<p>Statins are widely used for prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in order to reduce endogenous cholesterol synthesis and lower the blood level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, responses to statins widely vary by individual, including treatment failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011398239">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270011398239">2</xref></sup> Genetic variation of <italic>HMGCR</italic> may partly explain this variability, and some investigations have shown such associations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398239">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398239">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, an alternatively spliced transcript lacking <italic>HMGCR</italic> exon 13, which encodes part of the statin-binding domain, was correlated with the LDL-C–lowering effect in simvastatin treatment, and SNP rs3846662, located in intron 13, was associated with the level of alternatively spliced mRNA of exon 13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398239">5</xref></sup> Specifically, the rs3846662 G allele was associated with increased LDL-C levels in humans as compared with the A allele. The G allele is common (~50%) in whites and Japanese, and occurs almost twice as frequently in blacks (~88%), who have a lesser response to a given statin dose in comparison with whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398239">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011398239">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011398239">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>HMGCR-variant–dependent statin action is important in terms of predicting therapeutic efficacy and for identifying statin-insensitive patients in order to avoid excess systemic exposure to statin, which could cause adverse reactions. Therefore, the presence of a functionally deleterious polymorphism in the <italic>HMGCR</italic> gene could have clinical significance. Quantification of the effect of <italic>HMGCR</italic> variation on statin action would provide useful basic clinical information.</p>
<p>Atorvastatin is a potent inhibitor of HMGCR and is the most commonly prescribed statin worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270011398239">8</xref></sup> Although less is known about the clinical response to atorvastatin in association with HMGCR variation, genetic polymorphisms of <italic>HMGCR</italic> are expected to affect the lipid-lowering action of atorvastatin. Moreover, there have been no prospective quantitative investigations of the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of statins in relation to <italic>HMGCR</italic> variations in humans.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the relationships between polymorphism rs3846662 in <italic>HMGCR</italic> and the LDL-C–lowering effects of atorvastatin in healthy participants. We used longitudinal observations in healthy participants to quantify the effect of the <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 SNP on pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic characteristics and on the variability of LDL-C levels following atorvastatin treatment in a prospective clinical study.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>After the genetic screening of <italic>HMGCR</italic> and <italic>SLCO1B1</italic> in 497 individuals who had donated blood for genotyping with consent, 24 healthy, unrelated Korean participants were enrolled in the study. Participants were then grouped into <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 genotypes (GG [n = 13, including 1 subject with GA] and AA [n = 11]). Given the potential effect of a <italic>SLCO1B1*15</italic> genotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270011398239">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398239">11</xref></sup> we excluded subjects homozygous for <italic>SCLO1B1*15</italic>.</p>
<p>All participants were ascertained to be healthy by medical history, a physical examination, vital signs, a 12-lead electrocardiography, and routine clinical laboratory tests performed within 3 weeks prior to the start of this study. Regular heavy drinkers, smokers of more than 10 cigarettes per day, and those with a body weight differing by more than 20% from their ideal weight were excluded. No medications, herbal drugs, alcohol, beverages containing caffeine, or grapefruit products were permitted from 7 days prior to the study for the study duration. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea (Reg. No. 4-09-0038). All procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research involving human subjects and with the guidelines of the International Conference on the Harmonization of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use—Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Written informed consent for participation in the study and for genotyping was obtained from all subjects before enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0091270011398239">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>All subjects were given once-daily multiple doses of atorvastatin, 20 mg (Lipitor tablet, Pfizer Korea, Seoul, Korea), for 14 days with 240 mL of water at approximately 8 a.m. on an outpatient basis. Subjects were kept in a fasting state for at least 10 hours before the examination of lipid profiles. Serum levels of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and creatinine kinase (CK) were measured before (day 1) and 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 28 days after the initiation of dosing. Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected using an intravenous catheter before and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the dosing on day 14. Alcohol and drugs were prohibited during the study.</p>

<sec id="section4-0091270011398239">
<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples using a nucleic acid isolation device, QuickGene-mini80 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The subjects were genotyped for <italic>HMGCR</italic> IVS13+45G/A and 2 SNPs of <italic>SLCO1B1</italic>, c.388A&gt;G, and c.521T&gt;C to determine <italic>*1a</italic> for the reference type, <italic>*1b</italic> for c.388A&gt;G, and <italic>*15</italic> for c.388A&gt;G and c.521T&gt;C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398239">12</xref></sup> The NCBI reference sequences used for the <italic>HMGCR</italic> and SLCO1B1 were rs3846662, rs2306283, and rs4149056, respectively. The SNaPshot assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ABI Prism SNaPShot Multiplex kit, Foster City, California). Analysis was carried out using Genemapper software (version 4.0; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). The melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) for SNaPShot was 60°C, and sequences of the forward, reverse, and SNP genotyping primers were as follows: TGGCAACAACAGAAGGTT, TGCTTGACCCAAAAGGTA, and GCCAGTTTAAAAA TACATCATA for rs3846662; GGGGAAGATAATGGTGC AAA, CGGCAGGTTTATCATCCAGT, and GTCGATG TTGAATTTTCTGATGAAT for rs2306283; and CAGCA TAAGAATGGACTAATACACC, TGGACCAATCATT GCTATTG, and TCCACGAAGCATATTACCCATGAAC for rs4149056.</p>

<sec id="section5-0091270011398239">
<title>Drug Concentration Analysis</title>
<p>The concentrations of atorvastatin, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, and 2-hydroatorvastatin lactone were measured by liquid chromatography (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) with tandem mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) operating in a turbo ion spray mode. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Kinetex C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, California). The limit of quantification was 0.1 ng/mL and the between-day coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 10% in all range of concentrations for atorvastatin and its metabolites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091270011398239">
<title>Phenotype: Lipid-Lowering Action and Pharmacokinetic Parameters</title>
<p>The area under the time–lipid profile curve (AUL) was calculated by the trapezoidal summation method representing the total exposure of lipids in the body. Minimum (LDL-C, TC, and TG) or maximum (HDL-C) serum concentrations of lipids were determined from the observed values. Percentage difference from the baseline value on day 1 (%Diff) was calculated by 100 × (baseline value – value at time) / baseline. Areas under the time–%Diff-lipid-value curve (AUL_%Diff) and maximum %Diff of the lipid value were determined. For pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum drug concentrations in plasma (C<sub>max</sub>) were determined from the observed values, and areas under the time–concentration curve (AUC) from the last dose (time zero) to 24 hours were calculated using the trapezoidal method. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were compared for the 2 different genotypes. WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight, Mountain View, California) was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0091270011398239">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Demographic data and SLCO1B1 genotype frequencies were compared between HMGCR rs3846662 AA and GG groups by unpaired <italic>t</italic> test and Fisher exact test, respectively. The actual values and parameters of the lipid profiles between the 2 HMGCR genotype groups were compared using the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test and confirmed by the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Longitudinal lipid profile data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) to test the hypotheses for between-and within-subject effects of genotype and time. A linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the contribution of the genotype effect to the total observed variability (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). Statistical tests were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina), and differences with <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>The actual values of LDL-C in subjects with rs3846662 GG were significantly higher than those in the AA group at all observation times during the study, with a mean difference of 18% to 33%. The maximal percentage difference (33%) was observed on day 21, which was 7 days after the last dosing. A tendency toward an increase in the differences was noted from day 1 to day 21 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270011398239">Table II</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We quantitatively investigated the functional significance of the <italic>HMGCR</italic> genetic polymorphism on the LDL-C–lowering effect of atorvastatin in a prospective clinical study. Significant differences in LDL-C levels were observed between subjects homozygous for the <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 G allele versus subjects not carrying this allele. The difference was borderline (18%) at baseline and more prominent—as much as 33%—after the end of atorvastatin administration for 14 days. The LDL-C systemic exposure parameters, AUL_LDL-C and LDL-C<sub>min</sub>, were also 23% to 24% higher in the rs3846662 GG than in the AA group. The absence of significant differences in the parameters of percentage difference from baseline values (AUL_%Diff and %Diff_Max) reflects only the significance of baseline effect. However, the decreased median values of the GG group could be interpreted as reduced statin sensitivity, whereas the lack of significance could possibly be attributed to the small sample size. In the analysis after controlling the baseline LDL-C level by confining the range to 86 to 106 mg/dL, we found that the LDL-C level was 27% higher in the GG group than in the AA group following atorvastatin treatment (<italic>P</italic> = .029). Although this significant difference was observed only on day 21, it was mainly related to the rate of recovery to baseline, or the atorvastatin administration for 2 weeks might have been insufficient to produce the effect in full-scale. Therefore, we can infer that the reduced statin response was possibly related to the HMGCR rs3846662 SNP.</p>
<p>Only simvastatin treatment has been investigated with regard to the association between polymorphisms in <italic>HMGCR</italic> and blood lipid level in a large-scale clinical pharmacogenetic study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398239">5</xref></sup> The strength of the association between <italic>HMGCR</italic> alternative splicing and in vivo percentage response in that study was weaker than that in our study (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30 vs 0.49-0.57) even though we used a more indirect marker (SNP) than messenger RNA expression. This is because the present study was controlled for possible confounding variables other than genotype in normal participants. In a recent study of Japanese patients, significantly higher LDL-C levels were identified in patients carrying the rs3846662 G allele regardless of statin use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011398239">6</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with the results of the present study.</p>
<p>Polymorphism in drug transporter genes can have a significant effect on statin disposition and safety. The <italic>SLCO1B1</italic> c.521T&gt;C SNP (rs4149056) has been reported to be strongly associated with higher plasma concentrations of almost all kinds of statins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270011398239">13</xref></sup> and with myopathy of simvastatin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011398239">14</xref></sup> whereas these polymorphisms were not correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of pravastatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270011398239">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270011398239">15</xref></sup> Patients who have lower statin sensitivity are likely to be prescribed a higher statin dose, which might increase susceptibility to statin-induced myopathy, especially in <italic>SLCO1B1</italic> c.521C allele carriers.</p>
<p>In the present study, the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin were not different between the <italic>HMGCR</italic> genotype groups. We excluded <italic>SLCO1B1*15</italic> or T521C homozygous subjects to reduce variation in the plasma concentration of atorvastatin. It is known that atorvastatin dosage rather than systemic drug concentration better correlates with the LDL-C–lowering effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270011398239">16</xref></sup> probably because of extensive metabolism of the drug yielding various kinds of active metabolites. In this study, the LDL-C–lowering effect was not found to be associated with the blood concentration of atorvastatin.</p>
<p>The frequency of the <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 G allele in Koreans (50.6%) is similar to that in whites (47.4%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398239">4</xref></sup> and Japanese people (51.1%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011398239">6</xref></sup> Ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins have been previously reported; specifically, 1.6-to 2.3-fold greater rosuvastatin exposures in Asians than in white subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270011398239">17</xref></sup> did not appear to be caused by extrinsic factors such as body weight, food, or medical practice. It has not been elucidated whether the ethnic differences in statin plasma concentration combined with the HMGCR genotype also affect lipid-lowering effects or susceptibility to known adverse effects of statins.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in a relatively small group of participants who had normal LDL-C levels after we excluded participants with an <italic>SLCO1B1*15/*15</italic> genotype. This study may be applicable to only Asian populations and only those with normal body weight because patients with coronary artery disease receiving statins are often overweight or obese, which might mask this genotype–phenotype interaction. However, this study was prospectively designed to evaluate and quantify the net effect of <italic>HMGCR</italic> genotypes by minimizing other confounding factors. Therefore, the results are meaningful as basic information. HMGCR inhibition by statins is suggested to be an important mechanism with respect to the increase in hepatic uptake of LDL-C through the upregulation of LDL-C receptor (LDLR) expression in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398239">18</xref></sup> LDLR messenger RNA expression increases in circulating mononuclear blood cells after atorvastatin treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270011398239">19</xref></sup> Both HMGCR and LDLR can influence statin response, especially in black patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398239">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the LDL-C–lowering effect might be influenced by variations of <italic>LDLR</italic> expression level although we did not investigate this in the present study. However, the influence of <italic>LDLR</italic> variation on our results is not expected to be significant, considering that no profound effects of LDLR have been documented and that the gene variant may be randomly distributed within each HMGCR genotype group.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively address the association between genetic polymorphism of <italic>HMGCR</italic> and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atorvastatin in humans. Previous findings and the hypothesis of higher function of HMGCR in the GG genotype type were consistent with our results. Our findings need to be confirmed in other ethnic groups to determine whether Asians are more or less sensitive to this HMGCR variation in the LDL-C–lowering response to statins compared with other ethic groups.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the <italic>HMGCR</italic> rs3846662 SNPs were identified as determinants of the serum LDL-C level in the basal state, possibly in response to atorvastatin. Approximately 30% higher LDL-C concentrations were observed after atorvastatin treatment in GG compared with AA genotypes. These results suggest that the rs3846662 A allele may be associated with reduced function of HMGCR and, consequently, with higher LDL-C receptor expression in hepatocytes, leading to lower serum LDL-C levels. A large-scale study is necessary to assess the use of <italic>HMGCR</italic> genotyping in identifying cardiovascular risk factors or as a prediction tool for ensuring clinical efficacy and safety of statin treatment.</p>
