<p>Manufacturability calculation of product’s design proposal often plays a vital role in many engineering applications, which is critical to achieve reduced time to market, high quality, and low cost. A methodology for the manufacturability evaluation of composite material components during preliminary stage of design is introduced and applied for the thermosetting composite laminated components produced by autoclave process in this article. The proposed methodology relies on the consideration that the component’s quality is a decisive index in the manufacturability evaluation of composite products. First, according to the analysis of composite product manufacturing processes, the concept of composite product manufacturability was proposed in this article. Second, the knowledge-based manufacturability evaluation flow is acquired based on the hierarchical indices setup of composite product manufacturability. Then, we mainly studied assessment model of composite product quality controllability: the quality controllability of composite product and its influencing factors were discussed. In addition, the quality controllability assessment model proposed was carried out step by step through the characteristic of multi-procedure in the production of composite product. In the end, an example of composite laminate component was provided to demonstrate the proposed model for evaluating the manufacturability.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412474701" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the recent years, with the development of fiber-reinforced polymer technologies, composite has become one of the major aeronautic materials and has a dramatic increased use in modern civil aircraft primary structures. It is worth noting that the composite material is formulated while the product structure is being built. This unique characteristic not only provides a great advantage for the optimization of composite structures but also causes the enormous performance deviation from one to another. Furthermore, some of the designs with special performance requirement cannot be produced, or cannot be produced under current condition at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>It is well known that the composite performance depends strongly on the manufacturing process selection, along with the initial choice of raw materials. Obviously, this unique material offers greater feasibility for employing the methodology of design for manufacturing (DFM), which is an effective approach to join design closer to manufacturing and guide the designer to achieve the successful design. Today, manufacturability evaluation which derives from the research in DFM becomes an important step in the design stage. While a majority of the manufacturability evaluation research concentrates on machining processes such as milling and drilling processes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412474701">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412474701">2</xref></sup> there is less focus on non-machining processes such as composite manufacturing process.</p>
<p>An integrated knowledge-based framework is needed to be developed to aid designers in successfully performing the task of composite manufacturability evaluation. Therefore, the central objective of this article is to provide an approach for manufacturability evaluation based on the proposed concept for the composite manufacturability. In the following section, a brief review of the related literature is provided. Then, the definition of the composite manufacturability is introduced based on the in-depth analysis of the characteristics of composite manufacturing processes compared with metal. Subsequently, we give the knowledge-based manufacturability evaluation flow with the hierarchical composite manufacturability indices and emphasize on the quality controllability analysis, including the factors that affect product quality and the quality controllability assessment model. Next, we give an illustrative example of composite laminate part. Finally, we discuss the contribution of our research in supporting the application of DFM techniques and manufacturability analysis in composite domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412474701"><title>Related research</title>
<p>The DFM techniques are nothing new and have been employed successfully for a considerable number of years. From the 20th-century, early 1990s, a large number of technical papers including reviews have been published on the subject of manufacturing issues analysis to support the design synthesis or design analysis aiming for a specific type of manufacturing process. Among them, the better known one is the design for assembly method proposed by Boothroyd and Dewhurst,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412474701">3</xref></sup> which computes a design efficiency and motivates a designer to combine and reduce the number of components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412474701">4</xref></sup> Other DFM-related work assisting the designer has been reported on manufacturing process selection methods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412474701">5</xref></sup> DFM guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412474701">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412474701">7</xref></sup> and manufacturability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412474701">8</xref></sup> analysis.</p>
<p>Adopting DFM techniques for the product design development process can sufficiently utilize the unique characteristic of the composite material and greatly reduce the lead time and improve product quality. Although several techniques have been developed in composite domain and employed in some handbooks for DFM guidance in selecting a process and help to shorten the design procedure, none focuses explicitly on the product manufacturability analysis. For example, Haffner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412474701">9</xref></sup> presented some of the DFM guidelines for the advanced composite materials and provided a general overview of available composite manufacturing methods. The main discussed content was the major application area of different manufacturing processes, including their capabilities in terms of size, complexity, and production volume. Its goal is to help people who are new to the field to quickly narrow down the choice of processes suited for their particular manufacturing needs. With the provided DFM guidelines, it is available to evaluate the feasibility of a design and feedback redesign recommendations to designers when the design rules are violated; however, this approach cannot compare alternative design candidates quantitatively and optimize a design based on a selected objective.</p>
<p>On the other hand, during the past years, a surge of research and development work involving the composite cost assessment have been proposed with several analysis models such as parametric cost modeling, activity- and manufacturing process-based cost modeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412474701">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412474701"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412474701">12</xref></sup> At the same time, the manufacturability analysis techniques during the design stage, which emphasize the quality issues of the composite product, are still in one area that has been given little attention by researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0731684412474701"><title>Definition of composite manufacturability</title>
<p>DFM is a methodology that involves simultaneously considering design goals and manufacturing constraints to identify and alleviate manufacturing problems while the product is being designed, thereby reducing the lead time and improving the product quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412474701">8</xref></sup> As with manufacturability, however, there exists no consistent definition for it. According to Design for Manufacturability: Handbook,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412474701">7</xref></sup> the term of manufacturability is a measure of the relative ease with which a product or component could be manufactured. In Best Manufacturing Practices and Center of Excellence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412474701">13</xref></sup> it is: ‘The relative ease by which a product can be manufactured as measured in yield, cycle times, and the associated costs of options in product design manufacturing processes, production and support, and tooling.’ It can be observed that the product manufacturability is a relative term based on the judgment on whether or not the manufacturing method ability meets the product’s design requirement, including functions, performance, cost, quality, etc. Its main goal is to attain the design required level of product quality while the expended effort of processing and handling is as less as possible.</p>
<p>Fully understanding the processes characteristics of composite is critical to guide engineers for a successful design decisions and quantitative manufacturability evaluation. The characteristics of composite manufacturing processes have been summarized by Gutowsk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412474701">14</xref></sup> that in general each composites manufacturing process is actually made up of at least two sub-processes. The former is some kind of additive process that generates the primary shape by building up the material, requiring a measure of positioning control throughout the volume of the part, and the latter is the consolidation and curing process with the assistance of hard tool. Apparently, the composite manufacturing process is a multi-stage process; the outputs from operations at downstream stages can be affected by operations at upstream stages.</p>
<p>Here, the manufacturability of composite is defined as the feasibility between the process constraint and the design parameters, as well as the controllability evaluation of design requirement so that: (a) the selected manufacturing method is suitable to satisfy the design requirements, at the same time, the given processing parameters is available to apply for the raw material transformation; (b) the manufacturing quality attains its designed requirement; (c) the manufacturing cost is not beyond the budget; and (d) the time to make the product does not exceed the deadline. Among them, (a) can be analyzed qualitatively with some DFM guidelines, while (b), (c), and (d) need to be evaluated with quantitative indices in a scientific and systematic approach.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412474701">Figure 1</xref> shows the flowchart of the proposed knowledge-based composite manufacturability evaluation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412474701">Figure 1</xref>, the manufacturability evaluation flow begins recognizing and extracting the manufacturing feature of a product with the application of manufacturing feature database. By identifying all the features and categorizing them as to the manufacturing methods that can produce them, the first step in the approach is to identify all the manufacturing process which can potentially be used to create the required product. Using these means, different operation plans with specific processing parameters are also generated for the proposed design. When the set of manufacturing processes has been limited, the second step is aimed at qualitatively analyzing the compatibility between the generated processing parameters and the raw material processing characteristics, and between design for assembly and product curing deformation. The later compatibility can be decided using finite element modeling (FEM) method with software of Ansys or Abaqus. First, FEM of the product can be built in the software. Material parameters (Young’s modulus, shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, etc.) and manufacturing process parameters (process pressure, cure temperature, plies angle, etc.) are inputted. The product’s curing deformation can be calculated. Comparing calculation results and assembly requirements, we can get the judgment on whether or not the generated manufacturing process operation plans with the special processing parameters is available to apply for the raw material transformation. Finally, the detailed technical controllability evaluation needs to be performed quantitatively, applying with the simulation and the experimental analyses, for the selected manufacturing process operation plans with the special specifications of technical indices such as cost index, time index, and quality index. Among them, the quantitative technical controllability evaluation with the quality index can be used to assist the product design team in eliminating the potential quality-related problems and minimizing the product’s sensitivity to quality variation.

For each of the sub-process, at least one processing program needs to satisfy the required quality sub-index. Otherwise, if only one sub-process quality characteristic value is beyond the required indices, the design is still treated as quality uncontrollable. Thus, it seems appropriate to classify the quality control into two stages: sub-process quality controllable and the final product quality controllable, while the former is the precondition of the latter.
<fig id="fig2-0731684412474701" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The composite product quality controllability model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412474701-fig2.tif"/>

<p>In composite manufacturing processes, it is common that the final product quality is determined by the key quality characteristic of some critical sub-processes, while the different quality characteristic may be determined by different sub-processes. At the same time, owing to the propagation chain of quality characteristics in the composite manufacturing processes, the quality characteristics of a product at single sub-process stage are not only determined by the process variables of the current stage, but also affected by the quality characteristics of its previous stage. That is to say, the method of controlling manufacturing quality at each sub-process stage separately is usually not effective because it ignores the inherent quality characteristics relationship among different sub-process stages. The main process variables that affect the composite quality include material properties, ambient environment, molding tool, process planning paths, etc.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0731684412474701" sec-type="cases"><title>Case studies</title>
<p>It is well known that the autoclave-assisted cure of prepregs is an important manufacturing process for the advanced polymer composites. During this process, prepregs are laid up on the tool surface in a prescribed fiber orientation for each layer to form the laminate. The laminate is covered with other bagging materials such as the peel ply, bleeding layer, separator, breather cloth, and the vacuum bag. The entire assembly is then cured by exposing it to the prescribed temperature and pressure cure cycle. The shape of cured structure, in the free state, is different from the ideal. This inconsistent state which is caused by thermal expansion and contraction effects of the material, chemical reactions contraction effect of resin matrix, different coefficients of thermal expansion between the mold and the part is called cure-induced deformation for composite structural. Curing deformation affects the component dimensions and assembly, which is obviously a key characteristic for the composite quality controllability analysis. In the following, we provide a case study for the curing deformation of composites.</p>
<p>Take a laminate manufacturing process for example which is the product design proposal. The laminate modeling taken from manufacturing feature database is 300 mm long, 200 mm wide, and 1.5 mm high. Design requirement is that the deformation of the laminate is less than 2.25E − 5 mm. In the manufacturing process database, there are 24 layer schemes, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412474701">Table 1</xref>, which are pre-selection manufacturing methods. Then, technical feasibility assessment is used for these schemes. In the DFM guideline knowledge-base, when the layers of each scheme are taped in, the deformation of the laminate which is caused by thermal expansion of the composite material can be got. This step can roughly select layers which satisfy the request of design, that is, the deformation of the laminate in these layers is smaller than the design. If none of the pre-selections satisfy the design, then we must go back to change the design.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412474701">Table 1</xref> is the result of pre-select layers. It shows that there are five layers meeting the requirements. Now, in the technical controllability assessment module, other causes of cure-induced deformation are considered in simulation analysis. When inputting the five schemes in the simulation analysis module, the warping value can be calculatedas presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412474701">Table 2</xref>.

<p>There are four layer schemes satisfying the design. In consideration of economic, quality, and efficient assessment, at last, one of them is produced. If none of them is satisfied, other new design proposals must be used.</p>

<p>Designers are facing the challenge of making a successful design decisions early on the development process, but confronting with rapidly evolving production techniques. It is well known that the current profusion knowledge of the manufacturing process and product design optimization have been presented, but not been sufficiently utilized with the employment of DFM in a systematic approach.</p>
<p>In this article, an integrated composite manufacturability evaluation framework has been proposed to carry out the manufacturability analysis of composite product. This system integrates knowledge-base and design and manufacturing feature database as well as the simulate analysis and the experiment analysis results to support the designer performing manufacturability analysis of composite product in the qualitative manner. The evaluation flow, quality characteristic, its affecting factors, and the quality controllability model for the composite are developed in this article, which can help the designer complete the design task from the manufacturing point of view in a qualitative and systematical way.</p>
<p>Future development tasks focus on expanding the information about the manufacturing feature, the manufacturing process, and reasonably distributing the sub-index for the key quality characteristic in the critical sub-processes based on the design requirement.</p>
