<p>Time is meaningless in the face of creativity.</p>
<attrib>—Bill Owens, American Artist</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That was the quote on the tee-shirt I wore that summer during the Rogerian Conference in New York City where I always enjoyed being with other folks who loved and respected the work of Martha Rogers. Fran was a regular participant in all-things Rogerian. He traveled often from the United Kingdom to engage in spirited dialogues challenging us to be expansive and innovative in our thinking. Fran loved that tee-shirt so much that he ended up having one too. That phrase had special meaning for both of us who embraced so acceptingly the notion that time really was much more malleable than most would admit. It is especially poignant to me now as I learned only a very short time ago that Fran was ill. I let myself believe, in spite of his descriptions of the gravity of his condition, that Fran would be around for quite a bit longer in this physical world. Since his death, people asked me how old he was, and it is fitting, I suppose, that I do not know—that is also compatible with our shared beliefs about the meaninglessness of chronological age and the amount of clock time one had spent on Earth. I would say Fran was young—regardless of how many years he actually had lived. Fran was diagnosed with cancer in August and died peacefully in the presence of his most beloved on November 3, 2012.</p>
<p>Fran Biley was an editorial board member and an active reviewer for the <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing.</italic> I relied heavily on Fran to review those manuscripts that were particularly “out-of-the-box” with the potential to push the boundaries of holistic nursing science and practice. Fran had a strong understanding and knowledge of what was credible and creative in the most profound sense. He was a strong proponent of divergence and expansion of knowledge in the service of humankind; that is to say, Fran sought to embrace the possibilities of broadening knowledge to include all the senses to understand the human condition. Art, music, images, photography, stories, and poetry were essential to deepen our understanding of nursing, those we served, and the pursuit of human betterment. This was reflected in his own work and in his appreciation and affirmation of others—those who were well-established and those who were beginning to shine. He was perfect for the <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing</italic> because he embodied the aims and scope of the journal in his own work and his intellectual attraction to the integrative and innovative in the work of others.</p>
<p>Fran lived in a small village near Dorchester, England, enjoying countryside living, keeping his small woods for the benefit of wildlife and his young boys, woodturning as an expression of his exceptional creative connection to nature and a practice of mindfulness, and keeping chickens who were never to be eaten, only adored for what they had to give him and his family. Fran shared his life with his very lovely wife, Anna, and his two sons, Mathew Jack and James. Recently, 10-year-old James participated in a bicycling challenge benefit to raise 400 pounds for a local cancer trust. He described being inspired by his dad to do this while Fran was receiving chemotherapy at a clinic.</p>
<p>Professionally, Fran was a nurse, qualified in adult and mental health nursing, and employed by Bournemouth University as an associate professor in the Centre for Qualitative Research and as an adjunct professor, Seton Hall University, New Jersey, USA. He had specific interests in inventive methodologies such as historiography, autoethnography, unitary appreciative inquiry, and using the arts and humanities in health care. Fran was involved in the built care environment for clinical purposes, the service user movement in mental health and adult care, and mindfulness practice. He was particularly dedicated to supporting the work of graduate students who sought to explore deeper dimensions and broader understandings through unitary and holistic inquiries. He had many years of experience with establishing, leading, and teaching courses in countries as diverse as the United States, Wales, Germany, Greece, Sweden, and the Netherlands Antilles. Fran was also a Governor of Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Fran established the first university-accredited Therapeutic Touch modules in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Fran’s scholarship exemplified imaginativeness and expansiveness that is so in tune with the nature of human experience and well-being. An example of the type of scholarship that he created that pushed the boundaries of knowledge for practice was an article published in the <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing</italic>, titled “My Life: My Encounters With Insanity,” which detailed his early practice experiences in mental health nursing, personally rejecting reductive-pharmacologic approaches in favor of more holistic ideologies focused on human-centered activities. He coauthored a book with similar themes that was described as having great benefit to those interested in the pedagogy of suffering. Additionally, it was noted that this book distinguished itself from others in the genre because its narratives were unmediated—not sanitized by professional, psychobiological, medical commentaries. Fran practiced this in his life—what you got from a relationship with Fran was certainly unmediated in the way he approached communications and relations—what you got was the pure and genuine honesty of his presence.</p>
<p>Fran translated his ideals and his theoretical leanings into action. He initiated a project called “Digging for Health” in which he took a community allotted, rundown, and overgrown space and returned it to a fully functioning and productive resource. It not only produces vegetables, it produces social capital. Fran and his team engaged with volunteers, primarily men in later life, many retired, and who wished to become more involved in community life. By engaging in the development of the allotment activities, they also have an opportunity to avoid losing contact with friends and acquaintances. In addition, the men benefit from light exercise as part of recovery from an array of illnesses. This project enhances healthier communities by providing the means for these men to meet up with others and engage in meaningful, productive, social, and physical activity.</p>
<p>In a tribute on the Cardiff University website where he previously worked, it was said of Fran that he
<disp-quote>
<p>caused many staff and students to learn to think differently. In the best sense of the word Fran was a maverick; sometimes misunderstood, sometimes infuriating which he enjoyed being told with that chuckle of his, and challenging to those he knew, worked with and taught to consider the ways of the world and academia from different perspectives (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/staff/obituaries/profiles/biley-francis.html">http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/staff/obituaries/profiles/biley-francis.html</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those few lines capture Fran’s unmediated, pure nature in relating to others. In the same way that Fran lived his intellectual, professional, scholarly life, he lived his personal life as well. He has caused his boys to think differently, also in the best sense of the word—and the world is, and will be, better for that.</p>
<p>One of Fran’s most extraordinary joys was the annual experience of the Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts that was initiated in the 1970s. It is a festival that takes place in Pilton, Somerset, England, featuring contemporary music as well as dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. The festival retains vestiges of its hippie tradition such as the Green Fields area, which includes the Green Futures and Healing Field. The festival has grown in size since the 1970s, now attended by around 150,000 people experiencing performances in open air venues large and small. The majority of staff is volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes. The last time I visited Fran in England, he was basking in the afterglow of having come from that experience. Interestingly, there was no festival in 2012, but tickets are already being sold for the June 2013 event. Fran won’t need a ticket—I know he will be there again—dancing and laughing and cavorting freely in those healing fields.</p>
