<abstract>
<p>Metaphor is one element of language capable of capturing human’s perception of reality. Nursing care can improve as patients’ perceptions of their illnesses are better understood. Realizing how patients with asthma, their family members, and the nurses caring for them perceive the asthma experience was the goal of this study. The authors used a qualitative research method implementing systematic metaphorical analysis to analyze the data. The authors identified an encompassing metaphor titled: Owning and Winning the Asthma War. The results of this study enhanced understanding of the asthma experience and contributed to metaphorical analysis as a valid way of knowing, understanding, and describing in nursing and human sciences.</p>

<p>Nurses use language to understand and ultimately improve the health of their patients. Metaphor is inherent in all communication, constitutes understanding of reality, and has a powerful effect on health care and the experience of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712439714">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref></sup> Understanding the metaphors used within specific patient populations may lead to improved health care for those groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129712439714">5</xref></sup> The nearly 22 million asthmatic patients living in the United States today may suffer from pulmonary inflammation, bronchiole constriction, hypoxia, and dyspnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129712439714">6</xref></sup> The chronic illness often requires frequent visits to outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and numerous pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.

<title>Rationale and Conceptual Framework for the Study</title>
<p>In this article, we discuss the metaphors people use to describe their asthma experiences. We also discuss the metaphors that were used in the communication that occurred between adult asthma patients, their family members, and nurses during acute asthmatic episodes and as part of ongoing care for the chronic health condition. Although a plethora of studies have examined the asthma experience using a variety of methodologies, few have reported the meaning patients, family members, and nurses attribute to the disease using metaphorical analysis. The goal of this research study was to contribute to what is known about the asthma experience as perceived by the nurses, patients, and family members associated with the disease by adding metaphorical data analysis. A qualitative approach using open-ended questions, observation, reflection, and recorded interviews was used to gather data for this study. Systematic metaphor analysis attempting to reconstruct models of thought, language, and action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129712439714">8</xref></sup> was the method used to analyze data.</p>

<title>The Asthma Experience</title>
<p>Baptist et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129712439714">9</xref></sup> used a qualitative approach to study the experience of asthma in the geriatric population. They suggested in one of their findings that elderly people with asthma tend to not participate in asthma education, which could have significant implications for their health. A few studies have looked at children’s perspectives of the asthma experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129712439714">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129712439714">13</xref></sup> but only one used metaphorical analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129712439714">12</xref></sup> Protudjer et al studied the “normalization”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129712439714">14</xref>(p94)</sup> process of children with asthma using thematic coding. Similarly, Prout et al examined the “ordinariness”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129712439714">13</xref>(p138)</sup> of children and families living with asthma from a qualitative approach. They used an adaptation model from a sociological analysis of chronic illness in their work.</p>
<p>Clack, an advanced practice nurse, described the clinical decision-making process she used to assist a young boy and his mother in eradicating persistent symptoms of asthma. Her first step of “cue acquisition”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p24)</sup> described the importance of gathering information to “formulate an accurate picture of the child’s situation.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p24)</sup> The second step Clack described in her clinical decision-making process was “hypothesis generation.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p25)</sup> Clack refers to Tanner’s work suggesting that good clinical judgments require an “understanding of the illness experience for the child and the family.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p27)</sup> The additional stages of Clack’s clinical decision-making model with asthma patients, “interpretation”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p25)</sup> and “evaluations,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129712439714">15</xref>(p26)</sup> were useful in understanding the childhood experience of asthma.</p>
<p>We suggest that findings from the aforementioned studies support the profound complexity of communication and language surrounding asthma. Although some things are known about perception, metaphors, and asthma, additional metaphorical studies are needed to understand the plethora of health care experiences including adult asthma patients, their families, and the nurses who care for them.</p>

<title>Purpose and Questions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to understand how adult, Anglo American people living in an area with readily available access to excellent health care facilities ascribe meaning to the experience of asthma. A secondary purpose was to obtain sufficient data to compare the results of this study to other ethnic, age, and socioeconomic asthma groups. Learning how diverse groups of people with asthma perceive their experience could enhance therapeutic communication specific to those groups or individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref></sup> Finding common language between nurses and the people they care for can strengthen the nurse–patient relationship and promote caring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two questions prompted this study: (<italic>a</italic>) What metaphors are used by asthma patients, their family members, and nurses to describe the asthma experience? (<italic>b</italic>) What does an analysis of the identified metaphors reveal about how the asthma experience is perceived? The answers to these questions provided information about metaphors used by nurses in acute and chronic asthmatic situations and revealed an understanding of the perception nurses, patients, and family members associated with their asthma experiences.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-2150129712439714">
<title>Design</title>
<p>We used a qualitative approach to collect data for this study using tape-recorded open-ended interviewing and observation. Participants were asked to tell their stories relating to their experiences with asthma and were observed in a variety of asthma-related settings including emergency departments and chronic care asthma clinics. Metaphorical analysis was used to analyze the data. We chose this approach because metaphorical analysis is considered an excellent method for examining the meaning and values people attribute to their experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129712439714">5</xref></sup> We focused the approach on identifying the metaphors that occurred between adult asthmatic patients, their family members, and the nurses who were providing their care in both acute and chronic situations. Following institutional review board (IRB) approval to collect data from human participants, written permission was obtained from all participants prior to participation in the study.</p>
<sec id="section7-2150129712439714">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Adults with asthma, their adult family members, and nurses were invited to participate in the study following IRB approval. Any person registered as a patient in the chronic care asthma clinic who had also been treated in the emergency department within 3 years of the study and their family members were asked to participate in the study. Family members were limited to immediate family members living in the home of the person with asthma. All identified potential asthma patient family members were adult spouses or significant others of the asthma person. All family members described themselves as the primary caregiver assisting with the asthma condition and attended clinic and emergency department visits with the patient when necessary. In addition, any nurse working in the chronic care asthma clinic or emergency department for longer than 1 year was invited to participate in the study. Forty-two people met the inclusion criteria. After we presented verbal and written descriptions of the study, had informed consents signed, and answered all participant questions, 23 people agreed to participate in the study, but 5 adult asthma patients and their family members did not complete the process for a variety of reasons including moving to another state, claiming too busy to participate, and undeclared. Data from participants who did not complete the study were destroyed and not used in the analysis process. All nurse participants who started the study remained in the project until completion. Eighteen participants provided data for the study consisting of 6 adult asthmatic patients, 6 family members, 3 emergency department nurses, and 3 nurses who took care of asthmatic patients in an outpatient clinic setting. Because cultural factors heavily influence the metaphors used in language,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129712439714">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150129712439714">20</xref></sup> all chosen participants were adult Anglo Americans with English as their native language. All participants resided in a large Midwestern city well served by medical facilities and health care workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150129712439714">
<title>Data collection techniques</title>
<p>Data collection was done using 2 predominate methods: participant interviews and researcher observations. Participant interviews started first in order to help establish rapport. We initiated audiotape recordings during the first interview and continued through the subsequent interviews with each participant. When rapport was established with the participants and permission was granted, we attended the clinic and/or emergency department experiences as observers. During the observations, we took written notes and/or used tape recordings during conversations between nurses, the asthmatic patients they were caring for, and their family members.</p>
<p>All participants were involved in at least 2 interviews lasting approximately 1 hour each. Some of the interviews included patients with their family members. Some participants were involved in 3 or more interviews throughout the 8-month period of data collection. During the interviews, we asked patients and family members to describe their experiences with asthma and their interactions with nurses in the emergency department or chronic care facility. We conducted follow-up structured and unstructured interviews with the participants to verify analyzed data, clarify data, and obtain more in-depth information.</p>
<p>In addition, we spent a minimum of 6 hours each week observing interactions between nurses, patients, and family members in the emergency department or chronic care settings. We used observation techniques including note taking and memoing when we watched the interactions between the nurses, patients, and family members as they communicated, and we used the findings to lend credibility to the interview data. We observed nurse participants as they cared for acute and chronic asthmatic patients and adult asthmatic patients as they interacted with nurses in the emergency department and outpatient clinics.</p>
<p>A total of 249 collective hours were spent in data collection. Data collection ceased when no new information had been identified and consistently repetitive information was being obtained. When participants verified saturation, we left the observation areas, conducted no further interviews, and concentrated only on data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150129712439714">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>During the metaphorical analysis of the data, we attempted to reconstruct models of thought, language, and communication patterns of the participants to understand how the participants perceived their experience with asthma. We analyzed the data using a systematic metaphor analysis similar to the description used by Schmitt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref></sup> but using our own 5-step approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129712439714">8</xref></sup> We analyzed the data in such a way as to separate and identify metaphoric parts of speech from the transcribed data obtained during interviews and recorded observations.</p>
<p>In Step 1 of our analyses, we looked for and identified individual metaphors in the transcribed texts from the recorded interviews and observation notes. After careful and repeated analysis of the data, clusters of similar metaphors began to emerge. We then grouped the metaphors into similar but broad metaphorical concepts. We called these initial, broad concepts, metaphorical groups. We continued this step until all identified metaphors were listed under a metaphor group.</p>
<p>During the second phase of metaphorical data analysis, we further analyzed the metaphor groups and verified them with the participants to identify broader metaphorical classes. We defined a metaphorical class as the broad idea among the identified metaphor groups. We looked for and identified similar relationships and ideas occurring between the metaphor groups to develop the metaphor classes. We repeatedly asked for clarification from the participants. Metaphor classes that were verified by the participants were retained for additional analysis. Classes that were not verified by the participants were disregarded and considered inaccurate analysis. The established and verified metaphor classes were then moved to the third phase of our metaphorical analysis of the data.</p>
<p>The third step in our metaphorical analysis was to analyze the metaphor classes to identify any metaphor themes. A metaphor theme was the broad ideas between the metaphor classes verified in Step 2. The identified metaphor themes were verified with the participants and began to reveal the organization of relationships between the identified metaphor classes. Analysis of the themes revealed the broadest metaphorical classes and how they related to the dominate metaphor groups.</p>
<p>During the fourth phase of our metaphorical analysis, we identified metaphoric taxonomies and verified them with the participants. A metaphor taxonomy is the division of the identified metaphor themes into ordered categories. We verified the identified metaphor taxonomies with the participants. Relationships between the identified themes began to reveal the organization between the identified metaphor themes. Analysis of the identified taxonomies revealed the broadest metaphorical classes and how they related to the dominate metaphor themes.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fifth and final step of our metaphoric analysis, we developed a metaphoric paradigm. We consider a metaphorical paradigm to be a philosophical or theoretical framework made up of a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129712439714">21</xref></sup> The metaphoric paradigms we identified were common sets of metaphor taxonomies distinguished by their similar thematic meanings. Our analysis at this step began to reveal the underlying subconsciousness of the participants yielding insight into how they perceived and attributed meaning to their experience. During this final step, we made a connection between the concepts we found and the events, thoughts, and actions that took place during observation and communication between asthma patients, their family members, and the nurses caring for them.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150129712439714">
<title>Trustworthiness and Credibility</title>
<p>We established trustworthiness several ways consistent with Schmitt’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref></sup> explanation of trustworthiness in metaphorical research. First, the amount of metaphorical concepts found and to what extent they satiated the material contributed to the overall trustworthiness of the research. We found hundreds of metaphors that we placed into 115 metaphor classes. No additional metaphors were identified from either the participants or external reviewers examining the transcribed data supporting our determination that all metaphorical concepts occurring in the data had been identified.</p>
<p>Another step that helped establish the trustworthiness of our study was the thoroughness of the reflection on interpretive options within the metaphorical concepts. Schmitt stated, “The more thorough the comparison of the metaphorical concepts within the material, the sooner can it be assumed that the most significant implications of metaphorical thinking have been discovered.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref>(p381)</sup> Metaphorical comparisons took us a considerable amount of time and effort and were continually evaluated by outside reviewers and the participants. We labeled these comparisons metaphorical themes. We identified and verified 20 metaphorical themes, lending to the trustworthiness of this study. We elaborate on metaphor classes and identified themes in the subsequent results section.</p>
<p>We obtained credibility by maintaining contact and interaction with the participants in their homes or health care facilities for a period of 8 months. We asked participants to validate findings as they emerged. In addition, 3 outside researchers experienced in qualitative research methods reviewed the data consistently throughout data collection and analysis. Data collection techniques and ethical standards such as avoidance of coercion to participate, full disclosure of the study, and researcher availability were deemed satisfactory throughout the study by external checks. We asked initial interview questions to stimulate conversation. Nurse participants were asked questions such as “Tell me what it’s like to care for an acutely (chronically) ill asthmatic patient in the emergency department (health care clinic)” and “Describe some of your most memorable interactions with (families of) asthmatic patients.”</p>
<p>Initial interview questions posed to patients and families included statements such as “Describe your experiences in the emergency department (health care clinic)” or “Describe a typical day in living (caring for your loved one) with asthma.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2150129712439714" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 115 metaphor classes were identified from the initial transcribed interviews. We subsequently coded the metaphor classes into 20 metaphor themes by continuously reading and rereading the transcribed interviews, coding the language, and discussing the findings with the participants. We identified subsequent and dominant metaphor themes as those that reoccurred several times during the process of comparative analysis of the data and repeated interviews with participants. The participants helped verify 3 of the metaphor themes as dominant over other identified themes also considered a part of their experience. The 3 dominate metaphor themes were additionally conceptualized into corresponding metaphor taxonomies, also verified by the participants. We then developed and verified the metaphor paradigms from the developed taxonomies in the same way. The meta-metaphoric meaning that described the experience of asthma for the nurses, patients with asthma, and their family members in the emergency department and/or chronic environments was then formulated and verified through careful review, discussions with participants, and intellectual synthesis of all previously analyzed data.</p>

<sec id="section12-2150129712439714">
<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section13-2150129712439714">
<title>Owning Asthma</title>
<p>One of the dominant metaphor themes we uncovered through analysis was the notion of asthma ownership. The metaphorical concepts we identified through observations and analysis of recorded interactions lent support to this finding but were not readily obvious from the transcribed data. Rigorous analysis of the identified metaphors provided us with more insight into this aspect of the asthma experience supported by observational data. The word “have” or a derivative thereof saturated the data. The Merriam-Webster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129712439714">21</xref></sup> dictionary lists more than 13 meanings and 2 grammar parts (noun and verb) for the word “have.” All our patient and family participants verified they used the word “have” in describing their asthma experience to mean “to receive, accept, or obtain,” consistent with Merriam-Webster’s definition. Interestingly, when patient and family participants used the word “have” they were often observed bringing their hands to their chest. When asked about this gesture participants verified it to mean they owned or possessed the disease and conceptualized it as a part of themselves.</p>
<p>Additional exploration and analysis of this small but significant word led the researchers to identify this recurring term as a metaphorical concept defined as an ontological metaphor group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref></sup> The use of ontological metaphors provides a means for people to identify experiences as entities or substances that can be referred to, categorized, grouped, and quantified, thereby providing the means to reason about them. Most people unfamiliar with metaphorical research do not consider certain common words metaphorical in nature. However, further analysis and understanding of ontological metaphors support the notion that by using the word “have” people with asthma conceptualize the disease as an entity providing the means to deal rationally with the experience. The physical experience of receiving, accepting, or obtaining something is metaphorically applied to asthma, which cannot be physically held thereby allowing meaning to be ascribed to the disease or care thereof. Patients used ownership metaphors repeatedly during interviews. Family members verified this often both in observational data when they pointed at the patient when describing their loved ones’ disease and in verbal recording when they said statements such as “his asthma” or “her disease,” both possessive pronouns. Possessive pronouns are parts of speech that denote ownership, which also supports our ownership finding. Once the diagnosis of asthma was made, the participants used language describing the experience reflecting a sense of ownership communicated in a variety of ways. Several classes of metaphors emerged supporting the ownership theme.</p>
<sec id="section14-2150129712439714">
<title>The discovery of having asthma</title>
<p>Statements such as “I found out I had it,” “I discovered he had it,” and “I realized I had it” were made by asthma patient participants or their family members. Analysis of these statements suggested that being diagnosed with asthma was a revelation of some hidden truth and was the first step in accepting ownership of the disease. The types of metaphors used to describe the experience of discovering asthma and its subsequent inclusion into the whole being were complex figurative language referred to as structural metaphors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref></sup> The idea of discovering asthma used the highly structured and clearly delineated concept of knowledge to structure the less familiar concept of being diagnosed with asthma. Hence, the less familiar experience of being diagnosed with asthma could then be communicated through the use of the familiar structural metaphors relating to obtaining knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-2150129712439714">
<title>Nurses help make asthma discovery leading to ownership</title>
<p>Some patient participants stated that they thought they had asthma but it was not until a medical person confirmed their disease that they were willing to take ownership of it. Nurse participants indicated that they understood the process and worked toward facilitating ownership for their patients and families with asthma, similar to acceptance described by Kubler-Ross and Kessler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129712439714">23</xref></sup> as the healthy outcome of an unfavorable diagnosis. The following statements were made by nurse participants: “We are . . . giving them ownership,” “We help patients . . . take ownership of it,” “ . . . if we could get them to accept their disease . . .” Analysis of this finding demonstrated one way in which nurses implicitly understood the asthma experience and were conceptualizing the reality similarly to the patients and their families.</p>
<p>Observational data supported this finding as well. Chronic care nurses were observed providing informational literature, providing education, and answering patient and family member questions all in an attempt to help the patient and their family member understand the disease. When the nurse assessed patient understanding of the disease, a plan of care was discussed and collaboratively implemented. The process of nurse assessment, patient education, and a collaborative plan of action supported the finding that nurses assist patients in gaining ownership and ultimately better management of their disease.</p>
<p>Emergency department nurses were observed doing similar ownership giving activities when they were discharging their asthmatic patients. They reviewed the asthma follow-up discharge papers with the patients, asked if the patient or their family member had any additional questions, and reiterated the importance of seeking follow-up care with the pulmonologist. The participants verified that each of these activities led to a sense of owning their disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-2150129712439714">
<title>People own their asthma but ownership is problematic</title>
<p>Once patients realized they had asthma and they accepted ownership of the illness they were able to incorporate it into their being. Although patients accepted ownership of their disease and incorporated it into their sense of self, they found ownership to be undesirable and used metaphors such as “If you don’t have the problem you don’t believe it,” “It’s not funny when you’ve got the problem,” and “I wouldn’t wish this problem on my worst enemy.” Metaphorical language that revealed the difficulties of owning asthma demonstrated another way that patients and families explained and conceptualized their asthma experience. The “problem” metaphors were not inherent to the experience of asthma; instead, they arose from and were related to the way human beings interact with and experience the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>Metaphors of Health Care Assessment Are Visual</title>
<p>The second dominant metaphor theme that emerged from the data and was verified by all the participants (patients, family members, and nurses) was the use of visual metaphors used in and to describe health care assessments and the nursing process related to the asthma experience. Nurse participants used the following visual metaphors to help alleviate patient and family concerns: “OK, let’s see, what can I do for you?” and “. . . just keep an eye on things.”</p>
<p>Emergency department and chronic care nurses also used visual metaphors when describing medical regimens and plans of care with patients and family members. Nurse participants made the following remarks: “They come in and the first thing we look at is how well they are able to talk,” “They just don’t envision how it works, so they’re not always compliant,” “I told them just to watch it,” “There are 5 things that we look at with our patients,” and “During the last visit, we focus on relaxation.” In each of these examples, visual language was used metaphorically to relate to some part of the nursing process such as assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, or evaluation.</p>
<p>Visual metaphors were also used to describe the communication that occurred between nurses, patients, and family members in acute and chronic environments. When patients described their experiences in the emergency department and chronic care environments, they made the following statements: ‘I need to see the doctor right away,” “I like the nurses we see in our doctor’s office, at least I think they are nurses,” and “I thought I should be seen about the bleeding.”</p>
<p>Family member participants made similar statements, such as “Sometimes I just wish he could be seen sooner,” “We leave there [the asthma clinic] and just have to watch and see how he does,” and “The other day I called and asked if I could bring him in to be seen.” However, unlike the ownership metaphors where participants were observed bring their hands to their chest to demonstrate a sense of possession, no such hand or body gestures were observed when participants were using visual metaphors.</p>
<p>When questioned further about the meaning of the visual metaphors used in the above statements, the patients and family member participants stated that they used visual metaphors to mean assessment or evaluation by a nurse or other health care professional. Similarly, nurses explained their use of visual metaphors to indicate the assessments, interventions, education, and care given to patients and family members.</p>
<p>The visual metaphors we described in the above examples are referred to as ontological metaphors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref></sup> similar to the ownership metaphors described earlier. The less discrete events and activities such as nursing assessments, communication, nursing interventions, and understanding asthma regimens can be easily understood using the discrete entity of vision.</p>
<p>The visual taxonomy and paradigm was discussed and refined according to suggestions made by some of the participants. Ultimately, the participants verified the accuracy of the taxonomy and paradigm related to vision as a way of expressing and understanding the asthma experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129712439714">Table 1</xref>, Theme 2).</p>

<sec id="section18-2150129712439714">
<title>Asthma Is War Seeking Peace</title>
<p>Asthma is war seeking peace was one of the more traditional metaphor themes we identified and was consistent with findings from other metaphorical illness research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref></sup> The nurses, patients, and family members metaphorically described asthma as a war. Nurses were striving to restore or maintain peace. Several dominant metaphor classes were used to develop the theme and are described in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section19-2150129712439714">
<title>Asthma symptoms are imprisonment</title>
<p>Patients described their symptoms of asthma to nurses using metaphors relating to being imprisoned. Patient participants made the following statements: “I want freedom from the symptoms,” “I hope I can break it loose,” “It’s confining you know,” “I’m locked in. When I do get out I have to have my inhalers for sure.” These statements suggested one of the ways patients explained their illness situations as expressed through the use of metaphorical language. Although none of the patient participants had ever actually been imprisoned, their conceptualizations of imprisonment lead them to use such metaphors when referring to the symptoms of their illness. When patients were observed talking with the nurses and using imprisonment-type metaphors, their body language and gestures added support to this finding. One patient participant held up his arms in front of his face mimicking bars. Another patient moved her arms back and forth to indicate shaking the asthma symptoms loose. The more common experience of imprisonment or confinement was used to describe the less familiar human experience of asthma symptoms. Hence, the concept of unpleasant asthma symptoms was metaphorically represented using imprisonment terminology.</p>
<p>Similarly, emergency department nurses and chronic care nurses understood the sense of imprisonment and worked toward freedom from symptoms in an effort to restore peace and freedom. Nurses in both settings used similar confinement metaphors when interacting with patients and families and in discussion with the investigator regarding interactions with patients and families. Nurses used the following metaphors: “You [the patient] feel freedom, they [the patient] feel like they’re not tied to the phone,” “We get them an NMT [nebulized mist treatment] and usually, they’re feeling much freer to breathe,” “They come in and are really tight and clamped down and our first priority is to relieve that,” “We work to get them opened up as fast as possible.” Emergency department and chronic care nurses used metaphors that were understood and used by patients and their family members. The nurses were observed nodding their heads when listening to the patients as if they understood the frustrations of feeling imprisoned by the disease. The nurses incorporated the metaphors spoken by the patients and family members into their communication with them. The nurses demonstrated an understanding of how patients perceived their asthma experience by using metaphors that suggested they recognized the concept of imprisonment and worked toward peace and freedom for the patients. By using metaphors that the patients and their family members used, the nurses were able to increase the effectiveness of their communication and ultimately the care they provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-2150129712439714">
<title>Asthma fight can lead to death</title>
<p>Patients, families and nurses explained that asthma was a fight for improved states of health using compatible and similar metaphors. Military metaphors were used prolifically in the patterns of communication that occurred between nurses, patients, and family members. Asthma patients, their family members, and nurses made statements such as “He was having an asthma attack,” “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy,” “It’s pert near killed me,” “. . . causes me to go into full blast asthma,” and “We teach them what the medicine is fighting” revealed the perception that exacerbations of asthma are battles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-2150129712439714">
<title>Asthma attacks can ambush leading to uncertainty</title>
<p>Another metaphorical pattern used by patient and family participants consistent with the war theme was the notion that the asthma attacks could ambush the victim, leading to uncertainty. Patients made the following statements that supported this finding: “I don’t know when the attack is coming,” “I’ve had them hit me all at once and that’s pretty hard to take,” “I’m walking and all of the sudden, boom, it hits again.” Family member participants said the following: “I hate it when he gets those attacks” and “It would be nice to have some warning when he’s about to get the asthma attacks.” Although nurses were aware that patients and their family members feared being ambushed by an asthma attack, their medical expertise and experience gave them a slightly different perspective than the patients and family members. Thus, another finding that emerged by studying the language of emergency department and chronic care nurses was that both groups of nurses help patients avoid an ambush. Both chronic care nurses and emergency department nurses got frustrated by patients who were repeatedly ambushed by their disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-2150129712439714">
<title>Chronic care RNs help plan military strategies against asthma wars; emergency department nurses squelch the attacks</title>
<p>The war metaphor was also extended to describe the strategies that were used to bring peace to asthma patient’s sense of war. Chronic care nurses demonstrated an understanding of the patient’s perception of their experience by developing strategies to prevent future asthma attacks and minimize any battles that occurred. They did so by developing individualized care plans and by explaining the plans to the patients and family members. Their goal was to obtain peace in the war with asthma. The individualized care plans were described by the nurses, patients, and family members as a guide they could follow when they were at home to help them get the disease under better control.</p>
<p>Emergency department nurses demonstrated therapeutic communication toward asthma patients and their families by assisting to squelch the asthma attacks when they did occur. One emergency department nurse informant described one of her therapeutic interactions toward patients as “recognizing a patient in an acute asthma attack and getting them started on an NMT stat, even prior to a physician’s order.” The differences in the types of language between emergency department nurses and chronic care nurses were evidenced in the metaphors they used. Chronic care nurse participants made the following statements: “We have care plans that we design with the patients and their families,” “It’s like a road map they follow . . .,” and “The care plan correlates to the numbers . . . they follow a certain regimen.” In these cases, the words “plan,” “map,” and “regimen” were metaphorically conceptualized to mean a well-planned process to ameliorate symptoms congruent with planning strategies used militarily to win a war or battle.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the emergency department nurse participants were asked to describe some of their interactions with asthmatic patients and their families, they used more immediate, rapid, and urgent-type metaphors. Samples of their language are as follows: “People coming in with acute asthma attacks, they often have more than one exacerbation so immediately you go back and start an NMT, . . . you are grabbing the first person you see,” “You don’t ask questions, you get treatment started stat and get them going on an NMT,” “They are working just to breathe so we throw them in a wheelchair,” and “He waited too long, we couldn’t reverse the process, so anybody who tells someone with asthma, you’re never going to die from asthma ought to be shot.” The participants demonstrated how the initial phases of an acute asthma experience are conceptualized by the metaphors they used. At this phase of the asthma condition, participants structured the concepts around urgency and speed of nursing interventions versus the careful long-term planning done by the chronic care nurses. The metaphorical concepts used by emergency department nurses were structured around active military conflict and the need to use experience and training to quickly defeat the opponent, which is the worsening asthma condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-2150129712439714">
<title>Family members are reinforcements for patients fight against asthma</title>
<p>Family members of people with asthma were also actively involved in the asthma war. The asthmatic situation was also described by family members using war metaphors. Family members metaphorically viewed themselves as providing support in the fight against asthma attacks. Family members made the following statements: “I was trying to shield him from people who are sick,” “I’ve darn near killed myself getting out there ’cause I thought he was having an asthma attack,” and “I was always fighting everything so he wouldn’t get sick.” When family member participants were asked about these specific words they reinforced the finding that they conceptualized themselves as fellow team members to help the patient defeat the asthma enemy. All the family member participants viewed themselves as a part of the asthma process even though they were not the person diagnosed with the disease. This conceptualization is consistent with support personnel such as military families and civilians working in the armed forces to support those in active duty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-2150129712439714">
<title>The asthma war and peace model</title>
<p>Some authors, who have also identified military-type metaphors as a way of understanding illnesses, seem to experience a conflict between the use of military and war metaphors and the concept of caring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712439714">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129712439714">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712439714">25</xref></sup> Although this phenomenon requires additional study, we theorize that military personnel consider their actions to protect people and country as caring endeavors and the 2 concepts are not mutually exclusive. The combative nature of military actions does not necessarily negate the intended caring outcome, which is that of protection and service to country much like nurses care for and protect patients. Nurses demonstrated understanding through the words they used, which brought peace to the war of asthma. Through metaphorical analysis, we conceptualized the patient and their family members involved in a tumultuous asthma war. The nurse was aware of the asthma war and was ready and prepared to begin the peace process. When the nurse, patient, and family interacted in a health care environment and communicated using congruent metaphors, the initiation of peace could begin. The nurse incorporated his/her use of language during the nursing process in an attempt to restore health. The nurses’ language resulted in the restoration of peace and health for the patient and their family member. All the participants involved in the asthma health care experience were affected and will carry the experience into their respective futures.</p>
<p>A careful analysis of the identified asthma is war seeking peace metaphorical paradigm helped construct the meta-metaphor for this study. A synthesis and comparison of the asthma war and peace metaphorical concepts were rigorously analyzed and verified with all participants. The participants verified the accuracy of the developed war and peace taxonomy and paradigm shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129712439714">Table 1</xref>, Theme 3.</p>

<title>The Meta-Metaphor Principle: Owning and Winning the Asthma War</title>
<p>A careful analysis of all previously analyzed data with confirmation from the participants lead to the development of the meta-metaphor that described how people knew and expressed their reality and experiences with asthma. The meta-metaphoric principle was labeled “Owning and Winning the Asthma War” to capture the meaning of the asthma experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129712439714">Table 1</xref>, meta-metaphor principle).

<title>Metaphor as a Way of Knowing</title>
<p>For the purposes of this study, metaphor was conceptualized according to the Lakoff and Johnson conceptual metaphor theory. Lakoff and Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129712439714">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150129712439714">27</xref></sup> stated in their theory the concepts that govern thought are not just matters of the intellect, they also govern everyday functioning. Concepts structure what people perceive, how people function in the world, and how they relate to other people. The conceptual system thus plays a central role in defining everyday realities. The human conceptual system is theorized to be largely metaphorical. The way people think, how they experience, and what they do every day is a matter of metaphor. Therefore, a systematic study of metaphors can uncover perception, lead to understanding, and enhance therapeutic relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712439714">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129712439714">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2150129712439714"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2150129712439714">31</xref></sup> A deep level of understanding perception is especially important in health care sciences.

<p>Increasing numbers of researchers and authors accept the premise that metaphor is pervasive in language and the human conceptual system is fundamentally metaphorical. As such, examinations of metaphors used in a variety of health care settings have offered new ways of more thoroughly understanding many aspects of nursing and health care. Some researchers used metaphorical analysis to examine specific arenas of nursing practice such as community health nursing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2150129712439714">32</xref></sup> mental health nursing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2150129712439714">33</xref></sup> and nephrology nursing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2150129712439714">34</xref></sup> Other researchers used metaphors to understand nursing experiences. For example, McAllister and McLaughlin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2150129712439714">35</xref></sup> explored metaphors used by nursing students to describe their experiences with their nursing professors. Cook and Gordon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129712439714">1</xref></sup> explored using a metaphorical approach to teach qualitative research methods to nursing students. Froggat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2150129712439714">36</xref></sup> studied metaphors to understand hospice work and nurse bereavement. Wurzbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2150129712439714">37</xref></sup> examined moral metaphors that could provide values for the nursing experience.</p>
<p>Metaphorical analysis has also been applied to various patient populations to better understand their experiences. Health experiences such as myocardial infarctions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2150129712439714">38</xref></sup> diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2150129712439714">39</xref></sup> osteoporosis risk in women,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2150129712439714">40</xref></sup> health promotion/disease prevention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2150129712439714">41</xref></sup> and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref></sup> have been examined using a metaphorical analysis approach. Other researchers have also described the significance of understanding communication patterns as effective ways of knowing. For example, Hovey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2150129712439714">42</xref></sup> described the basis of their method to better understand patient safety as determining a common ground between health care provider and patient. They furthered their premise by concluding that the common ground “can only be provided by the dialogue they sustain between themselves”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2150129712439714">42</xref>(p663)</sup> The goal of their study was to show how communication between health care professionals and patient/family members can enhance patient safety. The conclusions Hovey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2150129712439714">42</xref></sup> made were useful for understanding the significance nurse communication has on promoting patient safety. Additional metaphorical analysis, however, may have yielded more than a description of conversations relating to patient safety and led to an understanding of the meanings of communication and how patient safety is perceived.</p>
<p>An examination of metaphors used in a variety of health care situations has offered a deeper understanding of how people think and perceive their illnesses; however, not all authors agree that metaphor is a valid way to understand a particular phenomenon. Most notably, Susan Sontag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129712439714">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712439714">25</xref></sup> claimed that the healthiest way to handle an illness is to avoid metaphoric thinking altogether. Her work examined the disease processes of tuberculosis, cancer, and AIDS and determined that regarding them metaphorically only yields dread and impairs healing. However, her writing to discredit metaphors is riddled with metaphors. In her opening remarks of <italic>Illness as Metaphor</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129712439714">24</xref></sup> she metaphorically related health to good and bad kingdoms and the desire to remain in the good kingdom, an obvious metaphorical interpretation.</p>
<p>Subsequent authors have criticized Sontag’s work and argued for the usefulness of studying metaphors in health care. Penson et al claimed that “metaphors illuminate complex issues”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref>(p708)</sup> and described the importance of understanding metaphors relating to cancer. Rather than trying to inhibit the usefulness of metaphor as Sontag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129712439714">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129712439714">25</xref></sup> has done, results from work by Penson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref></sup> are being used to provide multidisciplinary forums for caregivers to reflect on the impact of illness for the patients and families they care for. Other authors claimed it is impossible to perceive reality without metaphorical perception,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129712439714">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2150129712439714">31</xref></sup> thus refuting the notion that metaphor is merely rhetorical flourish or an embellishment of language.</p>

<title>Support for Ownership</title>
<p>Protudjer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129712439714">14</xref></sup> identified themes that were often broader versions of the ownership metaphors identified in our study. For example, their identified theme of “acknowledging the impact of asthma”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129712439714">14</xref>(p97)</sup> was similar to our metaphor class labeled “Owning Asthma Is Problematic.” The metaphors we identified that led to the owning asthma is problematic class were also used by the participants in the study by Protudjer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129712439714">14</xref></sup> but not identified as metaphor.</p>
<p>Nurses often work to get patients to accept ownership of their diseases. From the very earliest stages of nurse education, student nurses are taught the benefits of helping patients move to acceptance following difficult or sad information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129712439714">23</xref></sup> Analysis of the metaphors used by nurses to help patients and their families move to acceptance and ultimate ownership of the disease demonstrate nurse participant understanding of meaning patients and family members ascribe to the asthma experience. We theorized that this type of effective nursing language might lead to improved asthma outcomes in the adult population because similar studies have been done in the asthmatic pediatric population, suggesting an improved sense of well-being when patients’ language is carefully considered by health care professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129712439714">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2150129712439714">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2150129712439714">43</xref></sup></p>

<title>Support for Asthma War</title>
<p>Several researchers also identified illness metaphors that related to the concept of war consistent with the findings of this study. Researchers studying the pediatric asthma population found similar metaphorical themes and paradigms especially in language used by nurses. Englund et al used a grounded theory open theme coding approach for data analysis and concluded that interactions with professional caregivers were useful in teaching adolescents to “take command”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2150129712439714">43</xref>(p193)</sup> and “conquer life.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2150129712439714">43</xref>(p196)</sup> They claim effective communication between asthma patients and the health care providers lead to improved health outcomes consistent with our adult findings. Further research might be useful to determine if the war-type metaphors nurses use with asthmatic children affects how adults with asthma perceive their illness. War metaphors have also been found in cancer research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129712439714">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129712439714">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>More Research Warranted</title>
<p>Additional research is needed to understand how and when nurse metaphors become congruent with the language of the patient groups they are caring for. All the nurses in this study had been in practice and working with asthma patients for many years. The patients and family members reported a level of comfort believing the nurses understood their asthma experience because of the familiar metaphors they used. A follow-up study examining if novice nurses are able to metaphorically conceptualize illness in the same way their patients do and if the perceived level of care changes based on years of nursing experience and ultimately the language used is indicated.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A noted limitation of this study was the exclusion of varying ages, races, and socioeconomic status of the participants. Although the participant selection process was deliberate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129712439714">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129712439714"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129712439714">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2150129712439714">44</xref></sup> additional metaphorical studies are needed to determine if other groups of individuals with asthma use similar metaphors to perceive the asthma experience. A subsequent study is currently underway examining the experience of asthma in school-aged children living in an underserved urban setting. The findings of that study will be compared with the results reported in this article.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Knowledge gained through a study of metaphoric concepts is only useful if it makes interpretation possible. The reconstruction of metaphorical models of perception can provide useful information for consultation, therapy, prevention, and interventions in the health and human sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129712439714">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2150129712439714">31</xref></sup> We believe our study has accomplished this goal relating to the adult asthmatic population. We have suggested through the results of this study the importance of nurses understanding the perceived reality of their patients. When mutual perceptions are communicated, healing can occur and outcomes can be improved through effective nursing interventions. Rigorous analysis of metaphors within language can reveal hidden meanings and deep truths. More qualitative studies are needed using metaphoric analysis as a mode of inquiry to discover and better understand other areas within nursing. Analyses of metaphors used in health care interactions can provide deep insight into the meaning of human care experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129712439714">4</xref></sup> Nursing strives to understand these meanings to enhance nursing knowledge and ultimately provide improved care.</p>
