<p><italic>The Iconic Obama, 2007–2009: Essays on Media Representations of the Candidate and the New President</italic>, co-edited by Nicholas A. Yanes and Derrias Carter, comes at just the right cultural moment, when scholars around the globe are speculating and theorizing about the representational differences and distinctions between Obama’s first and second presidential campaigns. This book sets a starting point for anyone interested in those distinctions by capturing representational elements surrounding the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p>The first campaign was an undeniable global movement, showcasing representational diversity in social and political arenas and flooding popular media with favorable images of Obama in magazines, music videos and in high and low art. In contrast, the second was comparatively more conservative, with perhaps only a margin of the mass celebrity influence. And yet, Obama won again. So, did the first campaign overdo it? Were global citizens exploited by the media capitalizing on the novelty of a black man being nominated as a major political party’s preferred candidate—and ultimately winning? And has the world grown passé about the “whole race thing”, thinking Obama’s like every other (white) man? And has he now become a ‘good ol’ boy’, just a biracial one? Co-editor Nicholas Yanes raises similar questions and urges further theorizing on Obama in his conclusion to the book, when he asks: “What happened to Obama-mania” (236)?</p>
<p>The main contribution of this important collection is not about what happened to the hype about Obama, but rather the phenomenon we witnessed just a few short years ago, with the rise of a real (as opposed to a representation) black male political icon (as opposed to one in entertainment, or civil rights). Given American history—and the present—this is an extraordinarily big deal! To highlight just how incredible this is, in the acknowledgments Yanes thanks “[his] niece whose freakish knowledge of the 2008 campaign—occurring when she was six—made [him] realize just how much of an impact Obama was having on popular culture” (xi). Yanes and Carter have done scholars and the public a real service by applying the academic apparatus of American Studies, characterized by its interdisciplinarity and multi-lens foci on a single issue, in this case Obama’s iconic stature in the media, framed between the year preceding and immediately following Obama’s election (2007–2009). The book is nothing less than a comprehensive compendium on this three-year period, covering a wide array of topics from “hegemonic masculinity” to filmic portrayals of black presidents; from the use of digital media in the campaign to Obama’s international appeal—an appeal that lead even Muammar Gaddafi to comment positively on Obama’s victory (17).</p>
<p>The book begins with an introduction by Derrias Carter, who describes how the 17 ensuing chapters are organized into six divisions. The first, “Forging a Brand: Introducing Obama-Mania” includes Angela Nelson, a leading scholar of black popular culture studies, who begins the section with an intriguing examination on how popular culture and representations of Obama inescapably affect all of us. Following is a co-authored piece by Etse Sikanku and Nicholas Yanes, who examine both Obama’s literary memoir (<italic>Dreams for My Father</italic>) and his political one (<italic>The Audacity of Hope</italic>) and tease out the ways Obama himself reports on his identity as an American and global citizen. Patrick Oray rounds out the unit with a narratological and semiotic analysis of branding the presidency. He does this by focusing on how myth-making is commonly engaged in pivotal moments of history. The second section, “Film and Television: Change Televised” contains just two essays (as do the following two sections). But they both pack a punch. “Character-in-Chief: Barack Obama and His Pop Culture Predecessors” by Justin S. Vaugh analyzes films and TV series that feature black presidents—such as <italic>Deep Impact</italic> and <italic>2012</italic>—and the impact they had on the public’s reception and perceptions of Obama. This is followed by Jenny Banh, who discusses a discursive moment from the show “Boston Legal,” showing how whites in the company of others negotiate racial politics in an arguably “postracial” setting.</p>
<p>The pair of articles in the third section, “Hip-Hop Culture: Remixed Response to Obama’s Popularity” are by Travis L. Gosa and Erika Schneider, respectively. Gosa covers the preponderance of hip-hop in the 2008 campaign and provides keen insight into the relation among race, politics, and music. Schneider teases out and explains why the seemingly low art form of graffiti was given an officially high artistic status in the Obama campaign in “The Politics of Tagging: Shepard Fairey’s Obama.”</p>
<p>Section four contains the essays: “Comic Books: Obama’s Popularity and the Original Superhero Medium” and “Obama and Spider-Man: A Meta-Data Analysis of an Unlikely Pairing” by Robert E. Weiner and Shelley E. Barba and “Comics and Politics: An Interview with Larra Hama, Creator of <italic>Barack the Barbarian</italic>” by Nicholas Yanes. Weiner and Barba illustrate just how in their view, “Spider-Man is the perfect hero to tie with Obama precisely because, although he is admired as a superhero, he is imperfect and sometimes makes decisions that have negative side effects” (124). Yanes’ interview with Hama provides a behind the scenes look at the development of Obama as a comic book character from conception to production.</p>
<p>The fifth section, “News Media and New Media: The Impact of Presidential New Politics and Digital Social Networks” is the longest unit, containing four essays and two interviews. The first essay is “Change That Couldn’t Happen: News Media’s Commitment to Hegemonic Masculinity through Collective Memory in the 2008 Presidential Election” by Robert E. Gutsche, Jr., James Carviou, and Rauf Arif. This important analysis explores the term “hegemonic masculinity” and the ways that power tends to coalesce around (white) men in America, and how Obama fits into that paradigm. Following is John T. “Jack” Becker’s discussion of the discourse and fallout surrounding Obama’s attempt to intervene positively into American education in “The President Speaks to America’s Schoolchildren: Outline of a Brouhaha.” In the next piece, Caroline A. Streeter lingers on an old sexual taboo and relationship between blacks and whites in “Obama Jungle Fever: Interracial Desire on the Campaign Trail.” The section is smartly rounded out by two interviews that focus respectively on “news media and new media.” They are “How to Understand Obama’s Election News Coverage: An Interview with Daniel Berkowitz” handled by Nicholas A. Yanes, With Derrais Carter and Robert E. Gutsche, Jr. and “New Media’s Impact on Elections: An Interview with Obama Girl Creator Ben Relles” by James Carviou. The last division is the necessary and important consideration of Obama and the global in “SIX–International Responses: Obama’s Popularity Goes Global.” There are two essays, one about Obama as represented in Japan, the other in Turkey. The last is an interview with a French journalist. In order of reading, the selections are: “Obama for Obama: Barack Obama in Japanese Popular Culture” by Yuya Kiuchi; “Obama-Mania in Turkey: Popular Culture and the Forty-Fourth President of the United States in a Secular Muslim Nation” by Zafer Parlak and Tanfer Emin Tunc; and Nicholas Yanes’ “France’s News Media and Obama’s French Popularity: Interview with Sebastian Compagnon.” The book ends with a conclusion by Yanes that speculates on the impact the first campaign had on the second.</p>
<p>The individual essays are uniformly interesting and intellectually sound. As noted, the contributors are diverse, ranging from graduate students in American Studies to assistant professors of political science to associate professors of popular culture, with others coming from the field of librarian and information sciences. This variety adds spice and the co-editors deftly arrange the writings so that they not only speak to one another, but also illustrate the claim Carter makes about the book, that “it explores the widespread enthusiasm associated with Obama and its implications for the study of popular culture” (1).</p>
<p>As a scholar and someone deeply interested in representations of Obama, I find the book useful not only to my research, but also in the courses I teach in American Studies, African American Studies, cultural studies, and gender studies. Others will certainly find much to mine in courses on popular culture, media studies, race, communication studies, as well as English and urban studies. <italic>The Iconic Obama, 2007–2009</italic> is overall a well-done project. However, I do have two criticisms that I hope can double as encouragement to the co-editors. In several places the co-editors reference their current status as PhD candidates in American Studies. While references to their field of scholarship is fine, there is no need to report on their year of training. Why even mention it beyond the bio on the back of the book? The publication of a major book like this stands on its own merits and will be in conversation with books published by full professors. Pointing out their student status could lessen the reception and impact. It might make the authors appear too green. Scholarship and publication is an equalizer. There is no need to actively point out university status differences.</p>
<p>Also, I did want to learn more from these editors in a more substantive introduction and conclusion, two spaces where they could have deepened the book’s claims. It was unsatisfying to me to read that “the project’s overarching argument is that Barack Obama’s campaign and transition into the American presidency created a space in which activists, politicians, fans, and artists converged, using Obama’s image to represent respective ideologies” (1). This is true and readily observable. But the question is, so what? So while the co-editors contribute to the selections in the main of the text, particularly Yanes, I would rather that they linger over a longish, intellectually rigorous foregrounding and ending. That said, the text as a whole stands solidly as a contribution to Obama studies in American Studies and related fields.</p>
