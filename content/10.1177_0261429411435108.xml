<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to encourage a greater emphasis on creativity across and between varied fields of endeavour. It has been written to underline the interdisciplinary significance of creativity and the role of creativity in truly enhancing achievement. There is a reinvigorated awareness of the need for ‘big thinking’, a global concern that the Australian Government (April 2008) profiled in its 2020 Summit. Essentially, ‘big thinking’ involves being a connection-maker together with being a creative problem-finder and problem-solver. It is imagination and originality valued within a social context. While welcoming and exploring the powerful vision of the 2020 summit, the article also aims to encourage its application to daily life. While creativity is included as one of the ‘General Capabilities’ in the new National Curriculum for Australia (ACARA, 2010), it needs to be kept in focus to ensure that creativity is pervasive throughout the curriculum, and not just an ‘add-on’ activity.</p>

<title>Big thinking</title>
<p>Shining the light on creativity, a term used synonymously in this paper with the popular term ‘big thinking’, involves putting it under the microscope to see it more clearly. While examining it, however, its full meaning will still elude us. It is thinking that is ‘big’ – going beyond the ordinary, beyond the usual and expected. And its iridescence dazzles. Without the magnifying light of the microscope on it, we underestimate and undervalue its significance. It is the compelling need for creativity that this article explores and advocates to educators, leaders and policy-makers in education and other disciplines.</p>
<p>Creativity provides new perspectives and insights that come about through the recombination of ideas which one might not expect to come together. As expressed in the educational report from the United Kingdom on creativity and culture, creativity is ‘making unusual connections, seeing analogies and relationships between ideas or objects that have not previously been related’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429411435108">NACCCE, 1999</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>To understand the complexities of creativity it is important to consider:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the <italic>process </italic>of thinking of ideas – including divergent – to generate a <italic>product </italic>that is valued in a particular situation or<italic> context</italic>, and </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the <italic>person</italic> with all the characteristics of the creative thinker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435108">Baer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435108">Kaufman and Sternberg, 2006</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Hence, the article proceeds by illuminating each of these facets of creativity – the process, the product, the context and the person – to promote its significance and nurture its growth. Creativity is something that hits the right note, rings true and is of recognisable quality. In conceptualising creativity there seem to be agreed components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0261429411435108">Sternberg et al., 2002</xref>). These include novelty, the notion of value and aptness. While defying definition, there might at least be some consensus on the view that creativity is ‘the process of having original ideas that have value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0261429411435108">Robinson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of attitude or will must also be included in a conceptualisation of creativity’s part in achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411435108">Frankl (1946)</xref> indicated that in ‘extreme conditions humans may have no opportunity to be creative, productive or even to enjoy the beauty of nature . . . but they can choose to make life “meaningful” ’ (pp. 75–76) and ‘Everything can be taken from a man [sic] but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way’ (1946: 75).</p>
<p>Human ‘uniqueness and singleness’, Frankl asserts, distinguish each individual and give a meaning that impacts on both creative work and love. In his words, bridging the gap seems to be part of the accomplishment:<disp-quote>
<p>Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become . . . challenging man [sic] with a potential meaning for him to fulfil.</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411435108">Frankl, 1946</xref>: 110)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The conflict, the tension and the need for resolution and for the gap to be filled constitute an important drive in creative achievement and will be considered below.</p>

<sec id="section2-0261429411435108">
<title>Creativity: why pin it down?</title>
<p>We pin down the wings of creativity in order to examine how best to nurture it. Long considered something to be grasped even from the seventeenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49a-0261429411435108">Kolp, 2009</xref>)- creativity is clearly placed as one of the essential words in the ‘vocabulary’ of the twenty-first century education along with communication, values and critical thinking in the address by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0261429411435108">Wardlaw (2008</xref>) reflecting on Australia’s National Curriculum. It is on the agenda. It was this process that was called for at the Australian 2020 Summit. The importance of creative as well as critical thinking in the development of the National Curriculum for Australia is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429411435108">McGaw (2008</xref>), who refers to such thinking, as well as metacognitive understanding, as an important skill to be included in the new curriculum. That is to say, awareness of what is needed in certain contexts enhances achievement that is derived from creative output, which must also be critically evaluated. The question, however, is how best to promote that awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435108">Fisher, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>If universities, sometimes labelled with the oxymoron ‘ideas factories’, are to contribute through research and presumably ‘big ideas’ to knowledge creation, they need to keep to the fore such recommendations as those put forward in the West Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411435108">DETYA, 1998</xref>: 46). In essence, the review was supporting creativity and the motivation to learn and to keep on learning. The capacity to continue to learn is more likely to be engaged when attention is given to connecting critical and creative thinking with the willing readiness for seeking and finding out.</p>

<sec id="section3-0261429411435108">
<title>So what is it to have big thoughts . . . to create?</title>
<sec id="section4-0261429411435108">
<title>The process</title>
<p>Asked about his process for coming up with his ideas in chemistry, the Nobel prize winner Linus Pauling is said to have recommended having many ideas, most of which will be wrong, but it is important to know which ideas should be thrown away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411435108">Crick, 1996</xref>). This parallels Bruner’s discussion of creativity (1962, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435108">Fisher, 2002</xref>), which is ‘founded on experimentation, variations . . . and successful adaptation of these variations’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435108">Fisher (2002</xref>), in his keynote address in Hong Kong, suggested that ‘to create is to generate something . . . bringing something into being . . . to be productive in thought, word or deed’.</p>
<p>Perceiving and synthesising relevance leads to insights that may be the impetus for innovation. This process was delineated in an early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0261429411435108">Wallas and Smith (1926</xref>), <italic>The Art of Thought</italic>. In their stage model, creative insights allowing adaptation to change included:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>preparation</italic>, a preliminary exploration of the problem or question – as when an inventor or businessman conducts market research to see what is lacking;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>incubation</italic>, where the problem seems to be inert – as when a poet mulls over incoming data, whether sensory, spiritual, emotional or intellectual;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>intimation</italic>, where there is the hint of breakthrough – as when the scientist has a hunch;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>illumination</italic> or awareness of the insight – as when a medical practitioner has a breakthrough in problem-solving; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>verification</italic>, when the idea is applied and accepted – as when a designer makes the idea work in the real world.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>To be more specific about the actual skills of creative thinking, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429411435108">Guilford in 1950</xref> and Torrance’s tests in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-0261429411435108">1974</xref> highlighted divergent thinking and problem-solving skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435108">Baer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411435108">Cramond et al., 2005</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>fluency: the total number of ‘interpretable’, ‘meaningful’ and ‘relevant’ responses; flexibility: different categories of relevant responses;</p>
<p>originality: the statistical rarity of the responses among the subjects; and elaboration: the expanded detail in the responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
In relation to the divergent thinking aspects of creativity, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429411435108">Daugherty and White (2008</xref>) revealed that both originality and fluency were related to self-direction in the private speech of pre-kindergarten children. Through using the Torrance creativity test ‘Thinking Creatively in Action and Movement’ (TCAM), investigation focused on the creative-thinking factors of monitoring, defining and generating solutions. It seemed to parallel the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0261429411435108">Sternberg et al. (2002</xref>) on creative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435108">problem-solving, and McGaw’s (2008)</xref> concern for learning self-awareness or metacognition as integral to creative achievement. </p>

<title>Transferring creativity: real-world success</title>
<p>While the focus here is on creativity’s part in achievement, it should be noted that creativity is sometimes seen as a gift that needs nurturing (Gagne, 2003), and which, unnoticed, can actually contribute to underachievers’ loss of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435108">Baum, Renzulli and Hebert, 1995</xref>). While there needs to be caution in predicting real-world creative performance, the work on divergent thinking does point to some predictability from test scores to later-life creative achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411435108">Cramond et al., 2005</xref>). Divergent thinking needs real-world application, with all the catalysts to optimise its chances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435108">Carson et al., 2005</xref>) to ensure actual achievement. Without the real-world application, an idea can remain just that and innovation need not follow. Concepts learned in classrooms – whether in schools or in workplaces – should be ‘resolved in real-life processes’, as suggested by Veliot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411435108">Cropley, 2006</xref>), who, with regard to training at the General Motors Company, recommended that the learning</p>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>– as creative thinking tends to do.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411435108">
<title>Creativity and expertise</title>
<p>It should be made clear that the author is not suggesting that creative thinking supplant deep knowledge. The place of expertise is fundamental. In respect to this, we know that expertise, while valued, needs also to be tempered with the glance of the novice – an expert viewing with fresh eyes. The ‘novice effect’ is said to be seen in experts who can ‘break out of the straitjacket of their own expertise and look at their subject with the openness and freshness of beginners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Seeing ourselves as learners, whatever our workplace, takes us closer to providing an environment for creative thought. A concrete example of embedding creativity in a culture of learning comes from the work of Costa (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>) at the University of Cyprus, who, with 15 years’ experience in engineering design, teaches techniques to improve creativity. The aim has been to encourage the mechanical engineers to be more open-minded with a wider view when searching for alternative solutions. Facilitating expression of creative thoughts and developing creativity through appropriate techniques such as analogy can come through the process of synectics, which connects seemingly unconnected ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429411435108">Forster, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429411435108">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In their training, the engineering graduates were required to produce something new or to use the materials in a radically unconventional way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>). Those who were given counselling in creativity’s novelty and effectiveness were, indeed, more innovative. The machines they constructed were judged by experts to be more elegant and creative, bearing in mind, of course, that:<disp-quote>
<p>Engineering requires high levels of expertise, mastery of basic knowledge , skills and techniques. The public wants machines to work and bridges to continue standing.</p>
<attrib>— (Root-Bernstein, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>: 23)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Originality is simply a fresh pair of eyes.</p>
<attrib>— Woodrow Wilson</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of the need to make sense of the burden of current information and combine it in a new way is underlined in the work of Gardner (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429411435108">Henshon, 2006</xref>), who voices our everyday concern: ‘Nowadays everyone is deluged by web information – but how do you decide what is important and how do you put it all together? One must be able to synthesise.’ Creativity includes both analysis, to break apart information with insight, and synthesis, to put it together into an original whole. It never underestimates the importance of knowledge. Rather, it recommends a different emphasis. The knowledge and deep understanding are fundamental, and judgement is applied to recognise and evaluate the relevance of the information.</p>
<p>Creativity is seen as an ‘integral part of giftedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>: 4). When asked to consider the highest achievers, engineers rated most highly by their colleagues displayed good grasp of factual knowledge, rapid recall, logical thinking in addition to having unusual ideas, tolerating the unconventional and the ambiguous and seeing unexpected implications (Facaoaru, 1985, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>: 4). Achievement, then, is a combination of traditional knowledge and further thinking to use it in a new way.</p>
<sec id="section7-0261429411435108">
<title>Problem-solving: the shortfall from creativity</title>
<p>A major drive in creativity is solving a problem in the sense of seeing a gap and needing to bridge it, as alluded to earlier in Frankl’s philosophical work. It is also said that children who are well in advance of their peers ‘have an unusually well-developed capacity to sense discrepancies and differences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0261429411435108">Shore and Kanevsky, 1993</xref>: 140), and tend to be effective problem-solvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261429411435108">New South Wales Department of Education and Training, 2004</xref>).<disp-quote>
<p>By imagining possibilities and evaluating options, creative individuals structure, define and delimit the problem or question. They combine, reorganise or reshape what little there may already be and ‘generate new understandings needed to solve problems . . . these new understandings must be evaluated and translated into action plans to bring creative ideas into being.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261429411435108">Mumford et al., 1993</xref>: 17)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Problem-solving, creativity and thinking skills are among the essential capabilities to be embedded in the new National Curriculum for Australia, and are also advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0261429411435108">Wallace (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0261429411435108">2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0261429411435108">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0261429411435108">2009</xref>) in the UK. Where problem-solving falls short of explaining, the process of creativity is expressed as follows, though sometimes a ‘problem’ is seen as a negative issue rather than an opportunity for expansion and breakthrough:<disp-quote>
<p>Not all problems call for creative solutions or original thinking . . . Composing poetry, painting pictures or ‘playing’ with abstract ideas in science or mathematics are not always problem-solving as normally understood . . . creative thinkers find problems we hadn’t imagined.</p>

<title>Why do we need to think big?</title>
<sec id="section9-0261429411435108">
<title>The context</title>
<p>In 1993, the former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating urged that we become a ‘clever country’, and an Australian journalist commented: ‘The people who can identify changing trends, changing demand, solve problems and invent new designs and concepts are the most valued by the community. That trend is increasing world-wide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411435108">Bernasek, 1993</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>Education was thought to be our greatest strength over our Asia-Pacific trading rivals, but we were reminded ‘to develop a workforce that has the edge over other countries, we need to improve our use of this asset’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411435108">Bernasek, 1993</xref>: 34). Having ‘the edge’ is, in part, a measure of creativity. This might be said to be synonymous with experimentation and originality; cleverness, it was thought, meant being creative – ‘it is all about ideas’ (Keating, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411435108">Jones, 1993</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, the Australian Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, urged ‘more ambitious partnerships to generate social innovation’ and showed her support for the University of New South Wales Centre for Social Impact’s objectives (UNSW Alumni magazine, May–June 2008). Thus, the context in Australia is being set for new approaches to making a difference and to contributing to society’s accumulated knowledge.</p>
<p>The interdependence of economic context and creative production has been referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0261429411435108">Westbury (2009</xref>) in <italic>The Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, in which he wrote that ‘creativity is far behind New South Wales capital’. In setting up a scheme to support creative opportunities by providing work spaces in vacated buildings, he recommended that artists, policy-makers and audiences alike should all be aware that creative output is integral to economic cycles.</p>
<p>The creative writer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0261429411435108">Winterson (2007</xref>) alerts us to the contextual factor in our creative response to the world:<disp-quote>
<p>You can change everything about yourself – your name, your home, your skin colour, your gender, even your parents, your private history – but you can’t change the time you were born in, or what it is you will have to live through.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We may define ourselves, in fact, by an organic sum of individual creative breakthroughs, alluded to also by Van Tassel-Baska (2004). Fundamentally a history of humanity's achievements is the set of lives of Great Men(sic) who have worked here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435108">Carlyle, 1840</xref>: 5). If, actually, ‘history is the essence of innumerable biographies’ (Carlyle, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0261429411435108">Van Tassel-Baska, 2004</xref>), we had better make them worthwhile biographies and significantly creative contributions if we are to influence change positively. Successful application, however, requires the right context. Indeed, the context creates the need as well as the opportunity.</p>
<p>In his foreword to a book on innovative thinking by Buzan, known especially for his work on mindmapping, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429411435108">Lundin (2009)</xref> points to the newly intensified focus on creativity from a number of diverse countries: 
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Any individual, company or country wishing to survive and thrive in the twenty-first century must develop the brain’s infinite capacity to create and innovate.’</p></disp-quote>Clearly, creativity is on the agenda for education in the United Kingdom, where it is recorded in national curriculum documents that creativity is important for improving students’ ‘self-esteem, motivation and achievement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261429411435108">Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, 2000</xref>). By being encouraged to think creatively and independently, a trait of creative thinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435108">Colangelo and Davis, 2003</xref>), students can explore and pursue new ideas beyond the classroom. Further, such encouragement ‘should enable pupils to respond to opportunities, challenges and responsibilities, to manage risk and to cope with change and adversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261429411435108">Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>The need for and the nurturing of big ideas</title>
<p>Highlighting the need for creativity in education, the UK’s National Advisory Committee on Creativity and Cultural Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429411435108">NACCCE, 1999</xref>: 14) reported that ‘high standards in creative achievement require just as much rigour as traditional academic work’ and that ‘creative abilities are needed in all forms of business and in all types of work’.</p>
<p>Who could dispute the worth of supporting the big thinkers in our communities? We were reminded of its importance in an edition of the alumni magazine (The Office of the Vice-Chancellor, UNSW Alumni Magazine, May/June 2008): ‘Our students and researchers are the thought leaders of the future who will make a real difference to our world by addressing contemporary and social issues through research, learning and teaching.’</p>
<p>In the public perception, acknowledgement of creativity’s power seems, in Australia, to be at a simmering point until an event such as the 2020 Summit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411435108">Commonwealth of Australia, 2008</xref>) actively canvasses so-called ‘big ideas’. The important issue is to keep it constantly on the boil. Significant points in relation to encouraging greater creativity were made at the summit. After brainstorming ideas, working groups considered ways of introducing creativity everywhere in society, and came up with specific ideas that make visionary sense for connecting creativity and achievement. Bringing their recommendations to fruition across many disciplines is one of the major challenges of current education, so that creativity is indeed allowed to be the hub of achievement. The faces of creative thinking should match inside and outside the windows of the classroom.</p>

<title>Creativity: driving change</title>
<p>In line with the aim of the European Union Council on Culture in its European Year of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0261429411435108">Creativity and Innovation (2009)</xref>, this article has as its humble purpose to promote awareness, debate and cross-disciplinary focus in recognising the place of creativity in driving worthwhile change, that is the significance of creativity in achievement.</p>
<p>It is relevant, then, to consider the words of US President Barack Obama (2008), who urged us to be active contributors to a society that can be innovative:<disp-quote>
<p>Scientific discoveries have driven the American economy, advanced medical treatments, increased computational capability, have improved the daily lives of Americans. High-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education can unleash the creativity and curiosity of our students, motivate them to understand our world, and provide them with tools to solve problems, think critically and communicate effectively. It can also inspire Americans to know more about the world around them . . . all students must have equal opportunities to learn 21st century content and skills. Only this can maintain our country’s leadership in innovation and create a nation of engaged citizens who can participate in a vibrant democracy and know how to learn for a lifetime in a knowledge economy.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In these words, creativity, with its spirit of discovery, vital in our day-by-day living, is placed to the fore. Creative problem-solving in the context of the economic crisis was considered again in the address to the Joint Session of Congress by President Barack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261429411435108">Obama (2009</xref>): ‘The answers to our problems don’t lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth.’</p>
<p>Solutions are sought through ‘boldness and imagination’ in diverse fields to drive change. These thoughts echo the stance of thinkers at the Australian ‘big thinking’ summit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411435108">Commonwealth of Australia, 2008</xref>): ‘Success in the new environment demands that creativity is embedded in our education systems, economy and international representation at every level.’</p>
<p>By focusing on thinking skills such as creative thinking, it is intended in the UK’s National Curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0261429411435108">Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, 2000</xref>) that students will have the possibility of learning how to learn: ‘knowing how’ and not just ‘knowing what’. The same is hoped for Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0261429411435108">Wardlaw, 2008</xref>), in that creative thinking skills will be considered to be an important part of the ‘vocabulary’ of educational initiatives, and will be embedded across the curriculum as part of the very process of learning with a concomitant awareness and capability to continue to learn beyond the classroom.<disp-quote>

<title>Harnessing creativity: innovation in business, industry, science and technology</title>
<p>Creative ideas are indeed the ‘beginning of innovation’ within a culture that sustains rather than stifles innovative endeavour: they provide impetus in business, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435108">Amabile, 1998</xref>). It is interesting to note that in Australia there has actually been a government portfolio for industry and innovation, which points to the significance of, and attempts at, nurturing new alternatives or big thinking through science and technology. To this end, <italic>The Australian</italic> newspaper reported that the car industry would receive one dollar in funding from the government for every three dollars spent by industry to encourage the ‘green car’ to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261429411435108">Maiden and Hannan, 2008</xref>). As necessity is the ‘mother of invention’, there is a good chance that need will again drive innovation. The economics of the situation can also contribute to the drive for big thinking. <disp-quote>

Munroe (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435108">Cropley and Cropley, 2000</xref>: 4), for example, states that 70% of the cost of a product is determined by its design so that creative design can lead to substantial cost savings.</p>
<p>Innovation’s back but does that change anything? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411435108">Caulkin, 2006</xref>). These words head a British article on rediscovering the ‘secrets of growth’ where necessity indeed drives invention – more and more realised as the economic downturn forces a new way of viewing circumstances. Responding to changing needs is fundamental to the creative thinking that must occur in industries and across all disciplines if they are to thrive. </p>
<p>Innovation can also bring paradoxes of change as manifested in technology. This has been highlighted in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261429411435108">Postman (1998</xref>), chair of the Department of Culture and Communication at New York University. The ‘human dilemma is as it has always been’, he warns, and ‘wisdom from past ages is not irrelevant’, so he urges scepticism for innovation.<disp-quote>
<p>Technological change brings benefits to some but disadvantages to others; such as, steel workers, vegetable store owners, automobile mechanics, musicians, bakers, bricklayers, dentists, and most of the rest into whose lives the computer now intrudes . . . They are more easily tracked and controlled; . . . increasingly mystified by the decisions made about them.</p>

</p>
<p>One view of technological innovation is that it is a way of seeing and understanding – it is both a medium and a message, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261429411435108">McLuhan’s (1964)</xref> widely referred to phrase. Our way of receiving messages has been changing from the times when Solomon’s songs were sung and valued, says Postman, to the times when the written word was emphasised more, to times when television’s ‘immediacy’ has been favoured, then to the computer times where information rather than wisdom may be the dominant value.</p>
<p>Even in the lasting songs creatively produced by Leonard Cohen performed in concerts from 1968 to 2012, he urges the power of the medium of song, which can be valued only by those who heed its inherent message and appreciate it for itself. In case we fail to question technological advances, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261429411435108">Postman (1998</xref>) reminds us that change is not always completely for the better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411435108">Cam, 2006</xref>). Clearly, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0261429411435108">Postman (1998</xref>) has made effective use of the tool to efficiently reach a wide range of readers – innovation that truly has a creative beginning should have value and novelty.</p>

<title>Enhancing performance through creativity</title>
<p>Asking our students to think like experts, bringing the outside into the classroom in terms of solving actual problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0261429411435108">Renzulli et al., 1995</xref>) and giving them the thinking tools of specific disciplines encourages them to think creatively and enhances their chances of attaining optimal learning outcomes. A major outcome is to synthesise a community of insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0261429411435108">Wirthner, 1994</xref>), which is more the way an expert in the field operates. This then needs to be the focal point of enhancing performance in classrooms, training spaces and beyond.</p>
<p>At most schools, professional learning sessions and universities, much of the current writer’s work has been to encourage the teaching of creative thinking. Many teachers in these sessions say that they do not train students to be creative (Forster, 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429411435108">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429411435108">2010</xref>). To be specific, when working in professional learning sessions, teachers usually acknowledge the significance of creativity but say that they rarely instruct students in how to be creative in any particular field.</p>
<p>Rather than creativity being the hub of achievement, it can be dismissed as being on the periphery of learning. This, of course, usually happens before teachers have seen the effects of training students to think creatively. In the process, teachers further harness their own creative-thinking capabilities – a vital part of effective teaching because, through the creative-thinking approach, the curriculum is more effectively differentiated to meet the wide range of student needs.</p>

Creative problem-solving as a process applied in a particular context is at the thinking intersection of many disciplines. The interdisciplinarity of creative thinking makes it valuable and rich in its own right but also a source of deeper understanding. In law, for example, the leading lawyer, expert in the understanding of his or her field, finds and fills a gap. Immersed in the field, the lawyer can see new directions and new connections through insight into, and familiarity with, the context. This parallels a scientist’s way of thinking: he or she has insight to sift and connect relevant information. The unique synthesis that results leads to its aptness; the thing that strikes a chord.<disp-quote>

<p>The aptness of creativity is seen also in humour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429411435108">Jewell, 2005</xref>), which works through surprise. The surprise might be said to come from its ‘uniqueness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435108">Fisher, 2002</xref>). Humour derives from the unexpected.

<title>The benefit of the arts for building thinking dispositions</title>
<p>More than a jump for joy – valuable though that is – the creative arts are a process of giving form and meaning to feelings, values and ideas, as suggested in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261429411435108">NACCCE (1999</xref>) report:<disp-quote>
<p>The creative processes of the arts centre on the shaping and refining of a work in which its aesthetic qualities are central to its meaning. The look, sound and feel of work in the arts is inseparable not only from what it means but from how it means.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Distinguishing between expertise and imagination and the usefulness of the arts in promoting this distinction, Winner (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429411435108">Henshon, 2002</xref>) indicated:<disp-quote>
<p>When children study the visual arts they learn to observe; they learn to envision; they learn to reflect upon their working process and to make critical judgements; they learn to be playful and explore; and they learn to persevere. Creativity means doing something that changes a domain . . . expertise differs from creativity because it doesn’t change a domain. What imagination does is to enable the mind to represent images and ideas of what is not actually present to the senses. It can refer to the capacity to predict, plan and foresee possible future consequences.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Understanding thinking has parallels with understanding art. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261429411435108">Perkins (1994</xref>: 6) has explored this parallel and cited the director of the New York Museum of Modern Art:<disp-quote>
<p>An artwork will establish certain boundaries by its subject matter, style, materials and techniques. It then lets us observe and analyse these givens by probing and musing. By finding its ambiguities we can proceed in a game of speculation and interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As it conveys much of its message through its form, appreciating art is a microcosm for the speculative and generative mode of thinking needed for creative output in varied disciplines:<disp-quote>
<p>Not only can students apply parallel skills in looking at art and reflective thinking in general but art can provide a strong base for developing transfer because of its motivating qualities and capacity to support connections with the world outside itself.</p>

</p>
<p>Inventiveness is one of the major creative commonalities across disciplines – such as in art, design, business, music or dance – and comes about to a large extent from being a problem-solver applying expertise and seeing things differently. Such are the insights into creativity of Mark Morris, the choreographer and dancer, when interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435108">Coutu (2001b</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Art depends on whether you can invent something from very little . . . I can make up a dance just from listening to music. I can invent an entire canon of works that didn’t exist before . . . art goes beyond skill.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ‘uniqueness of the expression’ through a particular medium was highlighted also in the work of Martha Graham, the dancer, who indicated that ‘if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and will be lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411435108">De Mille, 1991</xref>: 264).</p>
<p>Focusing on the interconnections in creativity in the arts, the dean of the Conservatorium of Music at the University of Sydney alerted us to Schubert’s words: ‘There’s no music until you have two notes and they have a relationship to each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0261429411435108">Walker, 2008</xref>). The relationship is the originality; the possibilities are the awakening of the imagination.</p>

<title>The person</title>
<p>Courage – or perhaps what the poet WB Yeats called the fascination for what is difficult – is essential for big ideas to flourish. Acknowledging the elusiveness of creativity when we consider achievement, the educator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0261429411435108">Van Tassel-Baska (2004</xref>) indicated that a fundamental characteristic of a creative person is risk-taking.</p>
<p>The place of imagination and of risk-taking in fields other than the arts is well supported in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28a-0261429411435108">De Bono (2008)</xref>, who, when training the Australian cricket team, believed that having the will to look for new ideas was key to their achievement. His internet message on creativity in sport is an innovative tool to share the messages across different disciplines.</p>
<p>Being uncomfortable is a great boost to learning and to finding out if we can resist the tendency ‘to copy successes rather than try to create something brand-new – if you want to be original you have to accept the uncertainty, even when it’s uncomfortable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0261429411435108">Treffinger and Isaksen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-0261429411435108">Hawley’s (1993)</xref> words point to the human element – the banal reality of what it takes to come up with something new that has value if not necessarily high global impact: ‘It’s not a thought but a particular incantation of words sparking off one other that you dreamed up while chopping onions.’</p>
<p>Personal involvement is, of course, essential to creative productivity. The satisfaction of creativity is well substantiated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435108">Amabile’s (1998)</xref> work, in which it was found that being overevaluated and having choice restricted, extrinsic rewards and an overly competitive environment detracted from creative productivity, inherently motivating but being vulnerable with time pressures (Amabile, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0261429411435108">Silverstone, 2002</xref>). Intrinsic motivation, provided through creative thinking, underpins successful learning rather than the ‘carrots and sticks’ of management:<disp-quote>
<p>Whether you are a scientist or a poet, an educational policymaker, or a computer whiz-kid, the creative person is hooked on the intrinsic challenges of the task or field. ‘Creatives’ are not just problem-solvers, they like being ‘in the maze’ rather than finding the quickest or most expedient way out. Creativity requires that we actively resist closure, that we sit in the discomfort of uncertainty, ‘dally and dabble’ with one more ridiculous possibility.</p>

<p>It is clear that our challenge is to place creativity at the forefront of any concerned intention to enhance achievement. Creativity or ‘big thinking’ must be embraced as a serious way forward for policy-makers and practitioners alike.</p>

<p>Creativity is a messy and confusing subject and seems to range from devising a new toothpaste cap to Beethoven’s writing his Fifth Symphony.</p>
