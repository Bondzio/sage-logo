<p>This book is divided into three parts: Part One is entitled “Orientation” with two chapters; Part Two is simply called “Elements” and is made up of seven chapters; Part Three has the title “Hints and Resources”; it contains two chapters, four appendices, and an index. In the following I will unpack in more detail the content of each.</p>
<p>In Part One, the first chapter uses three memorable words to define exegesis: investigation, conversation, and art. The practice of exegesis is outlined in three broad approaches: synchronic, with its focus on the texts as we have them; diachronic, better known as the historical-critical method; and existential, which Gorman defines as <italic>“self-involving”</italic> (p. 18). This approach is concerned with how “the text is taken seriously with respect to human existence now” (p. 19). Chapter 2 deals with selecting texts for exegesis as well as choosing the best translation and edition for the job. Gorman is quite detailed, proposing appropriate translations for each task. His discussion can be harsh, as for example his comments on what he calls the “disastrous New English Bible.” I was surprised that one guideline for selecting a text is one “that interests them” (p. 58). Experience tells me that there will be many exegeses on the parable of the Good Samaritan if we follow this guideline!</p>
<p>Part Two sets out seven key elements of exegesis: survey, contextual analysis, formal analysis, detailed analysis, synthesis, reflection, and expansion and refinement of exegesis. These elements provide a template for the exegete. Each of the elements is aimed not just at college students, but also at the busy preacher. The seventh element implies that it is the final element in exegesis. The previous six are primarily concerned with exegetes reading the text for themselves. The seventh suggests taking the work of the previous six and engaging them with the work of specialists only when the text has been studied. This is a very helpful point that might prevent a sermon from becoming a list of scholarly views on the preached text!</p>
<p>Part Three gives hints and resources relating to carrying out the key elements of exegesis. Gorman spells out clearly the errors to avoid; there is also a detailed annotated bibliography of resources for exegesis in nine sections with resources on ranging from understanding exegesis to executing detailed analysis. These sections present a wide selection of resources from different perspectives; so all users of this book will find something useful.</p>
<p>Appendix A sets out tables of exegetical approaches (synchronic, diachronic, and existential) in order to facilitate understanding of how they work and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. In each table, sample questions that these approaches might ask assist gaining a better appreciation of them. Overall, the tables provide easy reference to reinforce theoretical understanding. Appendix B provides experienced guidelines to those writing a research exegesis paper. They concur with the seven elements of exegesis set out in Part Two. In appendix C, three sample exegesis papers written by students are provided, two in New Testament and one in Old Testament. They exemplify to readers the kinds of questions they should address in their study and writing; these essays act as models on how to complete an exegesis applying Gorman's teachings. Appendix D lists some internet resources for biblical studies which will provide further access to resources to students.</p>
<p>In terms of the layout of the whole book, readers could wish for no better. Each chapter begins with relevant questions that are sure to focus readers' attention on the task Gorman has set himself. Every chapter has a helpful conclusion or summary relating back to the opening question. The practice of setting out a question is one that is effective, and one students would do well to consider using in their work. There are also hints and activities to develop further insight and practice.</p>
<p>Finally, I have long admired Gorman's exegetical work with its rigor, sensitivity to the text, clarity of method, applicability to preaching and theological interpretation, as well as relevance to today's society. It is a joy when an exegete like Gorman shares his experiences and understanding of the task of exegesis. His expansion and revision of <italic>Elements of Biblical Exegesis</italic> (2001) does not disappoint. I can think of no better work on the market for students, preachers, and teachers.</p>
