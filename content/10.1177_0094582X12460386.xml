<p>Bolivia is a complex developing country that has long fascinated scholars and travelers, but its multifaceted reality has not always been understood. Félix Muruchi’s autobiographical narrative <italic>From the Mines to the Streets</italic>, mediated and amplified by the commentary and analysis of Benjamin Kohl and Linda Farthing, describes a Bolivian miner’s experience and activism during the critical revolutionary and postrevolutionary events since 1952. Central to Muruchi’s life story is his personal struggle with identity and activism—a struggle that is at the heart of the political and social changes that have culminated in the historic 2005 and 2009 elections of President Evo Morales Ayma as Bolivia’s first president of indigenous heritage.</p>
<p>Despite having had Quechua and Aymara parents, Muruchi embraced his indigenous roots only later in life, after exile abroad and as self-identification as an Indian became more socially acceptable and politically beneficial. When his parents left the countryside for the Catavi-Siglo XX mining complex in the aftermath of the 1952 revolution, Muruchi’s life changed. He came to view himself as a miner and was shocked when he was considered an Indian abroad: “I viewed myself as a miner—I never would have identified as indigenous” (138). The identity conflict reflected here is similar to that of the late Domitila Barrios de Chungara, a prominent activist in the Siglo XX Housewives’ Committee, as described in her autobiography <italic>Let Me Speak!</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12460386">1978</xref>). Thus <italic>From the Mines to the Streets</italic> is an important contribution to the testimonial literature that includes Domitila’s story and that of the Bolivian tin miner Juan Rojas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12460386">Nash, 1992</xref>). However, it has a number of advantages over these classic testimonials. A primary advantage is the concise “contextual commentary” that Kohl and Farthing provide to make Muruchi’s story and Bolivia’s complex history accessible to readers at all levels of interest and educational preparation. Drawing upon their extensive research, fieldwork, and writing on Bolivia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12460386">2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12460386">Kohl and Bresnahan, 2010</xref>), the explanatory text effectively situates and elucidates Muruchi’s evolving role in Bolivia’s struggles for democracy and development. Additionally, the book has the advantage of clarifying and explaining the complicated interplay of old and new political parties and traditional miner, labor, and peasant organizations with the many new social movements that emerged before, during, and after the 2000 Cochabamba water war and the 2003 gas wars in Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is often difficult to understand the ideological fervor and complexity of Bolivian politics. This is why Muruchi’s story is especially important. As a young, committed Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, Muruchi belonged to the radical and insurrectionist Partido Comunista Marxista-Leninista (Marxist-Leninist Communist Party—PCML), and his activism reflected the fierce ideological, partisan, and personal infighting that characterized the politics of workers, students, and intellectuals during the twentieth century. Along with many activists, he experienced the brutality of two of Bolivia’s notorious twentieth-century dictators—Hugo Banzer (1971–1978) and García Meza (1980–1981)—and suffered imprisonment and torture. His narrative allows readers to appreciate the way Bolivia’s failed experiment with neoliberalism contributed to popular opposition to unbridled multinational investment and globalization. Finally, his personal story parallels the chaotic changes from the rise and demise of organized labor as a force in politics to the emergence and consolidation of the coca growers’ unions, indigenous federations, and neighborhood associations and their tentative and fractious alliance with the social-movement-based political party, the Movimiento al Socialismo (Movement toward Socialism—MAS).</p>
<p><italic>From the Mines to the Streets</italic> portrays the leftist perspectives and struggles of the miners rather than those of the rural peasant and indigenous communities. However, Muruchi’s years of exile and international experiences abroad ultimately brought an end to his radical PCML party affiliation and expanded his personal and political horizons. During his two periods of exile in the Netherlands (1976–1978 and 1980–1985), he developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of European democratic socialism. At the same time, brief visits to the former East Germany in 1978 to see his brother, who had settled there, and to Cuba during a quick stopover on his 1985 return to Bolivia left him disillusioned with Marxist-Leninist versions of socialism. As a result, his activism was renewed and redirected toward the struggle for broadly participatory democracy and against the disastrous neoliberal privatization policies of presidents Paz Estenssoro and Sánchez de Lozada. Neoliberalism had severely impacted the miners, resulting in the closing of the state mines and the dismissal of some 23,000 workers in 1985. Focusing on responding “to the immediate needs of many desperate mining families,” Muruchi turned to development-based activism and the economic and educational advancement of the disadvantaged and marginalized citizens of El Alto, the autonomous indigenous city on the Altiplano above La Paz (187). There he directed a local nongovernmental organization funded by donors from the Netherlands and was instrumental in organizing for the newly established indigenous Universidad Pública de El Alto. In the El Alto neighborhood of Ciudad Satélite, he ran for various political offices but failed to establish new political party ties and instead became active in the neighborhood and student associations that had sprung up to further indigenous rights and sociopolitical empowerment. Although well into his fifties, he did not shrink from mobilizing for protests in El Alto and La Paz during the 2003 water and gas wars that derailed the government of Sánchez de Lozada. In the process of his long-lived activism—whether developmental, partisan, or movement-based—Muruchi encountered the typical cronyism, opportunism, nepotism, and corruption that have hindered development efforts and bedeviled Bolivia’s political culture and social relations.</p>
<p>El Alto, now Muruchi’s home and that of thousands of indigenous migrants and ex-miner compatriots, has emerged as an especially rebellious city. Kohl and Farthing explain that in El Alto miners and indigenous people have converged to form a powerful new multiclass and multiethnic grassroots coalition. This new social-movement-based coalition has mobilized hundreds of thousands of social protesters to challenge even the Morales government. As Muruchi reflects on his life of activism, he concludes that he “was able to contribute a grain of sand to the historic process of change” (209). <italic>From the Mines to the Streets</italic> captures these historic transformations and helps the reader understand the reasons behind the often violent and chaotic events that brought them about.</p>
