<abstract>
<p>Globally, waterfronts have been used for trade, waste disposal, leisure and most recently for urban spectacle and lifestyle housing. While this has been explored in urban studies research, its relation to imperialism and colonisation has not. Waterfronts were often the entry points of imperial occupancy, trade and industry. Contestation over their value and use is integral to their constitution as landscapes, as place-taking becomes part of their place-making. Drawing on Adelaide and Melbourne, Australia, these sites register culturally specific imprints connected to the colonisation process. For Indigenous Australians, sea country was indistinguishable from land, but subsequent and current imperial transformations of land and water use have rendered benign an Indigenous presence through its symbolic re-presentation. This post-colonial reading will correlate the divide between land and water with those who have the imperial and class power to define this elemental boundary thus adding a new dimension to waterfront research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Globally, waterfronts have been used for trade, waste disposal, leisure and more recently for urban re-imagining, spectacle and lifestyle housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012452328">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012452328">Brownill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012452328">Hall, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012452328">Hoyle, 2000</xref>). Analyses of waterfront developments in terms of economic and spatial restructuring, globalisation, gentrification and the post-modern city of spectacle have been undertaken for many cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012452328">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012452328">Brownill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012452328">Hoyle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012452328">Bone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012452328">Dovey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012452328">Oakley, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012452328">2007</xref>). Yet the role of waterfronts as imperial beachheads, entry points and bases for the realisation of colonial ambitions has not been documented. Hence, the demarcation line between ocean and land has long been assumed to be obvious and unproblematic, a physical reality untroubled by cultural inscription.</p>
<p>It will be argued, using case studies drawn from Adelaide and Melbourne in Australia, that this boundary itself matters as it registers colonial power. Across this liminal zone place-making is literally fluid, an on-going contested process registering hierarchies of power within the imperial project as places are made by taking from others. For Indigenous Australians, waterfronts comprised a sea country undifferentiated from land as a source of vital spiritual and material sustenance. While colonial occupants briefly admired the aesthetics of these waterways, they were inevitably appropriated and converted into ports and sites of industry. Subsequent assessments of utility have seen the land encroach on the sea, waterways defiled and most recently rediscovered as the foundation of an ‘aesthetic’ and for economic revitalisation. In this latter exercise, Indigenous presence is formally denied although symbolically expressed through parks, public art and street names as a dead past-in-the-present. For Indigenous descendents, however, their presence remains far more.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the paper has been structured first to include a geographical discussion of landscape and place, which is then followed by a post-colonial theorising of place. Secondly, to trace the colonial and post-colonial histories of Port Adelaide in South Australia and Melbourne Docklands in Victoria, highlighting what these perspectives add to the analysis. This includes a recognition of prior Indigenous occupancy, the on-going process of Indigenous presence and Indigenous displacement. The discussion concludes with the role of contemporary planning in fusing place-making with place-taking through symbolic as well as literal appropriation.</p>

<sec id="section2-0042098012452328">
<title>Framings</title>
<p>Geographical discussions of landscapes have varied from the simplistic and material to more complex and textual accounts. Early theoretical debates regarding landscape were synonymous with terms such as ‘benign’, ‘natural’, ‘static’ and ‘fixed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012452328">Meinig, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012452328">Zukin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012452328">Massey, 1992</xref>). In such geographies, landscapes were conceptualised as a “neutral container … filled in by human activity” or alternatively ‘mapped’ and subjected to statistical testing, analysis and spatial modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012452328">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, p. 4). Water was all but invisible in such accounts, beyond being a barrier to be crossed or a resource to be utilised. From the 1970s, landscapes were increasingly regarded as socially constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012452328">Entrikin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012452328">Merrifield, 1993</xref>). By reading landscapes as ‘texts’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012452328">Walton (1995</xref>, p. 62) asserts that “it is not a given, universal, ‘authentic’ world, but an epistemologically mediated reality, constructed linguistically as well as materially”. This analytical framework has altered the way we both understand and theorise the built environment and potentially the aquatic environment, thus seeing them as cultural and discursive constructs. The ability to fix the identity of a landscape is, however, contingent on power.</p>
<p>Similarly, early theories and debates around the notion of place saw it as simply a fixed territorial and geographical unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012452328">Zukin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012452328">Cresswell, 1996</xref>). Theoretical approaches to representations of place as being more complex and contested emerged from the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012452328">Meinig, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012452328">Eyles 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012452328">Massey, 1992</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012452328">Meinig (1979</xref>, p. 3) place is contingent “upon some public agreement as to name, location and character; some legibility, some identity commonly understood”. Human experience is lived and acted out in place, which is linked inextricably to cultural, economic, social and political practices and their “symbolic representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012452328">Zukin, 1991</xref>, p. 16). For geographers, place represents a distinctive type of space, one that is defined by, and constructed through, the lived experience of people; a site within landscape which has a name and particular human resonance.</p>
<p>Such conceptualisations shift the analytical focus on meanings of landscape, the struggles over these meanings and the power dynamics associated with defining, making, owning and living in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012452328">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>.) For the purpose of this paper, landscapes are intertextual constructions that are open to a multiplicity of meanings and readings. They are where the social practices of everyday life are enacted, while also being intellectual and instrumental constructs. Places are more localised, named and lived in; they are where contestations over meaning and interpretation are encoded into an immediate locale. Within a White Australian context, landscapes and places have been constituted by the power relationships associated with capitalism and imperialism.</p>
<p>To understand the waterfront in terms of its meaning and value to both sides of the colonial divide, this paper has drawn on post-colonial literatures. Colonisation involves the military invasion and economic integration of one country into another. It is also associated with, and dependent on, the social and cultural transformation of the peoples involved. No other empires in history were as large, no colonies so totally dominated and none so unequal in power to the Western metropolis as those comprising the possessions of England, France, Germany, the Netherlands and other European powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012452328">Said, 1993</xref>, p. 6). While driven by political and economic rivalries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012452328">Said (1978)</xref> noted how Westerners also constructed a united fantasy of the Orient—as passive, feminine and exotic—which both justified the process and transformation of this region. These images in turn were vital to the construction of imperial ‘Europe’ as a unified, dominant and supposedly superior society distinguished by its race, religion, economy and social order. The processes of colonial incorporation were anything but total. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012452328">Bhabha (1994)</xref> highlighted the role of parody and mimicry in the relation between coloniser and colonised; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012452328">Spivak (1999)</xref> detailed the complexities around the never-silent ‘sub-altern’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012452328">Chow (1996)</xref> pointed out the role of the active, challenging ‘natives’ in making themselves and the coloniser as subjects.</p>
<p>If 19th-century colonisation involved military expansion, economic transformation, population displacements and identity reformations, its 20th-century aftermath saw widespread independence movements and decolonisation. Late 20th-centurypost-colonial studies have analysed these processes: the political and intellectualchallenges raised by Indigenous populations and the voices of migrants displaced from their homelands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012452328">Johnson, 2000</xref>, pp. 154–155). Post-colonialism has drawn on post-structural thinking about language and power while empirically it has portrayed the demands of the colonised and minorities in imperial centres as well as those on the margins of political and economic autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012452328">Gandhi, 1998</xref>). Nash notes how post-colonial thinking has informed geography with examinations and challenges to Western imperial practices of survey, mapping and classification; a range of critical perspectives on the diverse histories and geographies of colonisation; and studies of their legacies in the present. For Nash, post-colonial cultural geographies can work through the tension between understanding colonialism as general and global but also as particular and local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012452328">Nash, 2002</xref>, pp. 219–228).</p>
<p>Moving from literature and geography to the post-colonial planning of landscapes has involved acknowledging social difference and post-structural challenges to unified identities and incorporating popular demands for participatory planning. A call for post-colonial planning has produced what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012452328">Sandercock (1998)</xref> labels the ‘epistemologies of multiplicity’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012452328">Forester (1999)</xref> terms the ‘deliberative practitioner’ where all stakeholders—especially the weak and the marginalised—have a voice and role in planning decisions and practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012452328">Rankin (2010)</xref> is critical that such calls to acknowledge and include ‘difference’ are not necessarily related to a transformative and redistributive practice. Rather Rankin urges planners to assume a more active role in righting the wrongs of the colonial past and ensuring greater contemporary justice rather than just celebrating social difference —be it ethnic, racial or class.</p>
<p>In Australia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012452328">Wensing (2007)</xref> has argued that colonisation involved land seizure and the displacement of one ontological and management land system with another. This did not obliterate on-going Indigenous obligations or an on-going presence and connection to country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012452328">Behrendt, 2006</xref>). How these wrongs can be addressed is, however, a challenge: conceptually, practically and politically. This paper has drawn on these criticisms within geography, cultural studies and planning to examine the capacity of Port Adelaide and Melbourne dockland redevelopments to achieve a post-colonial alternative in contemporary planning and land use management.</p>

<title>Port Adelaide and Melbourne’s Docklands</title>
<p>Re-imagining these waterfronts into post-industrial forms goes beyond the simple regeneration of neglected urban precincts to involve the renewal of people, place and capital. The Melbourne Docklands is within a sub-global city of 3.5 million while Port Adelaide is located within a 2nd-tier city of 1.1 million. Both waterfront projects are integral to and support metropolitan densification and city promotion in a time of intense interurban and global competitive pressures. They both therefore register much larger economic and political agendas.</p>
<p>Port Adelaide is a seaside suburb of Adelaide, 14 km north-west of Adelaide’s CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012452328">Figure 1</xref>). The Port suburb and inner harbour have long suffered externalised and entrenched stigmatisation dating back to the 19th century when its muddy landscape, run-down housing and port workforce were labelled ‘Port Misery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012452328">Rofe and Oakley, 2006</xref>, p. 276). From the 1980s, cities along the eastern seaboard—including Melbourne—enjoyed the economic benefits of their status as locations for new finance, industrial and service economies. Adelaide suffered from a poor economic status both domestically and internationally by comparison. Transforming the inner harbour into a regional hub for 21st-century industry and living was critical in bolstering economic development within the area. In mid 2005, the State government secured a AUS$6 billion air warfare destroyer contract. It was important to the state not only in terms of new capital investment, but in securing 1200 new skilled and semi-skilled jobs with an additional 3000 flow-on jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012452328">Oakley, 2011</xref>). Many of the new jobs were highly skilled, thus requiring different workers from the existing local workforce. The Port redevelopment would assist in accommodating the housing needs of this incoming population. Increasing the densification of the waterfront was also considered a necessary catalyst in attracting additional business investment into the wider area.</p>

</fig>
<p>Located on Victoria Harbour to the western end of Melbourne’s CBD, the Docklands redevelopment involves transforming 150 hectares of land and 50 hectares of water from an abandoned port into a multi-use urban wonderland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098012452328">Figure 2</xref>). A desire to reactivate the Docklands in the 1980s was driven by a fear that Melbourne as a city in the Australian urban hierarchy could become a “backwater … of declining significance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012452328">Dovey, 2005</xref>, p. 208). The redevelopment would offer “a sophisticated urban environment … to live, work and play” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098012452328">VicUrban, 2008</xref>, p. 1). It was expected to attract local, national and international commercial investment while increasing inner-city residential densification by bringing “new energy to Melbourne” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098012452328">VicUrban, 2008</xref>, p. 3). Revitalising the Docklands reflected the government’s aspiration of repositioning it as a dynamic 21<sup>st</sup> century city, a city that would rival its eastern seaboard city rival and counterpart Sydney.</p>

<p>The history of Australian ports such as Adelaide and Melbourne mirrors general port trends in many Western industrial cities. Equally, they can be read as registering the power dynamics of imperial relations. In contrast to a standard story of port renewal, a post-colonial reading of the docklands of Adelaide and Melbourne focuses on their contested meanings as places, where the boundary between land and water becomes both a metaphor and site of Indigenous–invader contestation. After considering their earliest occupancy, the following discussion examines these places as ports and sites of industry within a particular imperial economy. This is then followed by observations of their current transformation and the echoes within them of an Indigenous presence. Our focus will be on how their Indigenous pasts are variously obliterated, remembered and re-inscribed as they become sites of intersection and potential reconciliation between land and sea, Indigenous and settler occupants.</p>
<p>This discussion involves a textual analysis of secondary data which draws extensively on academic literatures, government documents, developer marketing materials and media reports. Attention is paid to offering empirical evidence, which is informed by a post-colonial approach of the following three themes. First the paper outlines the local story of these two waterfronts and places this narrative within the larger history of colonisation and decolonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012452328">Nash, 2002</xref>). Secondly, it examines Indigenous displacement and subsequent consequences in terms of inherent rights and custodial obligations to country and water within this history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012452328">Wensing, 2007</xref>). Of interest is the epistemological difference and resulting power disparities regarding the attachment and management systems of land and water. Thirdly, the paper investigates the ever-present voice and resistance of Indigenous peoples within the technologies of settlement and occupation with particular reference to the current renewal of Adelaide and Melbourne’s docklands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012452328">Spivak, 1999</xref>). Through this analysis, an evaluation of the capacity of contemporary planning and land management processes to redress past wrongs, to accommodate cultural difference and to reinstate the rights of Indigenous peoples is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012452328">Wensing, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>When Europeans first arrived by ship, the Port Adelaide inner harbour was inhabited by the Kaurna people. During the very early years of colonisation, local Aboriginal families maintained connections to their traditional campsites along the inner harbour. The mangroves and creek inlets were plentiful sources of shellfish, crabs, whiting and flathead. Local flax was harvested to make nets for catching both seafood and native land animals, while cloaks, ground mats and baskets were made from rushes growing along the watercourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012452328">Murphy, 2007</xref>, p. 3). The Kaurna people thereby used this place for hunting, fishing, food gathering and ritual. There was no distinction between country and sea—just a set of material and spiritual resources to be named, used, conserved and valued.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of White settlement transformed the Port’s environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098012452328">Figure 3</xref>). In this process, natural resources were also exploited and, by 1850, the year in which Port Adelaide’s first ‘Grand Land Sale’ was advertised<disp-quote>
<p>the bountiful land, river and sea along which local Aborigines lived … hunted, raised their children and celebrated their culture, all became, in less than one generation, prohibited territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012452328">Murphy, 2007</xref>, p. 5).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the process of colonisation, this waterfront land was claimed, fenced, occupied and the water delimited as a site for port and later industrial uses. The fate of the Kaurna people was a mixture of dispersal and displacement. Small numbers held on to remnants of their land and culture by living on the fringes of White settlement while others were moved to reserves throughout South Australia. Those remaining Kaurna people who stayed moved between temporary camps along the Le Fevre peninsula, while others provided domestic and industrial labour for the colonists and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012452328">Murphy, 2007</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>The current site of Melbourne’s Docklands was part of a series of low-lying coastal wetlands which included the Yarra and Maribynong River deltas. As with Port Adelaide, the area comprised mainly salty marsh flats on alluvial sediment whose size fluctuated with the seasons and rainfall. According to local Aboriginal legend, Bunjil the great Creator Spirit was travelling through the bush around this area accompanied by two young boys. They had left their belongings behind. Bunjil allowed them to return and retrieve them, telling them that they would find magical vessels containing great volumes of water. He gave them permission to open the containers from which water poured over the countryside drowning the hunting grounds and forming Port Phillip Bay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012452328">Ellender and Christiansen, 2001</xref>, p. 13). One area of this low-lying water and land became known as the West Melbourne Swamp. A place where the land merged with the sea, this low-lying area teemed with water plants and bird life. It was this wild life which made it a favoured hunting and gathering ground for the Yalukit-willam clan of the Boon wurrung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012452328">Presland, 1994</xref>, pp. 37–41). Their coastal country took in a large meeting site and was also a corridor for contact between the Wathaurung of the Bellarine and the other Bunurong clans of Westernport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012452328">Presland, 1994</xref>, p. 42). The border between land and sea was porous as both provided food and it was where ceremonial life was performed between the clan territories of those who occupied lands west and east of Port Phillip Bay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098012452328">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>When first mapped and surveyed in 1837, the founding fathers of Melbourne—Robert Hoddle and William Fawkner—left this area ‘void’—an empty, White patch on the imperial map of the new city, where there were no (Indigenous) inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012452328">Docklands Authority, 2000</xref>). Others though, saw the area as a bitter unproductive marsh which should be put to more useful purposes such as cultivation, grazing and recreation. Generally though the area was deemed a problem, a ‘swamp’ whose only real utility was to come once the water had been banished and land put in its place. The possibility of extending the infant city of Melbourne westwards and draining the swamp was first proposed in the 1840s. However, the undesirable nature of the landscape would justify the location of noxious industry—thereby creating a blighted but clearly delimited waterfront. This left Indigenous communities to eke out a living within the new township or succumb to the diseases decimating many of these original inhabitants. Those surviving Boon wurrung and Woi wurring were moved to Coranderk, a traditional camping ground and later reserve in the eastern Yarra Valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012452328">Broome, 2009</xref>). For all European intents and purposes, there was no longer an Indigenous presence in the Docklands area and therefore no reason to acknowledge one.</p>

<p>The current site of the Port Adelaide waterfront was a controversial choice as the state’s international gateway. Political and personal battles were fought over the site with many favouring Port Lincoln on the Eyre peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012452328">Rofe and Oakley, 2006</xref>, p. 276). However, ports were vital to the business of British Empire building, acting as key gateways for the people and goods needed for colonisation. Once laid out, contemporary social commentary soon referred to Port Adelaide as inferior in physical quality and social character. William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012452328">Harcus (1876</xref>, p. 15) noted that Port Adelaide was a “most unwholesome and unsavoury spot”. Unlike other ports of the day, the landing site at Port Adelaide was “crudely constructed of clay, poles and bushes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012452328">Pike, 1967</xref>, p. 205). It was considered an unsuitable harbour because it was “narrow”, “dirty” and “hazardous to navigate due to a treacherous bar, irregular tides and unpredictable winds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012452328">James, 1838</xref>, pp. 24–26 quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012452328">Rofe and Oakley, 2006</xref>, p. 277). There were no docks or piers on the waterfront and so new arrivals were either “ferried ashore by small boat or taken ashore on the backs of sailors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012452328">Tolmer, 1882</xref>, pp. 130–131). It was characterised as a licentious landscape because of the activities of seaman and persons referred to as “gypsies” and “savages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012452328">James, 1838</xref>, p. 28 quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012452328">Rofe and Oakley, 2006</xref>, p. 277).</p>
<p>An enduring and external stigmatisation of Port Adelaide would be remobilised throughout the Great Depression and interwar periods. As the state’s largest port, the economic and social fortunes of the place have been largely subject to the agendas of outside stakeholders. The dominance of external economic interests has produced a spirited local politics and collective action by those local communities affected by on-going changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012452328">Oakley and Verity, 2003</xref>, p. 195). Labour relations between wharf labourers and employers at the port were symbolic of this tension, revealing not only a disregard by outside economic interests for local workers but an equal contempt for the local landscape. A commonly held view was that “respectable people” maintained permanent employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012452328">Curnow, 1958</xref>, p. 4). Wharf workers did not fit this characterisation as they were irregularly employed in manual cargo handling, working in deplorable conditions and subjected to instant dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012452328">Curnow, 1958</xref>, p. 3). While such labour conditions were not unique to Port Adelaide, their conditions were considered unacceptable at other ports. Indicative of this, toilets were not installed on the wharves despite numerous requests. The waterfront was therefore used for ablutions resulting in significant pollution of the inner harbour while wharf labourers were labelled dirty because of their “insanitary habits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012452328">Curnow, 1958</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>The lack of middle- and higher-class residents living in and around the Port further compounded the view of a morally degraded landscape and suspect place. Ship owners had little contact with their workers because ‘respectability’ relied on maintaining physical and social distance from the Port. The head office of the Harbours Board was located in Adelaide. Middle-class abandonment of the Port accelerated from the 1950s as further heavy industries were established in and around the Port River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012452328">Potter, 1999</xref>, p. 149). The Port’s landscape, already depleted of ‘decent’ residents, suffered further from the economic and industrial changes that occurred in the later part of the 20th century. Once vital to manufacturing and shipping, the Port Adelaide waterfront—like many working ports around the world—suffered from post-industrial restructuring. Increasingly the Port was characterised as ‘derelict’ and ‘lifeless’.</p>
<p>The demonisation of activities and workers associated with the waterfront was similarly experienced in Melbourne, as were the clear demarcation of land from sea and the extensive pollution of both. Thus from the 1850s and the construction of Melbourne’s gasworks and docks on the western edge of the city, industries needing water for processing and waste clustered in this area. A slaughter yard, melting works, tanning, curing, wool washing, bone grinding, soap and candle making ensured that higher-class residents moved east. The West Melbourne Swamp and surrounding environment became a heavily polluted mire. The problem of low-lying land was the subject of a Royal Commission in 1873 and this led to the dredging of the sand bars at the mouth of the river and a flattening of Batman Hill to create a central railway station and associated storage sheds. To further the growth and efficiency of the port, the Yarra River was re-engineered: straightened, widened and made deeper. As a consequence, the boundary between land and sea became a crisp, straight divide, with the sea tamed and drained from problem areas. In the place of murky swamplands, Victoria Dock was created to handle most of Victoria’s imports by 1900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012452328">Bentley and Dunstan, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1930s Depression was experienced in Melbourne in a way comparable to Port Adelaide, with wharf workers subjected to high unemployment, systematic campaigns to lower their wages and ultimately state-sanctioned violence to break resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012452328">Lowenstein and Hills, 1998</xref>). The widespread poverty of the era spurred the creation of a shanty town built by desperate people scavenging from nearby industries and tips. Condemned by the Slum Abolition Board and regularly raided and demolished by police, the Dudley Flats Shanty became a place distinguished by its poverty, poor sanitation and ramshackle dwellings perched on the mud. Over 60 humpies of hessian, scrap iron, tin and old drums remained there until the advent of World War II, with some still there in the 1950s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012452328">Thorne, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Rediscovering the Water: Reclaiming the Waterfront</title>
<p>The transformation of the Port Misery image along with the physical and social landscape that it represented is currently underway, along with a (re)inscription of the value of the waterway in aesthetic terms, as it becomes revalued as a separate littoral realm to be overlooked, overbuilt, renamed, remade and owned by new lifestyle investors. It is a waterfront renewal that is about place-making, as it creates expensive enclaves for a largely homogeneous urban population oriented towards high-income occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012452328">Miles and Miles, 2004</xref>, p. 65). Waterfront housing here has become an expression of cosmopolitan identity, prized for its display of both wealth and speculative real estate value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012452328">Oakley, 2005</xref>, p. 325; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012452328">Oakley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A purpose-built overwater display centre constructed of mainly glass and complete with gourmet café, offers a venue for potential buyers leisurely to take in the vista of the entire site in its pre-development state and then view a three-dimensional model of what this place will become. Within the display centre, large posters of young couples dining in waterfront restaurants, working out at the soon-to-be-built exclusive gymnasium and sailing on expensive new yachts reflect this future-oriented landscape for those potential residents who will become part of the ‘Newport Quays community’. Marketing materials produced by the developer promise a cleaner, sanitised, post-industrial cosmopolitan lifestyle and place of desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012452328">Newport Quays, 2006</xref>) which sits alongside rather than integrates with the existing social and economic fabric of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Docklands area was never really integral to the people of Melbourne, with the exception of the Yalukit-Willam and the Depression poor. In light of changing port technologies and intercity competition for mobile global capital, people and major events, this area was rediscovered: being first envisaged as ‘Docklands’ when it figured in Melbourne’s bid for the 1996 Olympic Games athletes’ village. The quest for global investment continued in 1990 when it became one of a number of Australian urban sites vying for the location of the Japanese-funded multifunction polis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012452328">Inkster, 1991</xref>). The victim of recession and intercity rivalries, such efforts came to no avail until the election of the neo-Liberal Kennett government in 1992.</p>
<p>The Melbourne’s Dockland redevelopment is a much larger and more complex space than that of Port Adelaide involving an array of uses to be built over a 20-year period. With around 50 per cent of its spaces intended to be residential, it also has considerable areas given over to retail, hotels, open space, major sporting venues, connecting infrastructure and multistorey offices. Its design history is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012452328">Dovey, 2005</xref>) but can be viewed as comparable to that of Port Adelaide’s in the construction of a post-modern fantasy place oriented to the water.</p>
<p>The many residential towers are integral to this development. Accommodating a projected final population of 20 000, many extol the virtues of near-city living, great water views and vertical communities. Residents in the Docklands are a privileged and select group who are highly engaged with the image and reality of the consumption lifestyle marketed for the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012452328">Colebatch, 2008</xref>). Social exclusivity is therefore a mark of such dockland developments in both Adelaide and Melbourne, as access to and views over water and a near-city location, become <italic>the</italic> markers of social affluence. The class nature of the residents is not in dispute, although the discount retailers and its tourist attractions do invite others into Melbourne’s Docklands. Yet this place is essentially a creation of the place-marketers of today. Indigenous people come to visit, actively recall its history and meaning, but are registered only through a symbolic presence.</p>

<title>Recognising Indigenous Place-making in Post-industrial Waterfront Landscapes</title>
<p>In the case of the Port Adelaide waterfront redevelopment, a newly built park and street names are the only physical remnants of an Indigenous past and presence. The State government and developers rejected a submission by the Kaurna people to have a 4.4 hectare site within the inner harbour retained as an elders’ village and a cultural interpretive centre. It was argued by descendents of the traditional owners that these resources would provide educational, tourism and employment opportunities and the foundation for a model of cultural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012452328">Peacock, 2005</xref>, p. 14). Furthermore their proposal was considered appropriate given that the site was inhabited by the family of the Lartelare, who were one of the last-known Kaurna people living a traditional life on the Adelaide Plains. Interestingly, the State government department responsible for Aboriginal affairs also recognised the cultural importance of this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012452328">Towel, 2005</xref>). A resolve to have a physical presence within the redevelopment was and is clear evidence of both a continued connection to the place by the Kaurna people and their preparedness to be part of its re-imagining as a 21st-century place. Despite public protests and significant media coverage, a 75-metre-long and 8-metre-wide Lartelare Park was opened in September 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098012452328">Figure 5a</xref>). Reference to the dispossession of traditional owners is sparingly made through signage in one of the public art installations located in the park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098012452328">Figure 5b</xref>). A decision by the developer to give the streets within the redevelopment Aboriginal names is the only other evidence of the original inhabitants. It is, however, difficult not to read the park and signage within the redevelopment as simply acts of tokenism and appeasement.</p>

<p>In a submission to the Melbourne Docklands Task Force in 1991, a spokesperson for the Wurundgeri Tribal Land and Compensation Cultural Heritage Council argued that, as they were the traditional owners of this site, they wanted to see open space retained especially in the underdeveloped swamp land along the Moonee Ponds Creek. They also recommended that the area be renamed in recognition of its Indigenous heritage to Doutta Galla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012452328">Docklands Task Force, 1991</xref>), which was not adopted. Nevertheless, these recommendations provided clear testimony to the on-going connection and presence of Indigenous occupants and their wish to be part of its new place-making. A government plan for a Living Museum of Aboriginal Culture first proposed in 1992 was subsequently shelved and, as with Port Adelaide, the only hint of Indigenous presence is through public art—the giant 25-metre-high sculpture of Bunjil, the eagle totem and spirit creator of the Wurundgeri (by the non-Aboriginal sculptor Bruce Armstrong) and the major road through way—Wurundgeri Way (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0042098012452328">Figures 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098012452328">6b</xref>). Similarly with the Port Adelaide waterfront, Indigenous presence is symbolic, relatively marginal and unrelated to the demands of those who retain custodianship over the lands. This is a post-colonial landscape only in a negative sense—as expressing the on-going dominance of the occupying culture and population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The redevelopment of Port Adelaide and Melbourne’s Docklands mirrors other waterfronts around the Western world. Most studies on waterfront redevelopments have located them within their recent technological histories, their emerging role as centres of economic and symbolic spectacle and new governance models. The approach taken in this paper differs in its emphasis on the dynamic ways in which the littoral boundary between land and sea has been physically altered and discursively reconstituted as a consequence of changing imperial and class relations.</p>
<p>This paper has considered the role of docklands within this imperial project to draw attention to and problematise Indigenous occupancy at the point of White settlement; the on-going displacement of water with land; and responsibility, obligation and actions of contemporary planning in urban waterfront renewal. By taking a long historical perspective, we have highlighted the critical role of how past port functions, within imperial and colonial occupation, continue to inform contemporary planning and land management systems within these urban projects. In the case of Port Adelaide and Melbourne’s Docklands, their initial use as wetlands sustained the physical and spiritual life of the original inhabitants, but was devalued and displaced by colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012452328">Wensing, 2007</xref>). The paper briefly outlined how the nature, meaning and use of the water–land divide within colonial history has altered over time to suit different socio-political and economic conditions. More telling, it points to the on-going process of place-making and place-taking by ‘an-other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012452328">Rankin, 2010</xref>). Such place-taking has involved environmental despoliation, physical realignment of land and water and the imposition of very different meanings onto these sites as they cease being places of localised sustenance and dreaming for traditional owners and become centres of trade, industry and working-class labour. More recently, with changing port technologies and different socioeconomic contexts, these sites have been rediscovered and remade into very different places.</p>
<p>Both waterfront redevelopments continue to reveal epistemological and power differences regarding the attachment to, and management of, land and water systems. Symbolic representations of an Indigenous past and the displacement and violence of the colonisation process are rendered benign, almost invisible, if not for the building of a park, scant public art and street naming at both sites. A failure to accommodate requests by traditional owners for an elders’ village and cultural centre within the Port Adelaide redevelopment and open space at the Melbourne Docklands does little to remedy past wrongs or accommodate cultural difference that can be considered to be meaningful. Thus far these redevelopments have failed to reflect progressive politico-planning practice, one that reflects ethics, responsibilities, obligations and actions that can successfully demonstrate a post-colonial alternative. Such an alternative is vital to their future as inclusive re-imagined urban landscapes and for rendering justice to those displaced in their taking and remaking.</p>
