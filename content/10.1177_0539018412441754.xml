<abstract>
<p>The meaning of the concept of natural selection undergoes important changes when it circulates, through the use of analogies, between the realms of biological and cultural phenomena. These changes are not easily detected, but they are unavoidable. They have to do with differences between the properties of cultural phenomena and those of biological phenomena: in particular, the absence of the equivalent of a Hardy–Weinberg law for culture. These differences make it necessary to translate the concepts of classic population genetics into the language of transmission. This translation enables the theorists discussed here to build a unitary general theory of evolution (GTE) based on analogies between biological and cultural evolution, and at the same time to single out their differences. But the unity and the rigor of this theoretical approach are merely apparent. The concept of selection as it is defined here loses, in its three spheres of application – GTE, culture but also biology – the meaning and explanatory power it has in classic population genetics. This means that the mechanism of Darwinian selection cannot be considered as a universal algorithm that is valid for both biological and cultural phenomena alike.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Le sens du concept de sélection naturelle subit d’importantes modifications lorsqu’il circule, à travers des analogies, entre les phénomènes biologiques et les phénomènes culturels. Ces modifications ne se laissent pas facilement apercevoir, mais elles sont inévitables. Elles tiennent à des différences entre les propriétés des faits culturels et des faits biologiques: notamment l’absence d’équivalent de la loi de Hardy–Weinberg dans le domaine de la culture. Ces différences imposent de traduire les concepts de la génétique des populations classique dans le langage de la transmission. Cette traduction permet aux théoriciens évoqués ici de bâtir une théorie générale de l’évolution (GTE) unitaire fondée sur les analogies entre l’évolution biologique et l’évolution culturelle et, dans le même temps, de souligner leurs différences. Mais l’unité et la rigueur de cet édifice théorique ne sont qu’apparentes. Le concept de sélection tel qu’il est ici défini perd dans chacune de ses trois sphères d’application – GTE, culture, mais aussi biologie – la signification et le pouvoir explicatif qui sont les siens dans la génétique des populations classique. C’est pourquoi le principe de la sélection darwinienne ne peut être considéré comme un algorithme universel, valide à la fois pour les phénomènes biologiques et les phénomènes culturels.</p>

<p>For the past 30 years or so, a number of researchers in different fields have argued that cultural evolution obeys mechanisms analogous to those driving biological evolution. To be sure, these researchers disagree on the precise nature of these mechanisms. Some maintain that cultural evolution is driven by cultural replicators – known as memes – analogous to genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441754">Dawkins, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018412441754">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441754">Dennett, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018412441754">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018412441754">Hull, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018412441754">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018412441754">Reader &amp; Laland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441754">Runciman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018412441754">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018412441754">Shennan 2002</xref>). Others construct fairly similar models, but without mentioning replicators or memes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>). Still others openly doubt the existence of such replicators and propose evolutionary models based on different biological principles: selection without replication, population thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018412441754">Richerson &amp; Boyd, 2005</xref>) or group selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018412441754">Sober &amp; Wilson, 1999</xref>). However, above and beyond the differences separating them, all these researchers consider culture as an entity that evolves autonomously in accordance with neo-Darwinian principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018412441754">1</xref></sup> Their research outlines a general theory of evolution (GTE), which they claim to be valid for both biological and cultural phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018412441754">Dennett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>These theories sparked lively debates from the outset. Their opponents have usually tried to play up the differences between biological evolution and cultural evolution. Evolutionary psychologists and cognitive anthropologists, in particular, but researchers from other schools of thought as well have sought to show that this analogy is only rarely valid in the cultural realm, for instance in the few cases in which one individual passively and faithfully imitates another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018412441754">Aunger, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018412441754">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018412441754">Bloch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018412441754">Boyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018412441754">Claidière &amp; Sperber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018412441754">Kuper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018412441754">Sperber, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018412441754">2000</xref>) and freely chooses between several cultural traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018412441754">Fracchia &amp; Lewontin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018412441754">Reisman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present article is to carry out a critical analysis of these neo-Darwinian analogies using a different approach. I do not content myself with simply listing the differences between biological and cultural evolution or with discussing the greater or lesser extension of the field of cultural phenomena in which these models might be valid. I also examine the changes that occur in the meaning of neo-Darwinian concepts – in the present case, the concept of selection – when they are transferred from biology to culture, and then on to the more abstract realm of the GTE.</p>
<p>The notion of natural selection has been the subject of intense debate in biology and has been defined in different ways. Here I limit myself to the analogies built on the concept of selection as defined in classic population genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441754">Lewontin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441754">Sober, 1984</xref>). What I call classic population genetics corresponds on the whole to what Peter Godfrey-Smith terms, in his three-part typology, ‘Darwinian’ models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018412441754">Godfrey-Smith, 2007</xref>). These models are based on three hypotheses: ‘The main idea is that we expect evolutionary change whenever we have a population in which there is (i) variation, (ii) which is responsible for differences between individuals in reproductive output, and (iii) which is heritable to some extent’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441754">Claidière, 2009</xref>). The theories of culture under discussion in the present article are thus for the most part those built using the concept of replicators, that is memetics, but also those that consider there can be selection without the completely faithful replication of the evolutionary units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018412441754">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>1 Candide’s travels</title>
<p>To understand the distinctive character of the present approach, we can refer to the journey made by Candide as imagined by the French <italic>philosophe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018412441754">Voltaire (2007 [1759])</xref>. In the course of his travels, Candide visits countries other than that of his birth but in the end returns home and decides to ‘cultivate his garden’. In the process, he meets different people to whom he sometimes feels similar and sometimes very different. The reader of <italic>Candide</italic> could stop at this ‘candid’ observation. He could also draw up the limits of the compatibility of people from different countries, or at least the limits of compatibility between a candid Frenchman of the 18th century and people from other cultures. But he would be forgetting that this voyage is an initiation: Candide himself changes as he goes, even if he eventually comes back to his starting-point. He has the same name, but he is no longer the same. The Candide who set out and the Candide who returns home have little in common.</p>
<p>The present article addresses this second aspect of the journeys made by concepts when they circulate from one realm of phenomena to another. Our Candide will be the concept of <italic>natural selection</italic>, as it is defined in classic population genetics. In the present case, the final goal is not to determine how well an inhabitant of the initial realm – natural selection in the land of biology – gets along with the inhabitants of another country – the realm of cultural phenomena. The final goal is to flush out the changes – sometimes almost invisible but <italic>unavoidable</italic> – that occur in the concept of selection when it travels from one realm to the other, and ultimately comes back home, in other words back to the realm of biology. By tracking these changes, we can measure the degree of consistency, of accuracy and of fertility demonstrated by the theories encountered in the course of the journey: the theory of cultural evolution, the GTE and the theory of biological evolution.</p>
<p>This approach enables us to draw three critical conclusions about these models.</p>
<p>First, one cannot speak of selection in the realm of culture in the same sense as one speaks of selection in the realm of biology. When applied to culture, the concept necessarily loses at the same time the <italic>meaning</italic>, the <italic>precision</italic> and the <italic>explanatory power</italic> it has in biology. Despite appearances, the concept refers to an altogether classic formulation of the problem of human action, without leading to a new solution.</p>
<p>Second, this implies that Darwinism is not a universal algorithm. The GTE outlined in these models is a shaky scaffolding that only appears to be a true general theory. For in these models, the same word – the word ‘selection’ – actually designates very different things depending on whether it is applied to the living world or to culture.</p>
<p>Third, using the vocabulary of selection imposes heavy constraints on the description and explanation of cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate these three points, let us return to the beginning of Candide’s travels. The point of departure is the land in which the concept was born: neo-Darwinian biology.</p>

<title>2 Reproduction, replication and natural selection in biology</title>
<p>In biology, <italic>reproduction</italic> refers to a physiological act: one individual engendering another individual. The process is underpinned by mechanisms of genetic <italic>replication.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018412441754">3</xref></sup> Generally speaking, the laws governing these mechanisms of replication and reproduction – all other things being equal – leave the number of genes unchanged in a panmictic (or randomly mating) population. This is stated by what is known as the Hardy–Weinberg law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441754">Sober, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>This law is expressed as follows: Suppose that, in a biological population of a diploid species, there is a gene that has two alleles, indicated by <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic>. There are therefore three possible genotypes: <italic>AA, Aa</italic> and <italic>aa</italic>. Let us say that their respective frequencies are equal to <italic>u, v</italic> and <italic>w</italic> with <italic>u + v + w =</italic> 1.

<p>Biological reproduction obeys Mendel’s laws.

<p>Biological reproduction thus leaves the frequencies of alleles <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic> unchanged from one generation to the next. In other words, absent other evolutionary forces, in particular, migrations, genetic drift, neutral mutations and selection, the genetic make-up of a biological population theoretically does not change over the course of the reproductive cycles.</p>
<p>The Hardy–Weinberg law has important consequences for the definition of natural selection. As Sober showed, it makes the theory of natural selection a ‘theory of forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441754">Sober, 1984</xref>: 31–38). A theory of forces, Sober writes, supposes defining a ‘zero-force’ state. A zero-force state is a state in which the different forces likely to be involved have zero effects. This is the role played, for example, by the law of inertia in classical mechanics: it is a reference state that makes it possible to interpret any deviation in the trajectory of an object as the quantifiable effect of a force. In classical mechanics, the law of inertia is therefore not a force but a principle that permits an analysis in terms of forces. The action of a mechanical force is then defined and measured as a deviation from this state.</p>
<p>Sober emphasizes that the Hardy–Weinberg law plays the same role in population genetics as that played by the inertia principle in classical mechanics. The faithful reproduction of a population’s genetic traits: constitutes a ‘zero-force’ state, that is, a state in which the various evolutionary forces – mutation, migration, drift, selection, in particular – have zero effects. In this case, natural selection appears as one of a number of forces that produces a change in these frequencies. This change stems from the differential reproduction of the individuals, which in turn depends on the relative fitness of their alleles (for all these points, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441754">Sober, 1984</xref>, chap. 1).</p>
<p>Let us come back to the example developed above and suppose that individuals with an <italic>aa</italic> genotype reproduce less well than individuals with an <italic>AA</italic> genotype or an <italic>Aa</italic> genotype. This is the case, for example, when allele <italic>a</italic> is recessive and codes for an unfavorable characteristic, such as color blindness or hemophilia. In such situations, the different genotypes – like the different alleles – are not equally fit. A process of selection will thus occur over generations.</p>
<p>This process is usually quantified using a coefficient <italic>t</italic>, called selection coefficient, of between −1 and 1. This coefficient measures differences in genotype fitness; it makes it possible to quantify the rate of reproduction of the different genotypes. In our example, the reproduction rate of the relatively favorable genotypes – <italic>AA</italic> and <italic>Aa</italic> – will be given a value equal to 1. That of the unfavorable genotype – <italic>aa</italic> – will be given a value equal to 1 − <italic>t</italic> (<italic>t</italic> here having a value of between 0 and 1, since <italic>aa</italic> is unfavorable).</p>
<p>Given these conditions, the selection process can be described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0539018412441754">Table 1</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018412441754">4</xref></sup> and these results allow us to deduce the frequencies of <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic> after selection, in other words in the following generation, indicated respectively as <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>:</p>

<p>Let us now follow our Candide – natural selection – as he takes his first steps outside his homeland – biology. If one wishes to construct a theory of cultural evolution and a GTE using these concepts, it is imperative to clearly define what these notions mean when applied to the diffusion of ideas among humans. What will replication designate in the area of cultural phenomena? Can an exact equivalent of genetic replication or the Hardy–Weinberg law be found in the realm of culture? And if not, what changes must be made to the theory of biological evolution for it to become a GTE and be valid outside the field of biology?</p>

<sec id="section3-0539018412441754">
<title>3 The difficulties of finding a cultural equivalent of genetic replication</title>
<p>Let us begin by first trying to find the cultural phenomena that can be considered to be the equivalent of genetic replication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0539018412441754">5</xref></sup> As all of the theorists mentioned here stress, the analogy must be based on the idea of a faithful transfer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0539018412441754">6</xref></sup> of information from one individual to another. Let us therefore choose a deliberately broad and purely descriptive definition of cultural replication: we call replication in the field of culture any faithful transfer of information from individual A to individual B through social learning in the broad sense. We say that an idea or a practice, for instance ‘harpoon fishing’, is <italic>replicated</italic> when it is found that an individual to whom it was communicated by another individual has <italic>adopted</italic> it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0539018412441754">7</xref></sup> Cases where individuals have been aware of this idea or practice but have not adopted it will not be regarded here as instances of replication. For example, if individual A shows individual B how to fish with a harpoon, but individual B continues nevertheless to fish by hand, we say that the idea has failed to replicate itself. Likewise if an individual discovers harpoon fishing on his own, this event is not considered as a replication since the person did not get this new idea from someone else. The event is considered to be a <italic>mutation</italic>.</p>
<p>If we retain this definition of cultural replication, the notion of differential reproduction of cultural units – ‘cultural selection’ – takes on a precise meaning. Its quantification does not pose any problems that are basically different from those it poses in biology.</p>
<p>For instance: Suppose a population is composed at date T<sub>1</sub> of 75 individuals who fish by hand and 25 individuals who fish using a harpoon. Let us say that at date T<sub>2</sub>, we observe that 60 individuals in this population fish by hand while 40 use a harpoon. Finally, let us say that no migration, mutation/cultural innovation or cultural drift has occurred between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>. In this case, we can conclude that, in this lapse of time, the cultural trait of ‘harpoon fishing’ has produced more replicas of itself in people’s minds than the cultural trait of ‘hand fishing’. And we can propose to measure the ‘differential reproduction’, the selection coefficient <italic>t</italic>, in the sense of population genetics, of these two practices in this population. This enables us to compare their respective fitness.</p>
<p>Let <italic>t</italic> be the selection coefficient (or fitness) of the trait ‘hand fishing’ with respect to the trait ‘harpoon fishing’, so that</p>

</p>
<p>As in the previous model, the fitness of the trait ‘harpoon fishing’ will be agreed to be 1. The fitness of the trait ‘hand fishing’ is equal to 1 − <italic>t</italic> = 1/2. We can conclude that, in this population, the cultural trait ‘harpoon fishing’ is more fit and therefore has a differential replication greater than the trait ‘hand fishing’. This differential results in a process of <italic>selection</italic> in favor of ‘harpoon fishing’.</p>
<p>This model has at least two advantages. First, the notion of selection is precisely defined and can be quantified. Second, the model allows us to get around the problem posed by an important difference between biological evolution and cultural evolution, which is: generally speaking, gene replication implies the reproduction of the bearer of the gene. Alternatively, in the replication of a cultural trait, it is not necessary for the individual bearer to reproduce another individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018412441754">Godfrey-Smith, 2007</xref>). An idea can pass from individual A to individual B, who already exists. In the present model, however, the reproduction of the individuals is a variable that can be ignored, since we are concerned only with the number of cultural traits and not the number and the nature of the individual bearers. Whether or not we are dealing with the same individuals at T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, or whether or not the individuals at T<sub>2</sub> are the descendants of those at T<sub>1</sub>, in no way changes the results of this model.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this model does not enable us to construct a solid, fruitful theory of culture. The main reason is that the selection coefficient, as it is defined here, mixes the forces and mechanisms that it is generally important to distinguish when analyzing cultural dynamics. In effect, this model does not allow us to differentiate between two quite unrelated cases of the diffusion of ideas: on the one hand, the case in which the idea has enjoyed a great deal of publicity while being infrequently adopted by people and, on the other hand, the case in which an idea has rarely been presented to others, but where it has, it has frequently been adopted by those individuals. In the present model, the two cases yield selection coefficients whose values are necessarily close or equal, since the various measurements take into account only the number of <italic>successful</italic> information transfers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0539018412441754">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the purposes of illustration, let us take another example. Suppose a society A, in which people exchange ideas via forums, whatever their age and kin ties. In this society, individuals are rapidly aware of a new idea and can adopt it if they wish. Let us say that between two dates, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, each person who has a new idea tells an average of 20 people. Suppose another society B, which is very different, made up of fairly isolated family units. In this society, only family heads can tell others about new ideas and they have the opportunity to tell only other family heads or the rest of their own family. This society’s pyramid structure means that information circulates more slowly than in the previous society: let us say that between the two dates, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, each person in this society with a new idea tells an average of 10 people.</p>
<p>Now consider three competing practices: hand fishing, harpoon fishing and net fishing. In these two societies, at date T<sub>0</sub>, everyone fishes by hand. People in both societies have the same structure of preference among the different techniques: when a person who fishes by hand is shown how to fish with a harpoon, he adopts harpoon fishing 4 times out of 5; when a person who fishes by hand is shown how to fish with a net, he adopts net fishing 2 times out of 4. Both societies are made up of 100 individuals.</p>
<p>Suppose that at date T<sub>1</sub> a person invents net fishing in society A, and a person invents harpoon fishing in society B. At T<sub>2</sub>, there will therefore be 1 + 20 × 2/5 = 9 individuals fishing with nets in society A and 1 + 10 × 4/5 = 9 fishing with harpoons in society B. The two practices replicate here at exactly the same rate. They produce the same number of copies of themselves over a given time in two populations of the same size. Consequently, the selection coefficient of ‘net fishing’ with respect to ‘hand fishing’ in society A, which we will call <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, and the selection coefficient of ‘harpoon fishing’ with respect to ‘hand fishing’ in society B, which we will call <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, have here the same value. The reason for this is simple: the selection coefficient, as I defined it above, depends only on the frequencies at the start and at the finish, which here are the same for both practices. For the two practices, the frequency at T<sub>1</sub> (which we will call <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>) is equal to 1 / 100; the frequency at T<sub>2</sub> <italic>(q</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>) is equal to 9/100; and the frequency of hand fishing at T<sub>1</sub> (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>) a practice with which each of the other two is in competition – is equal to 99/100.</p>
<p>Going back to the preceding formula for calculating <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, we thus obtain:</p>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In this model, both practices thus have the same selection coefficient with respect to hand fishing. And yet harpoon fishing has a much greater capacity than net fishing to reproduce copies of itself in people’s minds once they become aware of it (4 out of 5, as compared to only 2 out of 5). In this sense, harpoon fishing is much more attractive, more fit, whatever one means by this notion, than net fishing. But in society B, this superior power of replication enjoyed by harpoon fishing over net fishing is diminished by the relatively slow pace at which information circulates. As a result, it produces slightly fewer copies of itself in this society than in a society where information circulates more swiftly, as in society A.</p>
<p>Summing up: in this model, an idea that is very attractive to people can multiply at exactly the same rate as a less attractive, less fit idea: all that is needed is that the first idea be diffused in a society where information circulates more slowly than in the second. For the same reasons, an idea can multiply at very different rates depending on the information-communication structure found in the society in which the idea is diffused. Therefore the capacity of an idea to pass from one mind to another, in other words its attractiveness, its cultural fitness, is not enough to explain its replication rate in a given population. This depends on other forces: in particular, the structural forces that dictate how information circulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>: 426).</p>
<p>We do not encounter this difficulty in biological evolution due to the Hardy–Weinberg law. This law implies that the mechanism by which genetic information is replicated – the reproduction of individuals – is the same for all genes and is, as I stressed above, without effect on their frequency. In biology, the coefficient <italic>t</italic> thus reflects necessarily and only the fitness of the gene, its own replication capacity. But in the field of culture, <italic>t, as it is defined here</italic>, can no longer measure only the fitness of the evolutionary unit. It also and inseparably measures something else: the repercussions of the rate at which information circulates and, more precisely, the frequency with which individuals in a population are aware of a given idea.</p>
<p>This difference between biological evolution and cultural evolution means that we cannot construct a theory of culture by directly transposing concepts of evolutionary biology as they stand. Moreover, none of the theorists discussed here takes this approach. How do they get around the difficulty? What changes occur in our Candide – natural selection – when he runs into cultural phenomena?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0539018412441754">
<title>4 The solution offered by the language of transmission</title>
<p>This difficulty is very generally circumvented, explicitly or not, by a single method, which consists in describing replication as a <italic>transmission</italic> of information. The concepts borrowed from the biological theory of evolution are thus translated into the language of transmission in order adequately to describe cultural evolution.</p>
<p>How do the concept of transmission and the language with which it is associated allow this difficulty to be resolved? They have at least three advantages. Like the difficulty itself, these advantages are not always explicitly set out in the literature on the topic. But it seems to me they explain why theories of culture and the GTE inspired by neo-Darwinian analogies on the whole drift from the language of replication toward the language of transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0539018412441754">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>First of all, in its broadest sense, the word transmission designates a process that can occur without individuals reproducing themselves. In effect, for individual A to transmit something to individual B, it is not necessary for A to engender B. As I pointed out above, unlike biological traits, cultural traits have the particular capacity of being able to multiply without the individuals that adopt them having each time to produce a new individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018412441754">Godfrey-Smith, 2007</xref>). And even when the cultural information is passed from parent to offspring, for example when a father teaches his son to harpoon fish, the child exists before the information is communicated. And the child will later be able to change his way of fishing if someone manages to transmit another practice to him. He can even transmit this new practice in turn to his father, something that is not possible in the case of biological traits, since heredity flows in one direction only.</p>
<p>Second, when we describe the diffusion of cultural traits as a transmission, it becomes possible to distinguish different types of diffusion channels open to these traits. A cultural trait can be transmitted simultaneously to several individuals if the emitter has the capacity to address several persons publicly. It can also be transmitted by several persons to a single person, or by one person to another person in the same generation (‘horizontal transmission’), or by parent to child (‘vertical transmission’) or by a person in one generation to a person in the next generation who is not his or her child (‘oblique transmission’) and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>). Using the language of transmission, we can thus provide a fine-grained description of the structure of the communication channels followed by a cultural trait and measure the effects of this structure on the rate of multiplication. This is not the case with the models that stick to the language of replication, as we saw in the example of net and harpoon fishing (section 3).</p>
<p>Finally, transmission, however we define it, is a process that can always be broken down into two distinct phases. The first phase is the emission of something by person A towards person B; the second is the reception of this thing by person B. To speak of transmission is thus to speak of a fallible process. Individual A can propose something to individual B who is unable or unwilling to receive it. As a result, the language of transmission makes it possible to account for the fact that a cultural trait can be presented to someone without that person necessarily adopting it. More generally, it makes it possible to consider that ideas move more or less easily from one person to another. Consequently, the language of transmission makes it possible to take into consideration the differences in the attractiveness of ideas and, above all, the differences in the probability that a person will adopt the ideas presented to him or her. Once again, this is not the case with the language of replication: using this concept does not allow us to make distinctions between ‘replications’ of ideas that have failed because the person has not heard of these ideas, on the one hand, and those that have failed because the person has not adopted the ideas in the end, although he or she was aware of them, on the other hand.</p>
<p>These advantages surely explain why use of the language of transmission is almost unfailingly found in the different variants of the analogical neo-Darwinian theories of culture. The notion of transmission is no doubt even more widespread in all these theories than that of meme or of replicator. These advantages also explain why this notion is central to the GTE constructed by these researchers: on the one hand, it possesses a high degree of generality; and, on the other hand, it is well suited to describing the specificities of cultural phenomena and integrating them into a more general model. Together with the notion of replicator, the notion of transmission serves, in the bulk of these models, as a basis for building a GTE, which is then divided into a theory of cultural evolution and a theory of biological evolution, each of which has its particularities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0539018412441754">
<title>5 A GTE built around the concept of transmission</title>
<p>This GTE is explicitly set out by a good portion of the researchers mentioned here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 351; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441754">Dawkins, 1976</xref>, chap.

It can be summarized as follows: First of all, evolution is defined very roughly as a change in the nature and frequency of the different information units of the same type present in a population of individuals. The individuals are the bearers of these information units. Several forces can lead to the evolution of the nature and frequency of these units. The main forces are: selection, migrations, neutral mutations, drift and transmission.</p>
<p>The first four forces, as these researchers usually underscore, are present in the standard model of population genetics. The fifth – transmission – given the Hardy–Weinberg law, has evolutionary consequences only for cultural evolution: this GTE considers that, when it comes to biological evolution, the forces of transmission have zero intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 340–366; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>: 419–467). In other words, aside from a few exceptions, transmission is a ‘neutral force’ in biological evolution: that is the specificity of biological evolution according to this theory. In cultural evolution, on the other hand, a change in the transmission channels followed by an idea or a practice can entail a modification of the frequencies of the competing evolutionary units, even in the absence of migration, mutation, drift and especially selection. Transmission in this case is a force that can affect evolution.</p>
<p>The new importance of the concept of transmission in this GTE appears at three levels.</p>
<p>First, transmission becomes an <italic>evolutionary force</italic> in its own right.</p>
<p>Second, the biological concepts of <italic>reproduction</italic> and <italic>replication</italic> are translated into a language built around the principle of transmission. The concept of individual reproduction, which was central to the biological model, drops into the background. For in this GTE it is no longer necessary for individuals to reproduce in order for evolutionary units to replicate themselves. The replication of an evolutionary unit is then described as a <italic>transmission</italic> of information from one person to another. Thus gene replication in the course of individual reproduction is described as a transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring, i.e. a vertical transmission. And the replication of an idea or a practice in another mind is described as a transmission of cultural information from one person to another.</p>
<p>Third, in this GTE, the <italic>modes of transmission</italic> – vertical, horizontal or oblique – of the information units can have crucial importance for evolution.</p>
<p>In sum, what fundamentally distinguishes the competing units is their <italic>unequal capacity for transmission</italic> to others. As a result, what becomes central is the probability of a cultural trait present in one individual being effectively transmitted to other individuals in the population, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman (1981</xref>: 78) call its ‘transmission coefficient’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson (1985</xref>: 65) the ‘transmission rule’. As we see from these notions, transmission is placed at the heart of the mathematical formulas on which these models are based.</p>
<p>Let us take as an illustration one of the examples discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman (1981</xref>: 77–78). The example concerns a case of ‘vertical cultural transmission’, in other words cultural transmission from parents to offspring. In the simplest case, they stress, the cultural trait is a discrete variable that can take two values, <italic>H</italic> and <italic>h</italic>. These two values can designate respectively cultural traits such as, for instance, being a doctor or not, or being a Republican or not. In such a case, there are four possible matings (the left-hand value designates the trait carried by the mother and the right-hand one the trait carried by the father): <italic>h</italic> × <italic>h</italic>, <italic>h</italic> × <italic>H</italic>, <italic>H</italic> × <italic>h</italic> and <italic>H</italic> × <italic>H</italic>. The ‘transmission coefficients’, noted as <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub>, then designate ‘the probabilities (assumed constant) that an <italic>H</italic> child results from the matings <italic>h</italic> × <italic>h</italic>, <italic>h</italic> × <italic>H</italic>, <italic>H</italic> × <italic>h</italic> and <italic>H</italic> × <italic>H</italic> respectively’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 78).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0539018412441754">10</xref></sup> For example, in the present case, the probability of a child being a Republican with a Republican mother and a father who is not is equal to <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>. The coefficients <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> can range between 0 and 1 from one social group to another. In sum, as we can see, the point of departure for the formula is here a quantitative variable that concerns transmission.</p>
<p>The preeminence of the concept of transmission is nevertheless explicitly stated especially in the models based on mathematical formulas. In those models that make little or no use of mathematical formulas (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018412441754">Blackmore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018412441754">Brodie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441754">Dawkins, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441754">Dennett, 1996</xref>) – more often listed under the name of memetics – the concept of replicator is usually mentioned as being central. But even in this second set of theories, the language of transmission, despite appearances, still plays a crucial role. The importance of this language can be felt in the reference to the figures of the virus and contagion that regularly crop up in memeticians’ discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018412441754">Brodie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018412441754">Lynch, 1996</xref>). In effect, the virus analogy makes it possible to introduce the language of transmission into the description of evolutionary phenomena. It makes it possible to describe cultural replication as a <italic>transmission</italic> of something from individual A to individual B. Using the virus image, it is also possible to account for the fact that communication of an idea can fail: one is not always contaminated when one is exposed to a virus. When described as a virus, the meme can also be regarded as an entity that is more or less successfully spread, that is more or less ‘contagious’, and to which individuals are more or less receptive or sensitive. In sum, the virus analogy solves the same problems as those I mentioned in the case of the mathematical models (section 4). It gets around the difficulties posed by the exclusive and direct reference to genes.</p>
<p>We find this explicit reference to viruses and epidemics in quantitative models like those of Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman or Boyd and Richerson. These models are based on formulas borrowed not only from population genetics but also from epidemiology. The simultaneous recourse to population genetics, epidemiology and the study of cultural traits diffusion is facilitated by the fact that all three fields use similar mathematical functions in some of their models. These functions are used to describe diffusion processes in the broad sense of the term. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman (1981</xref>: 19–53) point out, for example, the diffusion of a mutant gene in a biological population (1), the propagation of a virus in a living population (2), and the diffusion of an innovation in a human group (3), are three processes that follow a logistical evolution. In simple cases, this evolution can be represented as an S curve corresponding to the same function:</p>

<p>We see here that, even in mathematical formulas, the translation of the mechanisms of biological reproduction and replication into the language of transmission makes it possible to tighten and solidify the analogical ties between biological and cultural evolution. It thus resolves the difficulties and alleviates the tensions created by the exclusive reference to genetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>These are a few of the conceptual adaptations made to the standard neo-Darwinian model of biological evolution in view of constructing a theory of culture and a GTE suited to the specificities of cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>We look next at the consequences of these changes for the meaning of the concept of selection as applied to culture,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0539018412441754">11</xref></sup> first of all, and then as applied once again to biology.

<sec id="section6-0539018412441754">
<title>6 The concept of selection in the theory of culture derived from this GTE: meaning drift</title>
<p>How can culture be defined in such models? Where does it come in?</p>
<p>First of all culture must be considered as <italic>part of the transmission process.</italic> Selection cannot happen <italic>before</italic> transmission: an information unit cannot be considered to have been ‘selected’ before it has been transmitted to the receiver. And it cannot happen <italic>after</italic> the transmission, because once this has occurred, the selection, whatever meaning one assigns to the notion, is finished. Consequently, cultural selection is a mechanism or a force that necessarily occurs in the course of the transmission of cultural information.</p>
<p>The same conclusion is called for if we approach the question of cultural selection from the standpoint of the concept used to characterize the notion of selection in population genetics: fitness. Here again it seems impossible to define selection as anything but a part of transmission. In effect, fitness, however it is defined, is a parameter that directly controls the degree to which an idea is transmitted: by definition, the more culturally <italic>fit</italic> an idea is, the more readily it will be transmitted from one individual to another, all other things being equal.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if cultural selection is to be considered as a part of transmission, it cannot be confused with it. Selection cannot be defined, as one might be tempted to do by analogy, as a ‘transmission differential’ between two traits. For, as I showed in section 3, the difference in the rates at which two competing cultural traits spread in a society is not determined by their respective fitness alone, i.e. by selection forces alone, but also by the structure of the information transmission found in this society. Two cultural traits can be equally fit – for instance psychologically fit – and not both be transmitted with equal efficiency. Consequently, selection is only one of a number of other components of transmission and not the whole process.</p>
<p>To sum up: on the one hand, selection is necessarily a part of the transmission process; but on the other hand, it is not to be confused with it: all of the models discussed here agree, explicitly or not, on this point (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 349–350).</p>
<p>But how precisely do these authors define this part of transmission that they call selection with respect to the biology of evolution?</p>
<p>In point of fact, in the theories put forth by these researchers, the concept of selection as applied to culture unfailingly drifts toward a meaning close to that used in everyday speech. In most of these models, it explicitly designates the fact that an individual selects a cultural trait of which he has become aware, in other words he <italic>decides</italic> to adopt it.</p>
<p>Thus, as Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman write: ‘there are two stages in [the cultural] transmission process, analogous to those referred to above in the remarks on diffusion of innovations. The first stage is awareness, which requires the existence of a signal (via teaching or observation), and the second is acceptance (or learning). <italic>It is at the second stage that cultural selection may occur</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 62; emphasis added). A similar position can be found in Durham, who ‘defines “cultural selection” as the differential social transmission of cultural variants <italic>through human decision making</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>: 198; emphasis added). Selection is thus very clearly conceived by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, as by Durham, as the outcome of a personal decision and as a part of transmission. A similar position, even if it is developed more vaguely and ambiguously, can be found in the less formalized and more popularized versions of memetics, as in Blackmore: ‘there is memetic <italic>selection</italic> – some memes grab the attention, are faithfully remembered and passed on to other people, while others fail to get copied at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018412441754">Blackmore, 1999</xref>: 14; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Cultural selection is thus the ‘decision’ taken by an individual to retain one cultural trait rather than another. The notion is defined here as a part of the transmission process that depends on the receiver’s decision. Consequently, the factors determining selection are the factors that determine the choice made by individuals or groups in a society when they adopt a cultural trait they have seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>From this flows a crucial consequence. In this definition, the concept of selection <italic>no longer has the same meaning</italic> as in the classic population genetics models. The change is very clear on three main points.</p>
<p>First, selection is no longer correlated with the differential reproduction of individuals, since traits can be transmitted without individuals having to reproduce.</p>
<p>Second, selection can no longer be measured by the difference between the numbers of replications of two competing evolutionary units in a given lapse of time, as is the case for genes. This measurement, which can be called differential replication, no longer expresses only the difference of fitness between the units. As I showed in section 3, it also expresses the effects of certain transmission forces.</p>
<p>Third, defining cultural selection as the outcome of an individual decision implies considering that it is determined by the categories or values individuals use for making decisions. However, these categories or values are themselves most often cultural traits passed on by others. The selection of cultural evolutionary units is thus ultimately guided by the presence or absence in the mind of other cultural evolutionary units. Consequently, as Boyd and Richerson stress, cultural selection resembles less genetic selection than it does another biological process called <italic>meiotic drive</italic>. In this process, ‘ “driver” genes cause the chromosomes carrying them to be disproportionately likely to be incorporated in eggs and sperm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018412441754">Richerson &amp; Boyd, 2005</xref>: 79).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0539018412441754">12</xref></sup> Durham develops similar remarks when he emphasizes that the concept of cultural selection designates something analogous to what we would see if we were to choose the genes we pass on to our children or those we receive from our parents, or if we were to choose the viruses we pass on to others or those we get from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>, chap. 4). Unlike biological natural selection, cultural selection is a process oriented by intentions: it is <italic>goal oriented</italic>. And these goals and intentions depend on the cultural units present in the person’s mind. Cultural traits thus select themselves directly, as it were, unlike genes, which are selected indirectly through the objective consequences they produce in their own environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham, 1991</xref>, chap. 4; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018412441754">Dennett, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0539018412441754">13</xref></sup> Generally speaking, processes of cultural transmission are more similar to epigenetic processes than to simple and direct genetic mechanisms, that is to say to complex processes through which the environment interacts with genes in the development of an individual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0539018412441754">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>7 Natural selection becomes impossible in biology: the dilemma of neo-Darwinian analogies</title>
<p>The foregoing remarks merely show that the meaning of the concept of selection changes when it is applied to culture. They do not allow us to draw any final conclusions as to the theoretical solidity and the empirical fecundity of the models obtained. We must now illuminate the eventual difficulties raised by the shifting meanings of this concept.</p>
<p>The first difficulty appears when we analyze the meaning attributed to the concept of selection in this GTE when it is once again applied to biological phenomena, that is to say after having gone through the construction of a theory of culture and the GTE derived from it. In effect, the combination of the language of transmission and the language of classic population genetics – an association characteristic of this GTE – means in reality, despite appearances, that selection can no longer exist in the biological realm. In a word: biological natural selection disappears from this model. For as it is defined here, it can no longer operate in the living world and has necessarily zero effects on evolution. Why is this?</p>
<p>As I attempted to show in section 4, this GTE requires that all evolution, whatever it may be, must be described in the language of transmission. According to this requirement, genes are therefore described as information units <italic>transmitted</italic> from parents to their offspring. Genetic transmission is then described as having two specific properties that distinguish it from cultural transmission. First, it is always vertical and goes hand in hand with the production of a new individual – a descendant. Second, it adheres to Mendel’s laws. These laws imply that the means by which genes are transmitted does not alter their frequency. This is expressed by the Hardy–Weinberg law.</p>
<p>These properties have an extremely important consequence. They imply that all genes, whatever they may be, have <italic>necessarily</italic> the same probability of being passed on to a descendant when they are present in a parent, as Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman stress in their formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0539018412441754">15</xref></sup> Hypothesize, they say, a haploid species,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0539018412441754">16</xref></sup> and consider a gene having two alleles <italic>H</italic> and <italic>h</italic>.

<p>But, as I attempted to show in section 6, these models consider selection to be a part of transmission. It is defined as the part of transmission imputable to the fitness of the trait – that is to say, in biological evolution, to the fitness of the allele in question. In this case, fitness is necessarily a part of the probability of transmission. As we see in the values given, the probabilities of transmission are regarded as fixed in the case of genes and have the same value for all genes in the living world, in accordance with Mendel’s laws. This implies that, all other things being equal, in the case of biological evolution, fitness has fixed values and is the same for all genes in the living world. Which in turn implies that there can be no natural selection among genes since all have the same adaptive value, all are equally fit. This is of course in contradiction of the basic laws of population genetics and with the facts it purports to explain.</p>
<p>Such a statement enables us to draw two conclusions.</p>
<p>First, it shows once again that the concept of selection does not mean the same thing in classic population genetics as it does in the GTE. In biological evolution, as it is described by classic population genetics, selection does not come in at the transmission level, that is at the level of individual reproduction. It is measured by the number of descendants produced by an individual bearer of a given allele compared with the number of descendants produced by individuals who do not have this allele, and not by the proportion of individual carriers of a given allele in the descendants of a bearer of this allele. In other words, it is not measured by the probability that an allele will be passed on to a descendant. And, vice versa, this variable does not depend on selection: it follows fixed parameters, which are those of Mendel’s laws. As a consequence, in biological evolution, selection and reproduction – in other words the means of transmission – work independently of each other. Selection can therefore not be considered as a process that intervenes in transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018412441754">Guillo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Second – and this is the most important point – the concept of selection confronts the theorist constructing a GTE with an insoluble dilemma. Either he chooses to consider that selection is a process inherent in the transmission of evolutionary units – which is what the theorists under discussion do, for reasons that were developed in section 3. But in this case, as I have just shown, biological natural selection cannot exist, which makes the GTE model fruitless for biology. Or he chooses to consider that selection is a process external to the transmission of evolutionary units; but in this case, cultural selection can no longer exist (see sections 3 and 6), which makes the model fruitless for the social sciences.</p>
<p>Hence a crucial consequence arises. All this shows that it is impossible to construct, on the basis of an analogy with selection as it is defined in classic population genetics, a general model – a GTE – in which both cultural selection and biological natural selection have the same general meaning, are equally fruitful and appear distinctly. Therefore, evolution by replication/mutation/selection cannot be considered as a <italic>general</italic> model that applies <italic>both</italic> to biological phenomena and to cultural phenomena. Those researchers who maintain that Darwinism, understood in this manner, is an ‘algorithm’, or a ‘universal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018412441754">Blackmore, 1999</xref>: 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441754">Dennett, 1996</xref>) ‘acid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441754">Dennett, 1996</xref>) with a very general application, develop arguments that are in fact founded on a trick of homonymy rather than on a precise unitary theory. In the models proposed by these researchers, the unity and the generality of the theory are merely apparent. They stem from the use of the same word – selection – to designate very different realities: differential reproduction, in the case of biology, and individual choice, in the case of anthropology. Summing up, we could say that there is as much relation, in these models, between the selection of genes and the selection of cultural traits as between the Normandy Bridge and the bridge of the <italic>Normandy</italic>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this finding only permits us to doubt the value of the GTE constructed by these researchers. It does not allow us to conclude that the proposed theories of culture are themselves devoid of theoretical and empirical pertinence. The theoretical and empirical pertinence of a model does not depend on the method – here analogical – used to build it. Nothing says <italic>a priori</italic> that the models that prove fruitful in a field were not initially built on dubious analogies or fragile general theories, as numerous examples from the history of sciences show.</p>
<p>We must now concentrate on the realm of culture and answer the following question: does the analogical use of these neo-Darwinian concepts in the realm of culture engender specific advantages or disadvantages?</p>
<p>As I attempt to show, the concept of selection when applied to culture necessarily loses the central position and the explanatory power it has in biology. In the end, behind the use of a new vocabulary, these models still state the problem of culture in a classic manner. The use of neo-Darwinian vocabulary is not without consequences, however: it imposes a constraint – distinction between transmission and selection – which entails difficulties when it comes to describing and explaining social and cultural facts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0539018412441754">
<title>8 A theory that loses teleonomy on the way</title>
<p>Let us examine the first point: the loss of the explanatory power of the concept of selection. The primary originality and interest of selection as defined by Darwinism stem from the fact that the concept makes it possible to break with the teleological explanations of the living organism’s adaptation to its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018412441754">Mayr, 2001</xref>: 83–89). Indeed, the theory of natural selection makes it possible to explain the astonishing harmony of living beings with their environment without recourse to final causes or to mechanisms that suppose the existence of underlying goal-directed intentions.</p>
<p>This particular characteristic of the theory of natural selection stems from the fact that it makes a radical separation between two kinds of mechanisms: those that give rise to a new organic trait or that explain its replication, on the one hand, and those that explain its diffusion in a biological population, on the other hand. The new organic traits are the product of random mechanisms that have no adaptive purpose; they are mutations, genetic recombinations. That means that the <italic>appearance</italic> of a new organic trait is not caused by whatever fitness it may display. For example, the genes that control the color of the chameleon’s skin did not appear because they improved this animal’s camouflage. They did not appear <italic>in order to</italic> perform this function. Likewise, the <italic>replication</italic> of a trait owes nothing to its fitness. The camouflage genes are not replicated because they are useful to the animal. They are replicated uniquely because they have physical properties that make them regularly reproduce copies of themselves, like all other genes. The replication mechanism is thus independent of the information contained in the genes, that is, of how fit they are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441754">Claidière, 2009</xref>: 78–80). Summing up: the appearance and replication of a trait are not explained by their usefulness, by final causes. The <italic>diffusion</italic> of one trait to the detriment of another, on the other hand, is explained mechanically by the differential reproduction of the bearers. Therefore it is not explained by final causes either. The independence of the mechanisms at work in the two stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018412441754">Mayr, 2001</xref>: 119) – mutation and replication, on the one hand, and differential reproduction, on the other – mean that natural selection is a blind process, which allows us to explain mechanically the appearance of adaptive traits in living organisms without recourse to underlying goal-directed forces. This model has therefore been termed ‘teleonomic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018412441754">Mayr, 1976</xref>), in opposition to teleological models.</p>
<p>In the theory of culture under discussion, the neo-Darwinian concepts are reinterpreted in such a manner that they amount to a teleological explanatory model, in the case of both mutation and replication.</p>
<p>Let us consider the case of mutations. According to these theorists, the equivalent of mutation in the cultural realm is innovation, that is, a change that occurs in ideas or behaviors. However, the changes that occur in ideas or behaviors are rarely the consequence of a random copying error, as is the case for genetic mutations. They are more often innovations made for a certain purpose. For example, the derailleur gear was invented <italic>in order to</italic> improve the way the bicycle worked. In such cases the trait’s fitness – its usefulness for the person – is a cause of its appearance. A form of selection is thus already at work through mutation itself. Mutation and selection are therefore no longer perfectly independent. Yet the independence of these two mechanisms is an imperative condition for a process of selection free of teleology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018412441754">Mayr, 2001</xref>: 119–120).</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the case of replication. Here again, a form of teleology has crept back into the models. As I emphasized above, in these theories, cultural replication is described as transmission of information from one person to another. This transmission depends on several factors. One of these is the choice made by the receiver – a choice here called ‘selection’. For example, replication of the trait ‘harpoon fishing’ from individual A to individual B depends on the receiver’s decision to adopt it or not. This choice is often partially guided by the advantages the individual recognizes the trait ‘harpoon fishing’ to have over a competing trait, say ‘hand fishing’. Replication of a trait thus depends in part on selection, which depends on the assessment of a trait by a being endowed with intentions. Replication and selection are therefore no longer independent: here again, a form of teleology has crept back into the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018412441754">Guillo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, in this model, mutation, replication and selection are mechanisms that are no longer clearly distinct from each other. Applied to culture, neo-Darwinian concepts – in particular, selection – thus lose what gave them their epistemological originality and their explanatory power in biology.</p>
<p>In the end, the theory of culture proposed here comes down to stating the question of cultural diffusion in terms classically used in the social sciences – those of the determinants involved in individual decision-making and communication – while it leaves the possible answers open and without a definite solution. In this respect, the detour through the vocabulary of neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology does not seem to offer substantial scientific benefits. But that is not all: this detour is far from being neutral. As I attempt to show in section 9, it has serious drawbacks for the description and the explanation of cultural phenomena.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0539018412441754">
<title>9 The necessary distinction between transmission forces and selection forces: three negative consequences</title>
<p>There are three types of disadvantage we can mention.</p>
<p>First, the model is suitable by definition only for the cases in which the person is in a position to choose between two or more cultural traits. In effect, as we saw, selection is the part of transmission that is determined by choice on the part of the receiver.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0539018412441754">18</xref></sup> Consequently, if the individual is not in a position to choose between several cultural alternatives, there can be no selection. Such cases are frequent. This is the objection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018412441754">Fracchia &amp; Lewontin (1999)</xref> make about these models: their validity is limited by the importance of power relations in human societies. In situations where power is involved, cultural traits are imposed on individuals, as, for example, when a political authority makes it mandatory to wear a uniform. In such cases, there is no free competition between the cultural traits. And they can therefore not be ‘selected’ by the individuals (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018412441754">Godfrey-Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018412441754">Reisman, 2005</xref>), because one of the possible traits is imposed by constraint. As Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman stress:
<disp-quote>
<p>… for many traits the two stages, awareness and adoption, are not clearly distinct. We do not refuse to learn our native language … <italic>The outcome is that many cultural traits are accepted with limited or no choice. In these cases awareness and acceptance are difficult or impossible to distinguish</italic>, and transmission may be truly a one-stage process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>: 62–63; original emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The selection model thus is not suitable for describing and explaining cultural transmission operating under the constraint or the influence of a leader, a parent or a peer. But this situation surely accounts for a non-negligible part of the phenomena the social sciences file under the heading of culture.</p>
<p>To be sure, we could point out, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham (1991</xref>, chap. 4), that in the cases where cultural traits are ‘imposed’ on individuals by constraint, there is still a selection: the selection that is made between the different cultural traits by those who hold power. In my example, the public authority selects one uniform rather than another or rather than no uniform. The power structure in this society can be considered as a property that is part of the transmission structure of cultural information,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0539018412441754">19</xref></sup> and therefore as a transmission force. But this means further extending the realm of transmission forces to the detriment of selection, which then loses a little more of its explanatory pertinence.</p>
<p>Second, these models also pose difficulties in other cases, that is to say, where the individual is in a position to choose between two cultural traits. The influence exerted by individual A on individual B, when A explains to B the advantages of cultural trait <italic>H</italic> with respect to cultural trait <italic>h</italic> – transmission force – is a psychological mechanism that is hard to describe independently of the psychological mechanism by which B is persuaded to prefer <italic>H</italic> to <italic>h</italic> for objective reasons – selection force, which has to do with the respective fitness of <italic>H</italic> and <italic>h</italic> – independently of the person doing the explaining. For the influence of an emitter is always exerted through an argument that is convincing or not, and inextricably mixes rational – or at least apparently rational – arguments and emotional appeals, for instance, charisma. This is true even for religious and political leaders: an absolutely ‘pure’ influence, in which the receiver is totally passive, is akin to hypnosis and is surely a rare and extreme case. However, the theory of cultural selection requires us to describe concrete cases of cultural transmission as if a pure influence mechanism were at work, on the one hand, and a perfectly rational, independent and objective individual judgment, on the other hand. Generally speaking, this is not the empirical form taken by the process by which one individual persuades another.</p>
<p>Third, in certain cases, the evolutionary mechanisms observed empirically can be described <italic>indifferently</italic> as transmission forces or as selection forces. Take the example of a society where parents transmit to their offspring values of obedience to authority. These values strongly encourage respect for leaders. Suppose that in this society people fish by hand. One day a chief begins fishing with a harpoon. He does not force anyone to do likewise. But some people who have seen the chief fishing this way also begin to fish with a harpoon. How is this cultural change to be described? The adoption of this cultural trait is linked to the influence the chief has on the individuals in this society and therefore to a force that affects the <italic>transmission</italic> of cultural information, whatever the content of this information. But the adoption of harpoon fishing is also a choice dictated by the values people have in mind: respect for authority and faith in the value of the chief’s actions. When one subscribes to this value and this faith, it is rational to consider that one must adopt the practice of harpoon fishing. The adoption of this practice can therefore equally be described as the result of a <italic>selection</italic> process, in the sense that it is the result of a free choice made by the individual in virtue of his or her values. In this example, transmission is therefore equally, and especially <italic>indifferently</italic>, a selection. Here then no distinction can be made between selection forces and transmission forces, whereas the GTE requires the distinction to be made.</p>

<sec id="section10-0539018412441754">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a famous article, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin criticized an interpretation and a use of Darwinism that they called the Panglossian Paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018412441754">Gould &amp; Lewontin, 1979</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0539018412441754">20</xref></sup> But that is not the only risk run by researchers using the natural selection principle. Pangloss is not alone in Voltaire’s story. The Candidian Paradigm can also lead to failure to see the shifts in the meaning of concepts when they circulate from one discipline to another through the use of analogies. As I attempted to show, the concepts used in the GTE – and in particular the concept of selection – necessarily designate different things depending on whether they are applied to culture or to genes. And despite appearances, the use of these neo-Darwinian concepts does not bring anything fundamentally new to the way of theorizing the problem of cultural diffusion in the social sciences. These theories could be formulated without difficulty in the classic language of decision theory or interaction theory, in other words without reference to neo-Darwinian language. Moreover, the use of a neo-Darwinian vocabulary has drawbacks for trying to describe and explain cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>These criticisms do not apply, however, I repeat, to the other uses of Darwinism in the social sciences, particularly in evolutionary psychology, cognitive anthropology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0539018412441754">21</xref></sup> or in the analogical models constructed on population thinking. It is important to add that neither do these criticisms imply that the research discussed above is fruitless and has not yielded valuable lessons for the social sciences. This is particularly true of the models based on mathematical formulas, like those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441754">Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Feldman (1981)</xref>, Boyd and Richerson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441754">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018412441754">Richerson &amp; Boyd, 2005</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441754">Durham (1991)</xref>. But their studies can be regarded as extensions, systematizations or perfections of tools and concepts that already existed in the social sciences<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0539018412441754">22</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441754">Coleman, Katz &amp; Menzel, 1966</xref>), rather than as the result of a truly new paradigm. Above all, these tools and concepts can be used with another vocabulary than that of neo-Darwinism, and that would avoid taking on clandestine concepts and arguments in the course of the voyage.</p>

<p>In this article, I discuss only models that seek to explain cultural phenomena by analogy to neo-Darwinian explanations of biological evolution, and specifically to mechanisms of natural selection. If I focus on these models, it is not because neo-Darwinism and natural selection, as they appear in these models, are currently the best explanations of biological evolution. These explanations are now being discussed in particular for the meaning they give to the concept of natural selection: see, for example, the recent work of Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piatelli-Palmerini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018412441754">Fodor &amp; Piatelli-Palmerini, 2010</xref>). I leave this very complex issue to one side in the present article. If I focused on these models, it is mainly because analogies between biological evolution and culture are most of the time built on neo-Darwinism and its definition of natural selection. But of course we cannot exclude that an analogy based on other explanations of biological evolution may be just as productive.</p>

<p>Like Godfrey-Smith, I posit that selection requires reproduction. I do not talk about group selection here: the application of this concept to culture does not raise the same problems as those discussed in the article. The same holds for the evolutionary models that borrow only the principle of population thinking from Darwinism and leave aside the ideas of replicator and of a cultural selection process analogous to natural selection. The criticisms formulated here concern the models articulated around the idea that culture is made up of entities that evolve through a process of selection <italic>analogous</italic> to that of genes.</p>

<p>In this section I do not explicitly discuss the models of selection without replication. Nevertheless, they are amenable to the same critical reasoning to be found in sections 3 and 4.

<p>This reasoning is also valid for the case in which the cultural replication is not perfect, by analogy with the case in which biological heredity is not a process of exact copying.

<p>This is why many authors suggest regarding cultural evolution as a Lamarckian process. This hypothesis has sparked an abundant literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018412441754">Jablonka &amp; Lamb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018412441754">Kronfelder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0539018412441754">Szathmary, 2002</xref>).

<p>Pangloss is Voltaire’s imaginary philosopher whom he derides for his motto: ‘Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds’. Gould and Lewontin maintain that biology often uses natural selection in a Panglossian sense, that is to say tautologically: someone postulates first of all that an organic trait is necessarily useful, for if it were not it would not have been retained by natural selection; then, when a possible usefulness has been found for the trait, this usefulness is claimed to explain why the trait was retained by natural selection. For a reply, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441754">Sober (1984</xref>, chap. 2), who shows that there exist non-tautological uses of natural selection.</p>

<p>In particular, these criticisms do not apply to Dan Sperber’s theory. As I mentioned at the beginning of this paper, Sperber strongly criticizes the use of neo-Darwinian analogies in anthropology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018412441754">Sperber, 2000</xref>). His model must also be distinguished from diffusionist epidemiological models, based on the virus model, as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018412441754">Sperber (1996)</xref>. He argues indeed that ideas may be ‘contagious’ or ‘epidemic’, but the epidemics he refers to by this metaphor are epidemics linked to addiction, not to viruses.</p>

<label>22</label>
<p>The models I'm talking about here, like those by Coleman, Katz and Menzel, are models built on epidemiology, that is to say models based on an analogy with the spread of viruses, without reference to genes and natural selection. These models have been widely developed in economics and the sociology of consumption and fashion, especially to explain the distribution of property. These models definitely raise fewer problems than those discussed here. However, as pointed out by a referee of this article, the ‘viral’ model of transmission should, at the very least, consider also the integration into the genome of pro-phages, and transposable elements. These elements may remain dormant for a long time and then be activated some generations downstream. This represents a considerable complication of the model.</p>

<title>Author biography</title>
<p><bold>Dominique Guillo</bold> is a sociologist, director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), Centre Jacques Berque (Rabat). His research activities focus on the relations between biology and social sciences (evolutionary psychology, memetics, cognitive anthropology), the sociology of collective beliefs about evolution and creationism, and the interactions between humans and animals (dogs). His recent publications include: <italic>Ni Dieu ni Darwin: Les français et la théorie de l’évolution</italic> (Paris, Ellipses, 2009), and <italic>Des chiens et des humains</italic> (Paris, Le Pommier, 2011).</p>
