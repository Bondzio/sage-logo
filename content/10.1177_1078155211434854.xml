<abstract>
<p>Incidence of second malignancies in patients with advanced lung cancer is not well-studied, in part because of a short survival in this patient population. Apart from a genetic predisposition, various environmental hazards may also be at play in their pathogenesis. Chronic smoking exposure decreases T-cell responsiveness and stimulates production of a variety of inhibitory cytokines. Paclitaxel has been associated with several immunosuppressive effects such as decreased numbers and activity of dendritic cells, NK-cells, and monocytes. We herein describe the first series of lung cancer patients who developed colonic polyps/colon cancer either during or immediately following chemotherapy with paclitaxel, suggesting a possible role of this agent in their pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy agents are important tools in the therapy of various malignant neoplasms. Nonetheless, some of them can cause genetic damage and/or have unfavorable impact on the immune system. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are taxanes, an important class of chemotherapy agents, that emerged almost three decades ago. Their primary cytotoxic mechanism is mediated by interference with microtubule depolymerization resulting in cell death. Additional effects of this class of medications include suppression of protein synthesis, induction of apoptosis, enhancement of radiosensitivity, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mediated cell lysis. Taxanes were shown to have pleiotropic effects on the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211434854">1</xref></sup> We report herein a case series of patients who received treatment with paclitaxel-carboplatin therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and progressed to have new premalignant or malignant colonic lesions while on or immediately after such therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155211434854" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 1</title>
<p>An 81-year-old female presented in May 2011 with complains of dry cough, intermittent hemoptysis, and a 20-lb weight loss over the preceding three months. She had a past history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, mild chronic renal insufficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She also had a 60-pack-year history of smoking, but did not have any family history of oncologic problems. Her health maintenance measures were up to date. A chest CT scan showed a right hilar mass measuring 4.4 × 2.4 cm<sup>2</sup> and a 7-mm right middle lobe nodule. Bronchoscopy with biopsy yielded the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated carcinoma of lung primary origin. A staging PET/CT scan did not show any evidence of lesions outside thorax. The patient was treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation using a weekly regimen of carboplatin AUC = 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> that she tolerated well. A restaging PET/CT scan showed a near-complete response in the chest, but a suspicious new focal uptake with a standard uptake unit (SUV) = 6.5 in the ascending colon. A colonoscopy revealed the presence of a 2-cm polypoid lesion, for which polypectomy was accomplished. Pathology showed a tubular adenoma, a known premalignant colonic lesion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1078155211434854" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 62-year-old female presented with intractable back and sternal pain for nearly three months. She had a personal history of early stage cervical cancer at age 25 and was status post total hysterectomy without any adjuvant therapy. She also had a 50-pack-year history of smoking and had quit 4 years prior. Her last colonoscopy was done in the previous year and revealed no abnormalities. Family history was positive for lung cancer in her mother who was also a heavy smoker. A CT scan showed multiple bone lytic lesions with pathological fractures of right inferior pubic ramus, upper sacrum, and thoracic vertebrae T12. The hepatobiliary tree and pancreas were normal, and there was no lymphadenopathy, masses, or ascites. A chest radiograph was negative for any lesions. Laboratories were all normal except for an increased alkaline phosphatase at 184 mg/dL (normal, 50–75 mg/dL) and a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 1154.7 U/mL (0–4 U/mL). A PET/CT scan done for staging purposes revealed a 1.7 cm left upper lobe mass (SUV = 6.7), bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (SUV = 3.4) and multiple lytic lesions throughout the skeleton with a maximum SUV = 9.2. A biopsy of a bone lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of lung origin. The patient was started on chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC = 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for a total of 6 cycles at 3-week intervals. The clinico-radiological improvement was noted after the first three cycles, with decrease in size of the primary lesion and a decrease in CEA to 162 U/ml. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy, the CEA decreased further to 88 U/ml and a repeat PET scan showed a good partial response. However, a new focus of uptake was noted in the sigmoid colon (SUV = 14) suggesting a malignant or a premalignant lesion. A colonoscopy revealed a polyp that was resected and pathology showed a tubulovillous adenoma featuring severe dysplastic changes of glandular epithelium. The patient was started on pemetrexed cross-maintenance therapy and a repeat PET scan did not show any further colonic lesions. Unfortunately, she died of progressive lung cancer 5 months later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155211434854" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 3</title>
<p>A 63-year-old man with a 48-pack-year history of smoking and mild COPD presented with a persistent cough for approximately 12 weeks. His past medical history was otherwise unremarkable; colonoscopies have been consistently normal. A CT scan showed a 6-cm lingular mass with left hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. On bronchoscopy, the brushings suggested NSCLC cells, with subsequent confirmation of adenocarcinoma of primary lung origin by biopsy. A PET/CT done for staging indicated a clinico-radiological stage IIIB NSCLC as it showed no uptake outside thorax. A brain MRI showed no evidence of metastases. The patient was started on carboplatin AUC = 5, paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. He tolerated chemotherapy well. A restaging PET/CT scan after three chemotherapy cycles indicated a good partial radiologic response with shrinkage in the primary mass and nodes. However, it also showed a new 2.6 cm area of uptake (SUV = 11.1) in the distal sigmoid colon suspicious for a malignant lesion. Carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA) level was 4.4 U/mL and increased to 12.2 U/mL by the next visit. The chemotherapy for lung cancer was continued. A colonoscopy showed a sigmoid mass, the biopsy of which revealed moderately differentiated invasive colon adenocarcinoma. An anterior resection of the sigmoid mass with lymph node resection was performed. Pathology showed stage IIIC (T3N2M0) colorectal cancer with both nodal and lymphovascular invasion. Adjuvant chemotherapy with continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) along with concurrent radiation therapy was further offered. However, the patient developed coronary vasospasm leading to cessation of 5-FU. Radiation therapy with 5000 cGy alone was therefore delivered over 5 weeks. Although a repeat PET/CT scan showed no evidence of recurrence of colon cancer, it revealed recurrence of the lung cancer with new brain metastasis. Cyber knife therapy was used for the treatment of brain lesions. Given relapsed NSCLC, three different chemotherapy regimens were subsequently administered. Unfortunately, the patient died from progressive brain metastases of lung cancer 20 months from initial presentation.</p>

<p>Incidence of second cancers in patients with advanced lung cancer is not well-known, predominantly because of a short survival in this patient population. These patients could develop both lung cancer and second malignancies because of a shared genetic predisposition, common carcinogens or other unknown factors. Immune defects, often present in patients with lung cancer, may also play an important role in second carcinogenesis. Aging, with inherent genetic mutations, is a known risk factor for both lung and colon cancer. In addition, aging is associated with both decreased T-cell function and low antibody responses. Furthermore, some environmental exposures are important in the development of both lung and colon cancers. Among those, cigarette smoking has been known for a long time to carry potent carcinogenic properties. Cigarette smoking delivers circa 4000 substances that are known to be mutagenic, antigenic and carcinogenic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211434854">2</xref></sup> In addition, smoking has been associated with immune effects that might have important implications for carcinogenesis. Of all these substances, tar and nicotine have been shown to be immunosuppressive, by affecting the innate host immune responses and increasing chances of acquiring various infections. Impact on the immune system has been found to be directly proportional to the amount of these substances in the inhaled smoke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211434854">3</xref></sup> Chronic smoking exposure causes decreased T-cell responsiveness; a state of T-cell anergy is produced by nicotine that compromises the antigen-mediated signal transduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211434854">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211434854">5</xref></sup> In addition, studies have shown suppression of intracellular calcium responses, leading to impairment of signal transduction and hence decreasing the antibody production. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that acute and chronic exposure to nicotine suppresses immunity via different mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211434854">6</xref></sup> Other than affecting T-cell function, nicotine modifies the production of inflammatory cytokines including interleukins such as IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha, especially in close proximity to the respiratory tract epithelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434854">7</xref></sup> This in turn impairs the inflammatory cell function: phagocytic function of neutrophils and macrophages has been shown to be diminished in human cells exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to cigarette smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211434854">8</xref></sup> Therefore, chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and resulting immunosuppression might be an important cause behind carcinogenesis in smokers.</p>
<p>Adenomatous polyps have long been considered to be the precursor lesions for colorectal carcinoma. After Morson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211434854">9</xref></sup> first described the adenoma-carcinoma sequence for colorectal cancer, strong evidence has accumulated supporting it, though de novo carcinogenesis is also possible. Lifetime incidence of adenomas in humans is estimated to be 30–40%, while conversion of adenomas to cancer only occurs in approximately 3% of average risk population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211434854">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155211434854">11</xref></sup> This number though is considered to vary depending on existing environmental and genetic risk factors.</p>
<p>Paclitaxel-carboplatin doublet has been successfully used in the first-line therapy for NSCLC as well as in a variety of other solid tumors.</p>
<p>Myelosuppression is an important side effect of both these anticancer agents that could also lead to a decreased proliferation of cells of the immune system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211434854">12</xref></sup> An extensive literature review did not show significant immune alterations resulting from the use of carboplatin alone. However, there are conflicting results on the immune alterations caused by paclitaxel in cancer patients. While there is some evidence to suggest immunity-enhancing effects of paclitaxel, there is enough data to ascertain its immunosuppressive effects. Nonetheless, most data has been extrapolated from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, animal models, and small studies in humans. A study of peripheral blood from patients treated with paclitaxel for different solid tumors indicated a decrease in both monocyte counts and their phagocytic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155211434854">13</xref></sup> An animal model suggested paclitaxel induced immunosuppression via inhibition of the dendritic cell-mediated T-cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155211434854">14</xref></sup> A small study in humans demonstrated a decrease in natural killer (NK) cell activity, in parallel with decreased leukocyte counts due to weekly paclitaxel doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155211434854">15</xref></sup> In rat models, immunosuppression similar to the one seen with cyclosporine has been shown following heart allograft transplant using low-dose paclitaxel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155211434854">16</xref></sup> While these effects have potential implications for paclitaxel use in organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders, there is a real possibility that its immunosuppressive effects might trigger progression of additional premalignant or malignant colonic lesions.</p>
<p>In summary, administration of certain chemotherapy agents namely taxanes has been associated with immunosuppression that can possibly be leading to additional premalignant/malignant lesions. We describe a series of patients who developed precancerous colonic polyps and/or colon cancer during or immediately after paclitaxel use. These observations suggest at least a hypothetical role of immune alterations due to paclitaxel in both development and rapid progression of malignant/pre-malignant colonic lesions. To our knowledge, this is the first case series documenting such an association.</p>
