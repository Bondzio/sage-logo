<p>It is an honor to have the chance to serve the National Association for Music Education as president. While I know the road will not always be smooth, I look forward to the challenges and expect to learn a great deal personally and professionally as a result of this work. This column is an opportunity to challenge us all to think about issues affecting music education, to act on these ideas, and to strive to reach new levels of professional accomplishment and personal satisfaction.</p>
<p>Fall represents a season of change. For most of us, there is some relinquishment of the freedom of summer break. In many parts of the United States, the weather is showing signs of the onset of winter, and students and teachers are returning to classrooms with a renewed sense of energy and commitment to learning and teaching. The educational climate in our nation is ever-changing, and our association must adjust in ways that allow us to remain vital in our efforts to promote music education as a tool for orchestrating success for all students.</p>
<p>Many changes are in progress at the national level, including writing new arts standards, examining new ways to assess learning in the arts, and implementing new criteria for the evaluation of teachers. NAfME is integrally involved in all these areas, as evidenced by such things as Scott Shuler’s coleadership of the standards writing committee, last summer’s national symposium on music assessment, and the work of our higher education colleagues and our National Executive Board on issues related to teacher evaluation.</p>
<p>Our organization has undergone numerous changes in recent months, including the restructuring of societies and councils, the addition of councils for previously underrepresented areas, the creation of Give a Note Foundation, and the implementation of increased advocacy efforts through Groundswell. We are also operating under a relatively new strategic plan that contains four succinct and distinct directions: advocacy, serving the profession and the music educator, research, and organizational vitality.</p>
<p>Change is difficult. It requires us to think in different ways about ideals and ideas we have taken for granted. It asks us to be open-minded and willing to try new approaches. Change is not inherently good or bad but is shaped by our attitudes about it. No one knows what music instruction will look like in the future, but certainly there will continue to be significant change through the next few years and beyond. Instead of feeling threatened by new ways of thinking about such issues as instruction, assessment, and teacher evaluation, we must be proactive in finding new ways to ensure that all students have the opportunity to study music.</p>

<p>Whether we are in the first years of teaching or approaching the end of a long career, these times are challenging, and change is inevitable. I challenge all of us as music educators to embrace change and to view it as an opportunity so that we approach the changes in our profession and our professional organization in the most positive manner possible.</p>
<p>In thinking about change and its inevitability in our professional and personal lives, I am reminded of the following William Arthur Ward quote: “The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; and the realist adjusts the sails.” As we face uncertain times for ourselves and our profession, please remember that we cannot always control the direction of the wind, but we can adjust the sails to help us reach our destination.</p>
