<abstract>
<p>The challenges of remembering and memorializing the violence of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s tumultuous 20th century have captivated numerous scholars’ imaginations, because Bosnia is a remarkable example of both the utility and abuse of wartime memory. However, the elephant in the room during these discussions is the role of dark humour in narratives of Bosnia’s recent past. This article argues that dark humour is an especially subversive form of counter-memory, that allows Bosnians to express dissent from dominant narratives of the Bosnian War that they perceive as unproductive or divisive. Examples are drawn from oral histories, film and monuments to demonstrate how humour speaks to three major themes of Bosnian remembering: the idea of Bosnians as powerless victims; the seemingly arbitrary nature of the war and its aftermath; and the failures of the international community before, during and after the war. Bosnian dark humour critiques not only the above themes, but simultaneously the social structures in place for discussing the past.</p>

<p>We are the only region to have a good sense of humor, Bosnians. I think it’s a way of surviving. Humor gives you a distance. So we laughed a lot during the war. It was our secret weapon. So I thought why not treat a subject that was serious with a good sense of humor. It eases up certain things. (Danis Tanović, on his film <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>, interviewed by Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698011415247">Fischer, 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>I guess there were some really bad things like the shelling and being in constant fear, not sleeping in the night … but also there were some good things and some feelings, some sense of security when you are with other people in the same position, when people help each other, and stuff like that. Like funny things that happened, because we did not have electricity, so we had to do all sorts of stuff to watch television, like … take out the accumulator [battery] from the car to plug it in to our own television … A lot of very funny situations, but also horrible things that happened. (Alma, interview with the author, 2006)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698011415247">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The Balkan sense of humour is infamous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698011415247">2</xref></sup> It is a favourite topic of conversation among any and all internationals who have visited the region because it is both dark and ubiquitous; one can easily eavesdrop on expatriate conversations in Sarajevan cafes or relevant academic conferences that delve into the details of the cruellest or most absurd joke that one has recently heard. And yet it has rarely been taken seriously by these very same people in their academic and non-governmental organization (NGO)-based work that shares its subject with many of the best jokes: the former Yugoslavia’s recent violence, and how narratives of that violence are affecting the region’s present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698011415247">3</xref></sup> Indeed, during my own oral history research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I laughed frequently during my interviews; however, it took me several years of reflection to realize that these humorous moments contained important information about my interviewees’ remembering. Using Bosnia-Herzegovina as an example, this article argues that dark humour is the elephant in the room in discussions of post-conflict memory.</p>
<p>Philosophers and theorists have occasionally turned their attention to the structures and meanings of humour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750698011415247">4</xref></sup> In his seminal work on the topic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011415247">Freud (1938)</xref> lays out every type of humorous utterance possible in painstaking detail, musing on the various ways that such mechanisms affect both the speaker and their audience. He argues that wit uses many of the same strategies as dreams do in order to interpret reality and turn it on its head; it is similarly subversive and allows for the expression of taboo ideas. Kant states that incongruities produce laughter, arguing that it ‘is an affection arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698011415247">1951</xref>: 52); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1750698011415247">Schopenhauer (1966)</xref> similarly finds humour at the intersection of logically sophisticated, yet ultimately nonsensical statements. The playwright Pirandello describes comedy as an expression of profound melancholy: ‘the condition of a man who is always out of tune’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1750698011415247">1966</xref>: 46). Descartes is interpreted as having thought that humor is ‘joy mixed with hate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698011415247">Farb, 1981</xref>: 771), while Koestler muses that humour necessarily involves, ‘an impulse, however faint, of aggression or apprehension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750698011415247">1969</xref>: 54). These and other treatments of humour argue over whether humour asserts dominance over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698011415247">Hobbes, 1969</xref>); serves as a way of resisting and sometimes humiliating those who dominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011415247">Beckmann, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750698011415247">Obrdlik, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750698011415247">Payne 2005</xref>); or facilitates political intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750698011415247">Klumbytė, forthcoming</xref>). They ask whether it is cruel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750698011415247">Koestler, 1969</xref>), subversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1750698011415247">Zupančić, 2008</xref>), or an inherently social act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011415247">Bingham and Hernandez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011415247">Brandes, 1977</xref>). What everyone seems able to agree on is that humour is a very serious matter.</p>
<p>While canonical theorists argue about humour’s relation to power, social interaction, or expressions of the taboo, it is more recent literature that has mapped these ideas onto what has alternately been referred to as political humour, dark humour or gallows humour; that is, humour that deals with contentious politics or difficult political circumstances. Much current scholarly discussion of the potentialities of political humour centres around satire, such as political cartoons or the American television comedy programme, <italic>The Daily Show</italic>. Such discussions ask how analysing contemporary politics through a humorous framework affects political discourse. For example, it has been alternately argued that <italic>The Daily Show</italic> creates a cynicism that alienates its audience from political debate and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011415247">Baumgartner and Morris, 2006</xref>); that it reinvents political journalism and renders it more productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011415247">Baym, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750698011415247">McKain, 2005</xref>); and that its format uniquely allows it to it resist dominant discourses about American politics and subvert them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1750698011415247">Warner, 2007</xref>). These are all potential ways of characterizing political or dark humour in post-conflict contexts as well. Only occasionally have such questions been extended to contexts of oppression and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011415247">Brandes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750698011415247">Obrdlik, 1942</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, when humour is studied within the context of difficult politics or violence, it is usually regarded as a coping mechanism used <italic>during</italic> such experiences, rather than <italic>after</italic>. The most significant exception to this is the study of humour’s place in Holocaust memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698011415247">Gilman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1750698011415247">Rosen, 2004</xref>), which asks both how and why the violence of the Holocaust can be rendered humorous, and what the ethics of this are. The discussion is different, however, in political contexts that are less distantly in the past. In her work on post-authoritarian memory, Payne argues that humour ‘makes trouble’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750698011415247">2005</xref>: 68) both within authoritarian regimes and later transitional governments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Humor] tells truths about political affairs in a way that renders them funny. These truths percolate from below … Humor speaks a truth silenced by official channels. It raises a mirror on society that reflects an image very different from the one promoted by the old authoritarian order and its transitional successor. Humor cannot and should not replace politics; it adds to, enhances, and embellishes politics … Ultimately, humor gives voice to individuals and ideas excluded from the official political discourse. It is a way of making trouble, doing politics, by other means: an alternative form of truth-telling. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750698011415247">2005</xref>: 72)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite arguing for the subversive power of humour, Payne nevertheless separates it from politics; humour complements action, but is not action. Others are much more pessimistic, arguing that ‘political humor dissipates energy or deflects it away from direct political action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011415247">Brandes, 1977</xref>: 346). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1750698011415247">Scott (1990)</xref> is unique in his characterization of humour as a means of hidden resistance among oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>As is evidenced in many of the above ideas, humour is generally regarded as a symptom or litmus test of a general population’s feelings and anxieties, rather than as a political force in and of itself. Why are we so afraid of taking humour seriously? While scholars argue about whether humour helps or hinders political involvement and action, I argue that in certain cases, humour can <italic>be</italic> political action. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, a region which has experienced considerable difficulty remembering the violent past, humour is a way of remembering and representing this past in a subversive manner; it offers an alternative mnemonic paradigm that resists the ethnically divisive historical narratives that plague the region. It asserts agency and restores dignity that was lost as a result of the perceived humiliation of the war. This article explores three themes that are both the subject of much humour, and that speak to major issues in understanding the Bosnian War – the idea of Bosnians, especially Bosniaks,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750698011415247">5</xref></sup> as powerless victims; the seemingly arbitrary nature of the war and its aftermath; and the failures of the international community – to show how dark humour can, like Freud argued, be a way of expressing memories that otherwise seem dangerous. Furthermore, Bosnian dark humour critiques not only the above themes, but simultaneously the social structures in place for discussing the past. Erecting an ironic ‘Monument to the International Community’ that will be discussed later in this article, can function as a comment on both the form and content of that community’s involvement in the Bosnian conflict; these uses of humour can therefore serve as very powerful criticism of both the Bosnian past and present.</p>
<p>In this way, it is a form of <italic>counter-memory</italic>; this is the Foucauldian idea that memory can be used to speak truth to power, or to challenge dominant interpretations of the past that seek to oppress or repress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698011415247">Foucault, 1977</xref>). Memory scholars have generally used this and similar concepts when talking about peoples trying to assert previously silenced narratives in the face of oppressive histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011415247">Brantner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1750698011415247">Tachibana 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1750698011415247">Young, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1750698011415247">Zur, 1999</xref>; among many others). Usually such work focuses on uncovering a literal truth; I argue that dark humour is about countering with a figurative truth. In the next section, I explain why many Bosnians reject the more usual forms of counter-memory, and choose alternative mechanisms such as humour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750698011415247">6</xref></sup> I then analyse examples of this by drawing on cultural phenomena such as the 2001 Danis Tanović film <italic>No Man’s Land</italic> and recent Bosnian monuments, as well as oral history interviews that I conducted in the north-western region of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2005–06, around the Bihać area, which was mostly under siege during the war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750698011415247">7</xref></sup> These interviews discussed not only the substance of the historical events in question, but also both their public and private meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750698011415247">Portelli, 1990</xref>), and they encouraged interviewees to interpret their own memories along with me as part of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698011415247">Greenspan, 2010</xref>). Humorous jokes and anecdotes emerged spontaneously from seemingly innocuous questions, such as ‘why did the war happen?’ and ‘what was life like during the war?’ This spontaneity was part of what convinced me that something important was happening when my interviewees laughed. Due to the current fragmented nature of the country, as will be described in the following section, my examples focus primarily on humour coming out of the Federation side of Bosnia-Herzegovina, meaning that it tends to represent the Bosnian/Bosniak view of the war, even though it is perpetuated by all three ethnicities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1750698011415247">8</xref></sup> It should also be noted that most of the humour described in this article refers to life under siege, or life at war; I have found very few jokes specifically about the genocidal aspects of the Bosnian conflict. This is not to say that humour about such episodes does not exist – the example of Holocaust humour shows that it certainly is possible – but it is not surprising that it would be rarer, taboo or less likely to be discussed with an outsider such as myself, especially as the Bosnian genocide is not so far behind us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1750698011415247">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Violence, memory and laughter in Bosnia-Herzegovina</title>
<p>While Bosnian dark humour obviously predates the 1990s, the prevalent use of humour as a form of cultural resistance during the war has clearly inspired the post-conflict context. When Sarajevo was under siege during the Bosnian War, from 1992 to 1995, artists, journalists and other actors produced a remarkable amount of cultural resistance, in the form of theatre, festivals, posters, books and other artwork. While these efforts have been thoroughly documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">FAMA, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698011415247">FAMA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1750698011415247">Sarhandi and Boboc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1750698011415247">Sontag, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1750698011415247">Zelizer, 2003</xref>), and admired as a way of resisting the violent attempt to destroy Bosnian culture, few have commented on the fact that much of this resistance was funny.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1750698011415247">10</xref></sup> Published by a collective of journalists and artists during the siege, the <italic>Sarajevo Survival Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">FAMA, 1993</xref>) is perhaps the most iconic example of humorous cultural resistance, and it is still sold widely on the streets of Sarajevo. It is a mock tourist’s guidebook to besieged Sarajevo, which covers all of the relevant topics, such as: dining, featuring recipes for dishes made with paltry UN rations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">1993</xref>: 20–7); souvenirs, in the form of shrapnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">1993</xref>: 38); recreation, including running from sniper fire and ‘urban rock-climbing’ to access one’s apartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">1993</xref>: 51); transportation, wherein buses, trams and taxis simply ‘do not exist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">1993</xref>: 58); and out of town excursions, wherein it is explained that, ‘officially, there is no such thing as “going out of town”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">1993</xref>: 79). Stephenson argues that ‘the guide does not rely so much on its gallows humor to score points, but on the cumulative effect of the whole absurd gesture. Sometimes, just the sheer honesty of a statement cuts through the gimmick with a force that leaves one with seemingly no conceivable response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1750698011415247">1994</xref>: 96). Indeed, the guide’s tongue-in-cheek preface explains just how serious it is:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a chronicle, a guide for survival, a part of a future archive which shows the city of Sarajevo not as a victim, but as a place of experiment where wit can still achieve victory over terror, the (sur)real ‘The Day After’, contemporary [science fiction], the scene of factual ‘Mad Max 5’. This book was written at the site where one civilisation was dismantled in the course of intentional violence, and where another one had to be born, the one of the 21st Century. It is the picture of civilisation that emerges out of cataclysm, which makes something out of nothing, gives some messages for the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">FAMA, 1993</xref>: Preface)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The guidebook authors argue that there were, and continue to be, two reasons to make fun of life in wartime Sarajevo: to assert the spirit of the Bosnian people in the face of their annihilation, and, by taking things to their logical conclusion, to point out just how severe the siege, the war, and their consequences for contemporary understandings of humanity, were. They explicitly position the book as a <italic>weapon</italic> against violence. What is especially interesting is that this book was translated into English and is continually printed and sold in both languages, even 15 years after the war; what is its meaning now? Does it intend to convey different meanings to its Serbo-Croat and English-speaking audiences? If during the war, it was an act of resistance against the threat of the physical annihilation of Bosnian society and culture, now it is a testament to how that threat is being understood and remembered.</p>
<p>Why spread these messages through humour, though? While the literature discussed in the previous section makes some useful generalizations about the power and utility of humour, one needs also to examine the Bosnian context. First, as has also been argued regarding Jewish comedy about the Holocaust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1750698011415247">Rosen, 2004</xref>), humour is a mechanism indigenous to the Balkans. As the Tanović quote that opens this article suggests, Bosnians are proud of their sense of humour and see it as a legitimate form of communication. Second, the 20th-century trajectory of remembering in the region has created an atmosphere in which open discussions of the past are seen as dangerous and unproductive, compelling Bosnians to find new ways to communicate.</p>
<p>From the beginning of its inception at the height of the Second World War, The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) employed history and collective memory as an explicit tool in its construction; this approach has left a permanent mark on the region. While the Yugoslav brand of communism is seen as having been considerably more open and less repressive than Soviet-style communism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698011415247">Crampton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750698011415247">Malcolm, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1750698011415247">Ramet, 2006</xref>), the rule of Josip Broz Tito from the end of the war until his death in 1980 was marked by a particular interest in controlling the ways in which the history of his Yugoslavia would be written, by highlighting foundational myths of the Yugoslav state, such as inter-ethnic cooperation, and downplaying memories of ethnic violence that were a major part of how the Second World War was actually experienced in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011415247">Banac, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011415247">Bet-El, 2002</xref>). These myths were important not only for the state’s legitimacy, but also for creating ‘Yugoslavism’, an all-encompassing identity that erased ethnic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011415247">Allcock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750698011415247">Pavković, 1999</xref>). After Tito’s death, revisionist historians revived the ugliest episodes of the Second World War in order to make nationalist arguments against the legitimacy of the Yugoslav state, and its multi-ethnic character in particular. This work was conducted by artists, historians, and politicians, such as the late nationalist presidents of Croatia and Serbia respectively, Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milošević (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011415247">Banac, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011415247">Bet-El, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011415247">Denich, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011415247">Djordjevich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1750698011415247">Ramet, 2005</xref>). This opening up of the previously forgotten past was a major element of the propaganda that led towards the wars and genocide that destroyed Yugoslavia. The Bosnian War began in April 1992 after a referendum in which Bosnians voted to secede from Yugoslavia, which was boycotted and then immediately contested by the alternative Bosnian Serb government. Fought on three sides, Bosnian/Bosniak forces fought the Bosnian Serb and Yugoslav armies over the status of the newly formed country; while the Croatian army initially backed the Bosnians, the conflict eventually fragmented into three sides. While ethnic cleansing was a grim feature of the various armies’ military strategies, Serb forces carried out a genocide against Bosniaks, which involved the liquidating of villages, concentration camps, massacres of non-combatants and mass rape. Over 100,000 people were killed during both the war and the genocide before it was stopped by the Dayton Accords in 1995.</p>
<p>What has resulted from this trajectory of both historical manipulation and extreme ethnic violence is that in the memories of the Bosnians I interviewed, the Titoist period, which silenced open discussion of the violent past, is associated with peace, while the post-Titoist period, in which previously suppressed narratives were unearthed, is associated with war. As one interviewee explained, quite bluntly, when asked about why he still subscribed to a Titoist narrative of Yugoslav history: ‘Of course the story was a lie. I think that we all know it was a lie. But what does it matter? It was a lie that worked. That is why I still believe it’ (Nenad, 2005). Post-conflict efforts to encourage Bosnians to speak openly about their pasts through institutional mechanisms such as truth commissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698011415247">Gisvold, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750698011415247">Minow, 1999</xref>) are struggling in this incompatible context. The problem is that contemporary liberal democratic language about truth as a liberating and healing force is precisely the same language that was co-opted by the revisionists before the war,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1750698011415247">11</xref></sup> a tendency that continues today. Western scholars struggle to see beyond their own understandings of post-conflict issues and how they should be managed, to how Bosnians themselves perceive their challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698011415247">Hayden, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The post-conflict context presents an additional quandary because Bosnia-Herzegovina is now fragmented physically, politically, socially and culturally. The Bosnia-Herzegovina that was created by the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995 split the country into two pieces – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is home primarily to Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks, and the Republika Srpska, which is home to Bosnian Serbs. These divisions, and the system set out by Dayton that enforces them, have made it difficult for the Bosnian state to function normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011415247">Cousens and Cater, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1750698011415247">Weller and Wolff, 2006</xref>); the central parliament remains constantly divided, the presidency is shared by the three ethnicities, and these splits add an excess of administration that not only perpetuates ethnic nationalism, but that also makes it more conducive to corruption and endless bureaucracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698011415247">Donais, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1750698011415247">Pugh, 2002</xref>). As an interviewee of Zhelyazkova’s explained, ‘In Tito’s time life was real, now we have democracy which means looting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1750698011415247">2004</xref>: 11). Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs in Bosnia have different banks, telephone service providers, beers, schools, media, alphabets. The divisions carry through the very minutiae of everyday life in almost absurd ways. This also means that they have three different truths that cannot agree on even the smallest details of what happened during the Bosnian War. Top-down ethnic narratives of the war all feed into a given ethnicity’s nationalist sense of identity. As Esma explained, ‘what am I supposed to say to someone who tells me that we were shelling ourselves?’ (2006).</p>
<p>Idealistic ideas about counter-memory consisting of literal truth speaking to power do not seem particularly implementable considering both the current ethnic fragmentation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the above historiographic trajectory. This is where humour comes in. It not only avoids the quandary of appealing to literal ‘truth’, that nefarious tool employed by propagandists, but it is also able to take a step back, and comment saliently on the dynamics described above.</p>

<title>Laughing at ourselves</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have these sayings that we say about each other, what all of our weaknesses are, I guess. So we will say things like that Montenegrins are lazy, and there is a joke: how do you hide something from a Montenegrin? Put it under a shovel. In the same way, Bosnians are stupid. How do you hide something from a Bosnian? Put it in a book. These are old jokes that we all make about each other, we are just joking, but you know, when I look at how this happened to us, we were so naive, we allowed ourselves to be slaughtered like this because we did not believe it could happen, I wonder … I think maybe these jokes are really a little bit true. I think maybe we are a little bit stupid, that’s how all of this happened. (Alen, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Popular discourse on the Bosnian War has often emphasized Bosnian ignorance of the idea that conflict was imminent; Bosnians felt that they were a model of Yugoslavism, and thus they were unprepared for ethnic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011415247">Donia and Fine, 1995</xref>). While some have questioned accounts that portray Bosnians, particularly Bosniaks, as completely naive and unaware of the impending violence, arguing that this contributes to Bosniak narratives that focus too singularly on their total victimhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011415247">Miller, 2006</xref>), this theme is nevertheless extremely present in humour about the war. This humour pokes fun at Bosniaks for being so stupid as to allow themselves to be murdered so easily. In jokes such as the one cited above, Alen does not brag about his innocence; rather, he seems to express shame about it. Holocaust scholars have devoted considerable attention to the phenomenon of ‘Holocaust guilt’, referring not only to guilt about having survived, but of struggling to remember and interpret one’s lack of resistance to Nazi oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698011415247">Felman and Laub, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750698011415247">Langer, 1991</xref>). To admit that one perhaps allowed oneself to be victimized, and one’s family and loved ones to be displaced or murdered, is to admit an incredible amount of weakness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750698011415247">Pirandello (1966)</xref> mused that humour emerged at the intersection of what human beings aspire to be, and the reality of what they actually are, saying that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While a sociologist describes social life as he objectively observes it, the humorist, armed with his sharp intuition, shows and reveals how appearances are vastly different from what goes on in his associates’ unconscious. Indeed we lie psychologically just as we lie socially. Lying to ourselves by living consciously only on the surface of our psychological being is the result of the social lie. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750698011415247">1966</xref>: 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alen’s jokes seem to be situated precisely in that intersection.</p>
<p>The excerpt from the <italic>Sarajevo Survival Guide</italic> cited in the previous section similarly avoids victimhood, in this case by subverting it and reclaiming the activities of citizens in a besieged city as having different meanings. As this article’s opening quote from Alma suggests, many interviewees, when asked what they talk about when they remember the war among their family and friends, refer to ‘funny stories’. Alen, too, told me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We talk a lot about funny things that happened to us. How some neighbour went to plug in electricity into the building of the police department, because they had electricity during the war, and how they caught him on the roof, and they took him to the prison, and they were laughing at him. I guess we talk about that kind of stuff, mostly. (Alen, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While such anecdotes are not as obviously political as others, they nevertheless relate to the approach of the <italic>Sarajevo Survival Guide</italic>, of making something funny out of something tragic, and thereby subverting one’s victimhood. They demonstrate ingenuity in the face of deprivation, but they do not fall into the trap of claiming some sort of heroism; we are still making fun here. These stories position Bosnians as neither victims nor heroes, allowing them to avoid the traps of dominant narratives in the region that try to push them into one or both of those roles. Furthermore, contrary to the Hobbesian notion that humour asserts dominance, Bosnian self-mockery shows quite the opposite; humour is found in laughing about how one is inferior, and in finding non-threatening ways to express one’s foibles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1750698011415247">Solomon, 2002</xref>). This can also be found in laughter at how ethnic narratives are being unproductively perpetuated in the present day. <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>, Danis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović’s 2001</xref> film about the Bosnian War, depicts three soldiers, one Serb and two Bosnians, who are trapped between the two armies’ front lines. One of the Bosnians, Cera, is immobilized on a bouncing landmine that will explode if he attempts to get up, and it is the slow lack of resolution of this issue that keeps these men in the same space for the duration of the film. While much of the film is a commentary on how the conflict irreparably damaged Bosnia, and on the international community’s ineptitude there, there are various moments that poke fun at Bosnians themselves. For example, in one scene, two Bosnian soldiers are sitting watch at their front line. Listening to the radio, one soldier exclaims, ‘Ooh.’ ‘What is it?’ the second one replies. ‘Ooooh,’ the first soldier repeats. ‘What’s wrong?’ asks the second one. ‘Fuck!’ mutters the first one. ‘What?’ replies the second soldier, frustrated at this point. Finally, the first soldier replies, ‘Did you see … Such a mess in Rwanda!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>). Such a use of irony only highlights the foolishness of the soldier, of how one can be right in the middle of a violent mess and still not realize one’s predicament.</p>
<p>There is obviously something hilarious about a Bosnian soldier on the front lines of his bloody and similarly genocidal conflict pitying Rwanda. The scene satirizes those often-repeated stories of how Bosnians sat and waited while the war approached, naively expecting to be safe. Zoran describes the expectation that the war would not reach his hometown of Bihać by saying:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know what, it’s amazing, I’m going to tell you a story. The war started in Croatia, we were so passive about it. The war started in Slovenia, we were so passive about it, we were telling that it’s not going to come to Bosnia, this is unbelievable, it’s just happening for a day or two and it’s going to stop, and then the war continued in Croatia – the shelling, the dead people, the killing civilians, tanks, guns all around, towns destroyed, and we were still like … we still believed that it’s not going to come to Bosnia. And then the war started in Bosanska Krupa, it’s like … 25 kilometres from Bihać, and we were singing songs about Yugoslavia in Bihać, about Yugoslavia! And that same Yugoslav Army was attacking … Muslims and Croats in Bosanska Krupa. And all of a sudden, war came to Bihać … And we still, I remember the first day of war, I was in a shelter, in the basement, with many of my neighbours, and we still talked about how it’s going to pass in a couple of days, this is just … we were just misunderstanding, you know. But it didn’t, it lasted for three and a half years. We were so passive here …. People were so passive … (Zoran, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tanović mocks this blindness by taking it even further; even at the front lines, as an active participant in the conflict, our soldier does not understand that Bosnians have little to pity about Rwandans. He is not fully aware of what he is part of. Rather than glorifying Bosnian victimhood or naïveté in the war, this humour critiques it. Bosnians are foolish, rather than noble. This self-critique also demonstrates a cynicism that feeds into a Bosnian sense of cosmopolitanism, avoiding overly sentimental narratives and asserting a self-aware intelligence that counteracts their image as downtrodden masses without agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1750698011415247">12</xref></sup> Because this is an act of laughing at one’s own naiveté or stupidity, this self-aware use of ironic humour serves to make present-day Bosnians, laughing at themselves, regain their dignity and intelligence.</p>
<p>Tanović does not just mock Bosnian naïveté, though. In another scene, the two mobile soldiers who are stuck in no man’s land, Čiki and Nino, descend into an argument about who started the war; what begins as a tense and worrying exchange escalates into juvenile taunting, as both men shout at each other <italic>ad nauseum</italic>, ‘Who started the war? You started it!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">2001</xref>). The ways in which the various Bosnian ethnic groups have, and continue to, shape their own narratives of the war are reduced to childish bickering. The situation is only resolved when Čiki, the Bosnian, points his rifle at Nino and forces him to confess that the Serbs started the war. This meta-commentary therefore problematizes not only Bosnian narratives of their role in the war, but also the divisive and almost arbitrary context in which they are formed; it is in some ways more incisive than scholarly critiques of these narratives have been. As Cera, who acts as a Greek chorus throughout the film, eventually declares, ‘Who cares who started it? We’re all in the same shit now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>). This is both literally true of the circumstance in which the three soldiers find themselves, and figuratively true of the reality of post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is politically unstable and impoverished. As Alen told me, ‘I don’t need to remember the past. I need a job!’ a statement on which he elaborated by joking, ‘I personally don’t freakin’ care who is a Muslim, who is a Serb, who is a Croat. Let us work. Let us earn money. Let us make kids!’ (2006). Both Cera and Alen are saying that this obsession with proving who did what to whom is arbitrary, and is distracting Bosnians from the mess in which they currently find themselves.</p>
<p>By laughing at themselves, then, Bosnians are able to address several things. First, they can explore feelings of shame and foolishness about their role in the war, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011415247">Freud’s (1938)</xref> ideas about humour as a way to express taboo ideas. Second, they can subvert or reinvent what it means to have been a ‘victim’ in the war, particularly around stories of life under siege where one literally could not act. Finally, they are able to point out the ways in which their own public narratives about the war are contributing to Bosnia’s continued instability. Laughter here serves as both relief and critique. It paints Bosnian actors as self-aware, cynical and cosmopolitan; they were passive during the war, but the post-conflict context affords them the possibility to counteract that reputation through humorous self-critique.</p>

<title>Laughing at the absurdity of war</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We were so skinny at the end of the war, I am saying sometimes that this was the biggest benefit of the war … we looked like movie stars. It is a good way to diet, when you are hiding in the basement and snipers are keeping food from getting to you. Maybe the Serbs did us a favour, they helped us control our appetites. (Mirela, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jokes about weight loss thanks to life under siege abound in Bosnia; there is an almost identical passage to Mirela’s remarks in the <italic>Sarajevo Survival Guide</italic>, which explains dryly that, ‘Sarajevo is a city of slender people. Its citizens could be authors of the most up-dated diets. No one is fat any longer. The only thing you need is to have your city under siege – there lies the secret of a great shape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">FAMA, 1993</xref>: 8). Why joke so much about getting skinny due to a war-imposed starvation diet, and why have these jokes persisted into the post-conflict landscape? As was suggested in previous sections, many Bosnians have had difficulty adjusting to the changing opinions they are supposed to have about their neighbours; in a short period of time, they were expected to go from being a ‘model’ Yugoslav society, to one in which the three ethnicities are at odds with each other. Playing around with the role of victim and aggressor in the above quotes blurs these divisions considerably. Furthermore, it once again subverts the idea of being victimized. It also mocks the perpetrator for having ‘[done] us a favour’, playing into a long legacy of ridiculing perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1750698011415247">Rosen, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1750698011415247">Wiesenthal (1990)</xref> muses that in the case of the Holocaust, humour could be a useful tool of rapprochement between victim and perpetrator, as a way of bridging distance, but that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it should sometimes be deliberately employed as a weapon: the neo-Nazis are best fought by making them look ridiculous. It should even be possible, in retrospect, to make figures like Hitler and Himmler objects not only of revulsion but also of ridicule. I cannot think of anything more ridiculous than that moustachioed Germanic dwarf with his tinted hair, who barked his speeches like a seal and then, like a string puppet, flung up his arm awkwardly and crookedly in the Hitler salute. One cannot nowadays watch film clips of his big speeches without laughing. (1989: 407)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Does humour about wartime weight loss cause a rapprochement by blurring categories, or does it ridicule the enemy, taking away their power? The latter seems more likely, as these jokes do little to comfort the enemy; the blurring seems to happen more to comfort themselves. It does nevertheless make the perpetrator look impotent and silly, although what is unique about Bosnian humour is that one rarely takes a shot at the other without laughing at oneself at the same time. This is certainly evident in <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>, which, while clearly a film with Bosniak sympathies, portrays both sides as equally ridiculous, even if the Serbs, by planting the landmine under Cera, appear more nefarious.</p>
<p>The most important factor in this and other humour about the war, though, is the use of absurdity. Freud explains that nonsense humour ‘consists in advancing something apparently absurd or nonsensical which, however, discloses sense that serves to illustrate and represent some other actual absurdity and nonsense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011415247">1938</xref>: 665). Pirandello similarly argues that humour demonstrates that ‘the pretense of logic is much greater in us than real logical coherence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750698011415247">1966</xref>: 50). As elaborated previously, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698011415247">Kant (1951)</xref> and Schopenhauer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1750698011415247">1966</xref>) similarly see humour as emerging essentially out of the conflict between logic and absurdity. The sieges of several Bosnian cities, including Sarajevo and Bihać, where Mirela was located during the war, <italic>were</italic> ridiculous. By taking such ridiculousness to its logical conclusion and emphasizing it with humour, one highlights the real seriousness of its ‘actual absurdity’. The humour of <italic>No Man’s Land</italic> has been described by film critics as <italic>Beckettian</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698011415247">Gibbons, 2002</xref>), and compared both to <italic>Waiting for Godot</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1750698011415247">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698011415247">Ebert, 2003</xref>) and <italic>Endgame</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698011415247">Gonzales, 2001</xref>), because it darkly and unrelentingly laughs at the absurdity of human actions. In one scene, Čiki and Nino bond over having known the same beautiful (Bosniak) girl in Banja Luka, a reminiscence that is quickly broken when Nino comments that she went ‘abroad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>). Such a moment only reminds the characters, and the viewer, how ridiculous it is for people so close to each other to be pointing guns at one another.</p>
<p>Bosnian absurd humour is at its best when discussing the reasons for the war and its aftermath. In <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>, the previously discussed act of one soldier pointing a gun at the other and forcing them to do something they do not want to do ‘because I have a gun and you don’t’ punctuates the film. When Nino manages to find a gun so that he can counter Čiki’s dominance, he quips, ‘There, we’re equal now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>). These sardonic remarks create a nihilistic metaphor for the meaning of the Bosnian War; it is about who holds the gun, and nothing more. Again, they betray an intelligent, cosmopolitan self-awareness that counters one’s actually having participated in such a corrupt and morally bankrupt war. Nowhere in the film does anyone confess a more profound reason for this violence, or for why one ethnicity’s narrative of why they are at war is truer than the other’s. In my own oral history work, interviewees would stumble when asked why the war happened. This is not a straightforward question to answer, and 15 years after the war, it is even less clear. Mirela explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, what it was really about, it started for one thing, and it ended with completely ten thousand different things that weren’t even in people’s minds when it started. I guess, it started with … the thought that it was going to finish so soon … it was going to finish as soon as some goal that some people wanted to pursue … and it ended in a complete mess. People were not even aware that it ended, in the way it ended. It is really complicated to comprehend it. Because … when you see the beginning of the war, it was … it was just one thing, and in the end, it turned out to be like ten thousand different things in my mind, and it is not really clear, like, I do not know, I am still not clear on that, I think it is going to take years and years. (2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What does it mean, after a war, a genocide, and over 100,000 casualties; after a country is completely divided and restructured upon ethnic lines; after over a decade of an experiment in democracy that remains shaky and uncertain; to still not know what the war, this thing that unleashed all this instability, was about? Such a confusion can only be described as absurd. Alen similarly mused:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Why did it happen? I wouldn’t say it was started by the loonies. It was started because certain goals had to be accomplished. And the certain goals were that one nation should prevail, and all other nations should be down in the mud, and they should be manipulated with. And that idea didn’t work, that idea did not even work in World War II. That idea will not work ever. You cannot evaporate a nation. As long as you have five people, they are going to … make a soccer team again. Of eleven. I would not say that Milošević started it, that is definitely a … right answer, but I would not say he was a loony, he had a plan, but the plan was lunatic. The plan was loony. (2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even Alen’s impassioned and hopeful conviction that attempts to destroy a people are ‘lunatic’, and therefore a terrible basis on which to start a war, invokes humour. The resilience of a nearly destroyed people is summed up by saying that they will ‘make a soccer team again’. Laughing about how obvious it is that people will find each other and resist attempts to annihilate them only points out how stupid the plan was to begin with. Mirela cannot comprehend the reasons for going to war, and Alen thinks they are ‘actual nonsense’.</p>
<p>This confusion and absurdity extends towards the present day; not only was the <italic>raison d’être</italic> of the war nonsense, but the resulting cultural and political landscape is too. During one interview, Emir joked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I saw these images of Biljana Plavšić<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1750698011415247">14</xref></sup> being transferred to prison in Sweden, it looked so nice! It was like a palace. And I looked around at my small apartment that is falling down and I thought to myself, this is how I can get a nicer place to live … maybe I can kidnap some people and hold them hostage for a few days and then I could be sent to the tribunal and then maybe I would have a nice place to live. It makes a lot of sense, no? I don’t have a job or anything to do here, maybe Sweden would be nice. (Emir, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Issues of joblessness and poor living conditions are popular topics for this sort of joking. In the above case, Emir is referencing the idea that many Bosnians perceive that war criminals have been afforded better lifestyles than they have, by virtue of being imprisoned in the West, where even punitive accommodation is more luxurious than living as they do in cramped apartments or houses that are only half-built, because of a lack of funds. It also hints at the reality that even within Bosnia, those who emerged as successful politicians and public figures after the war were those who had profited from it, while ordinary people remain disempowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750698011415247">Jansen, 2006</xref>). Here is another aspect of the Bosnian War that is ‘actual nonsense’: the guilty parties – both perpetrators and war profiteers – have been able to live better after the war than ordinary citizens. Indeed, maybe Sweden would be nice.</p>
<p>Finally, the war was absurd because it accomplished nothing; it tore a country apart and left everyone worse off than where they began. This is in contrast to narratives, as were described in a previous section, of the Second World War as having been productive, because it brought about Titoist Yugoslavia and Yugoslavism. Vanja told me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What was the war about? … You know the Eurovision song contest? In Yugoslavia we took the song contest very seriously. We love music here, we love Eurovision, but it is very, very difficult to win, especially when countries are making alliances with each other, voting is not fair. I think that Milošević and Karadžić and all these men … really they are great lovers of music, and they wanted to give Yugoslavia more chances to win the contest. Now we have so many entries in the contest … Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, soon even Montenegro, it is really a service that Milošević provided us, to be able to display our musical talents in so many different ways … This is a joke, a joke … But it is a better answer than the real answer, it is possible. It makes more sense. (Vanja, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Laughing about why the war happened, what it meant, and where it left the Bosnian people gives us ‘a better answer than the real answer’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1750698011415247">15</xref></sup> At least, were the war to have resulted in an excellent strategy for winning more song competitions, it would have accomplished something. Making one’s invented accomplishment one that is so ridiculously minute only further demonstrates how impoverished the real results of the war were. In the opening scene of <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>, a local man tentatively guides a relief unit of Bosnian soldiers through the fog, where they eventually fall asleep for the night, only to wake up to find themselves only metres away from the Serbian front line. Their immediate slaughter is what kicks off the action – or purposeful lack thereof – of the film. Čiki utters the film’s very first words of dialogue by saying, ‘Fuck me if he knows where we are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>).</p>

(Dina, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dina’s cynicism echoes Vanja’s in the previous section; however, while Vanja hinted at the guilt of the international community in his words, Dina takes it even further. The role of the international community before, during and after the Bosnian War has been controversial. It is accused of having crippled the Bosnian military by enforcing an arms embargo in the early days of the war; of having been complicit in the slaughter of civilians through the shoddily set-up United Nations (UN) ‘safe areas’, of which the most infamous example is Srebrenica; of having failed to protect refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) and to deliver necessary humanitarian aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011415247">Corwin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1750698011415247">Rieff, 1995</xref>). The American-facilitated Dayton Accords ended the war by rewarding aggression and fragmenting the country into its currently unsustainable structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011415247">Cousens and Cater, 2001</xref>). The ICTY failed in its initial purpose of stopping the violence through legal mechanisms during the war, and has brought few of the major players to justice in its aftermath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011415247">Hazan, 2004</xref>), as well as being disconnected and unresponsive to Bosnian concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011415247">Delpla, 2007</xref>). Current international involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not only complicit in creating a dependent state that cannot function on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011415247">Bugajski, 2000</xref>), but has also mismanaged the millions of dollars that it poured into the country’s reconstruction, only furthering Bosnia’s problems with corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1750698011415247">Weller and Wolff, 2006</xref>). Dina’s joke refers to the last item on this laundry list of crimes. The international organizations that were meant to help fix the country have only further corrupted it; no wonder, then, that one might choose to laugh rather than turn to institutional solutions set up by the international community.</p>
<p>On the international community’s guilt in the war, we return to the opening scenes of <italic>No Man’s Land</italic>. Before planting the bouncing landmine underneath Cera, who is wrongly presumed to be dead, the nefarious Serbian soldier who performs this perverse act examines the mine lovingly, and exclaims: ‘Look at it: Made in EU.’ This goes further than accusing the international community of not doing enough, but rather paints it as complicit. Following from this indictment, much of the movie buffoons the UN chain of command, wherein the higher one goes, the less impetus there is for actually intervening in the chaos of the war. General Soft, the British commander in charge of the UN mission, is both cruelly indifferent and completely ridiculous; he reacts to the German de-mining expert’s eventual news that he will not be able to deactivate the bouncing mine by instructing him to ‘Get back into the trench. Pretend to be busy.’ At the end of the film, after both Čiki and Nino have killed each other, and it is clear that Cera will be left to die on the mine, Soft commends the implicated UN soldiers by telling them, ‘good work gentlemen, I’m very pleased. I have no doubt that in the fullness of time you will be duly compensated’; to underscore the painful callousness of these remarks, the viewer sees Cera listening to this exchange. The UN is literally portrayed as ‘pretending to be busy’, and as being satisfied with such a role in the war. It saves not a single human life in this predicament. The British journalist in the film, who is portrayed as voraciously seeking the truth to the point of self-righteousness, is not spared; Čiki’s final words before being killed in a shootout with Nino are directed towards her: ‘And you vultures film it? You get good money? Does our misery pay well?’ These moments come together to form a dark commentary on the international community’s role in the Bosnian War, concerned more about public and political opinion, as well as advancing their own careers, than saving lives. It is in line with the thinkers cited earlier who see humour as something cruel and full of melancholy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750698011415247">Koestler, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698011415247">Farb, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750698011415247">Pirandello, 1966</xref>); one laughs at these depictions with discomfort, as they relentlessly mock the darkest human tendencies in war. As the de-mining expert explains, after inspecting Cera and determining that there is nothing that he can do to save him, ‘This man is already dead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1750698011415247">Tanović, 2001</xref>). Tanović suggests in an interview that contemporary Bosnia-Herzegovina is ‘like the man on the mine … waiting to explode’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698011415247">Fischer, 2002</xref>). Thus, the international community plays an integral role in condemning Bosnians to their cruel fate.</p>
<p>One can also find such a sardonic view of the international community in recent Bosnian monuments. In April 2007, on the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the Bosnian War, artist Nebojsa Serić Soba erected a monument with the help of the Sarajevo Centre for Contemporary Art in a square in the centre of Sarajevo, with a pedestal that read, ‘Monument to the International Community, from the Grateful Citizens of Sarajevo’. The monument consists entirely of a giant can of spam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750698011415247">Figure 1</xref>). As a representative of the centre explained, ‘The Ikar canned beef is remembered by the people of Sarajevo with disgust. Cats and dogs did not want to eat it and people had to … Everybody agreed that we should do the project in this way. It’s witty, ironic and artistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1750698011415247">Reuters UK, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the spam monument subverts colonialist notions of a people being ‘grateful’ for the assistance they received by focusing on its inadequacy, which is demonstrated through a very literal depiction of what that assistance entailed. What did the international community contribute to Bosnia? Spam.</p>

<p>What is especially interesting about this monument is how it serves a dual purpose: it ridicules both the UN’s humanitarian assistance during the war, and the internationally influenced project of post-war commemoration. It is also not the first tongue-in-cheek monument to appear in the former Yugoslavia. In 2005, the divided city of Mostar erected a monument to Bruce Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750698011415247">Herscher, 2011</xref>), and, in 2007, the Serbian town of Zitiste erected a monument to the fictional character of Rocky in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750698011415247">Jovanovic, 2007</xref>). These artefacts are of course western-looking in their depiction of iconic Hollywood personalities; this is an aspect of the western world that is appreciated by many Bosnians. They also imply that these figures are the most easily agreed upon ‘heroes’ worth commemorating, contrary to the more expected subjects of commemoration, such as wartime military commanders or politicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1750698011415247">16</xref></sup> Finally, they betray a sarcastic rejection of the post-war project of commemoration and public remembering that has been promoted and institutionalized by the international community, through NGOs engaging in civil society projects, and through bodies such as the ICTY and American calls for a truth commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750698011415247">Kritz and Finci, 2001</xref>). They therefore get to the heart of the use of humour in Bosnian remembering by rejecting conventional means of representing the past and subverting them. They offer a meta-narrative that reflects on the story behind the mnemonic options that have been put forward. Expanding on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1750698011415247">Young’s (1993)</xref> exploration of memorial possibilities, these are both ‘counter-monuments’ and counter to the idea of monuments. They are possibly the best example of humour as alternative political action; subverting public space, the spam monument is in constant, visible opposition to the international community’s narrative of what it accomplished, and continues to accomplish, in Bosnia. Its irony is relentless. It beats the international community at its own game.</p>
<p>Bosnian humour that addresses the international community is mocking and sometimes spiteful, echoing ideas about humour as aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698011415247">Kant, 1951</xref>), and as ‘joy mixed with hate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698011415247">Farb, 1981</xref>: 771). As Payne suggests, the humour involved in <italic>No Man’s Land</italic> and the spam monument ‘[exposes] failed efforts to bring truth, justice, and reconciliation for past crimes … [and] builds solidarity among an opposition, subverts government authority, and demands justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750698011415247">2005</xref>: 70). The ‘Monument to the International Community, From the Grateful Citizens of Sarajevo’ therefore makes the perfect punch line to this discussion of humour; it is a self-referential monument to the content, processes and structures that influence and complicate Bosnian wartime remembering.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a consequence of their complex relationships with their histories of violence, both ordinary and artistically inclined Bosnians are interested in remembering and speaking about the past inasmuch as that remembering can be understood as productive. Many found this utility in Titoist narratives of the Second World War, but they have not found it in recent local, national or international narratives of the Bosnian War. They therefore turn to alternative ways of speaking about and remembering the past, such as humour. Humour is not the only way to speak about the Bosnian War, nor is it the only way to counter dominant narratives about it. However, it is a powerful and often used tool that has not been given enough consideration by Balkan and memory scholars. The examples discussed in this article demonstrate that Bosnian ways of laughing at the war get to the heart of the major themes that come up in discussions of Bosnian memory: the negotiation of victimhood, the absurdity and futility of the war and the controversial role of the international community within it. Furthermore, they address these themes from the angle of intelligent, self-aware social commentary that positions Bosnians as cosmopolitan citizens of the world, rather than hapless victims, allowing them a more empowered stance from which to negotiate how they want to be seen by the world, and how they want to see themselves. This humour therefore not only resists common characterizations of the war that feel humiliating and insulting, but it also completely subverts them.</p>
<p>What is also remarkable about these examples is how their different iterations – from oral history interviews with citizens of small towns with little to no political affiliation to academy-award nominated films – demonstrate that humour is present as a way of speaking about the violent past across Bosnian society. While many ordinary Bosnians remain sceptical and disaffiliated from many top-down political ways of speaking about the war, as described earlier in the article, humour transcends the tension between the top-down and bottom-up; everyone finds ways to laugh about the war and its aftermath, and a young woman in Bihać tells the same joke about wartime weight-loss as artists and journalists in Sarajevo once did. Humour is able to transcend boundaries that more straightforward political discourse cannot as easily penetrate, because it is not as fraught. In my interviews, young people, old people, men, women, politicized and non-politicized interviewees all told jokes about the war. It was a common element found where few others could be; as Alma mentions in one of the quotes that opens this article, humorous anecdotes can serve as a form of bonding among people who have survived similar things. It can build a sense of camaraderie and solidarity where such dynamics are lacking. I therefore wonder if humour could also be a means of bridging gaps between the still divided ethnic communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where earnest discussions of violence have thus far failed. Can it create a space not just to talk openly about the past, but subsequently to move understandings of what Bosnia-Herzegovina is forward as various citizens struggle to create a Bosnian state that is coherent and functioning?</p>
<p>Scholars who are interested in how speaking about the past can be used to mend broken societies must think beyond literal approaches to truth-telling; this tendency is overly narrow and betrays our cultural biases. We miss a lot when we overlook phenomena such as humour in our studies of post-conflict remembering. This article shows that there is much to be gained by thinking as broadly as possible about what speaking about the violent past consists of. Memory scholars have often commented on the reality that memory is complex and non-linear; therefore, when asking how people remember, we should be looking towards diverse iterations of memory, of which humour is a prime example. Humour sheds important light on how Bosnians are negotiating the post-war landscape, as their jokes blur the lines between what happened in the war, how those events are being remembered in the present, and how the present is affecting their perspectives on the past. Where wartime humour, as demonstrated by the example of the <italic>Sarajevo Survival Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011415247">FAMA, 1993</xref>), represented an immediate resistance to actual violence, post-conflict humour becomes even more complex, crossing temporal lines and blurring the boundaries between past and present. When Tanović describes Bosnia-Herzegovina as the man on the mine, he is invoking both the war and its aftermath; he is therefore critiquing the Bosnian predicament before, during and after the conflict. As such, this humour is complex and worthy of serious consideration, as are other alternative ways of speaking about the past.</p>
<p>Humour is also sophisticated and politically engaged; it is a legitimate means of speaking truth to power. Humour is a form of resistance. The emotional and figurative truth of the humour discussed in this article moves discussions of Bosnian memory forward beyond their usual tropes. Studying humour allows us to focus on the resilience and intelligence of the Bosnian people, and to experience some much-needed relief in the face of truly terrible historical events. As Tanović suggests in the quote that opens this article, ‘it eases up certain things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698011415247">Fischer, 2002</xref>).</p>
