<p>In their book <italic>American Urban Form: A Representative History</italic>, Sam Bass Warner and Andrew H. Whittemore explore transitions in urban form via a generalized city in the northeastern United States. This brief and accessible introduction to planning via the lens of historic urban fabric targets allied professionals and the general public. “We have written this book for two groups of people: citizens who are now concerned about the conditions of American urban living, and their allies … the professionals with whom they must work to preserve or alter these patterns to improve the places in which they live” (p. 1). Explorations of the social, economic, and political city are enhanced through representative bird’s-eye views and more detailed street drawings illustrating the hypothetical city, an amalgam of Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, as it grows from a colonial outpost in the seventeenth century to a bustling global city of the twenty-first century. This broad perspective, the authors argue, offers a means to understand the dynamics of change and better prepare for the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Though their strategy draws on the histories of these three cities to explore common urban “patterns and trends,” students of planning history familiar with these iconic places might find this composite metropolis somewhat disorienting at first as partial histories come together. Certainly, the role social and political forces have played in shaping specific cities from Reps’ <italic>The Making of Urban America </italic>to Kostof’s <italic>The City Shaped </italic>have already been explored. The challenge here is to depict the complexities of urban change while also relaying a common story of urban America that appeals to an engaged public and resonates with academics and practitioners.</p>
<p>To that end, the authors paint a vivid social, political, financial, and economic picture linked to broader global and national events and raise compelling questions about critical junctures in our country’s history. They see the city as always becoming. Unlike many urban histories, very few shapers of cities are specifically named; civic and business leaders, elites, architects, landscape architects, reformers, planners, all remain faceless alongside the larger numbers that also played a significant role—immigrants, African American slaves and migrants, and white rural migrants. In this way, the hypothetical city becomes an effective means to explore these themes and dynamics. Still, the reader is often reminded that it best reflects one in the Northeastern, or perhaps Midwestern, United States as the authors comment on such events as the migration of African Americans from the South during the early twentieth century or compare it to the growth of California and the South during the 1970s.</p>
<p>The book abruptly ends by noting the paradoxical constancy of urban change. And yet, there is enough currently occurring—the authors in fact allude to these dynamics at the book’s outset—for some discussion of possible near futures. Part of the Urban and Industrial Environments series, the book fails to mention certain key emerging environmental topics, most notably the impacts of environmental change, such as sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and/or subsidence, on urban infrastructure, enduring settlement patterns, and land economics (i.e., the role of property insurance). In addition to environmental change, how might ongoing global economic events shape the future of the city? Overall, these shortcomings are minor in this ambitious though relatively brief book that encapsulates many of the national, regional, and local dynamics that have shaped the US city as it grew into the modern metropolis it is today. Based on this, an additional target audience is indicated—the undergraduate student taking an introductory planning or urban studies course or even the beginning graduate student in these fields. Warner and Whittemore offer a solid foundation for future planners and anyone wanting to have a richer understanding of cities.</p>
