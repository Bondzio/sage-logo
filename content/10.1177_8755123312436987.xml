<abstract>
<p>Historically, music educators have expressed concerns about inadequate preparation to work with students with special needs, specifically desiring skills related to instruction adaptation. Research has indicated that educational supports (written words, color coding, icons, echoing, buddy system, and other visual aids) can be particularly successful for teaching students with special needs. To determine if preservice music teachers can employ these supports and determine which are most beneficial in various music settings, preservice music educators (<italic>N</italic> = 47) completed a 5-week field experience in which they taught general music concepts to secondary students with special needs incorporating educational supports. Participants rated the educational supports of echoing and icons most important when leading various activities to teach concepts in general music and predicted that the educational supports of echoing and other visual aids would be most important when teaching in various ensembles settings. For implementing assessments, participants rated icons and small groups or stations most important. Implications for preservice and in-service teachers are discussed.</p>

<p>Teacher academic preparation is a key component of the successful inclusion of students with special needs in music classes. Historically, undergraduate music education programs were not required to provide instruction related to teaching special learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312436987">National Association of Schools of Music, 2003</xref>), and for many years, music educators expressed feelings of inadequate preparation to address the needs of special learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312436987">Atterbury, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312436987">Frisque, Niebur &amp; Humphreys, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312436987">Gfeller, Darrow, &amp; Hedden, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8755123312436987">Gilbert &amp; Asmus, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312436987">Sideridis &amp; Chandler, 1995</xref>). In a somewhat more recent survey of music educators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312436987">Darrow (1999)</xref> learned that some have reservations about inclusions, yet most perceive inclusion to be beneficial for typically developing students as well as those with special needs. Still, they cited collaboration and communication with special educators, music therapists, and other related professionals; time for adaptation and integration planning; use of adaptive music and materials; and experience and education as some of the most critical factors related to successful inclusion of students with special needs. To prepare preservice teachers to meet the current challenges of their profession, many institutions offering undergraduate degrees in music education now require coursework to prepare students to work with special learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8755123312436987">Colwell &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312436987">Heller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312436987">Schmidt, 1989</xref>). Such coursework may incorporate field experiences with students with special needs, providing training related to each of those previously identified aspects of successful inclusion.</p>
<p>Initial research investigating field experiences for preservice music educators working with students with special needs found preservice teachers’ perceptions of music for the populations served become more positive following the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312436987">Kaiser &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>). Since that time, additional studies concerning secondary general music field experiences with students with special needs have been implemented to further investigate the effect of such field experiences in teacher training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>VanWeelden and Whipple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>) compared the effect of a field experience on music education majors’ attitudes and perceptions of music for secondary students with special needs within two subpopulations. Preservice teachers taught general music concepts twice weekly for 10 weeks within two self-contained middle school classrooms of students with special needs, who did not otherwise receive music education during the school day. One classroom contained students with emotional and behavior disorders (EDBD) and accompanying academic delays; the other classroom contained students with acute cognitive delays (ACD), such as autism, Down’s syndrome, and various severe learning disabilities. Results indicated that attitudes of the preservice teachers became more positive, both when interacting with persons with physical, mental, and emotional disabilities and when working with students with disabilities in music settings. The preservice teachers’ perceptions of educational preparation to work with students with special needs in music education settings was also rated significantly higher at the end of the field experiences.</p>
<p>VanWeelden and Whipple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>) also investigated the inclusion of alternative assessments with necessary testing accommodations in preservice music teacher special education field experiences. Preservice teachers’ predictions and perceptions of the level of mastery of specific music education concepts achieved by students within the two previously described EDBD and ACD classrooms, and actual grades earned by these students based on alternative assessments and testing accommodations were examined. The music education majors predicted that students within the EDBD class would achieve a significantly higher level of mastery of the music concepts than students within the ACD classroom. After the field experiences, however, the preservice teachers’ perceptions of all students’ level of mastery increased from their predictions. Additionally, preservice teachers were able to execute testing accommodations and implement successful alternative assessments, which provided empirical data on the students’ level of mastery of the music education concepts within the curriculum. However, there were no correlations among how the music education majors thought students would perform (predictions), how they thought the students did perform (perceptions), and how the students actually performed based on assessment data, indicating that preservice teachers cannot accurately determine student concept mastery without the benefit of formal assessment, and highlighting the importance of training in alternative assessment for the population of special learners.</p>
<p>Although results indicating improvement in preservice teacher perceptions, attitudes, and assessment skills following field experiences are encouraging, a specific preparation need cited by music educators is yet to be addressed: the acquisition of new skills and competencies related to instruction adaptation for students with special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312436987">Sideridis &amp; Chandler, 1995</xref>). To create a successful music experience for the preservice teachers and their students alike and provide preservice teachers experience implementing lesson and assessment adaptations, such educational supports were included in the curricula taught to students with special needs in the VanWeelden and Whipple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>) studies.</p>
<p>Based on experience working with students with developmental delays, emotional challenges, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, and other special needs in self-contained classes as well as inclusive or mainstreamed settings with typically developing peers, music educators, and music therapists, who are experts in addressing nonmusical goals with a variety of populations, including students with special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312436987">American Music Therapy Association, n.d.</xref>), also support incorporating a variety of sensory modes, including visual, aural, and kinesthetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312436987">Adamek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312436987">Cassidy, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312436987">Mazur, 2004</xref>), to create successful learning experiences for all students. This will likely involve adapting instruction to meet the needs of students through <italic>accommodations</italic> (additional supports whether in presentation, setting, time needed to complete the task, or type of response accepted, used when a student is capable of reaching the same level of participation or achievement as typically developing peers), <italic>modifications</italic> (a change in the standard of participation or achievement required, used when a student is not capable of completing the same task as typically developing peers), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312436987">Adamek &amp; Darrow, 2010</xref>).

<p>Music educators and therapists also recommend incorporating concrete educational supports in addition to adaptive teaching techniques. These include manipulative materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312436987">Mazur, 2004</xref>), which could include items such as actual music instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312436987">Hughes &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>); and visual aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312436987">Adamek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312436987">McLaughlin, 2006</xref>) in the form of pictures, graphs, charts, posters, and flash cards. In addition, color coding of visuals may enhance student comprehension and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312436987">Hughes &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>VanWeelden and Whipple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>) synthesized these adaptations in a comprehensive list of educational supports: written words, color coding, icons, echoing, buddy system, other visual aids, and small groups or stations for assessment. Furthermore, the researchers stressed those supports in all field experiences to equip preservice teachers with necessary teaching skills for working with students with special needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>). Not only do educational supports make learning possible for students with special needs but they may also facilitate progress toward nonmusical goals. The use of visuals, in general, is critical for development of both receptive and expressive language skills in students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312436987">McLaughlin, 2006</xref>). For example, literacy can be enhanced through the pairing of written words with auditory instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312436987">Hughes &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>), including pre-reading skills of left to right visual tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>), and the use of icons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312436987">McLaughlin, 2006</xref>), which are symbols representing words and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>Given previous concerns of music educators about their perceptions of inadequate preparation to work with special learners, it is important to identify those strategies that are most beneficial to beginning teachers in order to begin the task of ensuring adequate preparation of preservice teachers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate preservice music educators’ perceptions of educational supports for teaching students with special needs through the following specific research questions:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The participants (<italic>N</italic> = 47) were undergraduate music education majors at a large state university in the southeastern United States. All undergraduates were enrolled in a course titled “Assessment and Teaching Music: Secondary” during three separate semesters (Semester I, <italic>n</italic> = 15; Semester II, <italic>n</italic> = 15; Semester III, <italic>n</italic> = 17). This course is part of the undergraduate music education curriculum and enrolls students with emphases in choral, instrumental, and general music. Based on the university’s music education curriculum sequence, majors take all methods courses, including choral and instrumental conducting, prior to taking this course. The university course incorporated 5 weeks of a general music field experience working with secondary students with special needs (Monday and Friday for 30 minutes each day) following 10 weeks of in-class instruction (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 1 hour per day every week), which addressed song leading, World Drumming arrangements, music listening, world music and dance, and Western Art music microteaching; music composition activities; musical games; issues within secondary schools; and assessment and evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>In addition, the in-class portion incorporated instruction in effective secondary general music curriculum writing, whether to enhance or replace standard curriculum, or to make necessary adaptations for special learners, which is a necessary skill for music educators. This instruction covered selection of appropriate music concepts to teach, use and importance of educational supports (i.e., written words, color coding, icons, echoing, buddy system, other visual aids, and small groups or stations for assessment), and different lesson elements (or tasks) that should be included (i.e., singing, listening, instrument playing, composition, games, movement, cultural information, and informal evaluation and formal assessment) to allow for a variety of modes of learning and measurement.</p>
<sec id="section2-8755123312436987">
<title>Field-Based Experience</title>
<p>The field experience involved teaching music education concepts to middle school students with special needs in one self-contained classroom at a local middle school. The class consisted of students who exhibited cognitive delays, such as autism, Down’s syndrome, mental retardation, and extensive learning disabilities. A secondary general music curriculum created by the undergraduate students was the foundation of the field-based teaching experience. During the 2 weeks preceding the field experience, the preservice teachers determined the curricular goals and concepts to be addressed and then created the lessons to be taught on a weekly basis. Activities included the same types found within the in-class instruction portion of the course, and preservice teachers were encouraged to include a variety of lesson elements (or tasks) during each lesson, and to include each type of lesson element at least once during the 5-week field experience to ensure varied learning opportunities as well as preservice teaching experience with each type. In addition, preservice teachers were required to include a variety of educational supports in each lesson. Although the buddy system can involve peer, cross-age, or paraprofessional helpers, in this field experience, buddy system refers to the use of preservice teachers assisting individual students with special needs, rather than incorporating the use of peer helpers because of the level of deficits of the secondary students. In all three semesters, the curricula developed by the preservice teachers addressed different, yet comparable, general music concepts; incorporated different, yet comparable, music works; and included all lesson elements and educational supports previously discussed. Each semester, curricula were developed following the same course unit concerning effective secondary general music curriculum writing and received approval of the course instructor prior to implementation, ensuring each curriculum was equivalent in concept relevance, difficulty, and presentation format. The preservice teachers took turns leading lessons during each class period; at the end of the semester, each preservice teacher had taught during three class periods, leading multiple tasks each time, and assisted individual students with various music tasks during the 10 class periods.</p>

The survey required participants to rate on a scale of 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very</italic>) the importance of several educational supports (i.e., written words, color coding, icons, echoing, buddy system, other visual aids and small groups or stations for assessment) when teaching or leading a variety of music education tasks with students with special needs in general music and ensemble settings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8755123312436987">Figure 1</xref> for the Survey Instrument). The survey also included items that asked preservice teachers to evaluate the same supports as well as the use of small groups or stations for implementing assessments in general music and ensemble settings.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Educational supports were ranked within each general music and ensemble teaching element (or student task) based on means of ratings assigned by preservice teachers. In addition, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), followed by Tukey’s post hoc analyses, were used to identify significantly different mean perception scores of educational supports between teaching elements (or student tasks) within general music and ensemble settings.</p>
<sec id="section5-8755123312436987">
<title>Rankings of Educational Supports in General Music</title>
<p>Within general music settings, preservice teachers rated echoing and buddy system as the two most effective educational supports when implementing four of the six types of teaching activities: classroom cultural dance activities, classroom singing activities, classroom instrument playing activities, and movement to aid music concept acquisition. For music listening and musical game activities, however, those two supports were listed in the bottom half of the rankings and instead icons, other visual aids, and color coding were ranked as the top three. Furthermore, written words were perceived as the least or second least effective support when implementing all activities except classroom singing. In fact, when implementing movement to aid concept acquisition, preservice teachers rated all five other supports as significantly more effective than written words. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-8755123312436987">Table 1</xref> for a complete list of rankings by mean for educational supports for teaching concepts within secondary general music.</p>

<title>Significant Differences Among Educational Supports in General Music</title>
<p>One-way ANOVA results indicated significant differences among perceptions of educational supports for all general music teaching elements (or student tasks): cultural dance activities, <italic>F</italic>(46) = 26.496, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; singing, <italic>F</italic>(46) = 14.124, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; instrument playing, <italic>F</italic>(46) = 19.501, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; listening, <italic>F</italic>(46) = 10.215, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; musical games, <italic>F</italic>(46) = 9.299, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and movement to aid concept acquisition, <italic>F</italic>(45) = 37.533, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Subsequent Tukey’s post hoc analysis revealed significant difference pairings within each activity type. For example, results indicated that preservice teachers perceived echoing, buddy system, other visual aids, and icons, which were the four highest ranked supports for implementing classroom cultural dance activities, to be significantly more effective than the two lowest ranked supports of color coding and written words for that particular activity type. Echoing was perceived to be significantly better than other visual aids and icons as well.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some consistency exists among survey analysis results and is therefore helpful in drawing conclusions about which educational supports are most beneficial for beginning teachers working with students with special needs. First is the perceived importance of echoing for teaching music education concepts, which was the highest rated support for all settings combined and for private studios alone, and the second highest for ensemble settings. This may be explained not only because of inherent benefits of echoing during instruction with students with special needs but also because the special education teacher in the self-contained classroom where the preservice teachers worked incorporates echoing more than other supports in his or her own teaching and modeled this for the study participants.</p>
<p>As regards implementation of assessments, responses of preservice teachers indicated the use of small groups or stations was consistently considered highly important, as it was the highest rated support in general music and ensemble settings combined and the second highest in general music alone. Furthermore, regardless of educational setting, echoing was rated as the least important educational support when implementing assessments, significantly lower than other supports, including small groups or stations. This is likely because preservice teachers recognized that in formal assessment it is important to gain accurate measures of student understanding and acquisition of material. Unlike color coding, icons, and other visual aids, which may help ensure students understand the assessment question or task, supports such as written words, echoing, and buddy system, which were the three lowest rated supports, may go beyond that level and reveal the answer or be distracting to other students being assessed concurrently.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable result of the survey analysis was inconsistency in color coding ratings. Although color coding was rated most important in teaching concepts in ensembles, it was rated near the bottom in other settings, and in the mid-range for implementing assessments in general music. Both researchers conducting this study are educators and experts in working with students with special needs, and one is dually certified as a music therapist. They believe color coding is one of the most important and pervasive aids that can be provided to students, yet the preservice teachers during the first semester of this research project (<italic>n</italic> = 15) represent the only group of preservice teachers with more than 7 years of field experience research in which undergraduate music education majors did not embrace the concept of color coding. This aversion was evident not only in their survey responses but also during their field experience planning and teaching. Alternatively, the second semester of preservice teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 15) relied strongly on color coding, incorporating it more prominently than all other educational supports within their planning and teaching, and embracing this concept more than all other semesters of preservice teachers. In the researchers’ experience, once preservice teachers grasp the concept of color coding, this tool becomes a mainstay and is an excellent way for teachers to learn the importance of paired associations and then transfer that concept to enhancing as many inputs for students as possible.</p>
<p>It seems that the most important finding of this study is that preservice teachers are capable of determining which educational supports are most effective when implementing various teaching elements in general music and in a variety of ensembles. Based on their field experience working with students with special needs in general music and the transfer of that knowledge to ensemble settings, preservice teachers ranked the seven educational supports differently for each teaching element (or student task). Not only does the variation in their ranking support the concept that they are making judgments based on the content and requirements of each teaching or learning activity but their rankings also seem to the researchers to be appropriate. For example, in general music settings, preservice teachers rated echoing significantly less effective when conducting assessments than all six other supports. This is logical, as at the point of assessment, teachers are no longer necessarily instructing and providing new material to be experienced through echo or other means. Still, the preservice teachers ranked other supports, such as icons as very effective, indicating their understanding of the importance of ensuring that students understand what is being asked of them so that the teacher is testing the actual concept or material she or he intends to be testing, rather than testing if the student can read or hear, or otherwise perceive a question. As another example, the significantly lower ranking of written words when implementing movement to aid concept acquisition makes sense, as movement is typically a sensorimotor activity that can be modeled physically, not requiring any sort of reading on the part of the students. This is not to say, however, that the incorporation of written words to address nonmusical goals, such as literacy, would not also be beneficial. Although not their primary focus, music educators can address specific special education objectives as well as nonmusic skills such as developing appropriate classroom behaviors, cooperation, independence, and respect through music experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312436987">Adamek &amp; Darrow, 2010</xref>). However, the task for the preservice teachers was to determine which educational supports would be most effective in conveying music concept acquisition within each teaching element, activity type, or ensemble setting. Still, the researchers strongly support the concept of using educational supports to enhance nonmusical skill learning, including, but not limited to literacy, for students with special needs, as music educators are part of the entire educational team of any learning institution, and stress this value during the field experience and preceding classroom instruction for the participating preservice teacher university students.</p>
<p>Given preferences of preservice teachers expressed in this study, university music education faculty and beginning teachers should focus on using small groups or stations and a buddy system to assess students, and to use echoing, color coding, other visual aids, and a buddy system to teach concepts. However, the researchers believe the entire spectrum of educational supports are necessary to meet the needs of students depending on their varied abilities, educational setting, and concept being taught or assessed. Therefore, results of this study may instead indicate the need to stress the less highly rated concepts within preservice teacher education in order for future music educators to embrace necessary concepts that may not come as naturally. In addition, future research may examine the importance of each support depending on those factors.</p>
<p>To further aid university music education faculty in identifying preparation most beneficial to new teachers working with students with special needs, future research directions may also include a broad survey of university faculty about steps being taken to equip preservice teachers with the techniques necessary for working with this population; analysis of lesson elements (or tasks) and types of adaptations recommended for special learners within standard music education literature; survey of professional music educators to determine literature commonly used with special learners, as well as perceptions of needs for further curriculum development; and evaluation of training preservice teachers to write adaptive curricula, with focus on cross-curricular and special education goals interwoven within the music education curriculum. Furthermore, whereas preservice education including field experience has been demonstrated to be highly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312436987">VanWeelden &amp; Whipple, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8755123312436987">2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8755123312436987">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8755123312436987">2007b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312436987">Darrow (1999)</xref> found that 77% of general music, instrumental, and choral music educators interviewed indicated that collaboration and consultation with music therapists, special educators, and other related professionals are the most integral aspects of successful inclusion of students with special needs in any music education setting. As music therapists and music educators often work in concert with students with special needs, it may also be beneficial to survey preservice music therapists and professional music therapists about their perceptions of educational supports for this as well as other populations.</p>
