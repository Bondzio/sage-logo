<abstract>
<p>Significant stigma exists to marginalize persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Research has demonstrated it is possible to reduce stigma and prejudice through the development of meaningful and innovative education. The purpose of this article is to explore the ways in which the creative and purposeful use of AIDS Artwork as an educational tool may reduce stigma about HIV/AIDS and help adult learners to regulate their own prejudices about the diseases. Using Jarvis’s model for experiential learning as a framework for understanding, this article discusses some of the literature on HIV/AIDS education and the use of socially informed art in adult education. Eight potential educational exercises using AIDS Artwork are suggested and explained. The Critical Senses Conceptual Map is proposed as a helpful framework for adult educators who wish to include these exercises in curriculum designed for the reduction of prejudice and stigma about HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>“AIDS Artwork has the potential to demonstrate the unnerving power of HIV/AIDS to cross sexual, racial, gender, age, and socioeconomic dividing lines.”</p>

</p>
<p>Imagine believing victims of a disease deserve to die from it. Imagine believing this disease was a punishment. Imagine losing your friends or a member of your family to this disease, knowing you may soon follow in their footsteps. Imagine an uncontrollable pandemic. Imagine HIV/AIDS as one of the most relevant, continual cultural issues we face as a global society.</p>
<p>Realities surrounding HIV and AIDS have changed since the first reported human cases in the 1980s, but stigma still marginalizes those who currently have or are falsely perceived to be more likely to contract HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452262">Parker &amp; Aggleton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045159512452262">Varni, Miller, McCuin, &amp; Solomon, 2012</xref>). This stigma increases health and psychological risks for persons living with HIV/AIDS—referred to in this article as PLWHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045159512452262">Vanable, Carey, Blair, &amp; Littlewood, 2006</xref>). However, concerns related to stigma have been lowered for PLWHA in instances where those with whom they have close interactions have felt convicted by personal values not to discriminate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159512452262">Miller, Grover, Bunn, &amp; Solomon, 2011</xref>). Stigma-related concerns have been less ameliorated in instances where PLWHA felt as if others were not discriminatory simply because their community pressured them not to be. Therefore, exploring new techniques that increase adult awareness of their knowledge of, experience with, and beliefs about HIV/AIDS may be beneficial in decreasing stigma for PLWHA.</p>
<p>The limited nature of HIV/AIDS education literature, tools, and instructional methods necessitates continued exploration of new practices. I suggest HIV/AIDS educators may benefit from the development of methods designed to bridge the gap between truth about HIV/AIDS and what people <italic>actually believe</italic>. AIDS Artwork—visual, fine, and performing art created by individuals to express feelings about or understanding of portions of the HIV/AIDS narrative—may be a powerful tool for teaching adult learners about HIV/AIDS realities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159512452262">Nabulime and McEwan (2011)</xref> noted their experiences using sculpture as a part of HIV/AIDS education in Uganda:
<disp-quote>
<p>By encouraging openness and dialogue, [sculpture helps] to reduce stigmatization and discrimination. As the interviews revealed, [the art] can educate, entertain and provoke interest. [Sculptures] simultaneously initiate discussion about the dangers of the disease, which may lead to behavioural change, while also giving hope by reducing stigmatization of those living with HIV/AIDS. (p. 292)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>AIDS Artwork has the potential to demonstrate the unnerving power of HIV/AIDS to cross sexual, racial, gender, age, and socioeconomic dividing lines. This may be accomplished through the engagement of adult learners in the reflective process of creating and explaining amateur art inspired by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to explore the ways in which the creative and purposeful use of AIDS Artwork as an educational tool may reduce stigma about HIV/AIDS and help adult learners to regulate their own prejudices about the diseases.

<title>HIV/AIDS Stigma and Prejudice</title>
<p>In 1986, DiClemente, Zorn, and Temoshok surveyed 1,326 high school students to determine their overall awareness of realities about AIDS in San Francisco. Of these students, 78.7% reported “being afraid of getting AIDS” (p. 1443) and 79.6% agreed “most people who get AIDS usually die from the disease” (p. 1444). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452262">DiClemente et al. (1986)</xref> concluded that increased education about HIV/AIDS would be necessary to decrease infection rates. Now, 25 years after this research was conducted, it is not difficult to see how this statement may still carry some truth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159512452262">Ortega, Bicaldo, Sobritchea, and Tan (2005)</xref> said in the Philippines, workplace discrimination related to HIV/AIDS “occurs mostly in practice rather than on the levels of legislation and policy” (p. 161). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159512452262">Liu, Canada, Shi, and Corrigan (2012)</xref> found some PLWHA have a difficult time obtaining and maintaining employment, based primarily on employer perceptions of incompetence and/or HIV/AIDS being highly contagious. These findings suggest that stigma about HIV/AIDS is still alive in the hearts and minds of many. What is spoken in policy may not always be enacted in reality; education is a potential solution to this problem.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159512452262">Pryor, Reeder, and Landau (1999)</xref>, adults’ views of HIV/AIDS become contaminated by their social contexts and experiences with the conditions. For example, an individual who has only ever seen or heard of AIDS cases in drug-users, gay men, or the sexually promiscuous may believe those are the only populations at risk of contraction. Furthermore, this same individual may internalize these previous experiences to personally justify the marginalization of populations <italic>perceived</italic> to be at higher risk. This stigma may be dangerous for many reasons, not the least of which is that people “are more likely to seek out and follow through with HIV testing services that they perceive to be nonthreatening, nonjudgmental, and responsive to their individual needs and circumstances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045159512452262">Valdiserri, 2002</xref>, p. 341). A system of prejudice and judgment may contribute to at-risk individuals’ lack of willingness to get tested. However, the implications of HIV/AIDS-related stigma are much further reaching than health care concerns.</p>
<p>As of 1999, Herek and Capitanio found nearly a quarter of the individuals in their study believed HIV/AIDS could be passed between two gay men even if neither of the men was infected at the time of sexual intercourse. When compared with data from a study conducted 8 years prior, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159512452262">Herek and Capitanio (1999)</xref> found the “changing epidemiology of HIV” (p. 1139) did not seem to reduce stigma. Individuals in their study still believed AIDS was something primarily contracted by gay men, people with HIV/AIDS are guilty in some way, and “mere symbolic contact with [PLWHA], such as touching an article of clothing or drinking from a sterilized glass used by a [PLWHA]” (p. 1139) could lead to infection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045159512452262">Vanable et al. (2006)</xref> found “a substantial minority of [HIV positive] participants reported people behave negatively (42%), avoid being near them (29%), and exclude them from social events (20%), because of their HIV status” (p. 480). This prejudice must be reduced before PLWHA may escape, to some degree, harmful stigma on a daily basis.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>This article’s understanding of how adults learn, develop, and change was guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452262">Jarvis’s (1987</xref>, 2004, 2006) model for experiential learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452262">Jarvis (2006)</xref> posited a person brings her or his biography—history of experiences, relationships, and social interactions—into new learning situations. HIV/AIDS stigma and prejudice often stems from misguided interaction with information regarding the diseases. Thus, HIV/AIDS educators who utilize AIDS Artwork as a tool must respect the prior experience of learners and use the past to build a more inclusive future.</p>
<p>Within Jarvis’s model, new learning is foundationalized by the past and spurred by a specific experience within a social context. For those individuals whose prior experience has led to the development of stigma or prejudice about HIV/AIDS, seeking or being open to education about the diseases is a significant step forward. When this occurs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159512452262">Jarvis (2004)</xref> might argue, “No longer can previous learning cope with the present situation, people are consciously aware that they do not know how to act” (p. 93). Therefore, the experience of learning new truth about HIV/AIDS requires constant reflection and engagement.</p>
<p>After adult learners engage in this process, they move through a continual course of reflection, emotion, and potential action until change is enacted and embodied holistically—in every sense of that individual’s being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452262">Jarvis, 2006</xref>). The application of what has been learned is then contextualized within the ever-changing immediate world of the learner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452262">Jarvis, 2006</xref>), meaning what <italic>works today</italic> for a learner may not <italic>work tomorrow</italic> or could change given a new physical or metaphorical location. The nature of this change being somewhat unpredictable, internalization of knowledge on the part of the learner is a critical aspect of the experiential learning process because with that foundation, the learner may be able to better interpret new and challenging situations. For those individuals who have participated in an educational program using AIDS Artwork, the goal is to learn to regulate personal prejudice about the diseases on a daily basis by developing awareness—guided by <italic>accurate</italic> information about HIV/AIDS and PLWHA—of stigma.</p>

<title>Prejudice, Stigma, and Learning</title>
<p>This article’s inclusion of AIDS Artwork in HIV/AIDS education rests on the assumption that prejudice and stigma may actually be reduced through powerful, experiential learning. In this section, I first highlight some of the literature that supports this assumption. Next, I provide a brief overview of literature on HIV/AIDS education in the field of adult education. Finally, I discuss literature related to the concept of learning with the help of art.</p>
<sec id="section4-1045159512452262">
<title>Prejudice and Stigma Reduction</title>
<p>Racial prejudice may be reduced with education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159512452262">Hogan and Mallot (2005)</xref> found, “Completing a college level course in race and gender issues did indeed reduce prejudice toward African Americans in students” (p. 123). These findings are consistent with the contentions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045159512452262">Shaefer (1996)</xref> who argues education itself is not the answer to reducing prejudice, but rather education created with the explicit purpose of highlighting issues not typically addressed in the classroom. Conceptually, it is reasonable to believe that the same logic in designing education courses about race and gender may be applied to the development of courses that grapple with HIV/AIDS topics. However, HIV/AIDS education does not necessarily need to take place in a formalized higher education setting to make a difference. Adults may learn in a number of different settings or environments, and it is important adult educators meet learners where they are to reduce stigma across identity and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Drawing on previous research conducted on the reduction of prejudice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045159512452262">Paluck and Green (2009)</xref> compiled a list of potential interventions from the literature. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045159512452262">Table 1</xref> represents the findings and sociopsychological theories that frame the intervention approaches supported by experimental evidence from the field/laboratory. These findings support the conceptualizations within this article by providing a basis for the claim social prejudice in adults may be regulated with theoretically grounded interventions aimed at reshaping learners’ knowledge and beliefs about HIV/AIDS.</p>

<title>HIV/AIDS Education</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452262">Boshier (1992)</xref> was one of the first to argue the field of adult education has an obligation, and the capacity, to help combat miscommunication about HIV/AIDS that emerges from varying discourses about the diseases. According to Boshier, discourse about AIDS began with rumors of a “gay plague” (p. 128). In the mid-late 1980s, discourse shifted to concentrate on AIDS patients as “the contaminated other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452262">Boshier, 1992</xref>, p. 129). Other discourses leading up to Boshier’s publication in 1992 included “innocent victim[s]” (p. 130), “heterosexual-risk” (p. 131), and “development” (p. 132). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452262">Boshier (1992)</xref>, what all of these discourses about AIDS have in common is the conceptualization of HIV/AIDS education “from the assumption that individuals are capable of making the ‘right choices’ to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS” (p. 133). Arguably, these discourses still linger today, and there is a need for quality HIV/AIDS education to “represent [the] multiple meanings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452262">Boshier, 1992</xref>, p. 133) of the diseases. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452262">Archie-Booker, Cervero, and Langone (1999)</xref>, AIDS education programs, “defined as generic across cultural boundaries of race, gender, and sexual orientation” (p. 173), can result in programs that are not “culturally relevant” (p. 173) for certain populations—in their study, African American women. Multiple meanings should be considered to avoid this fate.</p>
<p>Ironically, the multiple meanings referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452262">Boshier (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452262">Archie-Booker et al. (1999)</xref> are often considered primarily from an <italic>outsider</italic> (HIV negative) viewpoint. However, some research exists to discuss adult education’s role in relation to PLWHA. In a qualitative study examining how HIV-positive adults make meaning of their experience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452262">Baumgartner (2002)</xref> describes “an increased appreciation for the human condition” and “an expanded view of intimacy” (p. 50) as key changes for people who are successful at managing their own identities as HIV positive. Participants of the study said dealing with HIV diagnosis positively impacted the way they interacted with different kinds of people, and the diagnosis also encouraged a more holistic sense of intimacy beyond what is physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452262">Baumgartner, 2002</xref>). The assumption that these kinds of positive life changes can exist for PLWHA informs a different approach to HIV/AIDS education—an approach that aims to teach PLWHA and the general population about how the conditions shape and affect lives in a complex, multilayered manner. One way of developing a more inclusive curriculum may be to include art as a tool of instruction.</p>

<sec id="section6-1045159512452262">
<title>Learning with Art</title>
<p>In the last several years, art as an educational tool has made its way slowly into the field of adult education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452262">Clover &amp; Stalker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159512452262">Lawrence, 2005</xref>). Theorizing about their own experiences with administering an art education program to lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersexual, trans-identified, two-spirited, and queer (LGBITTQ) youth and young adults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452262">Grace and Wells (2007)</xref> posited, “Dialectical engagement helped [program participants] to see themselves in personally transforming ways that helped to counter a past in which they were invisible in families, schools, and communities” (p. 100). The authors reflected further that youth who completed the arts program felt more able to “counter the ignorance that so often leads to fear and symbolic and physical violence toward LGBITTQ persons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452262">Grace &amp; Wells, 2007</xref>, p. 100). The art created as a result of their program was installed and displayed for the purpose of “representing self, others, reality and possibility in art” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452262">Grace &amp; Wells, 2007</xref>, p. 105). Grace and Wells called for the continued blending of arts education into adult education initiatives aimed at “cultural action for social transformation” (p. 104), in this case, specifically for LGBITTQ persons, but arguably on a much larger scale for other stigmatized or marginalized identity groups, such as those living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Artistic expression has nearly always been a part of the HIV/AIDS discourse. The first patients and their loved ones turned to their journals, canvases, cameras, and creative spirits to make sense of the confusing, earth-shattering news of testing positive, and to record feelings and thoughts in what were often, unfortunately, their last days together. In 1984, <italic>The AIDS Show</italic> opened in San Francisco, followed in 1985 by the opening of <italic>As Is</italic>—plays aimed at raising awareness of the realities of AIDS near the beginning of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452262">Artery, n.d</xref>.). In 1987, the AIDS Quilt, which now contains hundreds of thousands of pieces dedicated to victims of HIV/AIDS, debuted in Washington, D.C. That same year, the now-well-known AIDS education initiative, ACT Up, created its artwork to be used nationally. In 1988, the first well-established art exhibits dedicated to persons living with AIDS were opened, and in 1989, the first Day Without Art (a day dedicated to mourning HIV/AIDS) was born. In 1990, the documentary <italic>Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452262">Epstein &amp; Friedman, 1989</xref>) won the Academy Award. The mid-late 1990s brought HIV/AIDS discourse to the Internet in creative ways and also saw the first stage productions of the Broadway smash hit <italic>Rent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159512452262">Larson, 1993</xref>), which humanized HIV/AIDS as a disease by making a number of the main characters HIV positive. One may also grasp the importance art may have in creating understanding of HIV/AIDS by doing a <italic>Google Image</italic> search for the term <italic>AIDS Artwork</italic> and scrolling through the thousands of paintings and photographs that appear, each telling a unique portion of the HIV/AIDS story without the use of words.</p>
<p>The majority of the academic literature exploring art and HIV/AIDS has focused on how art can be used therapeutically for PLWHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159512452262">Rao et al., 2009</xref>). However, recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159512452262">Nabulime and McEwan (2011)</xref> used sculpture activities as a part of AIDS education in a Ugandan community and “were successful in stimulating dialogue and discussion and reminding people of their own experiences related to HIV/AIDS, which they then felt more able to articulate in public” (p. 290). This public articulation about experiences with and knowledge about HIV/AIDS may be exactly what is needed to reduce prejudice and stigma against PLWHA.</p>

<p>The proposed development of adult learners in educational settings using AIDS Artwork as a tool for instruction draws its strength from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452262">Jarvis’s (1987</xref>, 2004, 2006) model for experiential learning, this article’s theoretical framework. However, Jarvis’s model must first be contextualized within a HIV/AIDS education setting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045159512452262">Figure 1</xref> presents the Critical Senses Conceptual Map developed for the purpose of this article and for use by adult educators seeking a <italic>roadmap</italic> for the inclusion of AIDS Artwork into curriculum designed to reduce HIV/AIDS stigma and prejudice. Within the Critical Senses Conceptual Map, it is my belief that adult learners should first explore alternative viewpoints on HIV/AIDS. These viewpoints may focus on (a) the capacity of HIV/AIDS to cross social and cultural boundaries and affect people from all walks of life, (b) the belief HIV/AIDS does not necessarily have to mean death or social demise for PLWHA, (c) openness to the truth HIV/AIDS is not a punishment for non-heteronormative sexual behaviors and practices, and (d) the critique of depictions of HIV/AIDS that serve to keep certain truths and realities about the conditions hidden. The desire to enter such a learning environment may spark from interaction with PLWHA, realization of lack of knowledge about the diseases, witnessing prejudice in the community, or some other significant event.</p>

</fig>
<p>After adult learners have the experience of reevaluating their beliefs and understandings of HIV/AIDS, they may apply their new knowledge to deconstruct the stigma surrounding the conditions by <italic>creating</italic> and <italic>explaining</italic> personal works of AIDS Artwork. Stigma and prejudice may indicate “miseducative experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452262">Jarvis, 1987</xref>, p. 16), which Jarvis argues should be seen as valid experience that feeds into the overall learning process. Education is vital to fill the gaps between previous and new knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about HIV/AIDS, and such education should take place “in splendid isolation from the world in which the learner lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452262">Jarvis, 1987</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>Adult learners who understand how their new knowledge, and the application of that knowledge, may lead to new learning about prejudices related to HIV/AIDS may be ready to consider ways stigma can be reduced for PLWHA. Holistic embodiment of experiences in the learning process may enable the adult learner to internalize lessons from AIDS Artwork to regulate personal and community prejudice against PLWHA. In subverting systems of power that have sustained HIV/AIDS stigma, these adult learners may be more equipped to make educated choices. For adults completing an AIDS Artwork educational session, this social intelligence should be considered a primary goal of instruction: that learners integrate material into their belief system and enact critical principles on a daily basis.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Though it is likely that AIDS Artwork may be most easily implemented in formal learning environments, the use of art activities to educate about HIV/AIDS need not be limited to settings specifically designed to address HIV/AIDS or other health issues. College classes that address issues related to health, diversity, social justice, identity, power, sexuality, and more may also benefit from the inclusion of some of the methods put forth in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045159512452262">Table 2</xref>, which represents potential uses for AIDS Artwork, as influenced by each major section of this conceptual article. The activities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045159512452262">Table 2</xref> might also be used in support groups for PLWHA and their close family members and friends, or as part of a module in HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Finally, these activities could be implemented in the already-existing therapeutic art programs designed for PLWHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159512452262">Rao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045159512452262">Willemsen &amp; Anscombe, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>The Critical Senses Conceptual Map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045159512452262">Figure 1</xref>) offers a helpful framework for future researchers who wish to explore experiential learning methods, or methods that utilize art, in HIV/AIDS education efforts. Researchers may consider developing and implementing instructional programs based on this conceptual map, preceded by assessments to determine participant attitudes and prejudices/stigma about PLWHA and followed with interviews and/or focus groups to determine whether those attitudes have changed and prejudices and stigma have been reduced. Similar studies may be completed quantitatively after the conceptual map has been fleshed out more fully through this type of qualitative research.</p>
<p>In creating new HIV/AIDS education activities based on AIDS Artwork, this article contributes to adult education theory by expanding on applications of Jarvis’s model for experiential learning. The continued testing and expansion of Jarvis’s model in an innovative fashion will be crucial to the advancement and validation of the field of adult education. It is possible AIDS Artwork used purposefully in practice and in research may lead to the development of more holistic and socially just learning theory.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The evolution of HIV/AIDS awareness may be spurred with the design and implementation of purposeful adult educational activities using AIDS Artwork as the basis for learner application of principles. The tools and activities presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045159512452262">Table 2</xref> are merely a beginning of the possibilities that could stem from the merger of AIDS Artwork, adult education, and HIV/AIDS education. In the 21st century, medicines and treatments are available to ameliorate many of the medical and physical problems faced by PLWHA; however, presently there is no cure for the diseases. The field of adult education sits in a position of considerable power to help prescribe treatment for some of the other problems faced by PLWHA, specifically social problems. This article attempts to expand adult education’s awareness of prejudice and stigma. The use of AIDS Artwork with adults may prove helpful in taking HIV/AIDS education to the next level, a level that values alternative perspectives on the diseases and regulates the prejudices that have been instilled in many adults since the beginning of the pandemic in the early 1980s.</p>
