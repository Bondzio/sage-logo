<p>The narrow stretch of water between the coasts of the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, joins the two countries, and does not separate them. Therefore, the author rightly begins the narration in his book <italic>My days in Sri Lanka</italic>, with the ancient civilisational links between the two countries—our epic of ‘Ramayana’ and the Sri Lankan epic of ‘Mahavamsa’. He takes us through the peaceful political struggle for the freedom of both the two countries; visits of political leaders to each others’ country before independence, and the cordial relations between the political parties of the two countries.</p>
<p>There is a very appropriate reference right at the beginning to ‘Highland Tamils’ or ‘Indian Tamils’ in Sri Lanka whose lack of citizenship rights became an irritating factor, soon after the independence of the two countries. He rightly points out that these so-called ‘Indian Tamils’ had lived in Sri Lanka for no less than a century at the time of Sri Lanka’s independence and had built the only export industry of the island at that time, namely, the tea industry and the plantations. It is a relief that now the problem of citizenship of ‘Indian Tamils’ has been solved, though it took no less than 50 years after the independence of Sri Lanka for the ‘Highland Tamils’ to get their citizenship rights!</p>
<p>While tracing the recent history of Indo-Sri Lankan relations, the author also rightly questions the role of Sri Lanka during the period of India–China and India–Pakistan conflicts.</p>
<p>There is a detailed and poetic description of ‘India House’, the residence of the Indian High Commissioner, in Colombo in one chapter. However, this graceful teak-wood structure ‘India House’ became a source of extreme worry to me and the many Tamil families who had taken shelter there during the ‘anti-Tamil’ riots in Colombo in July 1983. All that a fanatic Sri Lankan needed was just one tin of petrol to set fire to this dried teak-wood mansion! The author talks of the lovely birds visiting ‘India House’ during the rainy season. I am reminded of G. Parthasarathi, the Special Envoy of our Prime Minister to Sri Lanka in 1983, who during his visits to Colombo would stay at ‘India House’, sit in the terrace, close his eyes and listen to the melodious chatter of these birds.</p>
<p>The discrimination against Tamils in Sri Lanka since 1956, and the long peaceful but unsuccessful struggle of Tamil Parties have been dealt within one chapter comprehensively by the author. The trouble right from the beginning has been that the Sri Lankan Government never conceded anything substantial to the Tamils struggling peacefully, which they could take back to their constituents as a token of confidence that their peaceful struggle was on the correct path and will succeed one day. It is for this reason that Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and other Tamil militant groups such as People’s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) came into existence. All this has been explained very well in a separate chapter.</p>
<p>What was the situation prevailing in Sri Lanka when the Author reached Colombo in April 1989? The following deserves quotations:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the aftermath of President Premadasa’s victory with just over 50 per cent of votes polled by him in his election, it was assessed that the difference was made by the Tamil vote in his favour in the area under IPKF’s tentative charge due to peaceful conditions there generated by its presence. Otherwise, it would not have been possible for the people of the area to exercise their vote at all. Moreover, if the Government of Sri Lanka did not ‘exercise jurisdiction and control in the Northeast’ due to the presence of the IPKF as it maintained, what about the south where district after district had been ‘liberated’ by the JVP from government control. The Sinhala Militants belonging to that organisation had been working assiduously to wrest control of Colombo itself from its hands. In the areas under JVP’s control, the writ of the government did not run at all. On the other hand, UNP cadres were murdered day and night by the JVP, the tourist centres had been emptied, rail and road transport embargoed, trade scuttled, goods from India embargoed, even pharmacies deprived of medicinal stocks and tea houses, tea inventories and tea farms burnt destroying much of Sri Lanka’s export potential. Ships were not allowed to either load or unload their wares even at the Colombo port. There were serious blackouts at JVP’s command in the south and in all administrative matters it was the ‘JVP Commander’ in charge who ruled the roost. (p. 64)</p>
<p>Grenades were thrown at the Indian High Commission frequently and JVP headquarters stood right across from the ‘India House’ in an academic campus with the Sri Lankan Government having done little to dismantle them. (p. 65)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The signing of the 1987 Accord and the invitation to IPKF to go for the assistance of Sri Lanka Government has been dealt with in detail by the author. The author is correct when he says that the serious problems which arose concerning the effective functioning of IPKF in the north and the eastern areas, the main reason was that ‘the old fox’ of Sri Lankan politics, President J.R. Jayewardene, knew that Premadasa, his Prime Minister, was against the 1987 Accord. It is for this reason that he decided to sign the Accord with India when Premadasa was away from Sri Lanka. Instead of helping IPKF in disarming LTTE, Premadasa, when he became the President in January 1989, started supplying covertly arms and ammunitions to LTTE in Tata trucks presented earlier during my tenure to Sri Lanka for relief work in Tamil areas! This tragic story of how the Sri Lankan Government, the fanatic Sinhalese organisation JVP, and the equally fanatic LTTE, all combined against the IPKF to wreck the 1987 Accord, has been explained very well by the author even at the risk of repetition at some places.</p>
<p>It is amusing to note the role that astrology plays with politicians both in India and Sri Lanka to which the author refers on page 103:</p>
<p>At one point of time the President’s astrologers advised him that he should invite his better half to all his cabinet meetings so that her supposedly better stars could impact on his decision making! From then on Mrs. Premadasa started attending those meetings. Cooray took it upon himself to advise the President to stop that most unconventional practice. However, the brave Cooray invited the wrath of the First Lady. He then left the island for better pastures in Australia, until the President wooed him back as the situation in the island got out of hand.</p>
<p>It is well known that Premadasa, after becoming President, started indulging dangerously in brinkmanship in Sri Lankan relations with India. He even went to the extent of issuing a written ultimatum that if the IPKF Force were not withdrawn by 29 July 1989, Sri Lankan Forces will be ordered to put IPKF in barracks, and take over the north-eastern areas of the country, forcibly. This was despite the assurance given by the Indian side that the process of de-induction of IPKF from Sri Lanka, which had already begun, would be completed by mid-1990. It is at this critical stage of relations between the two countries that B.G. Deshmukh, the then Principal Secretary to our Prime Minister, was sent to Sri Lanka as a Special Envoy of our Prime Minister. The IPKF had gone to Sri Lanka to help the Government and at their written invitation. The IPKF brought peace in the north and eastern provinces of the country at the cost of great sacrifice in men and materials. The response of Premadasa unfortunately was to give a desperate and dangerous ultimatum to India to withdraw IPKF immediately. India had enough of it. The dignified response given by Deshmukh during his meeting with the President deserves to be quoted:</p>
<p>Quite unfazed by the President’s remarks, Deshmukh stated that those developments would pose no threat to India and that he could go ahead. The President then said that he would declare the ‘Indian Army’ in Sri Lanka an ‘occupation force’ which could sully India’s fair name. The special Envoy quipped back saying that India could take care of its reputation, and he should not worry about it. The Sri Lankan leader then added the shrill note that if before 29 July India did not offer some formula that he could accept and announce to his people as a reasonable response to his request, it could cost him dearly and bring his political career to an end. (p. 115).</p>
<p>It is heartening that we were able to come out of the dangerous situation eventually, which prevailed in 1989–1990 in relations of the two countries. For this, the credit has to go to the saner voices on both sides of the border and the admirable patience shown by our High Commissioner, Lakhan Mehrotra, the author of the book, in Sri Lanka during that very critical period. The book is based on authentic documents, the author’s personal knowledge of events and is engrossingly written. I would certainly recommend it to those interested in our relations with our neighbour in South Asia.</p>
