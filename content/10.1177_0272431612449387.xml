<abstract>
<p>The current study examined adolescent persistence as a mediator between authoritative parenting and adolescents’ school engagement, prosocial behavior, and delinquency. Participants were taken from Time 2, 3, and 4 of the Flourishing Families Project and included 325 two-parent families with a child between the ages of 11 and 14 at Time 2 (mean age = 12.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06, 52% female), 96% of whom had complete data for Time 4 (2 years later). Analyses suggested that authoritative fathering at Time 2 (but not mothering) was positively associated with adolescent persistence at Time 3, and adolescent persistence was positively related to school engagement and negatively related to delinquency at Time 4. Discussion focuses on the importance of the socialization of persistence during adolescence.</p>

<p>Persistence is a key behavior that both parents and educators seek to foster in children and adolescents, as it is related to numerous positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431612449387">Burgette &amp; Magun-Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431612449387">Duckworth &amp; Quinn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0272431612449387">Zhang &amp; Zhang, 2003</xref>). Persistence may be particularly important during early adolescence given the diverse cognitive changes occurring that make consideration of long-term consequences more salient and advantageous. In addition, although we know more about adult persistence, we know very little about the socialization of this behavior during the formative years. Further, most research on persistence focuses on trait correlates that may enhance or even predict increases in persistent behaviors, such as self-esteem, optimism, and self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431612449387">Carver, Scheier, &amp; Segerstrom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431612449387">Di Paula &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431612449387">Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, &amp; Briere, 2001</xref>), but less is known about how proximate socialization agents, such as parents, influence the emergence (or lack thereof) of persistence during childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of the current study was threefold. First, we examined the role of parenting in promoting persistence in adolescents by asking whether authoritative parenting in mothers and fathers was associated with increases in persistence over time. As a part of that analysis, we explored whether an authoritative parenting style by mothers and fathers was important in explaining the development of persistence during adolescence net of typical trait correlates (self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem). Second, we sought to verify and demonstrate that persistence was associated with three common but crucial child outcomes (school engagement, prosocial behavior, and delinquency) over time. Last, we explored the idea that persistence may be an important mediator between parenting style and adolescent behavioral outcomes. In other words, we sought to understand whether the relationship between parenting style and target outcomes was partially explained through its effects on adolescent persistence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431612449387">
<title>Definition of Persistence</title>
<p>The definition of persistence encompasses two elements: First, persistence is the ability to persevere and continue toward a goal when the motivational source is centered in the individual rather than on external elements. This concept is informed by self-determination theory (SDT), which explores how an actor chooses to continue toward a goal even when there are difficulties but does so voluntarily or within the scope of autonomous action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431612449387">Ryan, Patrick, Deci, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). Conversely, individuals who continue in a task out of fear of punishment are neither truly self-determined nor truly persistent (for a detailed discussion of SDT, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431612449387">Niemiec, Ryan, &amp; Deci, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The second element of persistence centers on barriers and discomfort. A behavior designed to obtain a target goal can only qualify as persistence when a person continues on and works through the problem despite delays and obstacles. In other words, just because someone repeatedly participates in something enjoyable for an extended period does not necessarily qualify that person as persistent. The ability to overcome delays and hindrances throughout difficult tasks is essential in describing a persistent individual. This ability to continue on despite barriers is sometimes labeled <italic>perseverance</italic> and <italic>grit</italic> (these terms have been used interchangeably with persistence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431612449387">Duckworth &amp; Quinn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431612449387">Tenenbaum et al., 2005</xref>). Persistence also likely overlaps with constructs like conscientiousness and achievement but is unique because it highlights the feature of long-term stamina and self-direction. It also describes individuals who are not easily swayed from even the most difficult goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson and Seligman (2004)</xref> summarize these ideas and state that persistence is the “voluntary continuation of a goal-directed action in spite of obstacles, difficulties, or discouragement” (p. 220).</p>
<p>In the current study, we follow the lead of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431612449387">Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000)</xref> who opined that the role of positive psychology was not merely discovering treatments for mental illness but also aiming to “show what actions lead to well-being and positive individuals” and to “document what kinds of families result in children who flourish” (p. 5). While an individual’s IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431612449387">Gottfredson, 1997</xref>) and Big Five personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431612449387">John &amp; Srivastava, 1999</xref>) are frequently assessed as the most salient predictors of success, they do not account for sometimes large variation in IQ among successful individuals, and the somewhat low correlations between personality traits and positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431612449387">Tett, Jackson, &amp; Rothstein, 1991</xref>). Indeed, it has been suggested that behaviors such as persistence are as or more important than intelligence in determining positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431612449387">Howe, 1999</xref>), suggesting value in understanding the development of such behaviors in the formative years.</p>

<title>Predictors of Persistence</title>
<p>Most of the research on persistence has analyzed both state and trait predictors of persistence. State predictors of persistence include individuals who are in good moods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431612449387">Tice, Dale, &amp; Baumeister, 2003</xref>), are in the presence of another person who is an observer, are rewarded for effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431612449387">Eisenberger, Kuhlman, &amp; Cotterell, 1992</xref>), reside in homes of higher socioeconomic status and higher parental education, and who have greater social support and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431612449387">Lavigne, Vallerand, &amp; Miquelon, 2007</xref>). In contrast, research on trait predictors of persistence has primarily examined the relationship between persistence and self-esteem, self-regulation, and optimism. Multiple researchers have found that people rated high in self-esteem continue with tasks longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431612449387">Di Paula &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431612449387">Shrauger &amp; Sorman, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431612449387">Tafarodi &amp; Vu, 1997</xref>) and perform tasks with more efficiency than those with lower self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431612449387">Markman, Baron, &amp; Balkin, 2005</xref>). Similarly, adults who exhibited lower levels of self-regulation were found to be less persistent in task completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431612449387">Pelletier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431612449387">Vohs et al., 2008</xref>) and optimism has been related to persistence in educational efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431612449387">Carver et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the majority of research on predictors of persistence has focused on these types of internal traits, family factors have also been found to be predictive of persistence. Even infants as young as 6 months old who had mothers who were sensitive to the child’s need and who fostered social and emotional growth were found to have infants with higher levels of persistence in exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612449387">Banerjee &amp; Tamis-Lemonda, 2007</xref>). Studies examining mothers and their preschool children have found that emotional support and transfer of responsibility were positively correlated with persistence and good behavior in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431612449387">Neitzel &amp; Stright, 2003</xref>) and maternal avoidance was associated with greater frustration and reduced persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612449387">Dennis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As was mentioned earlier, one of the primary characteristics of SDT is the description of an individual choosing and persisting toward self-defined goals when the motivation is autonomous or self-generated. Several decades of parenting literature suggests that an authoritative parenting style (characterized by high warmth and expectations, with appropriate levels of autonomy granting) promotes more self-directed choice in children, but few have linked authoritative parenting with persistence. However, recent research has found that parents who engaged in patient, positive, and supportive interactions in a joint task were found to have teenagers who were more likely to persist in that specific task and in overall school performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431612449387">Hutt, Wang, &amp; Evans, 2009</xref>) and parental autonomy granting has been found to be predictive of persistence in college-aged students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431612449387">Ratelle, Larose, Guay, &amp; Senécal, 2005</xref>). This emerging research suggests that having warm and supportive parents who strategically use autonomy combined with appropriate levels of structure is likely associated with children who are persistent. In other words, it is important for parents to adequately structure their interactions so that adolescents learn that consistent behaviors are related to consistent outcomes (a key component of persistence) and that parents allow adequate autonomy so that adolescents feel their behavioral choices are self-generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431612449387">Grusec &amp; Goodnow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431612449387">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the current study seeks to fill an important gap in the existing research. While experimental studies highlight aspects of parenting that might lead to task persistence, they tell us less about the development of persistent behavior and how parenting might be related to long-term persistence (as opposed to task persistence in a one-time laboratory setting). In addition, as is often the case in parenting and adolescent literatures, researchers often write about parenting as if contributions from both parents are homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612449387">Day &amp; Padilla-Walker, 2009</xref>). Following the lead of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431612449387">Stoltz, Barber, and Olsen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431612449387">Steinberg and Silk (2002)</xref>, we suggest that as children move into the teen years and then into young adulthood, the influence of the mothers’ and fathers’ parenting strategies may shift. For example, research has suggested that mothering has a stronger influence on both boys’ and girls’ prosocial behavior (Hastings, McShane, Parker, &amp; Ladha, 2007) and hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612449387">Day &amp; Padilla-Walker, 2009</xref>) than does fathering. In like manner, father involvement has been found to explain unique variance in behavioral and externalizing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612449387">Day &amp; Padilla-Walker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0272431612449387">Williams &amp; Kelly, 2005</xref>). Thus, when examining parenting as a predictor of persistence during adolescence, we sought to understand the potentially differential impact of mothers and fathers in the development of persistence and positive behavioral outcomes.</p>

<title>Benefits of Persistence</title>
<p>Research highlights numerous positive outcomes related to persistence. In adults, higher levels of persistence have been correlated with greater educational attainment and fewer career changes over the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431612449387">Duckworth &amp; Quinn, 2009</xref>). In addition, individuals displaying persistence have been found to be more likely to attain difficult goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431612449387">Bandura, 1977</xref>), to have increased enjoyment and appreciation for subsequent tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>), to have enhanced abilities and proficiencies for a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431612449387">Aronson &amp; Mills, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431612449387">Bandura, 1977</xref>), and to have higher levels of self-efficacy and pride in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0272431612449387">Williams &amp; Desteno, 2008</xref>). However, the majority of these findings focus on adults; although a small body of research suggests that adolescence is a key developmental age during which persistence emerges and influences positive outcomes. Namely, persistence during adolescence is associated with higher grade point average, better class retention, and more involvement in extracurricular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431612449387">Duggan &amp; Pickering, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0272431612449387">Zhang &amp; Zhang, 2003</xref>), and is inversely correlated with hours watching television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431612449387">Duckworth &amp; Quinn, 2009</xref>). Taken together, the majority of existing research on persistence during adolescence has focused on academic benefits, although it is likely that a willingness to persist with long-term goals despite challenges is related to a number of additional behavioral outcomes. As many of these behavioral patterns are initiated in early adolescence, the current study sought to extend current research by examining the role of persistence on school engagement as well as on adolescents’ prosocial behavior and delinquency.</p>
<sec id="section4-0272431612449387">
<title>School engagement</title>
<p>Multiple studies show strong correlations between academic achievement and high levels of persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431612449387">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431612449387">Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431612449387">Rayle, Kurpius, &amp; Arredondo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431612449387">Tracy &amp; Robbins, 2006</xref>). Specifically, young children in preschool and first grade who were rated high in task persistence were also found to have higher standardized test scores and cognitive performance achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431612449387">Deater-Deckard, Petrill, Thompson, &amp; DeThorne, 2005</xref>). In adolescence, higher GPA has been linked to greater internal locus of control and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431612449387">Oliver, Guerin, &amp; Gottfried, 2007</xref>), and during the college years persistent individuals have shown higher levels of school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431612449387">Blecher, 2006</xref>). Thus, consistent with a growing body of existing research, it was expected in the current study that persistence during adolescence would be associated with higher levels of school engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272431612449387">
<title>Prosocial behavior</title>
<p>Although research on prosocial behavior (or voluntary behavior meant to benefit another) has highlighted the importance of moral emotions such as empathy and self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431612449387">Eisenberg, Fabes, &amp; Spinrad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011</xref>), relatively less research has focused on specific motivations or behaviors that might promote prosocial behavior (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431612449387">Walker &amp; Frimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0272431612449387">Walker &amp; Hennig, 2004</xref>). Research does suggest, however, that often individuals are limited in their willingness to help because of fear, low self-efficacy, or ambiguity of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431612449387">Staub, 1995</xref>), and that those who consistently help are seen as both dependable and dedicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0272431612449387">Walker &amp; Hennig, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that individuals who are persistent would be more likely to initiate prosocial behavior because they are willing to push through the initial setbacks of doubt and ambiguity that often accompany the decision of whether or not to help an individual with whom one is not acquainted. In addition, many prosocial behaviors, especially extended volunteer service, often require individuals to persist through difficult situations and learn the individual needs of those whom they are helping, which can be especially challenging if the target of the extended helping is in special need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431612449387">Sturmer, Snyder, &amp; Omoto, 2005</xref>). Thus, adolescents who are persistent might be more likely to initiate and maintain extended volunteer service, despite the knowledge that it will be challenging and may have potential setbacks, whereas others may shy away from such experiences because of the known challenges. Taken together, we thought it possible that adolescents who had higher levels of persistence would also have higher levels of prosocial behavior toward strangers.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272431612449387">
<title>Delinquency</title>
<p>Adolescent delinquency in the current study is defined as adolescents’ violation of rules or laws, including underage drinking, smoking, drug use, and minor infractions such as lying, stealing, and fighting. Although it is clear that persistence is related to positive outcomes during adolescence, relatively less research has examined persistence as a protective factor against negative outcomes. However, limited research has found that young children with behavior problems who were taught skills in planning, persistence, and flexibility ultimately showed lower levels of behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431612449387">Castillo, Holmes, Cuccaro, &amp; Gardner, 1997</xref>) and that task persistence in children was negatively correlated with behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431612449387">Deater-Deckard et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the self-regulatory aspects of persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>) may be key in the avoidance of delinquent behavior, especially among adolescents who developmentally have a tendency to place the benefits of delinquent behavior above the costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431612449387">Cauffman &amp; Steinberg, 2000</xref>). Thus, similar to findings in younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431612449387">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431612449387">Deater-Deckard et al., 2005</xref>), it is possible that adolescents who are more impulsive and less willing to persist in order to earn or achieve a desired long-term goal, are more likely to cheat, steal, and lash out aggressively to get what they desire. Therefore, in the current study we explored the possibility that persistence would be negatively related to adolescents’ delinquent behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section7-0272431612449387">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was threefold. First, we sought to examine the role of parenting style in the development of adolescent persistence over time. Given the research suggesting that parenting consisting of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431612449387">Hutt et al., 2009</xref>), structure, and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431612449387">Ratelle et al., 2005</xref>) promotes adolescent task persistence, it was expected that authoritative parenting by both mothers and fathers would also lead to the development of higher persistence in adolescents, and that these relationships would hold even after controlling for commonly assessed predictors of persistence (i.e., self-regulation, optimism, and self esteem). As was indicated earlier, fathering and mothering have been found to be differentially related to adolescent outcomes, so although we thought it possible that parenting would be differentially related to persistence as a function of parent gender, specific hypotheses were not made in this regard.</p>
<p>Second, we sought to extend the examination of achievement outcomes of persistence by focusing on how adolescent persistence was related to school engagement, prosocial behavior, and delinquency over time. Based on existing research it was expected that adolescent persistence would be related to higher levels of school engagement and prosocial behavior, and lower levels of delinquency, and that these relationships would hold after controlling for self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Third, we hypothesized that persistence would mediate the effects of parenting on target outcomes. That is, we hypothesized that effective parenting would influence both persistence <italic>and</italic> the target outcome in positive ways but that the impact on adolescent outcomes might be indirect. Research has supported links between authoritative parenting and a host of positive outcomes, including school engagement, prosocial behavior, and lower levels of delinquency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431612449387">Baumrind, 1991</xref>). However, research suggests that the influence of parenting during adolescence is more accurately represented by indirect effects through adolescents’ own personal behaviors that have developed over time, partially as an effect of socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431612449387">Eisenberg, Cumberland, Guthrie, Murphy, &amp; Shepard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker, Hardy, &amp; Christensen, 2011</xref>). Indeed, it is the goal of socialization and internalization for children to act on self-motivated and generated values and behaviors rather than as a function of external regulation from parents. Thus, we expected the relationship between parenting and child outcomes to be at least partially explained by adolescents’ persistence.</p>

<sec id="section9-0272431612449387">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Because not all variables used in the current study were available at Time 1, the participants for this study were taken from Times 2, 3, and 4 of the Flourishing Families Project (FFP). The FFP is a longitudinal study of family life involving 325 two-parent families with a child between the ages of 11 and 14 at Time 2 (mean age of child = 12.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.06, 52% female), 96% of whom had complete data for Time 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 314). Each time point was approximately 1 year apart (mean age of child at Time 4 = 14.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.05). Only two-parent families were selected from the larger sample because father data were not available in single-parent families. Regarding ethnicity, 79% of the participants were European American, 5% were African American, 5% were Asian American, 2% were Hispanic, and 9% indicated that they were “mixed/biracial” or of another ethnicity. Ninety-five percent of mothers and 90% of fathers reported being biological parents, 4% of mothers and 5% of fathers reported being adoptive parents, and 1% of mothers and 5% of fathers reported being stepparents. Fourteen percent of families reported an income less than US$25,000 per year, 16% made between US$25,000 and US$50,000 a year, and 70% made more than US$50,000 per year, with 21% of mothers and 5% of fathers reporting being unemployed. In terms of education, 70% of mothers and fathers reported having a bachelor’s degree or higher.</p>

<sec id="section10-0272431612449387">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participant families for the Flourishing Families Project were selected from a (masked) and were interviewed during the first 8 months of 2007 for Time 1, and approximately 1 year later for Times 2, 3, and 4. At Time 1, all families were contacted directly using a multistage recruitment protocol. Of the 692 eligible families contacted, 423 agreed to participate, resulting in a 61% response rate. For more information regarding participant selection, please see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker, Harper, &amp; Bean, 2011</xref>). At each wave of data collection, interviewers visited the family’s home and conducted an assessment interview that included video-taped interactions (not used in current study), as well as questionnaires that were completed in the home (participants were encouraged to complete questionnaires in separate rooms and not to discuss answers during administration). The most frequent reasons cited by families for not wanting to participate in the study were lack of time and concerns about privacy. It is important to note that there were very few missing data at any time point. As interviewers collected each segment of the in-home interview, questionnaires were screened for missing answers and double marking. Multiple imputation with 200 data sets was used in the software package Mplus 6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431612449387">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>) to deal with missing values where necessary (Mplus was used to fit all models). Multiple imputation has emerged as the preferred method of handling missing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431612449387">Acock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431612449387">McKnight, McKnight, Sidani, &amp; Figueredo, 2007</xref>). However, as a comparison, the Mplus full information maximum likelihood method was also used, finding no substantial differences in results from the multiple imputation method.</p>

<sec id="section11-0272431612449387">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Adolescents completed measures of their own persistence and prosocial behavior, as well as self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem. Mothers and fathers completed measures of their own authoritative parenting, and adolescents and parents completed measures of the adolescents’ school engagement and delinquency.</p>
<sec id="section12-0272431612449387">
<title>Authoritative parenting</title>
<p>Mothers’ and fathers’ connection, regulation, and autonomy were measured at Time 2 using three subscales from the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire-Short Version (PSDQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431612449387">Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, &amp; Hart, 2001</xref>). Parents were asked how often they did certain behaviors relating to authoritative parenting such as, “I am responsive to my child’s feelings and needs” for connection, “I emphasize the reasons for rules” for regulation, and “I take my child’s desires into account before asking him/her to do something” for autonomy. Responses range on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always</italic>), with higher scores indicating higher levels of maternal and paternal (respectively) connection (α = .78, .78), regulation (α = .82, .84), and autonomy (α = .75, .79), which were used as indicators of latent variables representing authoritative mothering and fathering. All factor loadings were above 0.70.</p>

<sec id="section13-0272431612449387">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Adolescents’ reports of their own self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem were assessed at Time 2 and used as control variables. Self-regulation was assessed using 12 items (α = .95) assessing emotional, behavioral, and cognitive self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431612449387">Novak &amp; Clayton, 2001</xref>) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never true</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always true</italic>). Sample items include, “I have difficulty controlling my temper,” and “I think about the future consequences of my actions.” Optimism was assessed using 10 items (α = .86) from the hope/optimism subscale of the Inventory of Strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>very much like me</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much unlike me</italic>). Sample items include “I always look on the bright side,” and “I expect the best.” Adolescents’ self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431612449387">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>). Adolescents responded to 10 items (α = .87) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Sample items include, “I certainly feel useless at times,” and “On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.”</p>

<sec id="section14-0272431612449387">
<title>Persistence</title>
<p>Adolescents’ persistence was assessed at Time 3 using adolescent reports (α = .86) of 8 items from the Industry and Perseverance subscale of the Inventory of Strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). Likert-type scale responses ranged from 1 (<italic>very much unlike me</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much like me</italic>), with higher scores reflecting a stronger sense of persistence. Sample questions included, “I am a goal oriented person,” and “When I get what I want, it is because I have worked hard for it.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272431612449387">
<title>Prosocial behavior</title>
<p>Adolescents’ prosocial behavior toward strangers was measured at Time 2 and 4 using child-report of 9 items (α = .85) from the Kindness and Generosity subscale of the Inventory of Strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612449387">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). Respondents answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>not like me at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much like me</italic>) in terms of how much they disagreed or agreed with statements about themselves. Sample statements included: “I help people I don’t know, even if it is not easy for me,” and “I voluntarily help my neighbors.”</p>

<sec id="section16-0272431612449387">
<title>School engagement</title>
<p>Adolescents’ level of emotional and behavioral functioning at school was assessed at Time 2 and Time 4 using mother (α = .88), father (α = .89), and child (α = .85) reports of the School Engagement Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431612449387">Fredericks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004</xref>).

<p>Bivariate correlations, means, and standard deviations were also conducted on all variables of interest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431612449387">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted that all aspects of parenting at Time 2 were positively associated with persistence at Time 3, as were self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem. It should also be noted that persistence at Time 3 was positively correlated with all reports of school engagement at Time 4, and with prosocial behavior at Time 4, and was negatively correlated with all reports of delinquency at Time 4. However, because these correlations did not control for behavioral outcomes at an earlier time point, we sought to understand the multivariate and longitudinal relationships between these variables using path analysis via structural equation modeling. Due to the numerous gender differences found above, gender of the child was examined as a moderator of these path models.</p>

<title>Measurement model</title>
<p>To test for latent variable invariance as a function of child gender, multigroup models were estimated and compared using χ<sup>2</sup> difference tests. Latent variables were created for authoritative parenting (mother and father), school engagement (at Times 2 and 4), and delinquency (at Times 2 and 4). Standard procedures were used to examine invariance in the latent variables across intercepts, factor loadings, and residual variances (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431612449387">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>, p. 433). Invariance test revealed that only the residuals of delinquency and authoritative parenting (mother and father) should be allowed to vary across groups. The model was therefore constrained across factor loadings, intercepts, and school engagement residuals and led to an acceptable fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(252) = 396.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, RMSEA = 0.060, SRMR = 0.068. Given this model, latent variable means were allowed to vary between groups (boy means constrained to 0 with girl means freely estimated). Boys and girls did not differ in mean levels of mother and father authoritative parenting but did differ in school engagement, with girls having greater engagement at Time 2 (<inline-formula id="inline-formula13-0272431612449387">

<title>Structural model</title>
<p>Next, a structural model was estimated modeling authoritative mothering and fathering (as well as self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem) at Time 2 as predictors of persistence at Time 3, and adolescents’ school engagement, prosocial behavior, and delinquency at Time 4 (behavioral outcomes were controlled for at Time 2). In turn, adolescents’ persistence at Time 3 was examined as a predictor of adolescents’ behaviors at Time 4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431612449387">Figure 1</xref>). Family income and adolescent ethnicity and gender were examined as possible control variables. However, including them in the model resulted in no significant paths and no increase in model fit, so they were dropped in the final model. To test for path differences as a function of gender, each path was constrained across gender groups and the significance of the χ<sup>2</sup> difference was calculated. None of the path constraints led to a reduction in model fit except the path from delinquency at Time 2 to delinquency at Time 4. It was therefore allowed to vary across groups (the path coefficient was greater for girls than boys, <italic>b</italic> = 1.13 vs. <italic>b</italic> = .88). The final model with these constraints yielded acceptable fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(438) = 744.224, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, RMSEA = 0.066, SRMR = 0.072.</p>

<p>Results revealed that authoritative fathering at Time 2 was positively related to persistence at Time 3 (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), even after controlling for internal traits shown to be important for persistence. In terms of these controls, self-regulation (β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and optimism (β = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) at Time 2 were positively related to persistence at Time 3. In addition, persistence at Time 3 was positively related to school engagement (β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), marginally to prosocial behavior (β = .10, <italic>p =</italic> .09), and negatively related to delinquency (β = −.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) at Time 4 (controlling for these outcomes at Time 2). It should also be noted that paths between Time 2 and Time 4 school engagement (β = .80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), prosocial behavior (β = .53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and delinquency (β = .62 for boys, β = .72 for girls, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were all statistically significant. The Mplus command “IND” was used to determine indirect effects, and results suggested that fathering was indirectly related to school engagement (<italic>b</italic> = .03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and marginally to delinquency (<italic>b</italic> = −.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) via adolescent persistence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent theory has encouraged the field to not only seek for the discovery of treatments for mental health impairments and to examine the lack of negative outcomes such as delinquency and depression, but also to explore positive behaviors that are associated with well-being in children and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431612449387">Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>). In an attempt to continue to move the field beyond a deficit model of adolescent development, the current study highlighted the importance of the positive adolescent behavior of persistence and found support for its importance during this key developmental time period.</p>
<sec id="section24-0272431612449387">
<title>The Socialization of Persistence</title>
<p>Our first hypothesis suggested that authoritative parenting would be associated with persistence over time. Although we did not have sufficient a priori knowledge based on past research to make specific predictions in regard to the potential differential effects of mothering and fathering on persistence, results suggested that in the multivariate model, mothers’ parenting was not significantly related to persistence, but fathers’ parenting at Time 2 (even after controlling for self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem), was significantly related to persistence at Time 3. These analyses add to the growing body of literature suggesting that the effects of fathers’ and mothers’ parenting may vary as a function of the adolescent outcome. It is possible that as children reach middle adolescence, the father’s role may become better defined in relation to outcomes such as persistence. Although mothers have been found to be importantly related to positive outcomes such as prosocial behavior, hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612449387">Day &amp; Padilla-Walker, 2009</xref>), and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011</xref>), fathers’ parenting style has been found to protect adolescents against negative outcomes such as externalizing behavior and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612449387">Day &amp; Padilla-Walker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0272431612449387">Williams &amp; Kelly, 2005</xref>) and to promote other constructs related to persistence, such as self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that persistence may be another behavior that is more clearly influenced by fathers than it is mothers, and indeed, may be one of the mechanisms through which fathers help to protect their children. Although the current findings suggest direct links, parenting styles are defined as the overarching emotional climate of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431612449387">Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1993</xref>), so it is possible that fathers’ authoritative parenting style creates a healthy climate that increases the effectiveness of specific parenting practices fathers may use to promote persistence. Perhaps fathers’ daily interaction and involvement with children (which often differs from that of mothers’) during activities such as athletics or academics are associated with persistence, and this relationship is facilitated by an authoritative parenting style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431612449387">Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1993</xref>). Future research should continue to examine micro-level aspects of the parent-child relationship and specific parenting practices to more clearly understand how fathers socialize positive behaviors such as persistence.</p>

<title>Longitudinal Benefits of Persistence</title>
<p>Our second hypothesis suggested that persistence would be longitudinally related to higher levels of school engagement and prosocial behavior, and to lower levels of delinquency, even when controlling for self-regulation, optimism, and self-esteem. This hypothesis was partially supported, as higher levels of persistence were predictive of school engagement and lower delinquency but only marginally associated with prosocial behavior over time. These findings are consistent with research suggesting that persistence is an important correlate of academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431612449387">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431612449387">Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431612449387">Rayle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431612449387">Tracey &amp; Robbins, 2006</xref>) and extend existing research to include school engagement. Although the current study did not examine IQ, research has suggested that persistence may be as important as intelligence in determining positive academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431612449387">Howe, 1999</xref>) and may be partially responsible for variability in academic achievement among those with similar levels of intelligence. Given the current findings, it is possible that the role of persistence on academic achievement may be due to its impact on school engagement, which has been shown to be an important predictor of academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431612449387">Ladd &amp; Dinella, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to confirming the role of persistence in academic success, the current study extended existing research by suggesting that persistence was related to delinquency over time. These findings are especially important given that variables such as self-regulation (which has been repeatedly linked to delinquent behavior; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0272431612449387">Vazsonyi &amp; Huang, 2010</xref>) were controlled in the current analysis and suggest that persistence may play a role in avoiding negative behaviors as well as promoting positive behaviors. Although there is little research in this regard, it is intuitive that those who are less willing to persist in the face of challenging situations may be more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors to get what they desire rather than continuing toward a long term goal despite difficulties. Future research should continue to examine the role of persistence as it is related to both negative and positive outcomes, and although persistence was only marginally related to prosocial behavior in the current study, it is possible that the relationship between persistence and prosocial behavior is concurrent rather than longitudinal or that the current measure of prosocial behavior did not adequately assess the type of prosocial behavior (e.g., lengthy volunteer service) that may be more strongly associated with persistence. As explained earlier, self-determination theory suggests that the emergence of persistence should be seen within the context of the adolescent choosing the activity rather than being forced to engage or engaging out of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431612449387">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>). Future research should return to this theme and explore different difficult tasks teens may face (such as sports or school achievement) while taking into account the effect of whether the choice to continue advanced level activities is a choice the adolescent is making, or one that is being made for them, and how this might be related to persistence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0272431612449387">
<title>Persistence as a Mediator Between Parenting and Child Outcomes</title>
<p>Our final hypothesis predicted that persistence would mediate the effects of parenting on target outcomes, and results partially supported this hypothesis by suggesting that fathers’ authoritative parenting style was indirectly related to school engagement and delinquency (marginally) as a function of fathers’ efforts to influence persistence. This finding is consistent with existing research suggesting that adolescents’ own emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker &amp; Christensen, 2011</xref>) and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431612449387">Padilla-Walker, Bean, &amp; Hsieh, 2011</xref>) are often important mediators between parenting and adolescent outcomes and adds to research by highlighting adolescent persistence as another potentially important mechanism through which parents exert their influence during adolescence. Future research should continue to examine persistence as a mediator between parenting and diverse adolescent outcomes, and these relationships should be examined over a variety of time points. It is possible that mediation at a single time point is stronger than over a period of three years, as in the current study, but it is also possible that persistence is not fully self-motivated by early adolescence and that parenting and other influences in early adolescence are associated with the gradual development of persistent behavior into adulthood.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Limitations</title>
<p>Although the current findings add significantly to our understanding of persistence during adolescence, this study is not without limitations. One limitation is that the current study examined a relatively homogeneous sample of intact families (e.g., in terms or race and income), limiting the generalizability of the findings. Given that parenting often looks different and functions somewhat differently as a function of race and ethnicity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431612449387">Huebner &amp; Howell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612449387">Jackson-Newsom, Buchanan, &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>), it is possible that persistence is socialized through different means for some family types than others. For example, in families where parents anticipate hardship for their children (such as in cases of expected discrimination), it is possible that persistence is more strongly stressed and/or is socialized differently. Thus, it is possible that relationships between parenting, persistence, and socialization might differ for families of different ethnicities or for single-parent families. These possibilities should be examined in future research. That being said, although not assessed in the current study, we suggest that these findings may contain an important message with regard to the role of single fathers in the lives of their adolescent children. Even when fathers are not in the home on a consistent basis (for whatever reason), it may advantage the child if the father takes the lead in promoting the notion that life is difficult, but the rewards for persisting are significant. It is possible that nonresident fathers can demonstrate the qualities of persistence by showing their children over time that they are willing to remain engaged even when it is difficult. Future research should more carefully explore this possibility, as well as the possibility that without the influence of a father, for example, in the case of a single mother, mothering may instead be importantly related to adolescent persistence. Finally, although the current study benefitted from using multiple reporters on several of the outcome variables, findings were based on self-reports of all behaviors, which may be affected by social desirability. Thus, future research should also consider behavioral observations, especially in relation to parenting behaviors.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study adds to the literature in several important ways. The primary finding of this study was the highlighting of persistence as a positive adolescent behavior that is associated with both school engagement and delinquency net of other traits that have been found to be strongly related to persistence and adolescent outcomes. Persistence has been an understudied aspect of children’s positive psychological makeup, and this study adds to the growing literature that shows its relevance and importance in understanding adolescents’ choices to engage in school and in prosocial or benevolent behavior toward others and to stay out of harm’s way with regard to problem behavior. Predictors of persistent behaviors, including parenting, should be studied in depth during the formative years, as persistence is importantly associated with child well-being and success and should continue to be examined developmentally as children make the transition to adulthood.</p>
