<abstract>
<p>In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in sheep pulmonary artery. Acute (30 min) and prolonged (24 h) exposure of arterial rings to EPA (30 μM) significantly decreased potassium chloride (KCl)-induced relaxation, an index of functional Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. In acute exposure, the pD<sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (the maximal response) values for KCl-induced relaxation were 3.21 ± 0.33 and 61.58 ± 11.30% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) versus control 3.58 ± 0.07 and 82.44 ± 2.36% (<italic>n</italic> = 24), respectively. The pD<sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values for KCl-induced relaxation in arterial rings exposed to EPA for 24 h in organ culture were 2.52 ± 0.11 and 55.00 ± 5.72% versus control 3.04 ± 0.19 and 80.74 ± 11.96%, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 4. Exposure of the arterial rings to EPA (30 μM) for 24 h in organ culture, significantly decreased (17.58 ± 2.15%) the protein expression of α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Acute exposure to EPA for 30 min significantly decreased (21.06 ± 5.89%) the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity as measured by inorganic phosphate (Pi) release. EPA, up to 100 μM concentration, marginally (&lt;10% of 80 mM KCl contraction) increased the basal tone of the pulmonary artery. Additionally, EPA (10–30 μM) had no effect on Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity as well as on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. All these results show that EPA has inhibitory effect on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in sheep pulmonary artery but prolonged exposure had no additional effect on sodium pump, and EPA-induced inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may be due to attenuation in protein expression of α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase independent of cGMP production.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fish oils and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protect against several types of cardiovascular diseases such as, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis and hypertension. It is widely accepted that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is the one of the active biological components of these effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327111417909">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111417909"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111417909">3</xref></sup> EPA has got both vasodilator (bovine coronary artery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111417909">4</xref></sup> and rat aorta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327111417909">5</xref></sup>) and vasoconstrictor (rabbit pulmonary vascular bed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111417909">6</xref></sup>) effects. While the vasodilator action of the fatty acid has been shown to be mediated by endothelium-dependent (sheep pulmonary artery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111417909">7</xref></sup>) and -independent mechanisms, the pathways involved in the vasoconstrictor action are not clearly understood. Nevertheless, dietary supplementation with EPA has been shown to impair endothelium-dependent dilations to acetylcholine (ACh) in the coronary microvessels of guinea pig.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111417909">8</xref></sup> Further, fish oil supplementation produces an increase in arterial pressure via peripheral vasoconstriction and that the vascular response to α-adrenergic stimulation is exaggerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111417909">9</xref></sup> The Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase has been hypothesized to play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111417909">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327111417909">11</xref></sup> Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase modulation is important in vascular smooth muscles, because it re-establishes the resting membrane potential by regulating intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, which in turn regulates the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, the enzyme is important in the regulation of vascular tone and contractility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327111417909">12</xref></sup> For instance, stimulation of the plasmalemmal Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in vascular smooth muscle causes membrane hyperpolarization that consequently reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels leading to vasodilation. Alternately, vascular smooth muscle relaxation through stimulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is mediated by the activation of Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange mechanism, which in turn reduces the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. On the contrary, inhibition of the enzyme produces vascular contractility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327111417909">13</xref></sup> EPA has inhibitory effect on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in different tissues like human endothelial cells, synaptosomal membranes isolated from rat cerebral cortex and isolated basolateral membranes from rat duodenal enterocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327111417909">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327111417909"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111417909">16</xref></sup> However, there is limited information on the effect of EPA on vascular Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Therefore, the first objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of EPA on functional Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and its activity in sheep pulmonary artery. A high concentration of ouabain (500 nM), which would inhibit the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, produced smooth muscle depolarization, indicating that this isoform is active under basal conditions in the rat mesenteric artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111417909">17</xref></sup> Recently, data published from our laboratory showed that inhibition of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by ouabain significantly increased the basal tone and 5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (5-HT)-induced contractility in the sheep pulmonary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111417909">18</xref></sup> Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the low-affinity isoform α<sub>1</sub> regulates basal tone, as well as agonist-induced contractility in the sheep pulmonary artery. Keeping these points in view, the second objective was to study the effect of EPA on α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in respect to protein expression. The third question was that whether EPA would modify the vascular tone in this vessel.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0960327111417909">
<title>Blood vessel preparation</title>
<p>Lungs from freshly slaughtered adult sheep were collected from the local slaughterhouse in cold (4–6°C) oxygenated modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (MKHS) of the following composition: sodium chloride (NaCl) 118 mM, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.7 mM, calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) 2.5 mM, magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) 1.2 mM, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) 11.9 mM, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) 1.2 mM and <sc>d</sc>-glucose 11.1 mM (pH 7.4). Second-generation intralobar pulmonary arteries were dissected from lungs, cleared of connective tissue, and cut into rings of about 2–3 mm length. As soon as the sheep were killed, lungs were collected within 10 min in cold MKHS and intralobar second-generation pulmonary artery was isolated from the lung within 30 min. After isolation of artery, immediately it was mounted on isometric force transducer for the experiment. Arteries were obtained from adult sheep weighing 30–40 kg from the local slaughterhouse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0960327111417909">
<title>Tension experiments</title>
<p>Arterial rings of 2–3 mm were prepared from second-generation intrapulmonary arteries. Rings were mounted between two L-shaped stainless steel hooks (30 gauge) under a resting tension of 1.5 g in a thermostatically controlled (37.0 ± 0.5°C) organ bath of 10 ml capacity containing MKHS and continuously aerated with carbogen (95% oxygen [O<sub>2</sub>] + 5% carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>]). Experiments were done in endothelium-denuded pulmonary artery rings. Endothelium was removed by mechanical rubbing with a cotton swab. Removal of endothelium was confirmed by demonstrating the absence of relaxation to ACh (10 μM). Following the removal of endothelium, most of the tissues contracted with ACh. The arterial rings were equilibrated for 90 min with a repeated replacement of bath solution every 15–20 min. A high sensitivity force displacement transducer (model MLT0202/D; PowerLab, CastleHill, Australia) measured the change in tension, and the data were recorded in a personal computer (PC) using chart version 4.1.2 software program (PowerLab).</p>

<title>Functional sodium pump analysis</title>
<p>KCl-induced relaxation in vascular rings, contracted with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution plus agonist has been used for the assessment of functional sodium pump.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111417909">19</xref></sup> In brief, after equilibration, pulmonary arterial rings were exposed to K<sup>+</sup>-free solution (MKHS in which KCl and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> were replaced with equimolar concentration of NaCl and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, respectively) for 30 min. At the declining phase of the K<sup>+</sup>-free contracture, 5-HT (0.1 μM) was added to maintain a steady level of contraction. At the plateau phase of contraction, KCl (10<sup>−5</sup>–10<sup>−2</sup> M) was added cumulatively at an increment of 0.5 log unit to elicit relaxation which was expressed as per cent reversal of contraction elicited with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution plus 5-HT. To study the influence of EPA in modifying sodium pump function, vessels were incubated with 30 μM of this drug for 30 min in K<sup>+</sup>-free solution before steady state contraction with 5-HT was elicited.</p>

<title>Organ culture</title>
<p>Second-generation pulmonary arteries were isolated in laminar flow to avoid the contamination. After cleaning the artery in modified Krebs–Hensleit’s solution, the arteries were cut into rings (approximately 2–3 mm). Arterial rings were then placed in 2 ml Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin in 24-well culture plate. The arterial rings were maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h (water jacketed CO<sub>2</sub> incubator).</p>

The pellet consisting of microsomes was resuspended in appropriate (depending on pellet size) volume of homogenization buffer and protein concentration was determined by Lowry’s method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327111417909">20</xref></sup> For Western blot, microsomal fractions were electrophoresed at a constant voltage on a linear gradient polyacrylamide gel (5–15%) with a stacking gel of 3.3% polyacrylamide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111417909">21</xref></sup> Proteins were transferred from gel onto nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) and the electroblot performed at 200 V for 1.5 h in a water-cooled transfer apparatus. The membrane was then blocked in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in 0.05% phosphate buffered saline [PBS]-Tween) for 12 h at 4°C. The NCM was incubated with primary polyclonal antibody (0.4μg/ml PBST) against α<sub>1</sub>-Na pump for 5 h at room temperature. After three washings of NCM in PBS-Tween (0.05%), detection was achieved using horseradish peroxidase (HRPO)-conjugated chicken anti-goat IgG at a concentration of 0.4 μg/ml (Santacruz Biotechnology, USA) and diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution. Quantification of α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was done using the densitometric analysis of the band, and the data are presented in per cent of the integrated density value (IDV) in control and treatment groups.</p>

The α-1 isoform was identified using goat polyclonal IgG against epitope mapping within an internal region of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α-1 of human origin. The comparison has been shown between different bands of α-1 isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase which had been treated with EPA. The proteins were quantitated using densitometry and the level of expression is expressed as per cent of integrated density value (IDV).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that (1) acute exposure to EPA (30 μM) inhibited KCl-induced relaxation in K<sup>+</sup>-free MKHS, (2) prolonged exposure (24 h) to EPA (30 μM) decreased the protein expression of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase of organ cultured vascular rings as well as KCl-induced relaxation, (3) acute exposure (30 min) to EPA (30 μM) caused an inhibition of the vascular Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, (4) EPA (10 and 30 μM) concentrations had no effect on Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity, (5) concentration of EPA (1–100 μM) caused a dose-dependent increase in basal tone of the sheep pulmonary artery, but ouabain (0.1 μM) had no effect on EPA-induced contraction in this artery and (6) EPA (30 μM) had no effect on cGMP production.</p>
<p>EPA reduced KCl-induced relaxation in sheep pulmonary artery which is an index of functional sodium pump activity. Our findings regarding inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase are supported by the inhibitory effect of EPA on other tissues such as human endothelial cells and synaptosomal membrane of cerebral cortex of rat).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327111417909">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327111417909"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111417909">16</xref></sup> This functional study is also supported by the inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity. Evaluation of enzyme kinetics (dose–response curves for ouabain) in membrane preparations allowed correlating the ouabain affinity of α<sub>1</sub> isoform with fatty acid composition. The affinity of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform for ouabain was significantly increased with accretions in the total amount of fatty acids of the n−6 series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0960327111417909">24</xref></sup> Polyunsaturated fatty acids are major components of membrane phospholipids and can modify membrane function. For example, EPA is known to increase membrane fluidity by increasing membrane cholesterol efflux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111417909">3</xref></sup> Since the dietary free fatty acid concentrations can reach 20–30 μM, the inhibitory effect induced by EPA on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in vitro may have a physiological relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0960327111417909">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0960327111417909">26</xref></sup> In addition to evaluating the acute effects of EPA on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, we also examined the influence of prolonged exposure to EPA in pulmonary artery kept in organ culture medium for 24 h, but there was no significant difference between acute and chronic exposures to EPA in isolated pulmonary artery. EPA decreased the protein expression of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in organ culture. Western blot data together with functional data relating to K<sup>+</sup>-induced relaxation showed inhibition of protein expression due to EPA. It is, therefore, possible that prolonged exposure to EPA may alter gene regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. The change in the density of the receptor may be one of the mechanisms for the change in the expression. This change in the density of the receptor may lead to change in the gene expression and regulation. EPA appears to inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the pulmonary artery through attenuation of expression of α-1 isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Organ culture is a useful method for analyzing the long-term effects of various pharmacological agents on vasculature and basic biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0960327111417909">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is known that inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase increases basal tone in several vascular smooth muscles. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the EPA used in the present study may increase the tone of sheep pulmonary vessel through inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. However, such a possibility appears to be remote from the observation that near maximal inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by ouabain (0.1 μM) barely had any effect on the basal tone of pulmonary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111417909">18</xref></sup> Therefore, a marginal increase in pulmonary artery vascular tone by 30 μM EPA may not relate to inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. We recently reported that ouabain enhanced the contractility to the vasoconstrictor 5-HT in the sheep pulmonary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111417909">18</xref></sup> EPA had no effect on cGMP production that means the role of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity is ruled out in the inhibitory mechanism.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of the present study show that EPA inhibits functional Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, its activity and protein expression of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in pulmonary vessel. EPA-induced inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may be due to attenuation in protein expression of the α<sub>1</sub> isoform of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, but it is independent of cGMP production. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase may have no role in the KCl-induced relaxation. But prolonged exposure had no additional effect on sodium pump.</p>
<p>However, the influence of this EPA on the myogenic tone appears not to be related to the inhibition of the sodium pump. The activity of this fatty acid observed in the present study is of clinical significance in the management of vascular diseases.</p>
