<abstract>
<p>The authors compared involvement in educational planning and use of self-determination strategies reported by two groups of students attending a high-poverty, predominately Black high school: 19 students with severe intellectual disabilities and 20 general education seniors who were identified as successful. Findings revealed that special education students participated in few activities (e.g., general or career education classes, transition activities, or employment) on a daily basis outside their self-contained special education classes. Special education students were significantly less likely than their general education peers to report involvement in educational planning activities or use of self-determination strategies. Although successful general education peers did take an active and self-determined role in their high school education, they represented only 20 of 114 members of their graduating senior class. Findings are discussed in relation to increasing efforts to promote self-determination and resilience among students with severe intellectual disabilities and their general education peers who are attending high-poverty high schools.</p>

<p>Increasing numbers of public school students in the United States are being identified as low income or living in poverty, as determined by their eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. Low-income students now comprise the majority of the public school population in the South and in three Western states (i.e., California, New Mexico, and Oregon) and, nationally, 46% of the public school population is low income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885728811420135">Suitts, 2007</xref>). In addition, in the South and several Western states, White public school students are now in the minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885728811420135">National Center for Education Statistics, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811420135">Orfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885728811420135">Suitts, 2010</xref>). By 2020, the majority of U.S. public school students are expected to be of color—and low income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811420135">Ball, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885728811420135">National Center for Education Statistics, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885728811420135">Suitts, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Growing up in an impoverished home or blighted neighborhood can have profound influences on youth, including poor academic performance, school dropout, unemployment, substance abuse, and incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885728811420135">Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885728811420135">Sharkey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885728811420135">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Stressors associated with concentrated poverty—presence of crime, persistent joblessness, limited health care and transportation, and inadequate housing and recreation options—affect youth and family members’ mental and physical health, producing anxiety, hypertension, fear, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811420135">Barton &amp; Coley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885728811420135">Shipler, 2004</xref>). Chronic poverty also limits opportunities for youth to be actively involved in their communities and participate in sports and other recreational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811420135">Hughes &amp; Avoke, 2010</xref>). The negative effects of poverty are especially salient for students with disabilities who are disproportionately members of low-income, single-parent, and racially or ethnically diverse homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885728811420135">Fujiura &amp; Yamaki, 2000</xref>). These students face additional challenges related to disability, such as a gamut of medical, communication, cognitive, and other support needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885728811420135">Emerson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885728811420135">Parish, Rose, &amp; Andrews, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Students from low-income neighborhoods are also more likely to attend schools that are racially and ethnically segregated and have limited resources and low graduation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811420135">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811420135">Orfield, 2009</xref>). These schools—typically located in communities with low property tax revenues to finance education—are historically underfunded and understaffed and have the highest dropout rates reported nationally. Almost 50% of Black and 40% of Hispanic students, as compared with only 11% of White students, attend high schools with dropout rates of 50% or more and with classmates living below the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811420135">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811420135">Orfield, 2009</xref>). Such schools are characterized by limited curricular options and rigor; teacher preparation, experience, and expectations; and parent participation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811420135">Barton &amp; Coley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885728811420135">Somers &amp; Piliawsky, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Attending a high-poverty high school is often viewed as a risk factor, especially for students from low-socioeconomic, disenfranchised backgrounds who are statistically less likely to achieve academically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811420135">Morales, 2010</xref>). Inequities associated with high-poverty schools, such as limited resources and substandard academic preparation, are widely considered as barriers to academic and postschool success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811420135">Barton &amp; Coley, 2010</xref>). Students who do succeed academically despite such adversity, although most of their classmates do not, may have more “resilience”—a combination of characteristics and assets theorized to protect or buffer an individual from the negative and debilitating effects of impoverished environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811420135">Kloep, Hendry, Gardner, &amp; Seage, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885728811420135">Lerner &amp; Benson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885728811420135">Rutter, 1987</xref>). In addition to support provided by family members or school personnel, specific attitudes associated with the concept of resilience, such as optimism or persistence, may account for students’ competence in achieving positive growth and personal outcomes despite the presence of chronic and severe adversities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885728811420135">Floyd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811420135">Kloep et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to resilience, self-determination as a psychological construct is related to successful individual performance and personal volition, particularly with respect to people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885728811420135">Walker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, self-determination is associated with positive academic, social, and adult outcomes for youth with a range of disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811420135">Fowler, Konrad, Walker, Test, &amp; Wood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885728811420135">Lachapelle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer, 2003</xref>). Consistent with a model of self-determination, individuals are seen as “causal agents” in effecting their own outcomes, such as making and acting on personal decisions or choosing to advocate for themselves. Although proponents of self-determination theory acknowledge that individuals do not have direct control over many aspects of their social or economic conditions, it is assumed that people who are self-determined can act to access resources or expertise through others to achieve desired outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885728811420135">Bandura, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885728811420135">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). The notion of achieving personal outcomes by accessing the support or influence of others is particularly relevant to people with severe disabilities who typically require extensive support to participate fully in everyday life activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885728811420135">Thompson, Wehmeyer, &amp; Hughes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, unlike resilience self-determination has not been investigated in relation to overcoming the adverse effects associated with high-poverty communities or schools, although several researchers have suggested doing so (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885728811420135">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2011</xref>). Students who are self-determined are characterized as skilled in accessing resources and supports and in speaking up for their own needs. Considering that limited resources, such as few jobs in a community or minimal college counselor availability at school, are typical of a high-poverty environment, it is more likely that individuals who assert themselves will be successful in accessing these limited opportunities. Therefore, skills that comprise self-determination, such as setting goals, problem solving, and self-advocating, may be instrumental in addressing the challenges of underresourced, high-poverty schools and neighborhoods. However, underresourced environments may hinder the development of self-determination skills because of scarce opportunities to make choices, exercise preferences, and experience stimulating and varied educational events on a consistent basis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer and colleagues (2011)</xref> further suggest that oppression, segregation, and discrimination—often associated with high-poverty environments—inhibit the development of self-determination skills, especially when coexisting with disability.</p>
<p>In response to the limited research on the effects of self-determination in relation to poverty, we examined the extent to which students attending a high-poverty high school reported use of self-determination strategies and skills related to active involvement in educational planning. As students with severe disabilities rarely have been asked about their self-determination skill use or involvement in individualized education program (IEP) planning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885728811420135">Test et al., 2004</xref>), we chose to interview a group of these students to determine the extent to which they reported exercising these skills. Furthermore, no context has been established in the literature with respect to the extent to which general education students perform these behaviors. Therefore, we asked a peer group of successful general education second-semester seniors in the same high school to assess their involvement in their 4-year education plans and how often they used self-determination strategies.</p>
<p>We also asked both groups of students to assess their sense of self-efficacy (i.e., psychological empowerment). Finally, we examined school reports to determine participation in career education classes and employment (all participants) and general education and school- and community-based transition activities (special education participants). We had two research questions:</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>Participants attended a comprehensive high school offering a range of academic and career preparation courses located in an urban school district of 78,000 students in southeastern United States. The school enrolled 1,070 students, of which 81% were Black, 16% White, and 3% Hispanic or Asian and 74% qualified for free or reduced lunch. At the time of the study, the high school was being taken over by the state because of its 53% dropout rate and failing to make Annual Yearly Progress on state exit exams. In addition, it had been identified as a segregated, high-need “dropout factory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811420135">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>). Most (56%) households in the community were single parent and 42% had an income of less than US$25,000.</p>

<sec id="section3-0885728811420135">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 39 students participated in the study: 19 students with severe intellectual disabilities and 20 general education students, as described later.</p>
<sec id="section4-0885728811420135">
<title>Students with severe intellectual disabilities</title>
<p>Participant selection criteria for students in this group were: (a) students were aged 14 to 21 years, had an IEP, and received special education services in classes for moderate and severe intellectual disabilities; (b) students had moderate to extensive support needs, as indicated by assessment data found in their IEPs; (c) students could respond verbally to spoken questions in four to five word phrases and follow one- to two-part directions; and (d) written parental and student consent was obtained. Students meeting these criteria were 19 of 38 students enrolled in three classes who had participated in a larger multischool study. Students excluded were those who were nonverbal and those with limited support needs (e.g., only monitoring or verbal prompts needed to complete daily living skills independently). Participating students’ ages ranged from 14 to 19 years (<italic>M</italic> = 16); 16 students were Black and 3 were White, and 10 were female. A total of 8 students were in Grades 9 to 10 and 11 were in Grades 11 to 12.

<title>General education students</title>
<p>Selection criteria for general education participants were: (a) second-semester senior class (Grade 12) status, (b) enrollment in at least one Advanced Placement (AP) or Honors English class, (c) a grade point average of 3.0 or better, (c) an absentee rate of less than 10% of total days enrolled, (d) having passed state exit exams, (e) sufficient course credits to graduate at the end of the spring semester, (f) having applied to at least one college, and (g) written parental and student consent. These criteria were established to ensure that participants represented students who were successful in academic performance and school completion. Of an entering freshman class of approximately 400 students 4 years earlier, only 20 members of the graduating senior class of 114 students (the school had a 57% dropout rate) met criteria for inclusion in the study. All seniors meeting selection criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were invited and agreed to participate. Mean student age was 18 years (range = 17–18); 16 students were Black, 3 were White, and 1 was Asian; and 15 were female.

<title>Student Self-Determination Survey (SS-DS)</title>
<p>We developed two forms (special education and general education) of the SS-DS based on a review of literature in self-determination and student involvement in the educational process. The SS-DS comprised 20 interview questions (forced-choice questions with requests to give examples) related to: (a) involvement in IEP activities (special education) or similar activities related to students’ individual 4-year education plans (general education; <italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885728811420135">Agran, Snow, &amp; Swaner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885728811420135">Dickhäuser, Reuter, &amp; Hilling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885728811420135">Martin, Greene, &amp; Borland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885728811420135">Test et al., 2004</xref>), (b) use of self-determination strategies, such as problem solving (<italic>n</italic> = 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811420135">Agran &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885728811420135">Caprara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer, Agran, &amp; Hughes, 2000</xref>), and (c) making personal decisions and choices (<italic>n</italic> = 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2000</xref>). A final open-ended question asked students to identify their postschool goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885728811420135">Benz, Lindstrom, &amp; Yovanoff, 2000</xref>). In addition, a second section requested students’ (a) age, race, or ethnicity and (b) involvement in general education, transition activities, and employment (special education) or involvement in career education and employment (general education). This information was drawn from school records. A draft instrument was field-tested for clarity of wording among five research staff and 17 high school students with severe intellectual disabilities; revisions in wording were incorporated into a final instrument. Cronbach’s alpha for the SS-DS was .82 (21 questions and 54 respondents).</p>
<p>The SS-DS (special education) was conducted as individual interviews by graduate students in special education by following a written script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811420135">Agran &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>) to ensure consistency in administration. Interviewers read the questions to each participant individually in a quiet area of the classroom out of earshot of other students, providing clarification or rewording as needed. Participants were asked to identify whether and how often they engaged in an IEP-related behavior (e.g., attending IEP meeting) or a self-determination skill, such as goal setting. If they responded affirmatively, they were asked to describe an occurrence in which they had used the skill. To control for acquiescence, if, after probing for understanding, participants’ examples did not match their response, affirmative responses were invalidated. As interviews were conducted, interviewers recorded participants’ responses, including examples of their IEP involvement or self-determination skill use, on the interview protocol.</p>
<p>Graduate students in special education conducted the SS-DS with the general education students using group administration. Reading aloud from a written script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811420135">Agran &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>), a student explained procedures for answering questions and confidentiality of responses. Next, the student read aloud each question on the survey, providing examples for clarification from the script, as needed. Participants were instructed to record their responses to questions directly on the protocol and to write an example for each question answered affirmatively.</p>

<title>The Arc’s Self-Determination Scale (SDS), Psychological Empowerment subscale—Adolescent Version</title>
<p>The Psychological Empowerment subscale of the Arc’s SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Kelchner, 1995</xref>) was used as a second measure of participants’ self-determination. The SDS is a student self-report measure of self-determination designed for adolescents with and without intellectual disabilities. It was constructed based on the definitional framework of self-determination as an educational outcome proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer, Kelchner, and Richards (1996)</xref>. The Psychological Empowerment subscale consists of 16 questions designed to assess students’ beliefs in their abilities, their perceptions of control, and their expectations of success. This subscale was chosen because it addressed students’: (a) self-efficacy—beliefs that they possess the skills to achieve their desired outcomes, (b) perceived internal locus of control, and (c) outcome expectancy—expectations that by applying their skills, identified outcomes would result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Kelchner, 1995</xref>). Higher scores are interpreted to indicate students are more psychologically empowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Kelchner, 1995</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha for the SDS Psychological Empowerment subscale (16 questions and 52 respondents) was .70.</p>
<p>The Psychological Empowerment subscale was administered orally immediately following the SS-DS interview. Interviewers read the instructions and questions to individual participants (special education) or group (general education), providing clarification as needed. Participants were asked to choose one of two paired statements they believed best described them for each of 16 questions. Special education students verbalized their answers to questions as interviewers circled their responses on the scale protocol. General education students circled their own responses to interviewer-read questions. Administration of the SS-DS and the SDS Psychological Empowerment subscale lasted between 20 to 30 min per participant with severe intellectual disabilities and 40 min for the general education group administration.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis comprised the following three steps: First, students’ educational programming and demographic data and participant responses were numerically coded and tabulated. Second, to compare findings for students with severe intellectual disabilities to those of general education students, descriptive statistics were calculated for participant response data using Pearson chi-square tests in SPSS. To control for random significance due to the number of descriptive comparisons (37), the <italic>p</italic> value of the chi-square analyses was set at .01. Third, on visually examining histograms to assure normality of the data, three <italic>t</italic> tests were performed to compare the mean summative responses of special education participants against the summative responses of general education participants. We compared students’ (a) reported level of involvement in their education programs, (b) reported use of self-determination strategies, and (c) their SDS Psychological Empowerment subscale scores. We set the <italic>p</italic> value at .05 for all three hypothesis-based comparisons and also calculated effect sizes.</p>

<title>Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>Consistent with the demographics of the high school, most (80% to 84%) participants in both groups were Black. Females comprised approximately half of special education versus 75% of general education participants. Most special education students attended no general education (79%) or career education classes (89%) and 84% participated in no school-based transition activities. Only 8 of 19 special education students participated in daily community-based transition activities and none was employed. More than half (60%) of general education participants were enrolled in one or more career education classes and 60% were employed part-time; 7 of these students worked for more than 20 hr weekly.</p>

<title>Participation in Educational Planning</title>
<sec id="section13-0885728811420135">
<title>Overall educational planning participation</title>
<p>Students’ self-reported participation in the IEP (special education) or 4-year planning process (general education), as derived from the SS-DS, is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885728811420135">Table 2</xref>. Low participation was reported across special education students for all phases of the IEP process queried. Only slightly over half of students reported knowing what an IEP was (e.g., “the papers you fill out with your teacher”) or attending their IEP meetings (e.g., “with my mom and dad and Mr. ___ but don’t remember what they talked about”). No students reported leading their IEP meetings. One student remarked, “I stay for a minute and leave and let them finish.” Participants who reported knowing their IEP goals (<italic>n</italic> = 10; 53%) gave examples primarily related to academic performance (e.g., “math, counting numbers, knowing alphabet”). Most (79%) students reported <italic>never</italic> reading their IEP or evaluating progress on their IEP goals (e.g., “I have tried but I don’t do good at it”). Few reported discussing IEP goals with parents or family (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Examples of IEP goal discussion primarily related to IEP meetings. For example, one student remarked that she discussed her IEP goals with her teachers “when we have an IEP meeting with my mom.”</p>
<p>In contrast, general education students reported significantly greater participation than did special education participants across six of eight educational planning activities. All general education participants cited that they were on the university versus technical educational program path (e.g., “because I want to go to college”) and all but one reported meeting with a guidance counselor to discuss their educational programs one or multiple (<italic>n</italic> = 2 to 20) times (e.g., “We discuss my schedule, credits, and what I need for graduation”). All but four students (<italic>n</italic> = 16) reported initiating meetings with their guidance counselors to talk about graduation requirements (e.g., “I went to make sure my transcript was in order, to see what scholarships are available, and to get recommendation letters”). All but two reported having school-related goals to complete high school (e.g., “I must learn all that I can, remain on the Honors path, and be involved in academic activities”). Most (75%) participants reported looking at their 4-year educational plans <italic>weekly</italic> or <italic>yearly</italic>; 75% also reported evaluating progress on their plan <italic>daily</italic> or <italic>weekly</italic> (e.g., “With every assignment that I get back that is graded I look at my progress”). A total of 45% of general education participants reported discussing educational goals with parents or families (e.g., “My mother stays on me about scholarships”) <italic>daily</italic> or <italic>weekly</italic> (vs. 11% special education students) and significantly fewer reported <italic>never</italic> discussing educational goals with teachers, although 75% said they did so only <italic>yearly</italic>.</p>

<title>Self-Determination Skills</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885728811420135">Table 3</xref> shows findings for questions related to self-determination skills drawn from the SS-DS. Participants with severe intellectual disabilities reported significantly less frequent use of eight of nine self-determination skills than did general education students. (The only nonsignificant finding was for Question 13 [self-monitoring].) Only six special education students reported ever setting goals in school (Question 9) versus all 20 general education students; goals for both groups primarily were academic, such as “I want to make good grades this report card” (special education) and “I try to improve every six weeks, set high personal standards, and evaluate my mistakes” (general education). Self-advocating examples (Question 10) were reported by eight special education students, primarily related to defending themselves in social situations or from bullying (e.g., “When someone says you did something and you didn’t, you have to say ‘No,’ you didn’t”), whereas all 20 general education students cited examples of speaking their opinion (e.g., “I always speak my mind if it is something I feel passionately about or don’t agree with” and “I like to have a say in most things that apply to me”).</p>
<p>Almost half (42%) of special education students versus no general education students reported <italic>never</italic> making choices by themselves (Question 11). Examples of choice making across groups generally related to daily life outside school, such as “What I’m gonna wear today or tomorrow” or “I choose my friends” (special education) or “I don’t hang out with my ex-best friend because she’s a bad influence on me” (general education). Over half (<italic>n</italic> = 11) of special education students compared with only one general education student reported <italic>never</italic> self-reinforcing (Question 12). Examples reportedly occurred in response to both school (e.g., “When I did well and made the honor roll, I told myself ‘Good job’” [special education]) and outside-school events (e.g., “After a long project, I sit down, relax, and watch TV” [general education]) across both groups of students. Examples of self-monitoring (the least reported skill across groups [Question 13]) reported by special education students primarily related to exercising, (e.g., “I count when I’m on a track—I got to do five laps”) versus personal or academic goals, as reported by general education students (e.g., “I keep track of where I am in life and in school”). Over half (58%) of special education students said they <italic>never</italic> self-instructed (Question 14), whereas 75% of general education students said they did <italic>most</italic> or <italic>all of the time</italic>. Self-instructing examples cited by special education students focused on everyday life skills (e.g., “A peanut butter and banana sandwich—first I need the bread and the peanut butter and the knife and spread it on, then cut up the banana”), whereas general education examples related primarily to personal or academic goals (e.g., “I try to map out what I’m going to do before I do it so I won’t make any mistakes” and “sometimes you have to tell yourself what to do in order to get it right”).</p>
<p>The few (<italic>n</italic> = 4) examples of self-evaluating (Question 15) reported by special education students occurred primarily in relation to academic performance (e.g., “My cursive—I can write more letters and do it better”), whereas examples reported across 18 general education students spanned both academic and lifestyle goals (e.g., “I compare my performances in all aspects to past performances so I can see how I am doing” and “When I am working in my job I look to see how I am improving performance-wise”). Almost half (47%) of special education students reported <italic>never</italic> solving problems by themselves (Question 16), whereas 85% of general education students said they did <italic>most</italic> or <italic>all of the time</italic>. Examples of problem solving cited by special education students generally were in response to events at home, such as losing a house key (e.g., “My mom told me she’d leave the key under the trash can and it wasn’t there so I had to call my mom and she had to leave work”). In contrast, general education examples encompassed life issues in general, such as “I take time out to be alone and think and then address the issue personally” and “A girl at my job was making racist comments. I just pulled her aside and talked to her.” Most (84%) special education students said they <italic>never</italic> or <italic>sometimes</italic> made decisions for themselves (Question 17), whereas 85% of general education students said they did <italic>most</italic> or <italic>all of the time</italic>. Examples of decision making related to outside-school events for both groups of students, such as deciding to go to a basketball game or what gift to buy for a friend (special education), or “I make my own plans every week, but I usually check with others to make sure I am not conflicting with anyone” (general education).</p>

Open-ended responses were grouped into three categories, which we compared using a Pearson chi-square test. The majority (58%) of special education students indicated wanting employment after high school, whereas 85% of general education students favored postsecondary education. For example, special education employment goals included “work in a grocery store putting things in a bag” and “wash dishes, wash clothes, mop floors.” Special education students with postsecondary aspirations (<italic>n</italic> = 5) reported goals related to career training (e.g., “go to technical school—do paint collision, custom painting”). In contrast, general education students’ postschool goals primarily comprised a 4-year college education (e.g., “I plan to be a fulltime student at a university minoring in nursing and majoring in occupational therapy” and “I plan to graduate from a four-year university”). Three special education versus no general education students reported wanting to stay home after high school.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We compared involvement in educational planning and use of self-determination strategies reported by two groups of students attending a high-poverty, predominately Black high school: 19 students with severe intellectual disabilities and 20 general education seniors identified as “successful.” Findings revealed that special education students participated in few activities (e.g., general or career education classes, transition activities, or employment) on a daily basis outside their self-contained special education classes. In contrast, over half of general education students attended both career and general education classes as well as worked part-time in the community. Special education students were significantly less likely to report involvement in seven of eight educational planning activities (e.g., evaluating progress on school goals). Few were aware of their IEP goals and none had led their IEP meetings.</p>
<p>Special education students also reported significantly less use of eight of nine self-determination strategies (e.g., solving problems independently). Examples primarily were limited to home environments, such as solving a dispute with a sibling, versus examples across school, home, and community as cited by general education students. Composite scores on the SDS Psychological Empowerment subscale revealed that special education participants were significantly more likely to choose responses indicating less psychological empowerment, particularly for questions relating to self-efficacy (e.g., “Trying hard at school doesn’t do me much good”). Special education students were also more likely to have favorable reactions to having parents or teachers make choices for them. Most cited employment as a postschool goal as compared with postsecondary education, as favored by general education participants.</p>
<p>This is the first study to compare educational planning and self-determination use reported by students with severe intellectual disabilities and general education students identified as successful within a high-poverty high school designated as a failing “dropout factory,” allowing us to draw important implications for research and practice. First, readers may be tempted to attribute disparate findings across groups to differences in cognitive level of students. Special education participants were identified as having severe intellectual disabilities, whereas general education participants had no identified disabilities and were enrolled in AP or Honors classes. However, prior research indicates that level of intelligence is not a strong predictor of degree of self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Garner, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer and Garner (2003)</xref> found that among a group of individuals with developmental disabilities—some of whom had co-occurring intellectual disabilities—that intellectual capacity did not predict level of self-determination or autonomy. Rather, having greater opportunities to choose related to increased self-determination. Level of intelligence did relate to restrictiveness of environmental placement in which, by definition, choices are limited.</p>
<p>A similar dynamic likely functioned in the current study. Participants with severe intellectual disabilities spent the overwhelming majority of their day in self-contained special education classrooms. Most participated in no general education classes or school- or community-based transition activities. It is likely that their self-contained settings provided students with few opportunities to choose or solve problems independently, as suggested by multiple studies equating restrictiveness of setting with diminished opportunity for autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885728811420135">Duvdevany, Ben-Zur, &amp; Ambar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885728811420135">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Bolding, 2001</xref>). When daily events are predictable, lacking challenges and varying stimuli to which to respond, students likely do not learn self-determined behavior, such as exercising preference or setting goals, as suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885728811420135">Duvdevany et al., 2002</xref>) and by the limited self-determination strategy use reported by students with severe intellectual disabilities in this study. Furthermore, examples of self-determination provided by these students primarily related to events at home, such as defending against a bullying sibling or choosing a CD to listen to, rather than in response to events likely to occur in more stimulating secondary transition programs, such as problem solving when task materials are missing in a community-based job training site or deciding which career education class to enroll in at school. Restrictiveness of setting must be considered in relation to findings in this study in view of the limited self-determination and self-advocacy expressed by students with severe intellectual disabilities, suggesting that providing instruction and opportunity likely would have yielded considerably different outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our findings bring into question those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885728811420135">Zhang (2001)</xref> who asked general and special education teachers to rate how often students with mild intellectual disabilities demonstrated self-determination behaviors in their respective classrooms. Special versus general education teachers reported higher rates of self-determination behavior, suggesting that special education settings may be more conducive to self-determination than are general education environments. However, Zhang suggested that teacher bias or expectations may have influenced results because special education teachers would have been more likely to be aware of the 1997 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandate to address students’ interests, preferences, and choices in educational programming. Unfortunately, Zhang did not report (a) environmental features or actual opportunities that may have related to self-determination use in either setting or (b) student perspective on opportunity to exercise self-determination across settings.</p>
<p>Second, restrictiveness of environment may have related to the poverty level of the high school and its community. A related study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885728811420135">Hughes, Cosgriff, Agram &amp; Washington, 2011</xref>) found greater participation in general education classes and school- and community-based activities in more affluent high schools, which was associated with greater use of self-determination strategies reported by students with severe intellectual disabilities. Limited resources, high student and teacher mobility, and blighted neighborhoods severely restrict opportunities for community-based experiences and for learning and practicing self-advocacy skills for youth with severe disabilities in high-poverty schools. Without a range of experiences across varied settings, students are likely to develop a restricted repertoire of choices, preferences, and basis for making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885728811420135">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>). Poverty, in itself, is a moderating factor that must be considered in designing any program to promote self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2011</xref>). Not only must instruction to learn to problem-solve or make decisions independently be provided to students with severe intellectual disabilities; this study also suggests that opportunity must be addressed, particularly in relation to high-poverty environments.</p>
<p>Third, we established a normative standard for general education students’ involvement in education planning, use of self-determination skills, and psychological empowerment as demonstrated by a group of 20 second-semester seniors identified as successful within the high-poverty high school environment (i.e., low absences, having passed all state exit exams, sufficient credits to graduate, enrollment in at least one AP or Honors class, good grades, and having applied to at least one college). Findings suggested that this small group of successful seniors took an active role in planning, monitoring, and implementing their education programs, particularly as compared with special education participants. For example, all but four students reported initiating meetings with their guidance counselors to ascertain having sufficient credits to graduate and that transcripts were being sent to prospective colleges, and to obtain information on college scholarships. All but two participants provided examples of goals they had established to finish high school (e.g., “I want to graduate! Learn better study habits, make better grades”) and 75% reported evaluating their progress on these goals daily or weekly (e.g., “I make sure each grade for every class is improving”), suggesting that they took ownership of and responsibility for their own education.</p>
<p>Findings also indicated that this group of successful seniors frequently exercised most self-determination skills queried. Most (85%) students responded that they solved problems and made decisions by themselves <italic>most</italic> or <italic>all of the time.</italic> Other skills cited by at least 75% of students <italic>most</italic> or <italic>all of the time</italic> were setting their own goals, speaking up for themselves, making their own choices, and instructing themselves to do a job or task. Reported examples showed that students used self-determination skills primarily in response to lifestyle choices (e.g., “I’ve decided not to drink or smoke even though we been around people that do”) and educational or personal goals (e.g., “As my high school years pass the classes have gotten harder but I’ve hung in and improved” and “I constantly reset the bar in my scholastics. I have increased my activities on my own. And I have increased my outgoingness!”). Finally, scores on the SDS Psychological Empowerment subscale suggested that this group of successful students had a strong sense of self-efficacy. All students chose the response indicating greater psychological empowerment on 10 of 16 questions and no more than 3 of 20 students ever choose a response indicating lower psychological empowerment (2 questions). Findings generally conveyed a group of students who were self-confident and believed their actions would result in positive outcomes (e.g., “I can get what I want by working hard”). Overall, a normative standard emerges of frequent use of self-advocacy and self-determination skills by general education students who were successful within a high-poverty environment.</p>
<p>Fourth, participants with severe disabilities and their general education counterparts reported very different levels of involvement in educational planning and use of self-determination skills, despite living in the same low-income neighborhood and attending the same underresourced high school. Findings are encouraging that a group of general education students identified as successful in the environment did take an active and self-determined role in their high school education. However, they represented only 20 of 400 students in their freshman class cohort and 20 of 114 members of their graduating senior class. Their persistence in achieving expectations for completing high school and preparing for college (e.g., having few absences, enrolling in AP and Honors classes, and applying to college) when few other students did so may have related to their resilience and self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811420135">Morales, 2010</xref>). These students cited multiple examples of how they monitored themselves to maintain good attendance, pass their classes, graduate on time, and maintain positive relationships with others, (e.g., “I try to improve every six weeks, set high personal standards, and evaluate mistakes”)—all of which are factors associated with high school completion in at-risk environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885728811420135">Floyd, 1996</xref>). Self-determination, resilience, and a sense of self-efficacy may have been what separated these students from their many counterparts who did not demonstrate a similar level of academic achievement.</p>
<sec id="section22-0885728811420135">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Limitations of this study should be addressed in future research. First, we did not corroborate students’ self-report of involvement in educational planning and use of self-determination strategies with direct observation. Therefore, it is not known how accurately students estimated their actual performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811420135">Martin et al. (2006)</xref> observed special education students’ behavior, such as stating goals, at IEP meetings. However, observing problem solving or self-advocating is difficult because such low-frequency behaviors are difficult to “catch.” Behavior like goal setting or self-monitoring are also challenging to observe because they typically occur “privately.” One suggestion is to ask students to record each instance of self-determination skill use, although external assistance likely would be required to maintain recording behavior. Second, we did not systematically observe opportunities to make choices or self-advocate that were available to students with severe intellectual disabilities in their self-contained classrooms. It may be that students had more enriched environments than we assumed, although our informal observation revealed considerable downtime and lack of stimulating and challenging activities throughout the day. Furthermore, we argue that by simply encountering different environments on a routine basis, students are exposed to more choices to make and problems to solve than if they remain in a more restrictive setting throughout the day, as documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer and Bolding (2001)</xref> and others. However, direct observation would have strengthened findings in this study and should be used in future studies.</p>
<p>Third, we also did not systematically observe adversities faced by general education participants that were routinely associated with their high-poverty school environment. However, informal observation revealed that many college preparation tasks taken for granted at more affluent high schools, such as guidance counselors sending transcripts and letters of recommendation to colleges and monitoring students’ transcripts to ensure sufficient credits to graduate, did not occur routinely without continual prodding by students at this high school. In fact, at the time of this study, a number of students entered their second-semester senior year to suddenly find out that they did not have sufficient credits to graduate. Future research should confirm specific examples of adversity that directly affect student participants. Fourth, we had no information on support provided by families or teachers to individual students. Like resilience, support from parents and other caring adults can serve as a buffer against adversity associated with poverty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811420135">Kloep et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885728811420135">Lerner &amp; Benson, 2003</xref>). It could be that the 20 successful general education participants had extraordinary family or teacher support that other students in the senior class did not access. Future studies should investigate supports provided to students who are succeeding despite challenging school environments.</p>
<p>Additional limitations relate to the SS-DS instrument and our student sample. Although we did establish a Cronbach’s alpha of .82 for the SS-DS, indicating a high level of internal consistency of items, further psychometric properties of the instrument were not investigated. Drawing items from the literature, as we did when we developed the instrument, does, however, provide some evidence of its content validity. Developing a psychometrically sound self-report instrument to assess students’ self-determination skill use would contribute substantially to the research base. Finally, our small sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 39 students from one high school) limits the generalizability of findings to other groups and geographic areas. In addition, our two groups of students were not well matched in age or grade. Mean age for special education students was 16 versus 18 years for general education students. All general education students were seniors, whereas only eight special education students were seniors. It could be that differences in findings related to disparities in students’ age across groups—a factor that we did not consider. Future efforts to compare groups should attempt to match students by age, although doing so within one high school is difficult due to typically small numbers of students with severe disabilities from which to draw.</p>

<title>Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>Our findings reveal that a traditionally disenfranchised and underserved population—youth with severe intellectual disabilities who are primarily Black and attending a high-poverty urban high school—may be missing out on learning and exercising critical self-determination skills and participating actively in their educational planning. Findings underscore the need to teach self-advocacy and self-determination skills and provide opportunities to apply these skills in daily activities in inclusive school and community settings outside the self-contained special education classroom. As teachers report not knowing how to teach such skills to students with more severe needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer et al., 2000</xref>), support should be provided to teachers to incorporate self-determination instruction in inclusive settings into curricula for students with severe intellectual disabilities attending high-poverty high schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only a small number of general education students in the same environment were found to be achieving the benchmarks typically associated with successful high school completion. Their achievement may have related to their resilience and self-determination. In an era when few students of color—particularly Black males—from high-poverty backgrounds are graduating from high school and going on to college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811420135">Barton &amp; Coley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885728811420135">Holzman, 2010</xref>), it is especially important to address factors, such as promoting resilience and self-determination, associated with increasing the odds that more students will succeed in at-risk environments. Education as a field holds as a value equity, opportunity, and achievement for all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885728811420135">Duncan, 2011</xref>). Self-determination is associated with academic achievement and positive postschool outcomes for high school youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811420135">Fowler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885728811420135">Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer, 2003</xref>). Research and practice designed to increase self-determination must begin to include <italic>all</italic> students—particularly those who have been left out of previous efforts: students of color attending high-poverty high schools.</p>
