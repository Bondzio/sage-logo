<p>In <italic>Banished to the Homeland</italic>, David Brotherton and Luis Barrios explore the intricacy of U.S. immigration policy and its social, economic, and psychological impact on Dominican deportees and their families who remain left behind in the United States. Through their analysis of in-depth interviews with 98 deportees (mostly male) and detailed footnotes, the authors provide a vivid illustration of how U.S. economic and political intervention in the Dominican Republic facilitated migration to the United States and subsequent deportation back to the Dominican Republic. Given the extent of few prospects for social mobility in the Dominican Republic, many Dominicans hoped life in the United States would provide opportunities for economic advancement, a better quality of life, and political stability. They hoped to accomplish the American Dream as do other immigrants. However, Brotherton and Barrios demonstrate that residential segregation, discrimination, and structural constraints caused poverty and hardship for respondents, who at times resorted to criminal behavior in Dominican neighborhoods in the northeastern United States. Though the majority of respondents were living in the United States as legal permanent residents, their inability or indecision to naturalize and become U.S. citizens made them eligible for deportation after encounters with the criminal justice system. While some respondents were actually involved in criminal behavior, others were falsely detained, accused, and convicted of crimes they did not commit. Brotherton and Barrios argue and demonstrate that the U.S. government’s increased vigilance in response to the September 11th attacks has created an atmosphere in which being a non-citizen, even a legal permanent resident, with a criminal record becomes grounds for deportation.</p>
<p>While most migration studies focus on the experiences of immigrants in the United States, Brotherton and Barrios conducted multi-site research in the United States and the Dominican Republic to capture what happens to Dominican migrants after they are deported from the United States and how they are received in their “homeland.” Dominican deportees are highly stigmatized in the Dominican Republic due to the assumption that most were involved in drug trafficking in the United States, were criminals, and will continue to commit crimes in the Dominican Republic after returning. Therefore, deportees are viewed with disdain and subject to discrimination, violence, and murder at the hands of the Dominican police. Furthermore, because these deportees spent the majority of their lives in the United States, they find themselves unable to readapt to “Dominican” life and reconnect with any remaining family members there. Brotherton and Barrios illustrate how this societal stigmatization and individual alienation makes it difficult for these deportees to sustain themselves, and subsequently a number of them resort (again) to criminal behavior and substance abuse, and suffer mental health problems.</p>
<p>This book has many strengths, one of which is its use of deeply descriptive narrative accounts to explain how macro-level U.S. immigration policy functions at the micro-level, affecting the lives of individuals. One notable example is the authors’ account of an emotional immigration hearing in which a (soon to be) deportee’s family testifies on his behalf to prevent his deportation. The deportee’s attorney argues that the deportee will be subject to “torture” and brutality from Dominican police if deported. Unable to prove the deportee will be “tortured” as defined by the U.S. government (“the government-sanctioned use of extreme pain to extract information from a subject” [p. 168]), the presiding judge has no choice but to deport the young man. Such stark narratives pull in the reader and movingly show the plight of deportees throughout the book. <italic>Banished to the Homeland</italic> also demonstrates the multi-faceted transnational ties between the United States and Dominican Republic: (1) U.S. immigration policy and Dominican government, (2) migrant families connected via deportees in the United States and Dominican Republic, and (3) economic interdependency via tourism and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Though this book elaborately shows how respondents’ lives are affected by deportation, crime, and stigma, there were some areas to which Brotherton and Barrios could have devoted more attention. First, the authors’ rationale for focusing on Dominican deportees as opposed to Mexicans or some other immigrant group was not completely clear. In the beginning of the book, the authors mention that a previous study explored New York City “street organizations,” in which a large number were first- or second-generation Dominicans. However, beyond this, there is no cogent discussion of the rationale for focusing on this particular population.</p>
<p>Another issue that the authors could have explored was how the racialization of Dominican immigrants in the United States may have influenced Dominican deportees’ social outcomes in the United States and Dominican Republic. Relative to other Latino ethnic groups, Dominicans tend to be darker in skin tone and have physical features more similar to those of black Americans. Various studies indicate that Latinos with darker phenotypes generally experience more racism, discrimination, and negative social outcomes relative to Latinos with lighter phenotypes. Even though some deportees mentioned experiencing racism in the United States, the authors did not dig deeper into this issue by asking respondents more about those experiences or how such racism influenced their lives. Additional studies have revealed the complexity of “race” in the “Spanish” Dominican Republic, given the country’s relationship with neighboring “black” Haiti, the role of the Trujillo dictatorship in emphasizing Dominicans’ non-blackness despite the country’s history of slavery, and the stigmatization of blacker physical features in the Dominican Republic. The juxtaposition of Dominican deportees’ encounters with racism in the United States and skin color stratification in the Dominican Republic may have added another level of analysis to the deportees’ narratives. Similarly, the authors do not mention anything about the physical appearance of the deportees although photos in the book suggest that the majority have “blacker” physical features. It is likely that being darker Dominicans <italic>in combination with</italic> being deportees could also have played a role in their stigmatization post-deportation in the Dominican Republic. To focus on the plight of Dominican migrants in the United States or Dominican Republic without a substantial discussion of how race, skin color, and racism intersect with being a migrant, leaves out a crucial piece of the Dominican deportee experience.</p>
<p>Finally, the book could also have used a broader discussion of the implications of these findings for other immigrants in the United States and deportees abroad. A question that was left unanswered was “what can the experience of Dominican deportees tell us about other similarly situated groups?” Are the narratives in the book unique to Dominicans or could these experiences be similar for Mexican, Jamaican, Arab, or other types of deportees? To some extent, this question relates to the first limitation regarding the rationale for focusing on Dominicans. It would also have been beneficial to get the authors’ perspective on how increasing anti-immigrant sentiment, more policing at the federal and local levels, and the growth of the prison industrial complex intersect to affect the lives of immigrants as non-citizens, who can be detained, arrested, convicted, and deported without due process or adequate legal representation.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Banished to the Homeland</italic> does a remarkable job of showing how Dominican deportees (and their loved ones) are subjected to the harsh reality and aftermath of U.S. immigration policy. This is a must read for anyone concerned with immigration, transnational ties, the criminal justice system, and human rights.</p>
