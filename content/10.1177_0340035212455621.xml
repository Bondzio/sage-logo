<abstract>
<p>The nature of the learning resource areas found in Britain’s schools has changed dramatically in the last decade and a half. Traditional libraries, based around a centralized collection of books, are becoming increasingly uncommon and have been replaced in many institutions by more computer-oriented ‘study centres’. These quite different environments have provoked controversy in several quarters and pose a range of challenges to those who manage them. Although some of the emergent issues are far from new and, indeed, have been debated in library circles for decades, others are more particular to study centres. This paper explores in some detail a dozen matters, highlighting dilemmas and, on occasion, possible solutions. The questions posed are fundamental and diverse, relating to such varied aspects as the physical environment itself, the virtual world to which the study centre offers access, the role of traditional materials, the functions of staff responsible for the facility and the purposes for which the area should be used.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The means by which learning from information materials is supported in many of Britain’s secondary schools has recently undergone a radical transformation. In previous eras, the school library has been integral to this provision but, today, traditional ‘rooms full of books’ with associated spaces for pencil and paper activities are becoming far less common. The last 10 to 15 years have witnessed countless instances where such old style facilities have been replaced by areas that accommodate books and networked computers side by side, with help desks staffed by personnel who address a wide spectrum of user inquiries. These may relate to, for example, the sale of stationery and other materials, the meeting of information needs, the book stock and the solution of technical, ICT problems.</p>
<p>Typically, the newly designed environments are dubbed ‘study centres’ or ‘independent learning zones’. As we will see later in this article, both terms may be somewhat problematic. The latter label is especially unfortunate since it rather begs the question, of what is the learning independent? It could refer, for example, to learning without direct instruction by the teacher, learning that takes place out of class time or practically any form of extra-curricular learning. Whichever term is employed to represent these environments, it is perhaps more useful to understand them as facilities that may support virtually all types of learning activities and situations triggered by the curricular policy of the school.</p>
<p>Although the shift towards ‘study centres’ or ‘independent learning zones’ would now seem irreversible, the demise of the conventional school library has attracted strong criticism in many quarters. There are fears that if youngsters come to rely too heavily on electronic resources that are accessible from a single location in other circumstances they will struggle to find and select from information available from disparate places or which exists in various formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0340035212455621">Owen 2009</xref>). For some critics, moves in favour of study centres are motivated not by the aim of enhancing teaching and learning but by concerns over the cost of maintaining a dynamic and up-to-date book collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0340035212455621">Lightfoot 2008</xref>) or by the desires of school managers to position their institutions at the forefront of new technological developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035212455621">Adams 2008</xref>). Even if school leaders intent on introducing a study centre approach are able to counter these charges and convince sceptics of the value of such an innovation, they should still be aware that fundamental issues will need to be confronted as they make the change. This article considers twelve such challenges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0340035212455621">
<title>Books and computer workstations</title>
<p>Given the natural inclination of many young people today, there is a clear risk that, if books and computer workstations are provided in the same room, pupils will almost always seek to use only the latter when given the opportunity. This is now a well established pattern. It is over ten years ago that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0340035212455621">Walker and Moen (2000)</xref> commented that, for “networked generation”, exploitation of the World Wide Web has become “the desired method of locating information”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0340035212455621">Schopflin (2003)</xref>, in fact, goes so far as to comment that a physical collection “may become ‘invisible’ to users who will use the most readily available source” (p. 56). Any school library that deals only in books would seem vulnerable to the fate that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0340035212455621">Toerien (2009)</xref> believes “now appears more or less universal in this country” – the environment is valued not so much as a facility for learning but as a place “in which to ‘babysit’ any number of pupils for any number of reasons”. We must remember that, as well as serving as a gateway to information, computers are associated with such attractions as games, software that can be used for the production of academic assignments and means of communication like email, and areas that accommodate them within the school provide a more multidimensional utility than a traditional library can offer. As the author has written elsewhere, in the study centre with which he is familiar it is common for all the computers to be occupied during breaks and lunch times when pupils are allowed casual access, whilst the bookshelves command virtually no attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0340035212455621">Shenton 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0340035212455621">Seldon (2011)</xref> suggests that situations in which the vast majority of a library’s books have not been checked out in the last 5 years are common. Of course, doubt can be cast on the validity of such analyses – issue figures fail to take into account, for example, the use that is made within the centre of the paper materials involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0340035212455621">Shenton and Johnson 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, even if the statistical evidence that presents a picture of minimal use of the book element of the facility is flawed, it may still be difficult to refute entirely the unfavourable conclusion that is drawn and to mount a robust argument for increasing or even maintaining expenditure on new books. Moreover, as the age of a stagnant stock rises over time, it may well attract even less interest, thereby beginning a vicious circle of apathy towards books in the centre. Despite initial hopes that books and electronic resources will be employed in concert by learners, there is a very real danger that, ultimately, the book collection becomes no more than a token one. Various courses of action are, however, available to staff looking to bolster use of the centre’s books. They include simplifying access to them and thus ‘demystifying’ the bibliographic conventions that typically accompany tools such as catalogues and classification schemes, actively promoting books through displays, reading lists, fairs, reviews and fun activities, increasing the need for books by helping to ensure that some of the assignments set by teachers demand that such texts be consulted and highlighting the weaknesses inherent in many electronic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0340035212455621">Shenton 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These actions presuppose, of course, that it is desirable for pupils to use paper materials <italic>and </italic>electronic resources, rather than to rely exclusively on the latter. It may argued that, if youngsters are effective in meeting their information needs after consulting appropriate sources, from a pragmatic perspective the question of what form the materials have taken is largely irrelevant. Advocates of this stance typically emphasize the pre-eminence of access to information above all other considerations. Certainly, it is hard to disagree with Crandall’s assertion, when comparing the services offered by libraries on the one hand and communities concerned with promoting ICT on the other, that the differences between them are of little concern to the user, whose aim is simply “to get their questions answered and their needs satisfied” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0340035212455621">Sears and Crandall 2010</xref>: 72). There are, however, reasons why an alternative view may be taken. Much has always been made in Britain of the importance of schools pursuing a ‘broad and balanced’ curriculum. Indeed this requirement is enshrined in National Curriculum orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212455621">Department for Education and Employment/Qualifications and Curriculum Authority 1999</xref>: 30). Where the only information sources available in study centres are of an electronic nature, even if the subjects taught in the school are diverse and a multitude of different disciplines is represented, clearly the use of computer-based materials exclusively leads to a certain monotony in the learning that takes place in study centres and this is hardly consistent with notions of breadth and balance. Moreover, in addition to experiencing only one dimension within the ‘information world’ available, youngsters are not being trained in developing paper-related skills that they will need in other situations where their needs cannot be met through electronic sources. We should not forget, either, that there remain instances where computer-based materials are intrinsically inadequate. For example, the writer has commented previously,
<disp-quote>
<p>Several teachers of fine art have drawn… attention to the fact that, on web pages, reproductions of paintings are often small and, when enlarged, lose much of their definition, with the result that fine detail in the pictures and brushwork characteristics associated with the style of the artist are not as readily apparent as in reproductions found in books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0340035212455621">Shenton 2009</xref>: 493).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The possibility that a resource centre for learning may offer no more than a minimal collection of books sits uneasily with the School Library Manifesto that has been prepared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0340035212455621">IFLA/UNESCO (1999)</xref>. This document highlights the importance of enabling youngsters to become “effective users of information in all formats and media”. The Manifesto also establishes that staff must encourage the exploitation of books and a range of resources “from print to electronic”, and support “all students in learning and practising skills for evaluating... information, regardless of form, format or medium”. In addition, unless one is convinced of the imminence of a paperless society it is difficult to realize the IFLA/UNESCO aim of promoting truly lifelong learning skills if the paper aspect is left neglected.</p>

<sec id="section3-0340035212455621">
<title>Decisions on expansion</title>
<p>The author’s experience demonstrates that levels of pupil use of the study centre in which he has worked vary appreciably according to the time of year. During the winter months and, in particular, when it is cold or wet outside, the facility has often been full to capacity during casual access times and pupils either have to be turned away or are left to queue at the doors. Although this may seem to indicate that the current number of workstations is insufficient, any decision to increase it should be considered only with caution, as there is much less use during the summer term, when pupils in two year groups are on examination leave, others are away on work experience and the warmer weather naturally attracts outside many of the pupils who are still attending. Furthermore, any plans to introduce additional workstations may have serious implications for the ICT infrastructure, which could well have to be upgraded accordingly. Thus managers must reflect on whether the cost involved and the time necessary for such expansion are worthwhile, especially as greater numbers of computers are likely to result in reductions in the space available for quiet reading areas, pencil and paper tasks or collaborative activities. If the school operates a policy of one pupil to each workstation, there may be a temptation to relax such a rule in times of heavy demand, although this, too, is far from ideal since it can easily lead to overcrowding and consequent risks to safety, and an inconsistent application of procedures frequently undermines efforts to maintain pupil discipline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0340035212455621">
<title>Structuring the electronic environment</title>
<p>The Internet Manifesto prepared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212455621">IFLA (2002)</xref> draws attention to the need to provide “unhindered access to information” (p. 3), champions the removal of barriers to the flow of information and urges opposition to censorship when information is made available. Nevertheless, the document also encourages librarians to “promote and facilitate <italic>responsible</italic> access to <italic>quality</italic> networked information” (p. 4; the italics have been added by the author). It is certainly unlikely that any school would want to allow pupils entirely unfettered access to the Internet, since the use of appropriate filters is integral to ensuring both that youngsters are protected from much undesirable material on the Web and that the school is seen by others, notably parents, to be taking the necessary precautions in safeguarding the youngsters. Nevertheless, within the broad limits imposed by such filters, it may well be that the school aims to provide access to as wide a range of electronic material as possible. This situation gives learners experience of dealing with vast quantities of information and may be used to help them to develop skills for assessing the quality of the material they encounter. Nevertheless, other options are open to school leaders thinking about the nature of the electronic environment that they are to make available in the study centre. A more cautious approach lies in establishing a highly structured and restricted virtual learning environment (VLE). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0340035212455621">Warburton (2010)</xref> explains how, in their most basic form, VLEs “are essentially tailored desktops… with links to the relevant learning materials” (p. 5). Resources may be limited to approved Web sites and materials uploaded on to the system by school staff. Whilst this obviously minimizes the risk of youngsters accessing unsuitable content, either accidentally or deliberately, since the materials have been pre-selected for them pupils can be confident of their quality and the study centre’s true potential as a training ground for gaining and practising skills involving source discrimination and the handling of extensive collections of information goes unfulfilled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0340035212455621">
<title>Jettisoning ill advised practices whilst retaining fundamental skills</title>
<p>Despite the apparent modernity of a ‘state of the art’ study centre, the possibility emerges that some of the teaching methods that are employed merely replicate electronically existing practices within the school. For example, in the scenario outlined above, where a VLE directs, and indeed limits, the pupils’ attention to particular materials, the situation may be scarcely different from the well established method of issuing learners with teacher-prepared information sheets and photocopied extracts from textbooks. Even though the medium may have changed, similar problems tend to arise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0340035212455621">Shenton and Beautyman (2008)</xref> highlight how, in both cases, if youngsters are required to move beyond such ‘spoon-feeding’ they may feel overwhelmed by the larger collections of information they encounter in other contexts. As was indicated earlier, this danger is a factor that should be considered when the electronic learning environment is being designed.</p>
<p>Care must also be taken to prevent pupils from continuing to lapse into undesirable practices. Some three and a half decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0340035212455621">Lindsay (1976)</xref> wrote of how he had to counter the problem of his secondary schoolers “just grabbing the first book they saw [in the library] and copying” (p. 19). If we translate this issue into today’s world, the predominant information source becomes the website, rather than a book; sources are frequently ‘grabbed’, not physically but by means of a search engine, and much copying is now done electronically, instead of via pen and paper. Nevertheless, Lindsay’s central concern remains as pertinent today as it was in the 1970s. Indeed, plagiarism, whilst significant then, is far more prevalent now, although the information professional can take at least some comfort from the fact that a wealth of recent ideas and suggestions is available to those intent on tackling the malpractice (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0340035212455621">Brett 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0340035212455621">Pavey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0340035212455621">Shenton 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0340035212455621">Tarter and Hyams 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to age-old problems resurfacing and proliferating, we are facing the danger that traditional, highly regarded skills become increasingly neglected as the modern, ICT-oriented information world offers few opportunities for their development. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212455621">Bastone (2010)</xref> observes, “Skills we all learnt without realizing it before the internet age do not seem to come naturally any more”. One such skill is that of scanning a text for information – a form of behaviour which receives considerable coverage in many older sources. In discussing his seminal “information skills curriculum”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0340035212455621">Marland (1981)</xref> highlights the importance of scanning when “interrogating resources” (p. 33); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0340035212455621">Wray and Lewis (1995)</xref> write of its role in that phase of their EXIT model devoted to the use of an information source, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0340035212455621">Trigg (1981)</xref> notes the value of the skill in the context of evaluating material. Today, however, very often a ‘find’ facility may be used to search an electronic document for a certain word or phrase, thereby rendering unnecessary in this situation the conducting of a focused examination of the text for the term involved. Yet, to neglect in a teaching programme scanning as a higher order reading skill is to assume that the user will invariably be operating in the electronic environment and even here the appropriate facilities are not always available.</p>
<p>Teachers and those who manage the study centre must, then, remain alive to the need to exploit fully the resource that is available to them, make a conscious effort to avoid the area merely providing a modern setting for the perpetuation of old practices and problems, and ensure that traditional skills which remain important continue to be given the attention they merit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0340035212455621">
<title>Spatial arrangement</title>
<p>The way that computer workstations within a study centre are positioned can significantly affect the extent to which pupils remain on-task in lessons and are deterred from accessing inappropriate material intentionally. In 2008, the school in which the writer is employed established a working party consisting of the Deputy Headteacher, an Assistant Headteacher responsible for child protection, the Head of ICT, the Lead Teacher for New Technologies, the Network Manager and the author himself (as Curriculum and Resource Support Officer). The group’s remit was to identify good practice within the institution with regard to teaching and learning that involved the use of ICT and to make recommendations for improvements. A major strength of the current situation was agreed to be the way in which computers in the study centre’s three sections were organized. In each case, a circular arrangement was in evidence, so that, from any single position within an area, a member of staff could see all the section’s computer screens simply by rotating through 360 degrees. Any off-task behaviour was immediately apparent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0340035212455621">Figure 1</xref> shows such a section. It was recognized by the working party, however, that this favoured form of arrangement does not necessarily constitute the most economical use of the space available and, given that some ICT zones may have to be accommodated in parts of the school building that are far from ideal, it may not always be possible to adopt the circular model in practice.</p>

<sec id="section7-0340035212455621">
<title>Staff roles</title>
<p>It is likely that the staff based in a study centre within a school will be diverse. Some, who henceforth in this article will be termed ‘learning staff’, will be responsible for dealing with user inquiries and supporting pupils in their efforts to find and use information effectively. Whereas the learning staff essentially provide the centre’s ‘human face’, other personnel will be technicians who have fewer direct dealings with users and are primarily concerned with hardware/software issues and the management of the network and the rest of the ICT infrastructure. It is, of course, possible that lines of demarcation become somewhat blurred – for example, in the absence of an available technician one of the learning staff may find themselves having to grapple with a network problem in order to satisfy a particular inquiry; technicians may, from time to time, be asked to supervise pupils during casual access periods such as breaks and lunch times. Where roles are duplicated, unequivocal areas of responsibility for different members of staff may be difficult to establish and the coordinating role of centre leaders becomes critical to the cohesive running of the facility.</p>
<p>In contrast to problems with overlapping roles, there is the danger that the functions of individuals are defined too narrowly. Any work involving the management of electronic resources may be deemed the preserve of technicians, even though others may be able to offer a useful input. It is pertinent in this respect to note the common strands that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0340035212455621">Marshman (2011)</xref> recognizes in the seemingly disparate work of “librarians” and “Web editors”. Specifically, she detects a shared interest in “organizing information”, “keeping it up to date”, “making it easily accessible”, “ensuring accuracy”, “communicating clearly” and “assisting with learning”. An intermediary responsible for the book collection in a study centre may be skilled more generally in information management and their abilities could be invaluable in a VLE context, yet it is all too easy for them to be effectively branded as ‘the book expert’ and seen purely in those terms. As Tarter remarks, traditionally, school librarians have often been typecast as “caretakers of the ‘quiet room’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0340035212455621">Tarter and Hyams 2010</xref>: 30).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0340035212455621">
<title>Regulation of the environment</title>
<p>Various tactics are available to schools in their attempts to ensure that pupils accept study centre norms and rules. They and their parents may be asked, prior to their use of the facility, to sign a contract in which they give a formal undertaking that they will behave in a satisfactory manner; they may be required to indicate on each occasion when they log on that they will adhere to an acceptable use policy; teachers may familiarize pupils in advance of their first session in the centre with the punishments that will be administered in the event of infringements of the rules. Yet, despite these precautions it is likely that punitive sanctions will have to be taken against some pupils at certain times. One of the greatest problems in applying such penalties is that of consistency. If rules are breached during lessons within the centre, it is highly likely that the teacher involved will see it as their prerogative to impose their own sanctions, which may well take the form of a ban on the pupil’s use of the facility for a given period. Another teacher, however, faced with a similar transgression may impose a different ban. It may, for example, be of a different duration and whereas one may be a ban on study centre use outside lessons, the other may be a total ban. In addition to variations in the attitudes of one teacher and another, study centre staff may have their own views on the punishments that should be applied during casual access periods and may even disagree among themselves. Drawing on findings from several research projects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0340035212455621">Julien and Barker (2009)</xref> assert that adolescents demonstrate a “significant preference for the Internet and electronic resources over print resources” (p. 13). If teachers recognize such an attitude to be prevalent in their own pupils, there is a danger that youngsters who break rules that apply in wider school situations which in no way relate to the study centre are also punished with bans on their use of the facility. This action is akin to the longstanding sanction of forcing youngsters who enjoy sport to miss games lessons. As well as depriving the miscreants of using a favoured means of finding information, study centre bans also, of course, result in offenders losing the privilege of playing computer games and emailing in an environment that they are likely to enjoy frequenting with their friends. However, complications result when pupils attempt to circumvent the sanctions that have been imposed. A banned individual may, for example, argue that they need access to a study centre computer during lunch time in order to complete a homework assignment and may even solicit support from a sympathetic teacher in their efforts to have their ban temporarily overturned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0340035212455621">
<title>Prioritizing contrasting pupil needs</title>
<p>Some of the problems that arise when the study centre becomes full to capacity were outlined earlier. Another issue that emerges is the respective priorities which should be given to youngsters wanting to use the facility for different reasons in the event of there being no room for incoming pupils. If, for example, all the workstations are taken and some of the youngsters occupying them are merely playing games, should they be asked to vacate their places for later arrivals who are intent on tackling homework assignments? Similar debates have vexed librarians for decades. The issue is sometimes framed in terms of ‘needs’ and ‘wants’. For instance, in a classic distinction often made in relation to information needs presented in public libraries, it may be decided that, since youngsters’ inquiries pertaining to academic assignments reflect ‘needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0340035212455621">Department of National Heritage 1995</xref>), they are more important than questions inspired by more trifling purposes, such as competition entries, which are essentially expressions of a ‘want’. Yet, by no means everyone is able to accept hard and fast demarcations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0340035212455621">Line (1974)</xref>, for example, states that “a recreational need may be just as much a need as an educational need”, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0340035212455621">Williams (1965)</xref> blurs the divide by associating with a need material that many commentators would probably feel pertains to a want. Specifically, Williams maintains that, despite its apparent frivolity, the reading of “ephemeral writing” can become a necessity and points to the important function that it fulfils in a range of situations, one of which he identifies as “disturbing growth as in adolescence” (p. 193). The motivations of pupils seeking to use their school’s study centre can also be understood in terms of a needs and wants dichotomy, although even staff who are in accord as to what is embraced by a need and what by a want may still disagree on the most appropriate approach in these circumstances. Some may take the line that, because the study centre is a school facility, its primary function is to support teaching and learning wherever possible, whereas others may consider it to be a place where pupils can relax and take a break from the working day, whilst still being subject to adult supervision.</p>

<title>Teaching and casual access</title>
<p>If the school operates a staggered lunch time, it may well be the case that, whilst teachers are keen to use parts of the study centre for their lessons, pupils wish to exploit the remaining areas for casual access. Where the facility is genuinely open plan and there are no real physical divisions between the different areas, any hubbub from youngsters using it for recreational purposes, such as playing games, may disturb pupils and teachers who are involved in lessons, although noise can be at least partially limited through close staff supervision and rules such as one pupil to one computer. If the facility is <italic>frequently </italic>used for lessons over lunch times, there is a danger that there will be insufficient provision for those youngsters who rely on it to tackle out of class assignments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212455621">Gardner, Woolford and Colvin (2007)</xref> acknowledge how a comparable problem has arisen in their own institution. Conversely, school leaders may, of course, insist that, during lunch times, the facility is used <italic>only</italic> for casual access. One head teacher who adheres to this policy explained his thinking to the author: “If we can accommodate eighty kids in the study centre and they’re supervised, it means we don’t have eighty kids causing trouble elsewhere in the school”. Again, however, such a stance is bound to displease teachers who believe that the facility’s principal role should be that of an <italic>educational</italic> resource; ill feeling among teachers who are of this opinion may be especially prevalent if it is highly apparent that pupils who exploit the study centre in casual access periods tend to do so for inconsequential recreational pursuits, rather than to support their academic work. It may be argued that, for pupils who use the facility mainly or even exclusively for game-playing or emailing friends, the environment’s designation as a ‘study centre’ could scarcely be more inappropriate. The situation is perhaps different when youngsters are intent on any real pursuit of information. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212455621">Carmichael (2010)</xref> writes of how, in an educational institution where learning for its own sake is valued and encouraged, the purposeful investigation of topics of personal interest may be deemed to be embraced within the concept of ‘serious study’. </p>

<title>Retaining structural integrity and consistency</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0340035212455621">Streatfield and Markless (1994)</xref> explain that one of a school library’s roles may be that of a model which demonstrates how a large collection of information may be organized. The resources made available via a VLE can serve as a comparable exemplar. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0340035212455621">Figure 2</xref> gives some insight into how electronic resources for social sciences are managed in the school where the author is employed. It can be seen that, within the overall disciplinary category, they are grouped according to the academic level and curricular subject. More precise breakdowns are provided according to topic at the hierarchical level directly below. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that, over time, the principles governing the naming of documents and the structuring of hierarchies involving folders, sub-folders, etc. becomes lost, and, as different members of staff upload materials, the variations become so marked that the VLE’s organization, far from demonstrating good practice, is rendered increasingly anarchic. There may even be discrepancies in what is done within a particular academic department, specifically between one teacher and another. Obviously, greater consistency is achieved if a single individual, such as, perhaps, one of the study centre’s learning staff with expertise in information science, is responsible for all the tasks associated with managing the materials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0340035212455621">Mullen (2007)</xref> asserts that a “teacher, subject expert or paid and trained individual is needed to add content and ensure an organized infrastructure of folders” (p. 38), although some teachers may prefer to upload their documents themselves and develop the necessary hierarchical structures in ways that are meaningful and intuitive to them personally.</p>

<title>Information literacy development</title>
<p>In addition to providing an environment such as a study centre where information skills can be practised and ensuring that opportunities for pupils to use it for learning tasks are embedded in a range of lessons, it is essential that a coherent framework for actively teaching the skills is built into the school curriculum. Few would dispute the recommendation made in the School Library Guidelines presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212455621">IFLA/UNESCO (2002)</xref> that information literacy should be “gradually developed and adopted through the school system” (p. 14), but there remains a conspicuous lack of consensus with regard to how this is best achieved. One approach to promoting information literacy within a particular institution is to offer the appropriate instruction in sessions devoted to individual subject areas. The effective use of tools such as search engines, for example, may be addressed in ICT lessons; in History, consideration of the value of particular sources may be extended to explore the quality of individual web pages; strategies for investigating source bias may be covered in the course of English sessions on the theme of ‘writing to persuade’. However, as there is a risk that the skills addressed are understood by pupils principally in the context of the curriculum subject being covered and the overall programme is presented to learners in a somewhat fragmentary fashion rather than as an integrated whole, staff may favour a strategy in which information literacy is promoted in a separate unit whose overall remit may be as wide as ‘study skills’. Here, too, though, there may be problems since youngsters frequently struggle to apply to wider contexts what they learn in exercise situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0340035212455621">Lincoln 1987</xref>). As the IFLA/UNESCO Guidelines make clear, the adoption of information literacy principles should enable pupils to master “a learning process that is transferable across content areas as well as from the academic environment to real life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212455621">IFLA/UNESCO 2002</xref>: 21). Whichever route to this outcome is taken, the potential of both the study centre environment itself and the expertise of the staff within it must be exploited to the full when the sessions are being planned and delivered.</p>

<sec id="section13-0340035212455621">
<title>Balancing provision for individual and collaborative learning</title>
<p>The prevalence of ICT in study centres perhaps leads to an assumption that the learning which takes place within them typically involves youngsters sitting at a computer and working in isolated fashion, especially if a rule of one pupil to one machine is steadfastly applied. Yet, as much of the literature indicates, those who manage such environments often aim to cater for a variety of ways of learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212455621">Gardner, Woolford and Colvin (2007)</xref> write of how a study centre can accommodate “a wide range of learning styles” (p. 36), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0340035212455621">Christie and Everitt (2007)</xref> see the facility as, ideally, “a one-stop shop that supports personalized learning, with the student determining how, where and when they learn” (p. 35).</p>
<p>Despite the frequent tendency to associate the<italic> technology</italic> in study centres with individualized approaches, for some commentators it is traditional books that allow the greatest flexibility with regard to working methods. In arguing that content within books can be investigated in “unpredictable and non-linear ways”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0340035212455621">Jardine (2010)</xref> outlines how a reader who is interacting with several texts simultaneously may arrange them in specific positions on their desk “to explain their part in the argument” they are following. It is certainly a measure of the inherent flexibility of books that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0340035212455621">Tibbitts (1992)</xref> is able to identify a series of ways in which they may be read, with each strategy closely related to a different purpose on the part of the user. If it is true, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0340035212455621">Criddle (1998)</xref> proposes, that traditional media generally deal in “richer types of information” than electronic resources such as web pages (p. 58), then it would seem that conventional materials like books offer more scope for the application of a greater range of reading tactics and thus, it may be argued, are better able to support different kinds of learning. This claim effectively returns the discussion to the first issue explored in this paper – namely, ensuring that full use is made of the book element within the study centre.</p>
<p>Some individuals, however, relish opportunities to learn via interaction with their peers. This is particularly true of those whose preferred learning style is that of ‘assimilator’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0340035212455621">Webb and Powis (2005)</xref> explain that people falling into this category “think in abstractions and process… new knowledge actively in the company of others” (p. 51). Drawing on the ideas of Vygotsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0340035212455621">James (2006)</xref> maintains that a social dimension can, in fact, be considered pivotal to the concept of learning itself. She argues that, according to one perspective, “learning is by definition a social and collaborative activity in which people develop their thinking together” (p. 57). Any study centre manager who accepts this principle is naturally faced with the task of striking an appropriate balance between facilitating access to learning resources, whether they be paper or electronic, and offering spaces that encourage pupil interaction. Somewhat paradoxically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0340035212455621">November (2007)</xref> suggests that, with learning becoming “more personalized and individually designed”, the need “to provide social spaces where students can work together to derive meaning from their online experience” is increasingly important (p. 45). In the mid 1970s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0340035212455621">Lindsay (1976)</xref> distinguished between “learning as reproduction” and “learning as creation” (p. 20). Today, with the advent of a ‘copy and paste’ mentality, it is all too easy for ‘learning as reproduction’ to manifest itself through a mechanical process that takes place with a solitary individual sitting at a computer workstation; if school managers are keen to promote the more creative mindset, discussion between learners may have a substantial role to play and should be encouraged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212455621">Gross (1998)</xref> notes how such simple measures as using large, round tables or pushing individual desks together can bring about “a physical layout that promotes interaction” (p. 134).</p>
<p>The emphasis on collaboration, however, once more raises an intriguing semantic question in relation to the label that should be applied to these environments and what takes place within them. Whilst the term ‘study centre’ would still appear appropriate in the context of collaborative learning at least, ‘independent learning zone’ is more questionable. The <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0340035212455621">International Dictionary of Education</xref></italic> (1977) asserts that ‘independent learning’ refers to the individual operating “independently of other learners in a class or group” (p. 171), and this clearly runs contrary to any collaborative ethos. It may be, of course, that the learning brought about in a study centre is thought to be ‘independent’ in the sense that it does not involve direct instruction from a teacher, although even this may not be the case in many lessons staged in the environment. Modern explanations of independent learning frequently adopt a stance that contrasts sharply with that of the <italic>International Dictionary of Education</italic>. One, taken by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0340035212455621">Quality Improvement Agency for Lifelong Learning (2008)</xref>, indicates explicitly that independent learning sees participants “sharing ideas and problems and working together to resolve those problems” (p. 1). If, as the Agency also suggests, independent learning means helping pupils to make informed decisions with regard to their own learning, then the ‘independence’ that study centres afford should perhaps be understood in terms of the scope and support they provide for pupils to learn in their own way.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has discussed a range of issues that must be addressed by the managers of schools wishing to introduce a study centre approach. If such a facility is to replace a conventional school library, the proposal may, from the outset, meet with opposition from those who favour a traditional area. More specific, practical challenges arise, too. Undoubtedly, some are similar to those that have been faced by school librarians for years. For example, what strategy should be employed for teaching information literacy? This question echoes longstanding debates that relate to the most effective placement of library ‘user education’ and ‘bibliographical instruction’; over 35 years ago now, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0340035212455621">Lindsay (1976)</xref> drew attention to the problems of the ‘library periods’ in his own secondary school being taken by staff from the English department. Seasoned librarians will also be aware of questions such as whether the use of their area for lessons should take priority over casual access and whether the academic needs of pupils are to be adjudged more important than their recreational pursuits. Information professionals in both settings must grapple with the task of ensuring that the potential of the resources available is maximized, and problems associated with, for example, plagiarism and the pre-packaging of information for youngsters must be countered.</p>
<p>Other matters, however, are more peculiar to these new information environments. If both books and ICT workstations are accommodated, how is the use of each to be promoted and, in particular, how can vital skills that are frequently associated with the paper environment best be championed? The maintenance of consistency is a significant challenge in several respects, especially in terms of sanctions applied to pupils who breach discipline and how structural integrity is maintained over time in the VLE to which the study centre affords access. More fundamentally, what kinds of electronic materials should be made available and how is this best achieved? In addition, questions may emerge in terms of the physical environment. Given the space available, what constitutes the best arrangement of the computers and how should decisions be reached with regard to needs for expansion? What proportion of the room that exists should be allocated to facilities for accessing the various resources offered and promoting the interaction of learners respectively? If it is true that the greatest strength of any organization is its staff, then the tasks of ensuring that the abilities and expertise of all the individuals employed in the facility are properly exploited and that the work of the different kinds of personnel dovetails seamlessly are perhaps two of the most basic. It is, however, clear that no absolute solutions which are effective in every case can be applied to many of these questions. Indeed, very often much will depend on local factors such as the culture within the school and the specific context in which the study centre operates.</p>
