<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Adults hospitalized with diabetes are likely to have multiple comorbid conditions contributing to suboptimal health-related quality of life.

</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712467697">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were collected using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the comparative risk perception questionnaire, and glycosylated hemoglobin.

<sec id="section3-0145721712467697">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Those with more severe disease who also anticipated the development of additional diabetes-related complications were likely to have suboptimal physical and mental functioning. The perception of diabetes as a health threat concurrent with having non-diabetes-related comorbid chronic conditions contributed uniquely to explaining scores in health-related quality of life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Hospitalized adults with diabetes represent a population affected by chronic disease demands that contribute to suboptimal physical and mental functioning. Suboptimal quality of life may contribute to severity of diabetes and to a perception of having a threatening disease trajectory. Hospitalization provides an opportunity for clinicians to intervene in mental and physical functioning by assessing for threatening illness perceptions and employing interventions to promote acceptance of functional limitations.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes affects about 25 million people in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712467697">1</xref></sup> and is associated with poor health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712467697">2</xref></sup> Factors that contribute to poor health-related quality of life in those with diabetes include symptoms from glucose alterations and physical complications due to micro/macrovascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and kidney and heart disease. Other chronic conditions that are not necessarily associated with diabetes are also prevalent, affecting almost half the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712467697">3</xref></sup> About 75% of aging adults have at least 1 chronic condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712467697">4</xref></sup> Patients hospitalized with diabetes account for 22% of hospital charges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712467697">5</xref></sup> The increased health care cost accrual by those with diabetes is related to the complexity and mix of comorbid conditions such as vascular disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712467697">6</xref></sup> In the urban poor, common comorbid conditions (ie, asthma, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and disorders of addiction) result in suboptimal health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712467697">7</xref></sup> and are observed in addition to diabetes-related complications such as chronic pain from neuropathy and vascular disease. The purpose of this article is to report on the characteristics of an urban adult population hospitalized with diabetes with regard to their disease severity, perceived illness threat, and health-related quality of life. Severe diabetes, defined as having poor glycosylated hemoglobin and related complications, is likely to be accompanied by suboptimal quality of life. Illness perceptions have been observed to be associated with disability and poor self-rated physical function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712467697">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Health-related quality of life is a general self-rated concept regarding one’s own mental, physical, and social functioning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467697">9</xref></sup> representing a major outcome of diabetes management interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712467697">10</xref></sup> Psychosocial factors have been cited as barriers to achieving quality of life, including personal models of illness (also known as illness perception).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712467697">11</xref></sup> Factors in recent studies that have been shown to be associated with quality of life, such as depression and self-efficacy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712467697">12</xref></sup> are constructs that are closely related to the personal model constructs, emotional reactions, and control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712467697">13</xref></sup> Cost-effectiveness of diabetes trials has been measured using the effect on improvement in quality of life, such as in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712467697">14</xref></sup> and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712467697">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, interventions targeting improved glucose control in those with impaired glucose tolerance enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program demonstrated beneficial effects on quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712467697">16</xref></sup> Glycemic control appears to exert effects on quality of life as do complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712467697">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, those who demonstrate acceptance of diabetes tend to have better metabolic control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712467697">18</xref></sup> which likely leads to improvements in quality of life. <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> recommends interventions to improve quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712467697">19</xref></sup> Hospitalization within the past 6 months and age have been shown to be predictive of poor quality of life in those with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712467697">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Illness perceptions influence problem-solving and coping behavior in chronic disease self-management. Interventions to improve quality of life have targeted problem-solving and coping skills in those with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712467697">20</xref></sup> According to self-regulation theory, illness perceptions include the beliefs about the causes, timeline, identity (symptoms and understanding), controllability, and consequences that create a schematic view of one’s own illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712467697">13</xref></sup> Collectively, this schematic view results in an illness perception that is either threatening or nonthreatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467697">21</xref></sup> Illness perceptions have been shown to be associated with adherence in diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712467697">22</xref></sup> Illness perceptions are associated with risk for developing diabetes-related complications, such as amputations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712467697">23</xref></sup> well-being, and health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712467697">24</xref></sup> Some research has even shown that illness perceptions can be altered from a threatening view to a nonthreatening view through provider-led interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712467697">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on the theoretical foundation and literature review, the following hypothesis (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712467697">Figure 1</xref>) was made: adults hospitalized with diabetes who perceive that their current disease status is severe and threatening would also be likely to anticipate disease progression, such that those with an anticipated disease trajectory that includes diabetes-related complications would also likely perceive themselves as having poor physical and mental functioning. Diabetes severity, duration of diabetes in years, perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions would be negatively associated with health-related quality of life. In addition, those who perceive their diabetes to be threatening would be likely to have suboptimal health-related quality of life.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A descriptive observational design was employed by collecting data on adults (N = 110) with diabetes who were recruited as part of a randomized intention-to-treat trial whereby transitional care was provided to hospitalized adults being discharged to home. Volunteers were hospitalized with diabetes as a primary admitting diagnosis and may have had exacerbations of comorbid conditions concurrently. The hospital was an urban, public, academic teaching hospital in a Northeast coast community. The hospital is the largest charity care provider in the state it is located. Patients were identified by the study team rounding and asking nurses to ask patients who were admitted with diabetes as a primary diagnosis if the study team could speak with them. Nurses were asked to locate patients with diabetes and ask if the study team could speak with them about a diabetes management program. Diabetes diagnosis was confirmed in the medical record. Participants were surveyed about their current glucose control, comorbid conditions (both diabetes related and other), disease duration, illness perception, perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications, and health-related quality of life. Paper-and-pencil surveys were administered and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were measured using an analyzer that provides results in 6 minutes at the bedside by finger stick, while participants were still hospitalized. Incentives were not provided to participants, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.</p>

<title>Surveys</title>
<p>During a hospital stay for an acute exacerbation of chronic illness, participants were asked to think about the time period when they “felt well” before being admitted to the hospital and/or before the acute onset of illness when answering the following surveys:</p>

<title>Illness perception</title>
<p>Broadbent et al’s 8-item Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467697">21</xref></sup> was administered. The measure contains single items using a 10-point rating scale on a level of agreement assessing each of Leventhal et al’s illness representation model (also known as personal models) components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712467697">13</xref></sup>: timeline, identity, control, consequences, causes, and emotional reactions. High scores indicate a threatening illness view, and low scores indicate a nonthreatening illness view. The BIPQ demonstrates concurrent validity as a rapid assessment with longer, highly reliable measures of illness perception ranging from <italic>r</italic> = .33 to <italic>r</italic> = .63 with significant associations. Predictive ability was demonstrated with disease outcomes such as mental and physical function (ie, quality of life), diabetes self-efficacy, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Test-retest reliability ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .48 for understanding to <italic>r</italic> = .70 for consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712467697">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Risk perception</title>
<p>Walker et al’s Comparative Risk Perception Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712467697">26</xref></sup> was administered. The original measure contains 5 subscales: personal control, worry, optimistic bias, personal disease risk, and comparative environmental risk. For this study, only single items with a 5-point Likert scale assessed perceived risk of each diabetes-specific complication (ie, amputation, stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, periodontal disease). A high score denotes high perceived risk. The items were preceded by the following stems: “How would you rate your risk of. . . .” The response sets included “almost none” to “high.” The Comparative Risk Perception Questionnaire demonstrates validity and reliability in ethnically diverse samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712467697">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Health-related quality of life</title>
<p>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) licensing fees were paid for permission to use. The primary areas assessed were mental and physical function and general health and well-being from the patient’s viewpoint. The measure has been used to compare disease burden across populations and to test treatment effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467697">9</xref></sup> The SF-36 demonstrates validity and reliability on diverse samples with diverse disease conditions with internal consistency reliability above .90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712467697">9</xref></sup> in many samples and is one of the most highly cited quality-of-life measures. High scores indicate good quality of life, and low scores indicate poor or suboptimal quality of life. The format of the response set for most of the items was rated as excellent, very good, fair, poor, or very poor.</p>

<title>Glucose control</title>
<p>Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured using the using the Siemens DCA 2000 Advance (Siemens Diagnostics, Tarrytown, New York). The A1C has been shown to correlate closely with serum drawn A1C values. The A1C analyzer used in this study correlates very closely with values drawn by venipuncture, and the device is CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) waived for use in point-of-care testing where real-time medication decisions are made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712467697">27</xref></sup> Glycosylated hemoglobin is measured as a continuous variable, with higher values indicating poor glucose control and disease outcomes and values below 7% indicating good control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712467697">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A descriptive questionnaire was also provided in which participants were asked to answer questions about their characteristics as well as their duration of diabetes and select from a list their currently diagnosed complications due to diabetes and other health conditions that make it difficult to manage their diabetes.</p>

<sec id="section11-0145721712467697">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Data were entered into a statistical software program and analyzed using SPSS version 18.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712467697">28</xref></sup> The mean score for each survey was calculated for illness perception-threat and quality of life. Risk perception was calculated by taking perceived risk for developing 1 or more additional diabetes-related complications. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical linear multiple regression analyses using listwise deletion for missing values. A moderator variable named diabetes severity was created by multiplying scores of the number of diabetes-related complications per individual (2 or more complications were calculated) by their current glycosylated hemoglobin level. Although insulin usage may be perceived as a disease severity indicator by some, insulin usage and number of oral agents indicating disease treatment complexity were not incorporated in the analyses because all of the patients were on insulin during the inpatient stay, limiting range variability. In addition, many patients were on oral agents before hospitalization but could not clarify if the agents were for diabetes or other conditions. A sample size of 100 was estimated to be able to detect small effects of independent variables and differences between mean scores on quality of life with 80% power using GPOWER.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712467697">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results of Hypotheses Tests</title>
<p>The following hypothesis was tested: diabetes severity, duration of diabetes in years, perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions will be negatively associated with health-related quality of life. In addition, those who perceive their diabetes to be threatening will be even more likely to have suboptimal health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life scores were regressed onto predictor variables: diabetes severity, defined as the product of average glucose level measured by glycosylated hemoglobin and the total number of diabetes-related complications per individual in combination with duration of diabetes in years, and perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications (previously undiagnosed). Perceived risk of diabetes related-complications, diabetes severity, and duration of diabetes were significantly and negatively associated with health-related quality of life (<italic>F</italic>(3, 68) = 3.08, <italic>P</italic> = .03), explaining 35% variance in scores. Perceived risk of diabetes-related complications (β = −.31, <italic>P</italic> = .008; 95% confidence interval [CI], −.008 to −.001) contributed uniquely in explaining variance in health-related quality-of-life scores. This indicates that those who had diabetes for more years, had more complications from diabetes, and anticipated the development of additional diabetes-related complications also had suboptimal physical and mental functioning. Conversely, those who did not have longstanding diabetes, had few complications, and were not anticipating developing other diabetes-related complications had optimal physical and mental functioning scores.</p>
<p>When additional non-diabetes-related comorbid conditions were added to the regression model, the variance in health-related quality of life explained an additional 10% of variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>; = .46; <italic>F</italic>(4, 66) = 5.44, <italic>P</italic> = .001). In this model, perceived risk for developing diabetes-related complications (β = −.26, <italic>P</italic> = .18; 95% CI, −.007 to −.001) and non-diabetes-related comorbid conditions (β = −.33, <italic>P</italic> = .005; 95% CI, −5.75 to −1.09) contributed uniquely to explaining scores in health-related quality of life. This indicates that having comorbid conditions in addition to the physical demands of diabetes further impedes physical and mental functioning.</p>
<p>In the final analyses in testing the central hypothesis, illness perception was added to the regression model using health-related quality of life as the dependent variable. When illness perception was added to the model, approximately 64% of the variance in health-related quality of life was explained (<italic>F</italic>(5, 55) = 7.49, <italic>P</italic> = .000). Interestingly, in this model, perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications drops out of uniquely and significantly (β = −.171) explaining health-related quality of life, and illness perception (β = .39, <italic>P</italic> = .000; 95% CI, .412 to 1.35) and non-diabetes-related comorbid conditions (β = −.42, <italic>P</italic> = .000; 95% CI, −6.78 to −2.11) uniquely explain the variance in health-related quality of life. This indicates that high illness perception scores indicating perceived disease threat, along with having multiple comorbid conditions not considered to be diabetes related yet pose a challenge to caring for one’s diabetes, offer a more complete understanding of the antecedents to suboptimal physical and mental functioning in adults who become hospitalized with diabetes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712467697">Table 3</xref> contains the correlation matrix of the variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the urban, hospitalized, very low-income sample studied here, longer duration of diabetes, disease severity defined as self-reported diabetes-related complications and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, perceived risk of developing additional diabetes-related complications, having at least 2 non-diabetes-related comorbid conditions (ie, HIV, sickle cell disease), and holding the view that diabetes is threatening were each independently associated with poor quality of life (both physical and mental functioning). Those who had severe disease status and who were also coping with other non-diabetes-related complications found their diabetes to be most threatening. Those who had diabetes for the least duration of time and who had the highest degree of perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications found their diabetes to be less of a threat. Since threat was defined as perceiving that one could not control his or her condition, that the condition has a lot of consequences, and the emotional response (such as anger, depression, sadness, and fear), it is possible that the more recently diagnosed individuals were having success with their treatment regimen and believed they could control their diabetes, suppressing emotional responses and high felt personal consequences.</p>
<p>Individuals who recognize and accept a risk for complications may be taking action through self-care behavior or preventive measures to reduce their risk of complications, resulting in low scores on perceived risk of complications in the context of recognizing illness threat. Illness threat, measured as illness perception, has been shown to be associated with risk perception and worry in chronic disease populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712467697">33</xref></sup> The illness perception constructs of identity, control, and emotional consequences are similar to those psychosocial factors found to be associated with quality of life in other studies such as self-efficacy, depression, knowledge, and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>The illness perception construct used to estimate perception of disease threat specifically taps consequences of illness, and it is possible that those scoring high on consequences also score high on perceived risk of complications, making it difficult to detect effects. In future studies, it may be useful to use a longer version of the illness perception questionnaire by regressing each component of the illness perception model independently onto risk perception measures. Illness perceptions and views of disease threat are modifiable psychological factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712467697">34</xref></sup> A limitation of this study is the uncertainty that remains regarding whether the poor quality of life seen in this sample is due to the complexity of chronic illness or part of the phenomenon of poor self-rated health observed in those from low socioeconomic classes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712467697">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Clinical implications of the findings in this study include those related to policy. Currently, in the United States, more federal funding resources are available for the newly diagnosed under the umbrella of teaching survival and fundamental skills needed for the routine self-management of diabetes (ie, Medicare reimbursement for self-management training). For those with longstanding complex chronic disease and who also anticipate a poor disease trajectory, resources could be provided that focus on physical and mental functioning during self-management training. Clinicians in practice can begin by using brief functional assessment tools to determine quality of life. Those with suboptimal quality-of-life scores should be screened to ascertain their views of illness threat and perceived risk so that concerns can be addressed since both are modifiable psychological factors that affect quality of life. Suboptimal health-related quality of life paradoxically makes it difficult to cope with daily chronic disease self-management demands. Current health care policy includes provisions for the newly diagnosed to receive the bulk of diabetes self-management training resources, with less resources provided for long-term sustainable support by diabetes educators. Those with longstanding diabetes use a large number of hospital days and are likely to return within a 30-day recidivism period.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Illness perceptions of diabetes include beliefs about disease trajectory and the consequences of illness, such as perceiving that one is at risk for developing diabetes-related complications. Collectively, an illness perception that diabetes is not controlling and that one is at risk for consequences of diabetes and holding a belief that diabetes will last a long time indicate that having diabetes is a health threat. Having severe diabetes and endorsing that diabetes is a threat is associated with health-related quality of life. Findings in this study indicate that those who view themselves as being at high risk for diabetes-related complications, such as amputation, kidney failure, stroke, or nerve damage, are the same individuals who perceive their diabetes to be less threatening. The paradoxical relationship may be a function of adjustment and/or acceptance in those who have had diabetes for a longer duration and may represent an accurate self-assessment of reality of one’s own circumstances. A certain degree of acceptance of functional loss has been noted to be a desired outcome of adjustment in coping with chronic illness and has been demonstrated to ultimately improve quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712467697">36</xref></sup> Endorsing that one has a threatening view of diabetes may be a factual assessment of the chronic nature of a condition that is associated with visible functional loss and psychosocial consequences. Acceptance may improve health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712467697">31</xref></sup> Acceptance of diabetes as a threat would be a prerequisite to problem-solving coping and self-care behavior, and self-care behavior leads to glycemic control, which will ultimately lead to improved physical and mental function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721712467697">37</xref></sup> Negative illness views can be modified through provider counseling and clarifying misinformation when identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712467697">35</xref></sup> For example, a patient who perceives a high risk of an amputation who does not have neuropathy or vascular deficiency may have an unusually high perceived risk if the only person he or she knew with diabetes experienced an amputation. Clinicians can provide statistical information about actual risk probability as well as present facts about the effectiveness of preventive measures. Ultimately, resources can be directed toward helping patients with a longer duration of disease accept the nonmodifiable functional loss associated with diabetes to the degree that motivation can be continued to maintain self-care behavior so that the functional limitations can be self-managed.</p>
