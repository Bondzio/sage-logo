<abstract>
<p>The growing attention to acts of interpersonal violence and misconduct among military members has accompanied a host of research investigating the nature and causes associated with these behaviors. As such, a robust body of literature exists lending insight into risk factors and clinical presentations associated with anger and aggression; however, such factors are multidimensional and complex, particularly for those suffering with war stress injuries. Furthermore, mental health stigma and treatment compliance with exposure and cognitive-based models, particularly in clients with aggressive presentations, can impact successful outcomes. One active-duty marine was referred to an outpatient mental health clinic for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Four sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) were used to significantly reduce obsessive violent impulses, traumatic grief, and depression. The benefit of EMDR therapy as a treatment for violent impulses is explored. The results are promising, but more research is needed.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>In the decade that has passed since the inception of the recent military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, media outlets, official reports, and research studies have highlighted alarming increases in acts of interpersonal violence (IPV) and war atrocities associated with military personnel and veterans. As an example, a 2011 U.S. Army report noted a 64% increase in violent sexual crimes since 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650112469461">Mulrine, 2012</xref>). This same report noted that 3,191 sexual assault cases were reported in the military population in 2011 alone, with rates believed to be much higher (i.e., closer to 19,000) when accounting for unreported incidences. This is particularly concerning in light of the fact that the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and intimate partner violence is believed to be higher within military populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534650112469461">Taft et al., 2009</xref>), and moreover, at least 6% to 10% of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans and 10% to 13% of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) have been diagnosed with PTSD, post deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112469461">Klostermann, Mignone, Kelley, Musson, &amp; Bohall, 2012</xref>). Other recent high-profile military-related crimes, such as the alleged murder of 16 innocent Afghan civilians at the hands of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650112469461">Dao, 2012</xref>), highlight the need to better understand how violent impulses subsequent to combat exposure reflect symptoms of traumatic stress.</p>

<title>Misconduct Stress Behaviors</title>

<p>These incidents exemplify what the American military calls “misconduct stress behaviors,” which are present during every armed conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650112469461">Jones, 1995</xref>). Misconduct stress behaviors describe a range of maladaptive stress reactions from minor to serious violations of military or civilian law and the Law of Land Warfare, most often occurring in poorly trained personnel, but “good and heroic, under extreme stress may also engage in misconduct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650112469461">Department of the Army, 2006</xref>, pp. 1-6). Examples include mutilating enemy dead, not taking prisoners, looting, rape, brutality, killing animals, self-inflicted wounds, “fragging” (i.e., intentionally killing other military members), desertion, torture, and intentionally killing noncombatants. The military has identified factors that may increase misconduct stress behaviors including (a) boredom and monotonous duties, especially if combined with chronic frustration and tension; (b) rapid return of soldiers to close contact with noncombatant military, civilians, or families after an intense battle experience without a unit stand-down period in which to defuse; (c) commission of atrocities by the enemy, especially if against U.S. personnel, but also if against local civilians; (d) racial and ethnic tension among Army personnel, stemming from major cultural, physical, and racial differences between U.S. soldiers and/or local populations; (e) local civilian population may be perceived as hostile, untrustworthy, or “subhuman”; (f) failure of expected support, such as inadequate medical support; and (g) popular opposition at home to the war and lack of understanding or belief in the justness of the effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650112469461">Department of the Army, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534650112469461">
<title>Screening for Posttraumatic Anger and Traumatic Grief</title>
<p>Expert consensus within and outside the military is that early identification and intervention is critical to avoid severe, chronic war stress injuries such as PTSD, depression and suicide, substance abuse, and misconduct stress behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112469461">Department of Veterans Affairs [DVA] &amp; Department of Defense [DoD], 2010</xref>). The military’s deployment cycle health screenings, Combat Operational Stress Control programs, anti-mental health stigma, resiliency training, and a plethora of postdeployment and transitional support programs, along with the DVA’s mental health outreach and suicide prevention programs, all represent notable efforts to stem the tide. However, military, government, media, and multiple other sources all point to dramatic escalations in rates of military and veteran suicides, domestic violence, divorce, mental health diagnoses such as PTSD, military sexual trauma, substance abuse, homelessness, joblessness, health problems, and misconduct stress behaviors including IPV and homicide.</p>
<p>Although research aimed at identifying risks for acts of violence among active-duty military and veterans typically trifurcates along the domains of military misconduct, perpetration of IPV (e.g., intimate partner violence and domestic violence), and clinical correlations between psychiatric diagnosis and anger, aggression, and/or hostility, several consistent risk factors routinely emerge across categories. These risk factors should be considered during any deployment-related screening and prevention program and include younger aged soldiers, predeployment history of violent behavior, childhood maltreatment and/or abuse, combat-related stressors, depression, alcohol or drug abuse, and financial status (e.g., unemployed or low income; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650112469461">Elbogen et al., 2010</xref>). Other variables such as chaotic upbringing, lower education levels, marital and/or relationship stress, and children at home have been associated with increased risks for IPV; low education level, childhood exposure to violence, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and high levels of anger have been associated with increased risk for general aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650112469461">Elbogen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534650112469461">
<title>Etiological Factors Associated With IPV and Misconduct</title>
<p>Research pertaining to clinical diagnosis and aggression paints an even more complex picture. Misconduct and IPV research with veterans, active-duty military, and civilian populations has consistently demonstrated a strong association between anger and psychiatric diagnosis, particularly PTSD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112469461">Taft, Creech, &amp; Kachadourian, 2012</xref>). For example, one study showed that war-deployed marines with PTSD were 11 times more likely to be discharged for misconduct behaviors than those without PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650112469461">Highfill-McRoy, Larson, Booth-Kewley, &amp; Garland, 2010</xref>). Another study estimated that of those veterans seeking treatment for PTSD approximately 33% perpetrated violence toward their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534650112469461">Taft et al., 2009</xref>). Not surprisingly, anger is reported as one of the foremost areas of concern for veterans with combat-related PTSD, as well as their family members and treatment providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650112469461">Novaco, Swanson, Gonzalez, Gahm, &amp; Reger, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are potential limitations to narrowing the study of anger and aggression among service members specifically to combat-related PTSD, as is often the case. Research has routinely demonstrated that depression can increase veteran’s risk for IPV and violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650112469461">Hundt &amp; Holohan, 2012</xref>), while other studies have linked military-member aggression to everything from borderline personality disorders to symptoms of psychosis, and alexithymia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650112469461">Elbogen et al., 2010</xref>). Military populations, particularly those with PTSD, are also at high risk for substance abuse and/or dependence. This factor is known to increase impulsive behaviors, thereby confounding the risk for violence even greater still (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534650112469461">Weiss, Tull, Viana, Anestis, &amp; Gratz, 2012</xref>). To that end, anger and impulsivity are also among a host of symptoms—including sleep dysregulation, memory and attention issues, hypertension, sexual problems, gastrointestinal problems, and numerous other health conditions—that may be mediated by neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system dysregulation, phenomena often associated with the physiological stress of prolonged combat exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112469461">DVA/DoD, 2010</xref>). Finally, problems with shame and guilt have also been shown to mediate the relationship between aggression and war stress injuries. For example, one study examining the relationship between IPV, PTSD, depression, guilt, and shame in a sample of treatment-seeking veterans found that shame was the leading variable that distinguished IPV perpetrators from nonperpetrators, and moreover, shame completely mediated the relationship between IPV and PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650112469461">Hundt &amp; Holohan, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Socialization within the military adds another complex element that may serve to influence the risk for aggression. In the context of combat, anger and aggressive behaviors are normative reactions to threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112469461">Forbes et al., 2008</xref>); such responses are not only adaptive to war but have also been extensively modeled and reinforced through military training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534650112469461">Taft, Vogt, Marshall, Panuzio, &amp; Niles, 2007</xref>). Cultural spillover theory would suggest that the legitimization of violence within military culture increases the likelihood that acts of aggression will be used in other domains of life where they are not otherwise sanctioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112469461">Klostermann et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies have focused on personality traits associated with military members. For example, one study found that Vietnam veterans with combat exposure were more likely to self-report participation in wartime atrocities when they measured elevated levels of trait aggression and trait neuroticism (e.g., negative emotionality) on personality assessments, and moreover, elevated levels of disconstraint (e.g., impulsivity, high-risk behaviors) showed a direct association to atrocities, even without exposure to combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650112469461">Holowka et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, researchers have noted that the expression of anger over more vulnerable emotions, such as fear or grief, is more accepted within the dominant culture vis-à-vis male gender socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650112469461">Kulkarni, Porter, &amp; Rauch, 2012</xref>), and in the case of the IPV, it reflects the historical legacy of male domination within society and intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112469461">Klostermann et al., 2012</xref>). This broader sociocultural and historical framework may be important to consider given the variability of clinical presentations that include aggressive symptomatology.</p>
<p>Military culture and masculine gender role may also contribute to the stigma that creates a barrier to mental health treatment among members of the military. This stigma—which can include concerns of being viewed as weak, being treated differently by leadership, fear of facing negative consequences in one’s career, mistrust of mental health providers, and a general sense of self-reliance or belief that one should handle problems on their own—has been well documented in research for years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650112469461">Burnett-Zeigler et al., 2011</xref>). Again, the expression of anger may serve as an alternative to more vulnerable emotions (i.e., fear or grief) in the context of a culture that views vulnerability as a weakness or a threat to employment stability. Though this strategy may impart a short-term gain, anger is associated with the increased severity of PTSD, which in turn is associated with poorer treatment response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650112469461">Kulkarni et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Overview of Early Intervention and Treatment of Posttraumatic Anger and Grief</title>
<p>Similarly, there is evidence that anger symptoms among treatment-seeking military members can negatively impact treatment outcomes. In a study examining the influence of anger on the treatment of veterans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112469461">Forbes et al. (2008)</xref> found that in addition to alcohol use—a well-known impediment to treatment success for clients with PTSD—fear of one’s own anger also significantly contributed to negative treatment outcomes. The authors suggested that patients who have fear of anger are more reluctant to access traumatic memories out of concern that it will activate anger-related cues that were otherwise adaptive in the context of combat. Similarly, in an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650112469461">Foa, Riggs, Massie, and Yarczower (1995)</xref>, patients who reported more anger prior to treatment expressed less fear (i.e., measured by facial fear expression) during exposure to traumatic events and had poorer treatment outcomes. These authors suggested that anger might negatively impact treatment by inhibiting the activation of fear, and thus preventing adequate habituation from occurring.</p>
<p>The aforementioned studies reflect the well-established endorsement and practice of cognitive and exposure-based treatment approaches for clients with PTSD; however, variability of efficacy with these evidence-based therapies (EBTs), particularly when working with military clients with aggressive impulses, is a cause for concern. Moreover, given the profound impact that aggression subsequent to combat-related trauma is currently having on society, the need for a greater understanding of EBTs currently being used and evaluated for the treatment of war stress injuries with aggressive impulses is greatly needed. At present, the DVA and the DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for Managing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650112469461">American Psychiatric Association (2004)</xref> endorse four main evidence-based treatment approaches known to be most effective for the treatment of traumatic stress injuries. These include exposure-based therapies (ET; for example, in vivo, imaginal, and narrative exposure), cognitive-based therapies (CT; for example, cognitive processing therapy, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]), Stress Inoculation Training (SIT; for example, breathing training, muscle relaxation, assertiveness training), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534650112469461">
<title>Research on EMDR Treatment of War Stress Injury</title>
<p>EMDR has amassed a growing body of literature to substantiate its efficacy, particularly for the treatment of the spectrum of war and traumatic stress injuries, including acute stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650112469461">Russell, 2006</xref>), PTSD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112469461">Carlson, Chemtob, Rusnak, Hedlund, &amp; Muraoka, 1998</xref>), medically unexplained symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534650112469461">Russell, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534650112469461">Silver, Rogers, &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>), phantom limb pain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112469461">Russell, 2007</xref>), and war-related symptoms of depression, traumatic grief, anxiety, and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534650112469461">Russell &amp; Figley, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534650112469461">Silver, Brooks, &amp; Obenchain, 1995</xref>). Despite its recognition as an evidence-based treatment since 2004, controversy regarding EMDR continues to exist and has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534650112469461">Russell, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>EMDR offers several potential benefits for military populations over other EBT models. First, EMDR has been shown to be as effective as exposure and cognitive-based models, though EMDR typically confers more rapid treatment gains, making it well suited for emergent response settings (e.g., postevacuation treatments) and for patients prone to drop out early in treatment when symptom alleviation is not immediately apparent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534650112469461">Russell, Lipke, &amp; Figley, 2011</xref>). In addition, clients using EMDR are not required to disclose specific information about their disturbing experiences. This is particularly advantageous for those clients who are reluctant to discuss traumatic memories for fear of their own anger, as well as for clients who use anger as a maladaptive coping style (e.g., fear of appearing weak or reluctant to express grief), and for those clients who want to avoid self-disclosure out of guilt and shame, or out of concern for the ramifications of disclosing perpetrating behaviors. Furthermore, EMDR endorses a neuroscientific explanatory model with treatment protocols that may seem less “touchy-feely” than other talking therapies and therefore may be perceived as less stigmatizing to patients. Finally, EMDR does not require homework, which may further enhance prospective treatment compliance, particularly for populations like the military, where reluctance to engage in mental health services is commonplace. These advantages may account for emerging evidence that EMDR has lower drop-out rates for military populations when compared with prolonged exposure therapy and CBT (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534650112469461">Silver et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At present, there is no research identifying EMDR therapy as a viable treatment option for the amelioration of violent impulses, which is the purpose of the present case study.</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>The therapist was an Army clinical psychologist assigned to an Army mental health outpatient clinic. A primary care manager referred an active-duty patient for an urgent psychological evaluation and treatment following a positive postdeployment health reassessment that indicated possible posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms subsequent to the patient’s return home from a second combat tour approximately 8 months prior. The patient, who will be given the fictitious name “Dave,” gave consent to describe the details of his treatment, but personal identifying information has been redacted to protect his privacy. Dave is a 31-year-old, engaged, Caucasian, male, enlisted Marine Corps Sergeant (E-5) with over 10 years continuous active-duty service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534650112469461">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Dave began noticing stress symptoms while working with the Afghan Army members, an experience he described as qualitatively different from previous joint patrol operations with Afghanistan soldiers. He described feeling “constantly” vigilant and on guard, and related feeling increasingly frustrated with his military leaders. He also expressed feeling discouraged with the reactions of the Afghanistan civilian population. He thought they appeared to resent the military’s presence and were more prone to betrayal than the Iraqi citizens he had encountered during his first deployment. Dave reported having difficulty with sleep, fatigue, some intrusive thoughts regarding past combat experiences, intermittent headaches, and chronic constipation, which persisted and gradually worsened when he returned home approximately 8 months ago. Upon his return, he experienced severe insomnia, chronic fatigue, diminished appetite, intrusive recollections of combat experiences and the deaths of insurgents and civilians by friendly fire, which included several Afghan children. Dave also relayed that his headaches and gastrointestinal symptoms were now more frequent and severe, and he described his overall mood as constantly irritable. He also described being increasingly prone to anger outbursts. However, what was most disturbing was that within a few weeks of returning home from his second deployment, Dave began experiencing intrusive, vivid images of cutting his fiancée’s throat with a knife. At first he tried distracting himself when the disturbing thoughts came to him, but this was becoming increasingly more difficult as the images were occurring more frequently and more violently.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Dave reported drinking more and becoming more depressed. He also described feeling intense guilt and shame. Dave tearfully confided that he had been seriously contemplating suicide because, as he explained, “I’d rather kill myself than risk hurting someone I love.” He reported that he began to withdraw and avoid his fiancée to prevent the disturbing images from appearing. This subsequently led to heated verbal arguments and threats of postponing their marriage, which further intensified his suicidal urgings. Dave also noticed violent images while driving his car, which he described as, “really bad road rage,” whereby he visualized confronting drivers and either shooting them in the face or cutting their throats. He reported feeling increasingly anxious when talking to his fiancée or driving his car in anticipation of the disturbing thoughts. Dave decided to confide in his fiancée about his sleep problems and road rage. She insisted that he seek mental health treatment, regardless of his stated fears of possible stigma or losing his military career.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534650112469461">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Dave reported no psychiatric history before or since entering the military. He denied any history of legal involvement, including any type of assault or violence. Dave described his childhood as “pretty normal,” having been raised by an intact family in rural Midwest. He reported no history of childhood abuse or witnessing domestic violence and no history of cruelty to animals, enuresis, or fire setting (i.e., homicide triad). Dave graduated from high school at age 18 and denied any academic difficulties, suspensions, or expulsions from fighting. He worked in a convenient store and attended a few quarters at a community college before deciding to enlist in the Marine Corps, as he explained, “to serve my country.” Dave’s medical history was unremarkable. There was no history of closed head injury before or since entering the military. Dave related that he generally got along well with other people and described himself as “pretty happy go lucky,” particularly with people who knew him before returning from his second deployment. Dave reported drinking about two to three beers on average, mostly on the weekends, but had recently increased his alcohol intake (e.g., a six pack or more a day) due to the intrusive thoughts of killing his fiancée. There is no history of suicide gestures or attempts. Extended family history was notable for maternal depression treated with medication.</p>
<p>Dave experienced no significant postdeployment adjustment difficulties following his first 8-month combat deployment to Iraq, despite being involved in multiple firefights, witnessing unit members wounded and one killed in action, as well as viewing dead bodies of Iraqi civilian women and children. Within a few months of his initial return from deployment, he became engaged to a high school sweetheart. However, his marriage plans were put on hold when he received his second deployment order, this time to Afghanistan. During that deployment, he again reported being involved in multiple firefights, he had shot and killed enemy insurgents, and he accidentally killed at least one civilian noncombatant. Several of his unit members were wounded during the deployment, including his best friend, who suffered a traumatic leg amputation via an improvised explosive device (IED).</p>

<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>Four scales were used to monitor Dave’s psychological responses to treatment during the course of treatment and in follow-up sessions.</p>

<p>A mental status examination (MSE) revealed that Dave appeared tired and visibly distressed. His mood was depressed, anxious, and slightly agitated, with limited range of affect that was at times tearful. His thoughts were linear and goal directed. Dave denied any cognitive or perceptual disturbance. His speech rate was somewhat rapid, with fluctuating tone. The therapist observed mild wringing of hands and foot tapping. Dave generally maintained good eye contact. He denied any active suicidal or homicidal ideation and was able to contract for safety.</p>

<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>EMDR is an eight-phased psychotherapeutic treatment designed to address traumatic or negative experiences, present-day triggers, and future maladaptive responses that may be blocking emotional, cognitive, and physiological functioning capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112469461">Shapiro, 2001</xref>). The underline tenet of EMDR comes from the adaptive information processing (AIP) model, which proposes that the brain contains a multidimensional, information-processing neural network responsible for the natural assimilation and accommodation of experiences through associated sensory, affective, cognitive, and physiological links. According to AIP model, psychiatric disturbances like PTSD reflect a block or disturbance to this natural neurophysiologic network, wherein traumatic memories and their subsequent embodied negative affect and beliefs become stored in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112469461">Shapiro, 2001</xref>). Consequently, dysfunctional information from the past pervades present functioning, particularly in circumstances where associated links are pervasive or repeatedly activated. EMDR treatment reflects a means through which these information-processing mechanisms can be engaged, and emotional disturbances, as well as their associated cognitive-affective and somatic associations, have an opportunity to be reprocessed toward a more resolved, assimilated, and adaptive state.</p>
<p>Phase 1 of treatment involves gathering client history and identifying potential target memories. Phase 2 involves preparing the client for EMDR therapy, including providing informed consent and establishing techniques for stress management. During Phase 3 (assessment), the client identifies the target memory with a corresponding visual image that they find most distressing. The client also identifies a maladaptive, negative cognition (NC) that they currently associate with the distressing event, alongside a more adaptive, positive cognition (PC) that they would prefer to associate with the memory. Other concomitant emotions and body sensations are also identified, and the clients’ current rated level of distress and beliefs about the PC are established.</p>
<p>During the fourth phase (desensitization), reprocessing begins. As the client focuses on the target image, the NC and related somatic sensations, they engage in sets of repetitive sensory-motor bilateral stimulations (BLSs; for example, eye movements, sounds, physical taps, alternating light cues, etc.). Although the mechanisms underlying BLS and dual attention focus are not well understood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112469461">Shapiro (2001)</xref> suggested that this process may help activate the information-processing system or, alternatively, may “induce an altered brain state that modifies the behavior of the information-processing system” (p. 33). The client determines the length of the set through nonverbal cues and/or response, at which time they are asked to report whatever comes into their awareness. Each subsequent set is then based on free associations or a new target event that arises at the end of the first set. Cognitive interventions are sometimes used as a way of restarting the reprocessing cycle in cases where progress is not being made. This structure continues as long as the client reports changes, both positive and negative, until they no longer experience a disturbance associated with the target memory.</p>
<p>Phase 5 (installation) of the treatment helps the clients to strengthen their consolidated PC, while Phase 6 (body scan) helps resolve any residual disturbing bodily sensations. In the seventh phase (closure), the client is evaluated for stability, and posttreatment expectations are discussed. Finally, the eighth and final phase (reevaluation) includes a subsequent session wherein initial target memories are reevaluated, and if needed, the treatment plan is expanded to include challenges to the resolution of previous conflicts or any newly emerging issues.</p>

<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<sec id="section14-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 1: Phases 1 and 2</title>
<p>The first session was primarily devoted to the completion of Dave’s history and the preliminary solicitation of potential target memories. Measures of traumatic stress and depression were taken, which revealed moderate levels of both PTSD (PCL-M = 55) and depressive symptoms (BDI-II = 26).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 2: Phases 2 and 3</title>
<p>In a follow-up session 1 week later, Dave was provided feedback on the assessment along with treatment options, including referral to psychiatry for medication trial, follow-up with primary care physician regarding somatic complaints, a war veteran support group, and a review of evidence-based PTSD treatment options (e.g., ET, CT, and EMDR). Dave elected for a trial of EMDR. He was provided a description of EMDR therapy and a model of psychopathology, alongside combat breathing techniques for in-between stress reduction. No other stress reduction method was used, such as safe place. Dave steadfastly declined the referral to psychiatry and refused to consider medication. An informed consent for treatment was obtained and reviewed.</p>
<p>The client was asked to pick the top “three” most disturbing memories that he wanted to start with, and he chose the following:</p>
<sec id="section16-1534650112469461">
<title>First target memory</title>
<p>Dave described a vivid, violent image of cutting his fiancée’s throat with a knife and watching her bleed out. The NC was identified as “I’m evil” and the PC was identified as “I’m a good person.” The emotions associated with target memory one included guilt, self-hatred, and scared, and the physical sensations included tightness in the throat, with a SUDS of 10+ and a VoC (i.e., adaptive cognitive) of 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534650112469461">
<title>Second target memory</title>
<p>Dave described a vivid, violent image of shooting a driver of a car he had confronted in traffic in the face. The NC was identified as “I’ll kill you” and the PC was identified as “I am better than that.” The emotions associated with target memory two included rage, guilt, and scared, and the physical sensations included tightness in the hands, arms, and chest, with a SUDS of 8 and a VoC of 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1534650112469461">
<title>Third target memory</title>
<p>Dave described a traumatic injury that his best friend sustained during combat in Afghanistan. The NC was identified as “I should have protected my friend” and the PC was identified as “That’s war.” The emotions associated with target memory three included guilt, shame, and self-anger, and the physical sensations included tightness in the throat and face area, with a SUDS of 9 and a VoC of 4.</p>
<p>A MSE was administered again at the end of Session 2. The client continued to report no suicidal or homicidal ideation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 3: Phase 4, the First EMDR Processing Session</title>
<p>In Session 3 the following week, Dave reported “having a rough day and night after our first meeting” but reiterated a desire for a trial of EMDR. When asked which memory he wanted to start with, he selected the first target memory (SUDS = 10). Dave was asked to bring up the image of cutting his fiancée’s throat with the knife, the NC, “I’m evil,” and emotions of guilt, self-hatred, and scared as they might come up, along with the sensation of “tightness” in his chest.</p>
<p>The dual focusing of attention was initiated as the therapist asked Dave to follow the alternating light of a light bar. After the first BLS set, he was asked to “Take a deep breath,” followed by “Tell me what you notice now?” The client said, “The image got a lot more vivid and I felt the tightness growing (as he pointed to his chest).” Therapist replied, “Just notice that, and just let whatever comes up, come up.” Another BLS set was initiated, at which time Dave’s face turned red and his eyes began watering. After this BLS set, Dave was asked what he noticed. He reported that he was looking in the shocked, horrified eyes of his fiancée after he cut her throat, and her mouthing the question, “Why?” Dave wiped away tears and was asked to, “Just stay with that.” Another three to four BLS sets were initiated. Subsequently, Dave replied, “I asked her to forgive me, I can’t live with myself anymore.” The therapist responded, “Just focus on that,” and initiated another two BLS sets. “I hate myself, what I could do . . . it then went to the other image of shooting the driver in the face with my gun . . . same look on his face, asking me why.” The therapist then replied, “Okay, think of that.” Another three BLS sets were administered. The client reported that the associations of the first image (i.e., his fiancée with a cut throat) were “kind of fading,” along with shifting images and memories related to Iraq and Afghanistan. Dave stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I remember now . . . the first time I saw that surprised look on a face was a young Afghanistan woman, maybe in her late teens that had been shot repeatedly and killed. But I can never forget the expression on her face . . . like asking, “Why did you take my life away?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The therapist responded, “Alright, just stay with that, notice anything else that may come up.” Two to three more BLS sets were administered. Dave began shifting back to images of his fiancée, now of memories of her running to greet him after Dave’s first deployment. This accompanied a smile and clearing on his face. Other positive associations, including trips he and his fiancée took together, and remembering the night he proposed to her began to emerge, which then shifted back to the disturbing image of cutting her throat. “But this time, it was not as vivid . . . in fact it’s harder to see the blood or cut . . . that’s really weird.” More BLS sets led to more free associations to memories of his fiancée, both positive and negative (e.g., recent arguing and talking of breaking off the marriage). From here, his emotions shifted from joy and love, to hate and anger, to despair and guilt. Dave began associating to many memories from the war zone, including his first firefight, when he thought we was going to be killed, to seeing several of his unit members being badly wounded or killed, followed by memories of seeing dead civilians, including women and children. These images were associated with a “tightness” sensation from his throat to his head, which initiated a headache. Toward the end of the session, Dave reported the association that he was not a bad person but did some bad things (e.g., killing someone), but that this is part of being in a war. The ensuing BLS set led to associations of feeling guilty and remorseful.</p>
<p>To check the status of the first target memory, Dave was asked to return to the image we started with (i.e., cutting the throat of his fiancée). As he was doing so, a confused expression came over his face. He could still see a clear image of his fiancée’s face, smiling somewhat, but he reported having a harder time seeing the cut he made and the blood. He gave the scene a SUDS of “6-7.” As the session came to a close, Dave practiced a few tactical breaths with the therapist and was advised to keep a log if other thoughts or images came to him between sessions. A quick MSE revealed no suicidal or homicidal ideation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 4: Phase 4, the Second EMDR Processing Session</title>
<p>Upon check-in 1 week later, Dave appeared more relaxed and reported that he and his fiancée went out for dinner after the last session. He explained that he continued to have a few sudden visions of cutting her throat. As he explained, prior to treatment the image would return 15 to 20 times, but now he could quickly distract himself from seeing it, and with far fewer returns (i.e., “Maybe just 4-5 times, I think”).</p>
<p>Dave was asked to return to his first target memory. He reported that he could still see the scene, but the cutting and blood was “harder to see now.” A BLS set was initiated, at which time he replied, “It became more vivid again. I can see her bleeding now.” This accompanied increased “tightness” sensations in his chest, throat, and head. Another three BLS sets produced free associations back to other memories involving his fiancée, images of road rage, and other experiences from the war zone. In particular, he recalled his best friend’s leg being blown off from an IED. He recalled that while his friend lay bleeding, he was looking up at Dave, pleading for him to help him and not let him die. Dave’s associations continued to alternate to other combat memories, including feeling betrayed by civilian members of an Afghan village, anger at military leaders, anger and sadness about being separated from his fiancée so soon after returning from his first deployment, and resentment toward the military’s insensitivity. After additional BLS sets, the patient stated, “I did the best I can under the circumstances.” This was immediately followed by another BLS, at which time he said, “But I killed people, maybe this is what I deserve.” A further BLS led to other associations, some of which were adaptive, others that were maladaptive. This vacillation continued for several more BLS sets. At the end of the session, he rated his first target memory SUDS at 4 to 5 and reported that it was a lot less vivid. As he explained, “It’s harder now for me to see myself actually cutting her throat and bleeding, but I still get this feeling in the stomach that I’m evil.” A MSE revealed no suicidal or homicidal ideation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 5: Phases 4 to 6, the Third EMDR Processing Session</title>
<p>Dave reported only experiencing a few episodes of visualizing violence toward his fiancée in the preceding week. He explained that he was sleeping better and starting to exercise more regularly, and he and his fiancée were back to planning their wedding. He also reported less road rage images and a generally more upbeat mood (e.g., “feeling more like my old self . . . even people at work noticed”). A recheck of the target memory revealed a SUDS of “maybe 3.”</p>
<p>A BLS was initiated with associations from the war zone and back home, with vacillation between negative, disturbing thoughts to more adaptive, positive associations. Dave described the experience of “looping” back and forth, with SUDS now reduced down to 2. When the therapist asked him what kept the SUDS from being a 0 or 1, Dave replied, “Hm . . . I guess the fact that I did actually take other people’s lives.” Another BLS set followed. Dave’s facial expression changed, and he stopped tracking the BLS midway. He responded, “That was really weird doc, the scene with my fiancée changed . . . I was cutting my own throat now.” Further BLS sets revealed various associations, including memories of shooting and killing enemy insurgents, uncertainty as to whether he killed a civilian noncombatant by accident, and overriding feelings of guilt, which switched to anger and eventually back to guilt over the wounding of his friend. He also recounted all of the pain he had submitted his fiancée to after returning from war. The therapist inserted a cognitive interweave to possibly accelerate reprocessing by asking Dave, “If you had killed yourself, how would that have effected your fiancée?” In reply, he stated, “She would be devastated.” Dave was asked to think about this idea as an additional BLS sets was applied. Associations became increasingly more positive in relation to his fiancée, including visiting his best friend who survived his war wounds, thinking of getting married, and images of Afghan villagers who showed appreciation for the help they received to rebuild a bombed-out school. At the end of the session, the therapist rechecked the SUDS of the primary target memory. Dave responded, “I would say probably a 1 now.” And when asked what kept it from being a 0, he replied, “I still killed someone, even if it was war.”</p>
<p>The therapist initiated Phase 5 of treatment with a quick recheck of the VoC. The cognition was changed to “I love my fiancée.” That was paired with the target memory and a VoC rating of 6. A short BLS set was administered. The VoC remained at 6. When asked what kept it from being 7, the patient replied, “It’s still something I did (killing), and people died.” After an additional BLS set, the VoC remained at 6. The therapist initiated Phase 6 of treatment. A body scan revealed “a little tightness” in his stomach. With an additional BLS, the tightness dissipated and was replaced with “a light feeling.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1534650112469461">
<title>Session 6: Phase 8, Target Memory Reassessment</title>
<p>Dave reported continued improvement to health and outlook. He reported no intrusive, violent thoughts over the past week and a half. Consequently, the therapist initiated Phase 8 of treatment. The reevaluated target memory SUDS remained at 1 and the VoC remained at 6. The second target memory was reevaluated, which indicated a generalization effect, with SUDS of 0 (i.e., “I haven’t had any road rage for a while”). A BLS set resulted in no change in SUDS. Next, the third target memory was reevaluated, revealing a SUDS of “about 2.” A set of BLS followed, revealing associations to the war zone, his best friend being wounded, feeling guilty he could not help his friend, and fear he would die on the battlefield. Positive associations followed, including seeing his best friend, who was now upbeat and able to walk with prosthesis. Associations led to memories of practical jokes with his friend and other fond memories. Upon returning to the target memory, a SUDS of “maybe 1” was solicited. A BLS set did not change the SUDS. When asked what prevented a SUDS of 0, Dave replied, “My best friend almost died.” Another BLS yielded no further change in SUDS. Furthermore, the PC remained unchanged upon rechecking. A VoC rating of 6 was maintained after BLS, with the same adaptive cognition. A body scan was “clear” (i.e., feeling light or relax). At the end of the session, the PCL-M and BDI-II were readministered, revealing nonclinical scores.</p>

<sec id="section23-1534650112469461">
<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>As previously stated, fear of one’s own anger is a salient issue for military clients with combat-related PTSD. A cross-sectional/cross-treatment study of emotional regulation, affective control, and depression among military-related PTSD veterans revealed that fear of loosing affective control was most predictive of PTSD symptoms, and furthermore, changes in fear of loosing control was most predictive of successful treatment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650112469461">Price, Monson, Callahan, &amp; Rodriguez, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650112469461">Price et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that once fear of control loss begins to wane, the patient might be more equipped to regulate emotions, leading to more successful treatment gains. To that end, a therapist will need to be particular mindful of this type of client concern. EMDR can be highly beneficial in this context, given that clients are not required to discuss or disclose any of the particulars of their distressing experiences. The therapist may want to periodically remind the client of this, especially early on in treatment, as a way of ameliorating any concerns regarding self-disclosure. It should be noted that though disclosure is not required, clients often elect self-disclosure once they have begun to see treatment gains. Furthermore, as this case study has demonstrated, relaxation techniques (e.g., “safe place”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112469461">Shapiro, 2001</xref>), breathing techniques, or SIT-related strategies may be used if the client reports loss of control concerns or presents with increased anger or agitation.</p>
<p>In addition, clients with aggressive presentations may also be reticent to self-disclose because of previous perpetrating behaviors. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112469461">Taft et al. (2012)</xref> aptly noted, although aggression toward other adults does not necessarily require mandated reporting, clinicians should be mindful of their duty to warn, as stipulated by their agency and state policies; they should be equipped with adequate referral options and crisis outreach contacts; and they should review standard safety procedures for assessing clients who may be at risk of imminent danger to self or others.</p>

<sec id="section24-1534650112469461">
<title>9 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Four months following treatment, Dave called the therapist to inform him that he got married and could not be happier. He thanked the therapist for giving him the chance to be alive and have a family, and confided that when we first met, he had already planned to kill himself that same day because he was convinced that he would have either murdered his fiancée or other people if he did not take his own life. Dave further relayed that after the first session, he decided to see whether therapy would help, and that this would be his last attempt to live. He was adamant that if he had not gotten help, we would have killed someone. Dave agreed to come in for a brief meeting in person in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>At a follow-up 5 months from the last treatment session, Dave showed the therapist his wedding pictures while beaming with pride. He and his new bride were about to transfer to another base within the year. A reassessment of target memories remained the same with regards to SUDS. Dave was readministered the PCL-M and BDI-II, which revealed scores in the nonclinical range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1534650112469461">
<title>10 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p>Over the course of 6 weeks, Dave engaged in a total of seven sessions, four of which included EMDR. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534650112469461">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates, he saw a significant reduction in his primary target symptoms (i.e., violent image of cutting fiancée’s throat), as evidenced by both a posttreatment and a 5-month follow-up SUDS rating of “1” and “2,” respectively. His second and third target symptoms yielded similar outcomes, with a SUDS rating of “0” for target two (i.e., violent image of road rage shooting) and a SUDS rating of “1” for target three (i.e., traumatic injury sustained by friend). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534650112469461">Figure 2</xref>, Dave appears to have made very good progress and no longer meets the criteria for PTSD or depression symptoms (PCL-M = 10; BDI-II = 5).</p>

<title>Importance of Early Identification and Early Intervention</title>
<p>The early identification and intervention of war stress symptoms is crucial to curtailing the severity and chronicity of diagnoses like PTSD, depression, and substance abuse, all of which compound the risk for anger and aggressive behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112469461">DVA/DoD, 2010</xref>). The military’s Post-Deployment Health Screening Reassessment (PDHRA) includes several items designed to screen for interpersonal difficulties, PTSD, alcohol abuse, and depression. One question specifically relates to possible IPV (i.e., “Since return from your deployment, have you had serious conflicts with your spouse, family members, close friends, or at work that continue to cause you worry or concern?”); however, endorsement of questions relating to PTSD (e.g., possible loss of control), alcohol (e.g., excessive drinking, desire to drink less), and depression (e.g., excessive guilt, suicidal thoughts or behaviors) should also warrant screening for possible symptoms of aggression.</p>

<sec id="section27-1534650112469461">
<title>11 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>Although this case study offers encouraging insight into the potential benefits of using EMDR, particularly with respect to posttraumatic-related aggressive impulses, it is not meant to suggest that all military members should expect symptom reduction along the same four-session trajectory or that all instances of IPV and war atrocity can be prevented. However, the ability to potentially intervene and prevent suicide and IPV in whatever the numbers can make a profound difference in the life course of those who would be victims, perpetrators, and their respective families members for generations to come.</p>
<p>Previous studies with PTSD-affected veterans receiving EMDR have suggested that single-trauma PTSD might necessitate as little as a single session to achieve adequate symptom reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650112469461">Russell, 2006</xref>), whereas other studies have suggested the need for as many as 12 sessions for similar outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112469461">Carlson et al., 1998</xref>). Nonetheless, given the benefits of EMDR for the application of violent impulses, which includes rapid treatment gains that may attenuate the fear of loosing affective control, the ability to meet successful outcomes without requiring self-disclosure, and the use of a neuroscientific model that may be received as less stigmatizing to a population already leery of talking therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112469461">Russell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534650112469461">2008b</xref>), the success of this study is promising. Furthermore, it is the experience of the author that EMDR’s client-centered nature can be beneficial to clients, who often feel a sense of control over the therapeutic process. This, in turn, can contribute to the formation of a good working therapeutic alliance.</p>
<p>More EMDR research is needed to understand the variability of efficacy between various clinical presentations of PTSD and other related war stress injuries (e.g., depression, traumatic grief, etc.). Future research should include randomized control studies that compare the efficacy of EBTs (i.e., ET, CT, EMDR, SIT), as well as anger management interventions, for reducing symptoms of anger and aggression, and furthermore, it should evaluate the means through which the treatment of PTSD and other traumatic stress injuries can alleviate anger and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112469461">Taft et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, EMDR research, particularly in military medicine, has had a dubious history in recent years. The DVA/DoD established EMDR as one of its four, top-tier treatments for PTSD in 2004, based on extensive studies, including a 1998 randomized controlled trial of EMDR with Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD. This study yielded a 77% treatment success rate and 0% drop-out rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112469461">DVA/DoD, 2010</xref>), yet the DVA has yet to conduct any subsequent studies using EMDR since that time. Consequently, in January 2011, the Government Accountability Office investigated the DVA for its deceptive practices of restricting training, manual development, and access of care for treatment-seeking veterans to only two EBTs, namely, ET and CT, reflecting the bias of DVA researchers. This is particularly egregious in light of the fact that in February 2012, the DVA informed the Congressional Budget Office that 60% of their patients with PTSD do not complete treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534650112469461">Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534650112469461">Russell (2008a)</xref> summarized the underlying reasons for resistance to EMDR, including controversy surrounding its treatment protocols (i.e., BLS and dual attention processing) as well as the uncritical and often overzealous acceptance of the dominant CBT zeitgeist.</p>
<p>The extensive research now available denoting the relationship between war stress injuries and aggressive impulses should merit swift action, not only within the military but also within society as a whole. Statistics denoting the increased incidences of violence among military members directed outwardly (i.e., IPV) mirrors an equally staggering trend of violence directed inward, with current suicide rates among OEF/OIF veterans outnumbering combat-related deaths of both wars combined (e.g., more than 6,500 suicides per year, or 1 suicide every 80 min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650112469461">Parrish, 2011</xref>). An urgent and rapid expansion of military research to include all EBTs is an ethical obligation that modern scientists should uphold in striving to maintain the highest professional standard of conduct, and a moral obligation that society should uphold in keeping the sacred the promise of caring for those warriors, past, present, and future, for whom they have knowingly sent into harms way. The evidence lay bare—the stress and violence of war, particularly if left untreated, can, and all too often does, come home.</p>
