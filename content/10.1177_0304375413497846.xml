<abstract>
<p>Recent debates on biopolitics have focused on negative and positive interpretations of “life” that is the object of biopolitical apparatuses. Agamben examines the “bare life” that is produced by the sovereign ban, Negri and Hardt speak on the contrary of emancipatory biopolitical production, while Derrida and Esposito study (auto-)immunitary reactions that constitute living beings. The aim of this article is to examine a concrete case that permits to evaluate the explanatory power of these positions. The test case pertains to the recent amendment of the Finnish law on the medical use of human organs, tissues, and cells. It shows very clearly how phenomena that conventionally constitute the basis of proper, personal existence, namely the biological body and death, are not natural phenomena anymore, insofar as they are delimited by biopolitical decisions, that also redefine social relations in a radical manner.</p>

<title>Biopolitics: The Theoretical Context</title>
<p>The threshold between biopolitics and thanatopolitics has been constantly reexamined ever since Michel Foucault brought the term biopolitics into the center of contemporary social and political theory and philosophy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375413497846">1</xref></sup> According to Foucault’s famous definition, “man, over milennia, remained what he was for Aristotle: a living animal with the additional capacity for a political existence; modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence as a living being in question.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375413497846">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, Foucault shows that after the Second World War, sovereignty has gradually transformed into governmentality, the aim of which is not the simple act of living but healthy life: while the premodern exercise of power was defined as a power to <italic>make die and let live</italic>, the modern exercise of power is a power to <italic>make live and let die</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375413497846">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Since<italic> Sovereign Power and Bare Life</italic>, the first volume of the as yet unfinished <italic>Homo Sacer</italic> series, Giorgio Agamben has sought to explicate the very threshold between the politics of life and death in the form of “bare life.” Bare life denotes various situations in which human life has been deprived of its qualified existence, particularly its political existence, and reduced to the simple fact of being alive. Lingering on the threshold between life and death, exposed to death but not in terms of homicide, bare life can no doubt be used by governmentality, but this is possible only because it has in the first place been produced by the sovereign ban. Completing Foucault’s work, Agamben thinks that the biopolitical space of modernity is essentially linked to the “birth of the camps,” and this is also how he underlines the thanatopolitical potential of biopolitics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375413497846">4</xref></sup> Analyzing bare life especially as life under the “state of exception,” Agamben gives a tragic, even inconsolable description of bare life, which he takes to be the fundamental situation of human life today. Jacques Derrida has criticized his conception very severely in <italic>The Beast and the Sovereign</italic>, in which he claims that Agamben’s conception of bare life is unreasonably natural and ahistorical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375413497846">5</xref></sup> Other thinkers as well, often inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s work, have contested Agamben’s “melancholia” in order to examine more optimistic facets of body politics instead. In particular, Antonio Negri and Michel Hardt have sought to replace the transcendent biopower by an imminent and emancipatory biopolitical production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375413497846">6</xref></sup> Roberto Esposito has pushed the question further by trying to go beyond both Agamben’s “negativity” and Negri’s “positivity” by developing, with a reference to Derrida’s notion of “auto-immunity,” a more complex notion of the body that would be produced by its immunitary reactions toward the community of which it is nevertheless a part.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375413497846">7</xref></sup> In this article, I will apply these discussions rather than analyze them on a theoretical level: hence this reminder of the debate between “tragic” and “hopeful” interpretations of the living body in contemporary debates on biopolitics.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the debate on biopolitics is about to pass onto a level at which different positions cannot be evaluated <italic>in abstracto</italic>, so that it is necessary to return to concrete cases to test their value. Theories on biopolitics are <italic>par excellence</italic> theories that need to be judged by what they can do. In this perspective, in this article, I will test the theoretical apparatus of biopolitics on a complex concrete case in which a human being, while reduced to his or her bare life, is also regarded both as a worthy citizen and as a valuable commodity. Naturally, a case study cannot exhaust the possibilities of a theoretical debate. Nonetheless, it will show the utility of biopolitical theoretical apparatus in a concrete case that has hardly been discussed at all in its immediate political context.</p>
<p>My test case is the recent amendment of the Finnish law on the medical use of human organs, tissues, and cells. It legislates on the status of the brain-dead body that belongs to Agamben’s examples rather than Foucault’s: it is one of the paradigm cases of bare life defined in chapter 6 of <italic>Homo Sacer I</italic>. I do not choose the Finnish law because it would be in any way exceptional (on the contrary, I present it as a token of modern, presumably progressive organ transplantation legislation) but because being a Finnish citizen I find it the most accessible. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to recall that Finnish legislation was mentioned already in Agamben’s original analysis of the brain-dead body insofar as he actually quoted as an example a report of the Finnish health office arguing, with an “unwitting circularity,” that “these patients [who have been diagnosed brain-dead and who were therefore supposedly already dead] died within a day.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375413497846">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this article, I will first outline the legal issue of the recent change of the Finnish law on the medical use of human organs, tissues, and cells. Then I will articulate the biopolitical dispositif that it deploys. My intention is merely to examine the text of law as a case that illustrates the intimate coincidence of biopolitics and thanatopolitics. Finally, I will try to show how this particular case fits with the original theoretical debate.</p></sec>
<sec id="section2-0304375413497846">
<title>The Case of Organ Donation</title>
<p>The Finnish law on organ donations was amended on August 1, 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375413497846">9</xref></sup> In comparison with other countries, the new Finnish law is generally regarded as progressive insofar as it is consistent with the desire of Western medical institutions whose aim is to increase the number of transplantations and who therefore present the scarcity of transplantable organs as a major problem.</p>
<p>Before this date, if a person had not <italic>explicitly agreed</italic> to the removal of his organs after death by signing an organ donation card while still alive, his organs could not be transplanted to another person. Since the August 1, 2010, health authorities can on the contrary rely on the “presumed consent” principle, that is to say, they have the right to remove a person’s organs unless he or has <italic>explicitly forbidden</italic> it, and this is known by health authorities in time. One of the explicit aims of the law is to prevent the relatives of the deceased from forbidding the removal of the organs: from now on, the only person who can oppose organ harvesting is the dead person himself (before dying, of course).</p>
<p>According to the law, before the doctor can cut away a dead person’s organs, he must check the person’s will on organ donation by verifying his organ donation card, if he carries one, or by asking his relatives (in order to avoid doubt on the relatives’ honesty the law expects to find a <italic>written</italic> refusal, although it is not an explicit sine qua non). For the time being, there is no official organ donation or refusal card, nor will there be a national organ donation will archive that could be consulted: the legislator judges it to be too expensive to maintain. A person will be able to save his or her will concerning organ donation in the National Patient Data Archive when it will be established, but that is only expected in the future. This is why the law asks the doctor to find out the person’s will <italic>as far as it is possible</italic>; if he cannot know the person’s will for certain, he can proceed to organ harvesting. As there is never much time for making this decision (preventing brain-dead bodies from turning into stone dead corpses is generally a matter of hours), the Act Explanatory Memorandum states that organ harvesting against some person’s will is unavoidable. This means that the new law judges the scarcity of organs to be a greater evil than the eventual acting against a person’s last will.</p>
<p>One cannot say that the amendment of the law was preceded by careful public consideration. In this regard as well, Finland is a typical Western country for, as Margaret Lock shows in her groundbreaking study <italic>Twice Dead. Organ Transplantation and the Reinvention of Death</italic>, in the West extensive public debates on organ transplantation have been rare, contrary to the passionate public debates in Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375413497846">10</xref></sup> According to the Finnish Law Explanatory Memorandum, seventeen specialists were heard during the preparation of the law, none of whom was opposed to it. Indeed, not a single opponent of the presumed consent principle was heard, the concerned committees only heard patient organizations and experts of medicine and law, but none of the relatives having forbidden the removal of the organs of their deceased parents (who were mentioned in the Memorandum with an air of disapproval) nor even presumed specialists on dying and mourning (like for instance psychologists, anthropologists, philosophers and religious authorities). Consequently, the interests of organ receivers were better taken into account than the feelings of potential organ donors and donor kin. The new law passed in the middle of summer holidays with hardly any public discussion. However, bioethical issues seldom arouse heated debates in Finland, and it seems that the new law is in accordance with the public opinion: the Memorandum quotes a nonspecified opinion survey according to which 90 percent of Finnish citizens agree to the harvesting of their organs after death, which should mean that there is a massive consensus on the morality and the necessity of organ donation. (Actually, the opinion poll was the one commissioned by the Liver and Kidney Association,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375413497846">11</xref></sup> which is naturally a private and interested party. Be that as it may, an opinion poll is not a referendum.)</p>
<sec id="section3-0304375413497846">
<title>Death by Law</title>
<p>It goes almost without saying that the law on the medical use of human organs, tissues, and cells is a biopolitical law <italic>par excellence.</italic> The evaluation of the law is a particularly sensible matter that raises a lot of both epidermic and visceral reactions that block the debate, and that is why I want to stress that my aim in this article is not to take a position but only to examine the bio-thanato-political structure of the law.</p>
<p>The law whose aim is to provide new organs to seriously ill persons, whose chances of survival and healthy life are thereby improved, is clearly biopolitical, if biopolitics is, as Foucault’s famous definition goes, politics in which man’s “existence as a living being is in question.” The biopolitical character of the law is enhanced by the fact that it is written in the name of the entire population and not of individuals, insofar as the donations of dead person’s organs are strictly anonymous: they may not be donated to specific persons but only to the medical community taking care of public health. (By way of comparison, the US medical system, which relies on private services, protects donor and recipient anonymity in the same way as the Finnish medical system, which is based on a public health care system: in both systems, the organs are given to the medical community, not to individual patients.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375413497846">12</xref></sup> In the United States, organ transplantation is widely accepted, and the regulations are progressive in the sense that they generally aim at facilitating transplantations.)</p>
<p>The Finnish law is also immediately a thanatopolitical law, because the organs and the tissues come from other persons, who are not stone dead but <italic>declared</italic> by specialists to be dead. The organ donor’s death has lost death’s traditional self-evidence and become a political decision grounded on very complicated medicolegal considerations. Let us consider the following example.</p>
<p>The chapter 7 § 21 of <italic>the Law on the medical use of human organs and tissues</italic> from 2001 (which is the law completed by the Act of 2010) gives a legal definition of death: “A human being is dead when the whole brain function has ceased irremediably.” The classical definition of death is cardiac arrest: it is now called the “clinical death.” A clinically dead person’s organs cannot be transplanted anymore (they are too “dead” to resuscitate, so to speak), and this is why organ transplantation surgery requires another definition of death, called “brain death,” which is the irreversible end of all brain activity. The Finnish surgeon general has defined the criteria of brain death as early as 1971,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375413497846">13</xref></sup> and Finland was indeed the first country in the world to accept brain death as the definition of death, precisely in order to enable organ transplantations. In comparison, among the technologically advanced societies, the Japanese have been particularly reluctant to accept brain death as the definition of death, and the Japanese Organ Transplantation Law was established only in 1997 after heated debates and in a much stricter form than the Finnish one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375413497846">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>What is the difference between brain death and clinical death? For a detailed description one can consult, in addition to Lock’s <italic>Twice Dead</italic>, Lesley A. Sharp’s excellent book <italic>Strange Harvest. Organ Transplants, Denatured Bodies, and the Transformed Self.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375413497846">15</xref></sup> To put it briefly, although the exact clinical definition of brain death is still a matter of controversies, its phenomenal aspect remains constant: the brain-dead person whose organs are about to be cut out is still warm, his or her heart is beating and blood is circulating thanks to the ventilator, and although he or she no longer has any reactions, his or her body can move as a result of residual spinal activity or “spinal dodges.” The University of Helsinki hospital’s neurosurgical databank concludes as follows: “Reflectory motions caused by spinal anoxia can occur after organ removal, and this is why relatives should not be present while removing organs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375413497846">16</xref></sup> It would seem that these “reflexes” that are not “reactions” can give the impression that the dead person, who is supposed to be beyond pain, is nevertheless suffering from the ablation of his organs. The same impression is enhanced by the fact that organ donors, although declared dead, are anesthetized at the onset of surgery. There are different explications for such a strange procedure: while some say that the aim is just to oxygenate the corpse’s tissues, others add that the aim is “to relax the body by dampening residual spinal cord reflexes,” and some add that the objective is to “bolster surgical personnel in case they worry that the person can still experience pain.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375413497846">17</xref></sup> Be that as it may, these appearances of pain cause stress to a part of the medical staff, and would be unbearable to donor kin.</p>
<p>On this limit, the possibility of drawing a line between life and death would seem to depend on the possibility of making the difference between genuine reactions and simple reflexes. We can note in passing that this distinction resembles the differentiation between reactions and responses which has, according to Derrida, provided the criteria for making the difference between animals and human beings in the entire Cartesian tradition until Jacques Lacan. Derrida doubts the evidence and the certainty of such a distinction and proposes to investigate it in order to arrive at another way of thinking about the living being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375413497846">18</xref></sup> In the framework of classical philosophical anthropology, the brain-dead body can therefore be seen as a human being entirely deprived of her “humanity” (consciousness, feelings, responsiveness…) and reduced, not even to her reactive “animality” described by Derrida, but to her reflectory corporeality, which is the most liminal of the guises of Agamben’s “bare life.” Whatever the graduation between responses, reactions and reflexes—and without even posing the question of our capacity of really detecting them in the body and not only fixing them in function of our (legal) categories—this gradual cessation of signs of life does not reduce the brain-dead body into inanimate matter but into something potentially living. This is why, notwithstanding the strict semantico-medical differentiation between deep coma, vegetative state and brain death, the perspective of a patient waking up from deep coma haunts the debates on brain death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375413497846">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To complete these considerations, I would like to stress that in the era of modern techniques of reanimation, these uncertainties are here to stay. Although it is not the case in Finland, in many countries medical authorities facing the increasing demand for organs have accepted organ harvesting not only after brain death, as previously, but also after cardiac death, which means “the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function,” after which it would not be necessary to check whether the patient is brain-dead or not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375413497846">20</xref></sup> In the United States, the time from the asystole (last heartbeat) to the declaration of death is generally five minutes, but can be as short as two minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375413497846">21</xref></sup> As cardiac arrest will happen to many more of us than coma, the debate is interesting. The duration of a cardiac arrest leading to brain death is another matter of political decision rather than evident medical knowledge: in the United States, it is considered that two to five minutes after the last heartbeat one is dead, while in Spain death comes in five minutes, in Switzerland in ten minutes, and in Italy in twenty minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375413497846">22</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0304375413497846">
<title>Technique and Sanctity</title>
<p>The dead body in the process of organ harvesting is a striking case of bare life. During the interlude of organ harvesting, the brain-dead body is no more a person, nor even a “natural” thing: it is a technological construct that cannot exist without a ventilator, and that would not exist if it was not in order to enable organ transplantation. In this process, the body’s personhood is temporarily suspended, and the body is changed into a reserve of commodities that have an important role in health economical circulation. Floating, as it were, between legal death and physical death, the brain-dead person is not there anymore to reclaim his body, which belongs entirely to the political community that can use it to enhance its own living substance. The debates on the exact moment and phenomenal appearance of death show that, as Agamben says, “life and death are not properly scientific concepts but rather political concepts, which as such acquire a political meaning only through a decision.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375413497846">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>These examples should suffice to show why brain death (not to speak of cardiac death) can be existentially disturbing and frightening. Of course, death is troubling for the survivors, too. Independently of any medical considerations, it is generally considered to be a fundamental existential fact that a human body is never a simple (piece of) matter: for most of us, a human body can be lifeless, its lack of life can be obvious, and yet even a stone dead cadaver is never a <italic>simple</italic> thing at hand (what Heidegger calls <italic>zuhanden</italic> or <italic>vorhanden</italic>, not to speak of a standing reserve in a technological situation, <italic>Bestand</italic>), because, as Derrida has shown, it is always fundamentally a human <italic>Dasein</italic> that is just not <italic>here</italic> anymore, so to say a <italic>Nicht-da-sein.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375413497846">24</xref></sup> This is why burial, mourning, and the care of the dead more generally are such fundamental anthropological facts. Transplantation surgery changes this evidence because it presupposes the temporary transformation of a person’s body into a commodity needed in a technological process.</p>
<p>The reason for the vast popular acceptance of brain death as a sufficient definition of death lies in the renewal of the community that the resulting organ transplantation makes possible. One does not need to refer to a complex philosophical anthropology, like the one constructed by Georges Bataille, to trace each human community’s sense of the sacred in its conception of the relation between life and death. In our community, the extreme case of organ donation is a contact between the dead and the living that gathers the community together with a momentum of a powerful, quasi-sacral feeling. The communication between the living and the dead is not only symbolic, like in the Eucharist, but it happens in concrete flesh (pulsating heart, hot liver … )—and thereby human flesh ceases to be intimate and natural and becomes increasingly public and technological. Our society has few common ideas on the sacred, but the popular support of organ donation shows that simple biological human life remains quite unanimously sacred: biological life is so important that even the dead, once revered, must serve it, and the medical institution that makes this possible is actually venerated more spontaneously than any religious institution today. Although the defenders of transplantation sometimes accuse its critics to be backward religious persons, this charge cannot be supported, insofar as practically all major religious communities support transplantation strongly. Although big religious communities are divided on many other biopolitical issues like abortion, euthanasia and stem cell research, most of them agree on organ donation: Lutheran, Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and a number of other religious authorities generally encourage organ donation, and are not worried about desecration. The only notable exception is Japanese Shintoism, which finds injuring a dead body very disturbing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0304375413497846">
<title>Concerned Parties</title>
<p>With the new definitions of death, the process of dying is considerably modified, especially by putting the focus on the medical event before the existential one, and by gathering around the dying person a medical team before the group of mourners. Death, which was traditionally considered the most private existential instant whose affect defined the group of family, kin, and community, is thereby a technical problem defined by experts framed by political institutions.</p>
<p>Let us examine this complex entanglement of relations by examining briefly each party of the community gathered around the brain-dead body. The benefits of the organ transplant would seem the most evident from the point of view of the recipient: in principle, his or her quality of life and life expectancy are thereby improved. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that this is not always the case: as in all complicated surgery, the result can also be a short and painful existence. Transplantations are not done only in order to heal people—“health” being a rather vague concept when applied to life with a transplant, which frequently requires supplementation by such heavy doses of medication that it is often experienced like a chronic illness. Transplantations are also motivated by a desire to reduce the cost of health care, a transplantation being clearly a cheaper solution than continuous treatments. Thus, in the Finnish Law Explanatory Memorandum, economic cost effectiveness, and not the patient’s well-being, is given as the first and the most evident motivation of the amendment of the law.</p>
<p>The donors generally represent the donated organ to themselves as a <italic>gift</italic> to “thy neighbor,” to the community—the greatest gift that one gives “at the price of one’s own life,” the “gift of life,” as the campaigns for the promotion of organ donation put it. Just as the mother risks her life in order to give birth, the organ donor risks his life in order to give life to an unknown person in a last grandiose gesture of love of humanity. Besides, this is a cheap gift for the donor who actually recycles what he or she does not need anymore, and some campaigns actually insinuate that it is a shame to waste what others could use. In his or her generosity, the donor mimes a kind of a consented sacrifice that has the force of regenerating the community. However, under the principle of “presumed consent,” the gift is less and less free, more and more obligatory. Should the donor be opposed to the removal of her organs, her right to control her own body after death is clearly less protected than her right to control her material propriety: the family has the right to her propriety, while the political community has the right to her body.</p>
<p>Ideally, the donor and the receiver of an organ transplant are related in such a way that the donor makes an invaluable gift to the receiver who receives life like an act of grace. One of the Finnish legislator’s intentions is the protection of the purity of this relation by stressing the anonymity and gratuity of organ donations. This is how the legislator wants to fight two psychological and social mechanisms that tend to contaminate the desired purity of the relation between the donor and the recipient. On one hand, a sick person could exert psychological or financial pressure in order to find a donor; everyone knows disgusting stories about the black market in organs. On the other hand, receivers sometimes feel a mix of guilt and gratitude, or just an alienness that they attribute to the donor; Jean-Luc Nancy’s <italic>Intruder</italic> is an impressive description of life with a transplant, which transforms the most intimate heart into a technological and social stranger-in-self).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375413497846">25</xref></sup> The transplant is seldom “pure” in the sense of a neutral piece of matter: it is often perceived as an immunological and a psychological stranger that affects and modifies the sensation of personal integrity.</p>
<p>The Finnish law on medical use of human organs and tissues speaks little of donors and recipients and much more about the two interested parties close to the deceased body: donor kin and the medical staff, and the law is primarily concerned with defining the relations between these parties.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the law and the correlative new definition of death were first needed by the medical staff. From the point of view of the doctors, the principle of brain death is the condition sine qua non of organ transplantation surgery. Before the legal definition of brain death, the doctor operating in a heart transplantation, for example, was legally a murderer killing a weaker individual in order to enhance his patient’s chance of survival. The murder charge is avoided only if it can be said that the organs come from dead persons, and this is possible only if the very definition of death is changed in such a way that the deceased is sufficiently dead while his organs are somehow still a little bit alive. However, although the new legislation protects the <italic>principle</italic> of organ transplantation, it cannot take away the doctor’s burden of making a <italic>decision</italic> on life and death. This decision is based on two types of calculus. On one hand, as we have seen, the exact moment of death is not evident, and it is given to the medical institution alone to count the strange chronometric of death, measuring the span between “dead enough” and “too dead” (because the other concerned party, namely the moribund, is of course incapable of describing the process from his point of view). On the other hand, although the individual doctor’s motivations are undoubtedly the desire to heal patients and eventually to continue his or her research work, health economics do interfere in the health institution's decisions. As the organ is given gratuitously, the law explicitly forbids any seeking of economic gain, for instance the selling of organs—but it also explicitly states that its aim is increasing savings in the public health economy. The law does not comment on the inevitable transformation and ensuing commodification of the organs in the process of transplantation (organs do not transmigrate to new bodies without complex mediations). In comparison, as Leslie Sharp points out, in the United States, transplant medicine is a very lucrative business in which the recipients pay a lot, the medical institution earns a lot, and only the donor and the donor kin get no financial compensation; the imperceptible transformation of gratuitous organs into precious commodities is one of the big taboos of the transplantation medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375413497846">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The last group affected by brain death is the relatives of the dying person. Without exception, the Law Explanatory Memorandum describes them as a troublesome lot: they cannot be found in time, they do not know where the organ donation card is, they are too bewildered to agree to organ harvesting, they do not agree with one another, and this is why, for example, says the Memorandum, fifteen organ donations were denied in 2008 because of parent refusals, which the legislator takes to be far too much in a country of almost six million inhabitants. The aim of the new law is to minimize the relatives’ influence, and this is why, according to the new law, if the medical staff cannot contact them in time (which can be very short), organ harvesting can be proceeded with. Nevertheless, according to paragraph 9a, relatives should be informed about this afterward.</p>
<p>How does this affect the process of mourning? We have come from a society in which, at the instant of death, the dying person was ideally surrounded by his relatives who accompanied him to the Last Frontier, to a society in which, at the instant of death, the most gloriously dying person is surrounded by medical staff. Some suggest that this does not alter the process of mourning, insofar as mourning concerns the <italic>community of survivors</italic> <italic>around the deceased</italic>: after all, he or she is not really there anymore, most people die alone anyway, relatives gather around them only afterward, once the cadaver is patched, cleaned, dressed, made up, made beautiful in death in every way. In this way, the last sight of the deceased is not the penultimate sight of agony but the last sight of beauty. In this case, the process of mourning is not altered by the brief interlude of organ harvesting, which is assimilated to the preparation of the body. Others argue that, on the contrary, mourning needs a <italic>community with the dying person</italic> (and not only <italic>around</italic> him). In this case, the doctor who takes the body away for organ harvesting does not cut only flesh and bone but also the relation of love, the possibility of dying in the arms of the beloved. At such a moment, some say that the doctor is the mediator who changes the love of a singular person into a love of humanity and thereby helps the grieving person to accomplish his mourning. But others counter that allowing the use of the beloved as raw material and spare parts for unknown people is just a way of admitting that this love was feeble to start with. Could a third party ever have the right to decide that some of these feelings are unjustified? The new Finnish law goes in the direction of establishing, instead of a <italic>chance</italic> of receiving an organ transplant, a <italic>right</italic> to obtain one, a right so strong that the donor (kin) might finally have no right to contest it. This is how the “free gift” of life is gradually changed into an obligatory one.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Biopolitical processes are most striking when a political community legislates on the limits of death and the conditions of survival. What are the conceptions of “the sacred” relations between the living and the dead established by the new Finnish law, which is indeed only an example of many similar legislative measures throughout the world?</p>
<p>We can see that the brain-dead body may yield to both “pessimistic” and “optimistic” interpretations, depending on one’s perspective. The body can be examined as a striking case of “bare life,” but in this case we see clearly that “bare” life is far from being a natural being, because it can only exist under specific technological and political conditions that have only become possible in recent history. The brain-dead body appears both as subjected to invasive biopower that imposes a certain type of death and expropriates a body and as a means of emancipatory biopolitical productivity for the beneficiaries of the transplantation. In all cases, the organ becomes a mediator of complex exchanges that mix bodies and persons in much more intimate a manner than was ever possible before, and these interminglings produce new kinds of communities around the transplants: Donna Haraway’s term “cyborg” is quite fitting in this context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375413497846">27</xref></sup> Contrary to classical forms of state sovereignty, the sovereignty expressed in this law does not lay hold on a citizen’s death in order to manifest state power, but in order to enhance another citizen’s life. Of course, the law cannot establish a positive right to get a transplant whenever needed, but it would go in this direction if it was possible, because it is animated by a hope to overcome the shortage of organs. Such is the contemporary liberal democratic sovereignty that a living citizen can almost claim his or her sovereign right to another citizen’s dead body, which is thereby momentarily de-individualized and commodified. When the right to individual survival justifies the loss of a thoroughly individual death, we have a striking image of the contemporary society as an individualism of minds that relies on the possibility of putting organic life in common.</p>

<p>The durations were quoted in the article by Denise Battaglia, “Wann ist man tot genug für die Organentnahme?” <italic>Basellandschaftliche Zeitung</italic> no. 211 (August 5, 2011). According to the website <italic>Therapia fennica</italic>, it is possible to reanimate a person even after a cardiac arrest of ten minutes, but the prognosis is very bad. This is why the person suffering from such a long cardiac arrest ends up by being considered “as good as dead.” Although at the moment even in the United States “donation after an unexpected fatal cardiac arrest is rare” (Steinbrock, 210), if one imagined the technical possibility that the doctor only had these ten minutes to find out what the organ donation will of the patient is, it would be evident that finding out the person’s will concerning organ donation “as far as it is possible” does not go very far.</p>
