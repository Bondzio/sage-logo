<p>In <italic>Tax Evasion and the Shadow Economy</italic>, the editors address a topic that is not only interesting but is also a viable research area to academics and professionals alike. With respect to tax evasion, this book adds to the extant literature by evaluating strategies employed in the discovery and prevention of tax evasion and by examining motivations of individuals who commit such crimes. In addition, this article focuses attention on the impact of the shadow economy on the formal economy with particular emphasis on its European impact. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides a short overview, Part 2 defines and evaluates tax evasion, and Part 3 rounds out the story by exploring the shadow economy.</p>
<p>In order to provide the reader with an overview of this topic, in Part 1, the Pickhardt and Prinz give a type of survey about the nature of tax evasion and the shadow economy. Part 2 of <italic>Tax Evasion and the Shadow Economy</italic> consists of three papers specifically written about the subject of tax evasion. This section begins with a contribution by James Alm in which he designs alternative strategies to reduce tax evasion. Alm is a leading scholar in this field and provides a comprehensive survey of the most recent results of theoretical, empirical, experimental, and agent-based research on tax evasion and tax compliance. In the next chapter, M. Rosaria Marino and Roberta Zizza analyze the issues of personal income tax evasion in Italy and, among other things; they find that on average over 13.5% of net income is anticipated. In the last chapter of Part 2, Gloria Alarcón Garcia, Arielle Beyaert, and Laura de Pablos undertake an analysis of female versus male attitudes toward tax evasion in Spain. The authors make an empirical study and analyze the impact of gender, culture, and knowledge of the tax code on tax evasion.</p>
<p>In Part 3, dealing with the shadow economy, Philippe Adair writes a contribution about the extent of the shadow economy in various European countries with particular concentration on 15 European Union countries. Adair presents a comprehensive overview and classification of the diverse forms of shadow economy activities and he introduces and discusses the different direct and indirect methods, to measure the size and scope of a shadow economy. In Chapter 6, Bogdan Mróz analyzes shadow economy activities in Poland. He presents an empirical analysis that is based on survey data and offers some unique insights with respect to the scope of the shadow economy in Poland. He comes to the “usual” result that the bulk of shadow economy employment takes place in three branches: repair, gardening, and neighborhood services; together 63%. In Chapter 7, Karaboytcheva and Andrada analyze whether the size of a country’s shadow economy and influence the country’s risk indices depend on each other. The authors use the Standard &amp; Poor’s risk index and they empirically investigate 28 transition and developing countries and they come to the result that there is a relation between the size of the shadow economy and the country risk index; for example, the size of the shadow economy in developing countries increases together with the risk of a country. In the final Chapter 8, Backhaus investigates the Madoff fraud, which is the only contribution dealing with the organized crime and tax fraud. Backhaus resolves that the Madoff case seems to be the biggest organized financial fraud in recorded history to date and goes further with a rather surprising result by stating that the internal revenue service is the biggest winner of this fraud.</p>
<p>In general, this is a highly stimulating book in the area of tax evasion and the shadow economy. It nicely links the two areas, provides new insights and shows that these two research areas are very lively, and brings out very challenging and new results. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know something about tax evasion and the shadow economy.</p>
