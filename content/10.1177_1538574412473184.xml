<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is widely treated by surgical elimination of the false lumen and subsequent dissection using traditional aortic arc replcament.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412473184">1</xref>
</sup> After aortic replacement alone, however, the potentially dangerous false lumen often remains in distal portions of the aortic arch. Numerous studies have indicated that expansion or sudden rupture of the remaining false lumen during the postsurgical period is a critical prognostic indicator of poor patient outcomes and increased mortality rates. Patients with evident tears in the aortic arch or proximal descending aorta are at a much higher risk of these complications. Thus, for patients whose condition indicates an initial elevated risk of expansion or rupture of residual dissection after replacement of the ascending aorta, overall treatment outcomes can be dramatically improved through the application of extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta.</p>
<p>A variety of stent grafts have been applied for aortic arch replacement in clinical settings, with the most notable being the stented elephant trunk technique. Kato et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412473184">2</xref>
</sup> first reported the stented elephant trunk procedure for treatment of aortic dissection. Subsequently, Mizuno and colleagues successfully employed the stented elephant trunk procedure for surgical treatment of acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412473184">3</xref>
</sup> Despite its initial success, the relative complexity of the 4-branched artificial blood vessel replacement combined with stented elephant trunk has limited its implementation in practical clinical settings. Very slight surgical errors can result in profuse bleeding and complications with high mortality rates, making many clinicians hesitant to employ the procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412473184">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412473184">5</xref>
</sup> Thus, only rare specialized heart centers routinely employ this technique. Simplification and standardization of such techniques for the extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta have the capacity to dramatically improve the clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The primary challenge, however, is the development of a sufficiently effective and relatively easy-to-implement alternative surgical procedures. The application of an open triple-branched aortic arch stent graft combined with ascending aorta replacement offers a viable alternative to traditional surgery, though it cannot entirely replace the classic surgery. The current study explores application of this relatively simple method in a number of cases treated with ascending aorta surgery combined with implantation of a triple-branched aortic arch stent graft without complicating factors. The present retrospective study summarizes the observations made in these cases in order to clearly document information on the optimal candidates, effectiveness, and risk factors involved in this treatment technique.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>The current study was approved by the institutional review board and the ethics review committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or trustee following a detailed description of the purpose and potential benefits of the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574412473184">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>A total of 34 cases involving patients presenting with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection were included in the present study, including 26 (76%) male and 8 (24%) female patients. The age of patients ranged from 20 to 70 years with a mean age of 49 years. Medical history or current observation of conditions including coronary heart disease (4 patients), hypertension (26 patients), transient brain ischemia (2 patients), and diabetes (3 patients) were observed. Patients were initially excluded if complicating factors presented, including unidentifiable tears or abnormalities of the aortic arch or its branches, the presence of pathological complications not listed above, and obscurity of aortic arch branch orifices.</p>
<p>Stanford type A aortic dissection was diagnosed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta and subsequently confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography, providing additional information pertaining to the character and degree of each case of aortic valve disease, intimal tear position, dissection invasion range, and pericardial tamponade presence. The ascending aorta was the primary site of dissection tearing in all included patients. In 6 cases, tearing was also observed in the distal descending aorta. In all patients, all 3 main branches of aortic arch were each involved in the dissection.</p>
<p>Complications included in the study, as demonstrated by ultrasonic examination, included moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (17 patients), bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (3 patients), and hemopericardium (6 patients). Cases underwent either immediate surgical operation within 12 hours (15 patients) or semi-immediate surgical operation within 24 hours (18 patients), with the exception of a single patient who underwent surgery on the third day. In additional cases where the aortic arch did not exactly match the triple-branched stent (16 patients), traditional full aortic arch prosthetic vessel replacement was conducted. These cases were used as the control group (n = 16). The major clinical features (age, sex, preoperative time, extent of dissection, and location of the tears) between the 2 groups were not significantly different (<italic>P </italic>&gt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574412473184">
<title>Stent Grafts</title>
<p>Appropriately sized self-expandable triple-branched aortic arch stent grafts (Aortec Medical Technology Co Ltd, Beijing, China) were used in the current study in order to support vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412473184">Figure 1</xref>). Stent lengths ranged from 130 to 190 mm with a proximal diameter and distal diameter ranging from 26 to 32 mm and 22 to 28 mm, respectively. Triple-branched stent lengths ranged from 23 to 26 mm with diameters ranging from 10 to 16 mm. A stent-free sewing Dacron tube 10 mm in length was applied at the proximal stent.</p>

<sec id="section5-1538574412473184">
<title>Anesthesia and Surgical Methods</title>
<p>Anesthesia was administered in conjunction with the cardiopulmonary bypass method. Combined intravenous-inhalation anesthesia and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was administered at a nasopharyngeal temperature of 18°C to 20°C, and a femoral arteriovenous shunt was applied in combination with circulatory arrest and low-flow selective cerebral perfusion. Upper body perfusion was completed through axillary artery cannulation during surgery in order to protect the cerebrum and spinal cord.</p>
<p>Ascending aorta artificial blood vessel replacement was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass first, and open placement of a triple-branched stent graft was undertaken. Either ascending aorta replacement or stent implantation (11 patients); Bentall procedure involving a composite graft replacement of the aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aorta followed by stent implantation (11 patients); Wheat operation involving replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta followed by stent implantation (9 patients); and aortic valvuloplasty and ascending aorta replacement followed by stent implantation (3 patients) were performed.</p>
<p>Median sternotomy and blood heparinization were performed after careful monitoring of the invasive blood pressure in the upper and lower limbs. Subsequently, superior vena cava cannulation and femoral arteriovenous conduits were combined to establish the cardiopulmonary bypass. The axillary artery was then dissociated and implanted into the bypass tube. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow was maintained between 2.4 and 2.6 L min<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>. Myocardial protection was achieved by multiple administrations of cold blood cardioplegia (4°C).</p>
<p>The innominate and left common carotid arteries were dissociated and exposed as long as possible. At a nasopharyngeal temperature of 32°C, the proximal aortic arch was clamped. Artificial blood vessels were used in proximal manipulations, including replacement of the ascending aorta or Bentall procedure. At a further reduced nasopharyngeal temperature of 18°C to 20°C, circulation was arrested and the aortic occlusion clamp was removed. The root of the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery were blocked, and low-flow cerebral perfusion (8-12 mg/kg) was performed through the right axillary artery. Subsequently, perfusion to the lower body was discontinued.</p>
<p>After clamping the innominate artery and left common carotid artery 5 cm above the arch, the ascending aorta was transected directly adjacent to the innominate artery. The stent graft was implanted into the true lumen of the aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta through the transverse incision made in the ascending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412473184">Figure 2</xref>). Each branch of the stent was then inserted into the corresponding true lumen of the blood vessels. Following the final proper positioning of stent grafts, clamps in the main stent, branched stents in the left subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, and innominate artery were released in turn, thus initiating expansion of self-expanding stent grafts into the vascular lumen.</p>

</sup> The transected distal stump of the ascending aorta was reconstructed by continuous end-to-end anastomosis between the artificial blood vessel located in the ascending aorta, the stent-free sewing Dacron tube, and the patient’s proximal aortic arch. Finally, air was carefully flushed from the triple-branched stent graft, brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid artery clamps were released, the patient was allowed to gradually warm to normal body temperature. Cardiopulmonary bypass was the removed, signifying completion of the operation.</p>

<sec id="section6-1538574412473184">
<title>Postoperative Follow-Up</title>
<p>Follow-up was conducted through both outpatient re-examination and telephone inquiry. Initial postoperative return visits were completed 2 to 4 weeks post discharge. Subsequent return visits were scheduled at 3 months post operation. At the 3 months follow-up, examination by chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiography, and CTA were used to inspect the aorta. Long-term follow-up ranging from 2 to 24 months was conducted for all the 32 cases. The mean follow-up period was 9.6 ± 4.8 months.</p>

<sec id="section7-1538574412473184">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Diameters of the dissected aorta and false lumen were collected for statistical analysis before the operation, before hospital discharge, and 3 months after the operation. Statistical differences were compared using 2 degrees of freedom test. All data were analyzed with SPSS V13.0 (IBM SSPS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and differences were considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic> value was less than .05 (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05).</p>

<title>Intimal Tear Characteristics</title>
<p>Intraoperative exploration confirmed that the primary intimal tear was located in the ascending aorta in all cases. Of the 34 cases, intimal tears were observed adjacent to the aortic arch only in 2 cases. No intimal tears, however, were observed on the aortic arch or the proximal descending aorta.</p>

Complications occurred in 6 cases (17.6%), including postoperative transient consciousness disturbance with a recovery period of 2 days (1 patient); upper extremity movement disorder with full recovery at 1 week (1 patient) and partial recovery at 2 months (1 patient); acute renal failure exhibiting recovery after 3 weeks of dialysis treatment (1 patient); gastrointestinal tract bleeding (1 patient); and chylothorax exhibiting recovery after treatment (1 patient).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1538574412473184">
<title>Surgical Outcomes</title>
<p>Follow-up over the course of 2 to 24 months after the surgical procedure indicated no further deaths or complications, with the exception of a single patient exhibiting a disorder of the right upper extremity necessitating rehabilitation therapy before attaining full muscle strength recovery. All other cases returned to normal activities of daily living within 2 to 24 months with virtually no indications of surgery-related disorders, indicating improvement in long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>Postoperative CTA imaging scans indicated fluent blood flow and good expansion of stent grafts with no evident vascular stent displacement, distortion, or stenosis. The false lumen of the descending aorta distal to the stent graft was closed at the diaphragmatic level by the 3 months postoperative follow-up in 18 patients. Of the 6 patients with intimal tears present in the distal abdominal aorta, 2 patients exhibited full closure of the false lumen in the abdominal aorta. The diameter of the dissected aorta at the diaphragmatic level was 30.4 ± 3.4 mm prior to the operation, 28.6 ± 3.6 mm before to discharge, and 27.8 ±3.3 mm at the 3 months postoperative follow-up. No statistically significant differences were observed between diameters prior to hospital discharge and at the 3 months postoperative follow-up (<italic>P </italic>= .318); however, each diameter was significantly reduced compared to its preoperative value (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05).</p>
<p>Similar measurements and comparisons were conducted at the superior mesenteric artery level, indicating that the diameter of the dissected aorta at this level showed no statistical differences preoperatively (26.7 ± 2.4 mm), before discharge (26.5 ± 2.2 mm), or at the 3 months postoperative (26.4 ± 2.3 mm) follow-up (<italic>P </italic>= .631). In addition, the diameter of the false lumen was measured at the superior mesenteric artery level, resulting in measurements of 16.2 ± 2.2 mm preoperatively, 10.0 ± 2.4 mm before discharge, and 9.3 ± 2.0 mm at the 3 months postoperative follow-up. Compared to the observed preoperative false lumen diameters, diameters before discharge and at the 3 months postoperative follow-up showed a significant reduction in size (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .05); however, no significant variation was observed in postoperative diameters (<italic>P </italic>= .289; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412473184">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Optimal operative modes for treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection can be more effectively determined when the position and characteristics of the dissection tear are clearly identified.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412473184">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412473184">8</xref>
</sup> By applying this novel form of open triple-branched aortic arch stent grafting using the simplified procedure described in the current study, patients with tears located solely on the ascending aorta have been shown to benefit from such modified implementation of triple-branched stent grafting for aortic reconstruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412473184">9</xref>
</sup> Because application of stent grafts requires careful consideration of tear location and size, identification of the aortic arch branch openings by direct visualization at the time of surgery may be difficult and provides suboptimal results.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412473184">3</xref>
</sup> This simplified method of stent grafting may be appropriate for small, regular, isolated tears, producing results superior to traditional treatment that may also be easier and more economical to conduct in most nonspecialized clinical settings. As tears become increasingly large, irregular, or complex, particularly in the case of tears extending to aortic arch branches, the correct placement of stent grafts becomes increasingly uncertain. Because of these additional risk factors, the use of whole or semi-arch replacement may be a more appropriate and safer alternative under some conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412473184">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412473184">10</xref>
</sup> With proper preoperative assessment using CTA and transthoracic echocardiography, the current study demonstrates that optimal results can be achieved using stent grafts for clearly visible and relatively simple tears.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412473184">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Variation in patient anatomy and medical complications may affect tears on the aortic arch, requiring careful selection of stent grafts with branches that fully match patient requirements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412473184">11</xref>
</sup> This observation further highlights the importance of proper preoperative imaging and diagnostic techniques<sub>.</sub> Thus, optimal surgical mode selection must be based on the unique characteristics of individual patients as well as comprehensive evaluation of concurrent diseases or conditions, allowing for the development of treatment strategies that achieve both short- and long-term benefits for the patient.</p>
<p>Intraoperative exploration revealed an innominate artery closed to the left common carotid artery in 2 cases (not included experimental group), resulting in failure of the standard stent graft to adequately match the unique anatomic morphology of the patient. In these cases, the stent graft was abandoned, and the patient was treated with traditional full replacement of the ascending aorta and arch combined with descending aorta stent graft implantation. Notably, if previous diagnostic information exists to suggest that distortion, dilatation, or other morphological abnormalities exist in the aortic arch or its triple branches, simplified stent graft application should not be the primary treatment of choice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412473184">12</xref>
</sup> The key to proper selection of treatment mode, therefore, relies highly on the ability of clinicians to observe the characteristics of the aortic tear prior to surgery.</p>
<p>Traditional aortic arch replacement generally requires a deep surgical field, a difficult operation involving many anastomoses, increased risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and profuse bleeding, disadvantages that result in overall poorer prognosis and increased mortality compared to simplified surgery with stent grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412473184">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412473184">13</xref>
</sup> The application of simplified stent grafts, when appropriate, results in extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta with the added benefits of reduced invasiveness, surgical complexity, and risks. If applied properly, widespread application of this technique in eligible patients could reduce surgical times, simplify surgical procedures, and reduce both postoperative complications and mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412473184">6</xref>
</sup> The current study demonstrates that implantation of the whole stent graft requires only 5 to 10 minutes. Not only is the surgery notably shorter, but it is also more easily performed than classic treatments. The bypass time and circulatory arrest time were reduced compared to the experimental control participants treated with traditional methods. Although simplified stent grafts may benefit a certain segment of patients, it is not intended to replace traditional extensive primary repair of the thoracic aorta in cases of significant or complex tears on the intimal region of the aortic arch. For complex cases, traditional aortic arch replacement with branched artificial blood vessels is still recommended for the complete elimination of intimal tears.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412473184">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412473184">15</xref>
</sup> Simplified stent grafting does, however, represent a safer and more economical alternative for eligible patients.</p>
<p>When patients are determined eligible for the simplified stent graft, it becomes critical to choose correct stent graft size based on the unique morphology of the aortic arch in order to achieve a lasting curative effect. The characteristics of each of the 3 stent graft segments, including the diameter of the aortic arch, diameter of its branches, and the distance between neighboring branches must be carefully measured according to sectional CTA images prior to surgery. In addition, allowances for morphological changes in blood vessels must be made using CTA and 3-dimensional imaging. Since stent graft implantation is performed under direct vision during surgery, the true and false lumen of blood vessels should be carefully distinguished during the process of implantation. This ensures correct implantation of branched stent grafts into the true lumen of the aortic arch and corresponding branched blood vessels. Moreover, the procedure of implantation will be the most successful when care is taken to avoid unnecessary injury to the intima. When necessary, a bougie following stent graft implantation can further facilitate full expansion.</p>
<p>Treatment of simplified open triple-branched aortic arch stent graft surgery is attended with good results primarily due to reduced cardiopulmonary bypass times and rigorous patient selection. Notably, the current study does not examine patient outcomes beyond 24 months, at which all therapeutic effects remained satisfactory. Despite these initially positive findings, further studies including longer follow-up periods and larger patient cohorts will be required in order to investigate the long-term rates of obstruction recurrence and treatment efficacy of the simplified graft stent technique before widespread clinical implementation can be recommended.</p>
