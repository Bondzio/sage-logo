<abstract>
<p>We analyze whether humor can release some of the tension in Islam controversies and open up new directions for dialogue. We do so in the context of Dahlgren’s civic cultures framework, asking whether humor can be a civic practice and how it is articulated with value conflicts. We examine the features of the humor performed in two comic vlogs on YouTube and the sentiments these vlogs evoked among their viewers. In one vlog, the comedy calls for interreligious acceptance, while in the other vlog comedy is used to “other” Muslims. The comments on both vlogs, however, comprise negative and positive sentiment in the same patterns, often expressed in an antagonistic style. These findings call for caution when contemplating the potential of humor to alleviate interreligious tensions and the prospect of the Internet to form a space for meaningful democratic deliberation, especially when dealing with topics as controversial as Islam.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Controversies about Islam entail some of the most enraged conflicts and debates in today’s world. The list is long and diverse, including the Muhammad cartoons and <italic>Fitna</italic> video, and the widespread street and diplomatic protests against them; the Swiss and French clashes about Islamic architecture and dress, and the resulting bans on—respectively—building new minarets and wearing face covering veils in public space; the proposal for a “Burn the Quran Day” in the United States or the anger about the plans for a “Ground Zero Mosque” in New York. Evidently, such disputes acquire extra meaning against the backdrop of the attacks by Al Qaida units on New York, Madrid, and London, which enhances the strong emotional investments that Muslims and non-Muslims have in these issues. As a result, public debate about Islam tends to be antagonistic and solemn, also because all sides feel their core religious and cultural values are at stake. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren (2009</xref>, 112) reminds us, such value conflicts need democratic procedures and practices to be regulated and appeased, for “democracy is as much about democratic society—how people live together and treat each other—as it is about a system of institutional frameworks.”</p>
<p>While in some conflicts practices of comic relief have been shown to release tension and open up possibilities for solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412453948">Morreal 2009</xref>), in Islam controversies humorous tones seem hard to find, regardless whether one looks in the news genres of print, broadcast, and Internet media. Right after 9/11, many Americans considered humor indeed offensive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412453948">Kuipers (2005</xref>, 72) observes that “the general sentiment was that humor was inappropriate and laughter was impossible in times of such shock.” She also demonstrates, however, that Internet jokes, especially in the form of visual bricolage, appeared almost immediately, not so much to provide comic relief, but rather to air hostility toward Bin Laden and to criticize the abundance of disaster images and larmoyant comments in the mass media. Evidently, there was humorous response to 9/11, but hidden in the semi-private spaces of the Web.</p>
<p>In this contribution, we engage in an empirically informed discussion of the articulation of conflict, Islam, and humor in order to find out whether humor can release tension in Islam controversies and can function as a civic practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren 2009</xref>). We zoom in on two immensely popular comical video blogs (or “vlogs”) responding to the anti-Islam movie <italic>Fitna.</italic> This film is a sixteen-minute visual rant released in March 2008 and made by Geert Wilders, a Dutch Member of Parliament. It evoked massive street protests, produced intense debates about freedom of speech, and encouraged people from across the globe to create and upload their own visualized opinion on YouTube. Some 1,500 unique videos were uploaded in reaction to <italic>Fitna</italic>, which together drew over 10 million viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412453948">Van Zoonen, Vis, and Mihelj 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The two most popular vlogs, in terms of number of views, were stand-up comedies. One was made by the American Muslim and filmmaker Murad Aldin Amayreh for the New Jersey chapter of the Muslim American Society and features writer Mustafa Gatollari defending himself and Islam. This two-minute stand-up routine was made before <italic>Fitna</italic>’s release, but it was re-uploaded by many people in response to the movie, carrying a tag like “Fitna” or “Wilders.” At the moment of writing, it had drawn over 4.4 million views.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412453948">1</xref></sup> The second stand-up, <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic>, drew over 1.5 million views. Made by the British anti-religious satirist Pat Condell in direct response to <italic>Fitna</italic>, it attacked Islam for its alleged violent nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476412453948">2</xref></sup> Condell introduces himself on his Web site as a maker of “godless comedy”: “Hi, I’m Pat Condell. I don’t respect your beliefs and I don’t care if you are offended. Cheers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476412453948">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We will analyze the nature of the humor in these two vlogs and the sentiments they evoked among their viewers. But first, we will discuss in more detail how humor can be articulated with the civic cultures framework as investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Peter Dahlgren (2009)</xref>, looking specifically at the dimensions of practices, spaces, and values.</p>

<sec id="section2-1527476412453948">
<title>Civic Cultures</title>
<p>“Civic cultures refer to cultural patterns in which identities of citizenship, and the foundations for civic agency, are embedded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren 2009</xref>, 103). In Western Europe, after a long period of relative invisibility, religion once again provides a cultural pattern that feeds into civic agency. The emergence of Islam as a key religion in the region has forced many countries and their citizens to rethink whether and how majority and minority religions and value claims can be reconciled with each other. Theories of interreligious dialogue and democratic deliberation have addressed the issue how to understanding and improving the quality of people’s interactions. Allison Jaggar, a political theorist, asks, for instance, “how cultural heterogeneity may be compatible with social stability and civic solidarity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412453948">Jaggar 2000</xref>, 27) and suggests that three virtues are key: multicultural literacy, that is, a willingness and capacity to recognize the experiences and self-conception of others; moral deference, which entails assuming and weighing the credibility of others, especially if they come from subordinated groups; and emotional reconfiguration in the sense that the pain of others is witnessed, acknowledged, and responded to. From a faith perspective, Miroslav Volf, a theologian, comes to a similar understanding when he identifies a need to embrace “the will to give ourselves to others and ‘welcome’ them, to readjust our identities to make space for them, prior to any judgment about others, except that of identifying them in their identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412453948">Volf 1996</xref>, 29).</p>
<p>The literature in both fields is immense and beyond the scope of this article to discuss. Both, however, suffer from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren (2009</xref>, 98) considers a limited understanding of civic practices, ignoring informal, affective, and—directly relevant to the context of this article—ironic or humorous modes of talk. Humor, together with other “unreasonable” factors like anger, frustration, fear, or joy is usually considered at odds with dialogue and deliberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412453948">Johnson 1998</xref>), although it has been welcomed as a means to improve a productive group atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412453948">Mansbridge et al. 2006</xref>) and it has been claimed that a sense of humor is a quality of intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412453948">Abu-Nimer 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412453948">Miczo and Welter (2006)</xref>, in addition, distinguish between aggressive and affiliative humor and demonstrate that they correlate, respectively, negatively and positively with the appreciation of intercultural communication.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer’s (2000)</xref> analysis of sources and functions of humor provides the most extensive and helpful treatment for our contribution. He discusses three basic humor theories that answer the question as to why something is funny: because it relaxes tensions (relief), because it points to anomalies (incongruence), and because it establishes superiority. Humor based on relief from tensions, Meyer argues, produces identification between maker and audience. Incongruity as a source of humor serves to clarify positions, but may also differentiate audiences. The enforcement of established norm is the last function in Meyer’s taxonomy. He concludes that identification and clarification are functions of humor that are capable of uniting people, whereas differentiation and enforcement tend to have divisive effects. In such an approach, humor is clearly a part of civic culture and can be employed both to support and undermine civic practices, by—respectively—pointing to anomalies or establishing superiority. Political satire, for instance, has been approached as a civic practice with a long tradition and a vital presence in current mediated politics. Using Dahlgren’s framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412453948">Jones (2005)</xref> shows how satirical TV programs in the United States contribute to civic culture by offering ways to talk about the political that connects to everyday experiences of diverse audiences and undermines the “pundit talk” of mainstream media.</p>
<p>Humor as a civic practice is best known and studied in the “civic space” constituted by media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren (2009</xref>, 124) argues that in the current media matrix, interactive media in particular allow for “many innovations where people are ‘making space’ for democracy, thereby extending and transforming public spheres.” The diverse ways in which interactive media enable people to perform their civic identities open up more ways than solely rational ones to engage with the political, according to Dahlgren. The two vlogs we study in this contribution are part of a set of wider YouTube responses to the anti-Islam film <italic>Fitna</italic>, that together substantiate and moderate Dahlgren’s claims. In an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412453948">Van Zoonen et al. 2010</xref>) we identified a variety of short videos through which posters demonstrated their criticism or support of the film and concluded that these provided both a generic and a substantial alternative to mainstream media coverage of the controversy. We also found that commonly posters did not respond to each other’s videos or to the comments on their videos. Commenters neither discussed among each other, leading us to conclude that YouTube constitutes a space for demonstration, but can hardly be considered one of the diverse “public spheres” because of the absence of interaction. Mouffe’s notion of antagonistic pluralism in which people acknowledge other’s right to speak but do not necessarily listen to each other applies better to the civic space constituted by YouTube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412453948">Van Zoonen et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>That conclusion calls for further and more detailed scrutiny, especially with respect to specific civic practices. In this contribution we focus on humor because, as said earlier, two comedy vlogs turned out to be the most popular among the whole body of YouTube responses to the <italic>Fitna</italic> film and because humor has been claimed to have both unifying and divisive potential. Therefore, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer’s (2000)</xref> model of humor functions, we will investigate the humor genres employed in <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic> and <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic>, the two comedy vlogs on YouTube responding to <italic>Fitna</italic>. This enables us to identify the nature of the humor and whether it enables identification and clarification (possibly bringing people together) or differentiation and enforcement (supposedly dividing them). Second, we will ask whether and how the comments evoked by the vlogs were positive (supportive) or negative (critical) qua sentimental tone, form, and substance. One would expect that a positive sentiment is a prerequisite for a civic culture to emerge on YouTube, wherein people would be willing to acknowledge and reflect on views different than their own.</p>

<title>Analysis of the vlogs</title>
<p>The vlogs studied here, <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic> and <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic>, have the form of a “testimonial,” a video genre containing monologues of uploaders who walk around or sit down and appear as “talking heads” on the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412453948">Van Zoonen, Hirzalla, and Müller 2009</xref>). A semiotic and discursive analysis was conducted to explore whether and how the humor in the vlogs invited audiences’ response in the four ways that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer (2000)</xref> identifies: identification, clarification, differentiation, and enforcement. Although humor depends on interpretation and context, Meyer suggests that the humor functions can still be distinguished on a general level and that they can be utilized by the performance of different humor genres. For instance, self-deprecating humor can realize identification and create an equal relation between audience and speaker. Clarification, he continues, can especially be served by plays on words, whereas enforcement often involves laughing at, rather than with someone. Differentiation, finally, involves contrasting oneself with an opponent often in the form of comic ridicule, the “harshest function of humor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer 2000</xref>, 322). Written, verbal, visual, and auditive cues were taken into account as signs that potentially compose the performance of these humor genres. These cues were explored and categorized by carefully and repeatedly viewing the vlogs. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412453948">Halliday’s (1994)</xref> functional grammar, different parts of the vlogs were subsequently submitted to in-depth analyses of their ideational meanings (representing what the world is and who we are), interpersonal meanings (regarding relationships between speaker and listener), and textual meanings (i.e., how text is structured and socially embedded) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412453948">Kress and Van Leeuwen 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527476412453948">
<title>Analysis of the comments</title>
<p>Condell’s video, <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic>, evoked over 31,000 responses by users, while more than half a million comments were posted in response to <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527476412453948">4</xref></sup> These numbers make any kind of overall analysis impossible. We therefore selected the last 1,000 comments to each vlog, thus 2,000 comments in total, as a sample for an in-depth case study. We used the software program LexiURL Searcher to automatically select and download these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412453948">Thelwall 2011</xref>). The comments analysis starts with a general overview of the presence of positive and negative “sentiments.” The term <italic>sentiment</italic> is used here rather than <italic>emotion</italic>, since, in the literature, the former term refers to “affect split into positive, negative and neutral whereas the term emotion refers to more differentiated affect (e.g., happy, sad, frightened),” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412453948">Thelwall et al. (2010</xref>, 2545) note. The overview of sentiments was produced with the software program SentiStrength, which follows an automated, quantitative coding logic aimed at measuring the strength of positive and negative sentiments in written text, including emoticons and nonstandard spellings. Positive and negative sentiments are detected through a large set of algorithms, on the basis of a database with terms associated with positive or negative sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412453948">Thelwall et al. 2010</xref>). Since Sentiment Analysis indicates <italic>whether</italic> sentiments are positive or negative and not <italic>how</italic> these sentiments are specifically constructed or what they refer to, we subsequently investigated the comments by a qualitative, inductive content analysis aimed at exhaustive categorization of the variations in topics addressed by the comments. These variations were coded and analyzed systematically through a constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412453948">Boeije 2002</xref>) in the CAQDAS program MaxQDA. This procedure, focusing again on the construction of ideational, interpersonal, and textual meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412453948">Halliday 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412453948">Kress and Van Leeuwen 1996</xref>), yielded detailed insights into which issues users discussed and how they discussed the various issues.</p>

<title>The Vlogs</title>
<p>This section discusses the differences between the videos <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic> and <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic>. We will illustrate how the former video uses humor based on incongruence to differentiate “us,” Europeans, from Islam, which is “othered” as a violent threat that “wants” to “take over the world.” Differentiation is the main humor function employed here, and the potential of such humor (and the nondistinctly humorous parts of the vlog as well) is to divide people, in this case, along their religious differences. In contrast, <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> employs irony and self-deprecation to reject stereotypes of Muslims and to reconcile Islam with peacefulness and Americanness. This humor genre works with much of the vlog’s narrative overall to foster identification between and unification of Muslims and non-Muslims.</p>
<sec id="section7-1527476412453948">
<title>The Religion of Fear</title>
<p>Pat Condell’s video only displays his head and shoulders against a greyish background. Throughout the vlog, Condell looks from up close straight into a camera, constructing an “in-your-face” experience of his message and violating the intimate space of the audience; in real life, we would not allow strangers to come this close. Condell begins with commenting on the “violent” nature of Islam and the lack of support <italic>Fitna</italic> has received.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What happened to all those people who keep telling us “I don’t agree with what you say, but I’ll defend your right to say it”? … No shortage of politicians, however, lining up to accuse the film of falsely equating Islam with violence, which is a bit like falsely equating Walt Disney with Mickey Mouse.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quote illustrates the kind of humor, created through unexpected and creative incongruence, that is characteristic for Condell’s vlog. Here Condell plays on the relation between Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse. Since Disney is the creator of Mickey Mouse, it is discordant and therefore potentially humorous to “falsely” equate the two. In other parts of the vlog too, Condell uses comedic incongruence to depict Islam as a violent religion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Islam without violence (!) is a like an egg-free omelette. The religion is predicated on violence (!) and the threat of violence (!). It’s a religion of peace in the same way North Korea is a people’s democratic republic. But we’re not allowed to say that, because when we do, we’ll be threatened with violence (!).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Condell mentions the term <italic>violence</italic>, he stresses its first syllable and pauses a fraction of a second before pronouncing it. By applying this technique repeatedly within a short text, as is the case in the previous quote (see exclamation marks), Condell achieves focalization of the term <italic>violence</italic> and advances its association with Islam. This storyline and the remainder of the vlog as well rely on a dichotomous opposition between a monolithic “us” (or “we”) and “them” (or “they”).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was the threat of Muslim violence that caused the Dutch government to grovel in such abject dimmitude and to run around apologizing like headless chickens. A spectacle which I’m sure many Muslims enjoyed, and why shouldn’t <italic>they</italic> enjoy it? After all, it sends out the clear message to the entire Muslim world that, in Europe, <italic>we</italic> won’t stand up for what <italic>we</italic> believe in. [italics added]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The remainder of the vlog is sometimes humorous by verbal incongruity, and throughout performed visually in-your-face, through a narration style that is sneering and antagonistic. Condell claims persistently that “we” have responded too softly to Islam and condemns Islam for suffering from a large set of “phobias,” such as “fear of women.” At the end, Condell concludes that Islam is “a violent, seventh century dessert dogma that wants to take over the world, remove our freedom, subjugate women, brainwash children, persecute Jews and homosexuals [and] all we can do is make excuses for it for fear of causing offence.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1527476412453948">
<title>I Am a Muslim</title>
<p>The video <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> begins with a young man walking up a sober stage. Only in the last sentence of the testimonial does the man reveal his identity: “My name is Muhammad, and I am a Muslim!,” he then says with a raised voice. Yet the title of the vlog hints from the start that the man’s identity is Islamic, thus imposing a reading of the text in which “a Muslim” is performing.</p>
<p>Muhammad begins with mentioning several things he, as a religious individual (“I”), “is not” (e.g., “terrorist”) or “does not” (e.g., “living in a tent”). The rejection of these things constitutes self-deprecation, but in an ironic way. The irony is achieved when viewers recognize the stereotypes and join Muhammad in his derision of such prejudice. When denounced by self-declared Muslims, like Muhammad, these stereotypes are rhetorically rendered “un-Islamic.” Accomplishing this through ironic self-deprecation seems to be the objective of the first part of Muhammad’s vlog.</p>
<p>Throughout the vlog, Muhammad’s performance is characterized by verbal intonations, gesticulations, and changing speaking positions. Further, some of Muhammad’s arguments are visually signified by cartoonish images, often playfully enacted in relation to Muhammad. For instance, when he mentions that he is not a “terrorist,” an image of a bomb is displayed above his hand. Such cartoonish elements as well as the relaxed style of narration add to the vlog’s comedic flavor. Halfway the vlog, however, a happy, classic melody marks a change of tone, abandoning the irony and moving toward verbal and visually supported appraisal of a peaceful Islam that can be reconciled with Americanness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think you’re an infidel. I believe in peace. I believe in people of all different religions and believes living together in harmony, like the early Islamic Arab, Ottoman and Spanish empires… . Trust me, I would go back to my own country, but I’m already in it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Coming from “a Muslim,” peacefulness (toward non-Muslims) and Americanness are rendered “Islamic” here. Also note that Muhammad speaks in terms of “I” and “you,” as opposed to the “us” and “them” in the Condell video.</p>
<p>Muhammad closes his testimonial with less personal remarks about the scientific achievements and courage of Muslims (e.g., “we invented algebra”) and the Quran’s “greatness.” These comments evidently are neither ironic nor self-deprecating. However, both in the ironic and in the serious part, Muhammad builds a case in which the prevalent message seems to be: “I, Muslim, am like you.” The group—“you,” his target group—to whom Muhammad belongs in his narrative includes non-Muslims, whom he embraces as “not infidels” and aims to convince of the idea that they share important norms and values with himself and other Muslims.</p>

<p>These results mean, in short, that negative and positive sentiments were about equally distributed among the sampled comments, although negative sentiments were overrepresented. A second conclusion is that <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> evoked comments that overall, contained content with slightly less positive and negative sentiment than <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic>. Both conclusions are most directly indicated by the average scores, with the negative average scores for both vlogs being higher than their positive average scores, and both average scores for <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> being lower than those for <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic>.</p>
<p>Yet, the nature of the dominant sentiment in the comments on both videos (negative) does not say much yet about the ways in which these sentiments were expressed. We will investigate these ways in more detail on the basis of our qualitative analysis. While the contents and styles of the comments were richly varied, it is clear that many people used the videos to make a comment about the nature of Islam or Muslims (“Muslim world”; “Islamic world”) or about “the West” and Christianity, without engaging specifically with the vlogs themselves. Fewer comments referred explicitly to the vlogs themselves.</p>
<sec id="section10-1527476412453948">
<title>Islam and Muslims</title>
<p>Comments about Islam and Muslims were often fervidly critical or supportive. One way in which support and critique were constructed was through depictions or quotes of (real or fictitious) Islamic religious sources, which were in some instances used to characterize the good or evil nature of Islam or Muslims. Posting 1, for instance, suggests that “most Muslims” follow verses that command freedom of religion and peacefulness and therefore are “exceptionally gracious and peace-loving.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 1@I am a Muslim</italic></p>
<p>Most Muslims are exceptionally gracious and peace-loving people. And Islam has elements of peacefulness in it. For example, Muslims point to Sura 2:256 which claims there is no compulsion in religion (compulsion), or to Sura 29:46 which says not to dispute with People of the Book (Jews and Christians) unless they do wrong. Also, Sura 41:34 which instructs that one should respond to evil with doing good deeds to the evil doer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527476412453948">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some postings were about the very authenticity of Islam and its prophet Muhammed, arguing whether or not they are “real.” The prophet Muhammed also served as a means to characterize Islam and its adherents. He was mentioned as mankind’s friend (e.g., “the best”) in pro-Islam comments, or foe (e.g., “paedophile”) in anti-Islam comments. By suggesting or implying that Muslims strictly follow the prophet’s example, some comments portrayed Muslims as good or bad people. Posting 2, for instance, depicts the prophet Muhammad and therefore his followers as thieves.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 2@The religion of fear</italic></p>
<p>At the very heart of the foundation of Islam lies not violence but looting. This is because Muhammad and his gang, coming from the desert had to steal to obtain any possessions. Muhammad was clever enough to create Islamic bling heaven in order to con his followers into dying for him. It is exactly the same today: looting museums and even hospitals is the first thing on the Arab mind.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contesting rejected and constructing valued images of Muslims’ mindset or their present-day practices was what many of the sampled comments aimed to do, with but also without explicit reference to what were described as Islamic religious sources. Disputes arose about the global expansion and historical successes of the Ummah and its compatibility with democracy, success in sports, peacefulness, intellectualism, modernity, and hygiene. Other content concerned a variety of more specific violent or repressive practices in Islamic or Western societies, such as mass killings, slavery, anti-Semitism, prosecution of ex- or non-Muslims, forcing people to convert to Islam, and subjugation of women. Critics depicted the latter as helpless victims of salacious Islamic men, as illustrated by the next comment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 3@I am a Muslim</italic></p>
<p>[Islamic] women are for mans desire and lust. Divorce is easy, but a man can have 4 wives and as many tempory wives as they like. Age is no limit, sexual acts no problem, any time day or night. What rights have the women? None. They sold there sex to their husband, grit you teeth and think of home, is the call. These guys do not even know their women, just they look good, like a cattle market.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1527476412453948">
<title>The West and Christianity</title>
<p>Comments about “the West” were about the nature of Western society, or about policies of “the West” vis-à-vis Muslims or the Middle East. Some self-critical comments, as illustrated by the next example, resembled one part of Condell’s vlog about the “weak response” of “the West” to alleged threats from Muslims.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 4@The religion of fear</italic></p>
<p>Do you realize that the West must be the laughing stock of the entire world? How did this happen? Was it just our gutless politicians? No. We are just as much to blame. We showed the enemy acceptance &amp; tolerance, and they kicked us in the teeth for it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most critical comments, however, were not self-reflective (about what “we” do), but accusatory or condemnatory (about what “they” or “you” do). Eating pork, prejudiced media, xenophobia, and various sexuality-related phenomena (e.g., lap dancing women, adultery, STDs, sex change operations, and homosexuality) were mentioned as some of the downsides of Western society or Christianity. Other content concerned violence or repression committed to or by “the West” or Christianity. Some posited that it is not Quranic but Biblical scripture that promotes violence, or justified violence committed by Muslims by pointing to violence committed by the United States or Israel. For example, after one commenter mentioned a “suicide bombing that killed 35 people” committed by “Islamist separatists from Chechnya,” a second commenter challenged him to unfold his views on Israeli and American policies in Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The second commenter seems to consider these policies as the cause of suicide bombings by Muslims.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 5@The religion of fear</italic></p>
<p>What do you think of israeli crimes in palestine for more than 60 years; and U.S. crimes in afganistan for more than 12 years; and U.S. crimes in iraq 8 years? Islam is innocent of these acts… . Suicide of Muslims comes from the opporssion and depression and injustice done to the person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The aforementioned example illustrates the kind of “serious” comments (without ridicule or insult and focused on content) and “serious” interactions (acknowledging or responding directly to other people’s remarks) that were present in our sample. Overall, however, there were many more comments that changed the subject, debouched into name-calling (imputations involving homosexuality, genitals, and stupidity were particularly popular), or instructed others to get their facts straight. There were relatively few commenters who expressed discomfort with the mudslinging back and forth. “Wonderful posts on this page,” one commenter lamented sarcastically, “congrats to all.” And every now and then, there were commenters who challenged others to respond seriously to their questions. These comments, however, generally stood alone amid rather unreceptive chatter, and in no perceptible way did they change the course of the discussion threads.</p>
<p>Christianity or its authenticity were by some commenters described, promoted, or attacked by referring to or challenging the truthfulness of particular Biblical narratives. Christianity was also diametrically opposed to Islam as a better or worse alternative. In these cases, the Bible was compared to the Quran, Jesus with Muhammad, churches with mosques, and/or Christians with Muslims, mostly in terms of which or who is more peaceful or civilized. In the next posting, for instance, the commenter expects that following the “teachings of Jesus” fosters peace worldwide, as opposed to the global “bloodbath” that the commenter foresees if “everyone practices the religion of Muhammad.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 6@I am a Muslim</italic></p>
<p>If the whole world practices the teaching of Jesus the world would be peaceful place. A true religion of peace. But if everyone practices the religion of Muhammad, the whole world would be a bloodbath.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-1527476412453948">
<title>The Vlogs</title>
<p>Some comments that did not explicitly reply to other postings (for instance, by using the @-sign as a prefix to another commenter’s user name, a common practice among YouTube users to address each other) may have been responding to one of the vlogs. These comments criticized religiosity in general, for example, called for a war on all violent people irrespective of their religious or atheist background, or urged people from all backgrounds to unite and accept each other. It was not always clear whether such general statements were made in response to the vlogs or in response to the discussions.</p>
<p>Few comments referred <italic>explicitly</italic> to the vlogs themselves. As is the case for the issue-focused comments discussed previously, these comments can be generally subdivided into supportive and critical comments. Supportive comments commended or elaborated on the contents of either one of the vlogs and/or included words of gratitude to the vlogs’ authors, Condell, or Muhammad. Posting 7, for instance, thanks Pat Condell for being “so right” and continues with building an anti-Muslim argument that revolves around “control” and “ego.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 7@The religion of fear</italic></p>
<p>Thank you Pat Condell, you are so right … ! Muslims are control freaks. No wonder they have started so many wars and have kill the most amount of people today. The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, or how they look at the Bible, or Quran.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There were also comments that supported the vlogs, without motivating why (e.g., “Awesome video! I’ve enjoyed watching it!”). Critical comments were in some instances <italic>ad hominem</italic> by nature, threatening or assaulting the character, appearance, or ethnic or religious background of Muhammad or Condell. For instance, one commenter, signifying his Islamic background by using an Islamic expression (“wallah,” Arabic for “I swear to Allah”), responded in the following way to Muhammed’s refusal (in his vlog) to consider non-Islamic Americans as “infidels”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 8@I am a Muslim</italic></p>
<p>I’d break your face wallah if i saw you &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;’’i dont think you’re an infidel’’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if you don’t believe a non muslim is a non muslim, then you’re going to hell and by the way, your prophet thinks you look like a woman for not having a beard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;fucking bitch</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only a couple of comments were critical, but ambiguously so and with caution. One commenter, for instance, starts his posting with expressing reservations about <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> (“I have my doubts”; “I’m 50/50 on this video”). Aside from these doubts, the commenter suggests that the vlog unrightfully ignores “atrocities” of which he “knows” the “Muslim world have committed” [<italic>sic</italic>], despite of what is wrong “morally” and “in Islam as well.” Islam as such, apparently taken as a source of commandments, is thus not constructed as an evil here that causes the “atrocities”; the guilt rather lies with the “Muslim world” that disobeys Islam.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Posting 9@I am a Muslim</italic></p>
<p>Trust me, I have my doubts. I’m 50/50 on this video. And I know of the stoning, beheading, &amp; other atrocities that Muslim world have committed. They are real and they are wrong not just morally but in ISLAM as well.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated how the narratives in the videos <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic> and <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> differ, particularly in regard to the humor functions they employ. Humor in the former video is used to differentiate between Islam or Muslims, and “us” or non-Muslims, while humor in the latter vlog works to produce identification between those groups on shared norms and values. <italic>The Religion of Fear</italic>, in itself, may therefore not qualify as a display of civic culture because of its strong and antagonistic construction of “us” and “them,” while <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic> could be typified as more inclusive through its personal address to a respected other. We can conclude, partly, therefore, that humor can function both as a civic and as an “uncivic” practice, which underlines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer’s (2000)</xref> taxonomy of humor functions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our analysis of the comments make clear that Islam controversies have such a strong presence in people’s everyday lives and opinions, that a single video, however popular, does little to open these up. The pattern of negative and positive sentiments expressed in the comments was almost similar, and these sentiments by and large covered the same themes, namely, the vlogs themselves, Islam, the West, or Christianity. Instead, what we see happening is that the videos are mainly used as instruments to once again vent one’s own already strong opinions for or against Islam. In fact, one is tempted to typify this part of YouTube as “uncivic culture” that lacks—to turn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren’s (2009</xref>, 106) understanding around—“a minimal shared commitment to the visions and procedures of democracy” and that misses “a capacity to see beyond the interests of one’s own group.” Commenters denied each other’s right to speak by advising them to first “get their facts straight,” ridiculing them, or calling them names. Both negative and positive comments were excluding others rather than including them by praising one group as being better than another. There were comments that had inclusive features, such as some comments that referred explicitly to and supported the vlog <italic>I Am a Muslim</italic>, but these comments seem to form a small minority in our sample.</p>
<p>While these findings are by no means representative for the vlogosphere, our case study does produce insight into humor as a civic practice and YouTube as a civic space. YouTube has been acknowledged as one of the most potent places where people can perform and contest identity, and rightfully so. However, performances and contestations of religious and political identity come in different forms, and the forms of discussion identified in the comments on the vlogs investigated here generally seem hard to qualify as contributions to “civic culture,” the kind of breeding ground that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412453948">Dahlgren (2009</xref>, 104-05), lays the foundation for civic agency, “those features of the socio-cultural world that serve as preconditions for people’s actual participation in the public sphere and political society.” As said, the comedic nature of the vlogs does not seem to have an immediate impact on commenters’ discursive attitudes and practices, as one might expect from humor theory (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412453948">Meyer 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412453948">Miczo and Welter 2006</xref>). With a controversial issue and experience like Islam, it is perhaps too much to ask that humor can function as a civic practice. When specifically Islam or related topics are discussed, it seems, civic culture online becomes a “communicative jungle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412453948">Schultz 2000</xref>). Not even comedy changes that, our case study suggests, at least not in a sudden, mechanic way whereby one turns from an exclusive to an inclusive discourse when exposed to uniting funniness online.</p>
