    <p>Writing an affirmative book on Pakistan, while critiquing its past and present, is
      undoubtedly a challenge. It becomes especially so for a scholar living and working on US soil
      at a time when the US Secretary of State is at pains to underscore the existential threat
      posed to the state of Pakistan by Islamist forces it seems unable (or unwilling) to rein in.
      Naveeda Khan, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Johns Hopkins University, attempts to do
      the impossible; she makes a valiant effort to pick out signs of plenitude from the chaos of
      contradictions and controversies and build a case for the future. <italic>Muslim Becoming:
        Aspirations and Skepticism in Pakistan</italic>—as the name suggests—tries to look at both
      sides of the coin. She uses a range of vignettes to bolster her argument: the religious
      conflicts and violence emanating from neighbourhood mosques, the appropriation of Iqbal’s
      poetic legacy for political purposes, the nuances of religious praxis among ordinary
      Pakistanis, the threat of violent disagreement that simmers below the surface of civilised
      discourse on state and society.</p>
    <p>Khan studies mosques as spaces of Muslim aspirations, as sites that allow Muslims to become
      better Muslims, as scenes that witness public piety but also as spaces for conflagrations to
      burst out through killings and bloodshed. Working on the oft-repeated assertion that Pakistan,
      the Land of the Pure, <italic>is</italic> a mosque, she goes on to probe what it means to
        <italic>be</italic> a Muslim in Pakistan today. Spelling out the different ways in which a
      mosque is appropriated (‘<italic>qabza karna’</italic>)—be it illegal occupancy of its land or
      building or hijacking it for sectarian differences among the Deobandis, Barelwis, Ahl-e-Hadis
      et al.—Khan views the proliferations of mosques in post-1947 Pakistan and their functioning
      either through elected mosque committees as in the early days or the more blatant use of
      muscle power in recent times as a form of striving: ‘These expressions of striving not only
      tie religious and moral developments to the development of the nation-state but also to the
      imagination of an earlier era of Islam’. In tracing the increasing politicisation of these
      essentially religious spaces she delineates the ties and tensions, the aspirations and
      scepticism within social groupings. Khan also takes in, among other things, ‘everyday
      expressions of religiosity (that) simultaneously impinge upon the local, the political, and
      the spiritual, in the temporal registers of possible pasts and futures’.</p>
    <p>Khan also revisits the legacy of Muhammad Iqbal, the visionary poet who first propounded the
      idea of a separate Muslim homeland. It was Iqbal who expressed—in hauntingly evocative
      poetry—the disquiet that afflicted the Muslim mind in a manner that no one had ever attempted
      before. This disquiet found expression in different ways: there was the sorrow over the loss
      of freedom or power of any Islamic race, whether in the distant past or the present; concern
      about the future of the Islamic countries subject to European hegemony; and suspicion and
      distrust of western powers that had, in the first place, plotted and brought about the
      downfall of Muslim rule everywhere. In a rejoinder to his own famous <italic>Shikwa</italic>
      (Complaint), <italic>Jawab-e-Shikwa</italic> (Answer to the Complaint, both published in
        <italic>Bang-e-Dara</italic>, ‘The Call of the Road’, 1924), Iqbal had declared: <disp-quote>
        <p>The tumult caused by the Bulgar onslaught and aggression</p>
        <p>Is to rouse you out of complacency and grid your loins for action.</p>
        <p>Presume not that to hurt your feelings, it is a sinister device</p>
        <p>It is a challenge to your self-respect, it is a call to sacrifice</p>
        <p>Why tremble at the snorting of the chargers of your foes?</p>
        <p>The flame of truth is not snuffed out by the breath the enemy blows. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493048">Iqbal, 1981</xref>)</p>
      </disp-quote></p>
    <p>Iqbal is also single-handedly responsible for introducing modern philosophical concepts,
      gleaned from his study in Europe, and vastly broadening the scope of the existing intellectual
      discourses among educated Muslims, keeping it all the while tethered to a quintessentially
      religious mooring. Khan places Iqbal’s political and religious doctrine with other Muslim
      thinkers whose writings continue to influence modern-day Pakistanis—Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and
      Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi of a generation before and contemporaries such as Maulana Abul ala
      Maududi and Muhammad Asad, an Austrian Jew who converted to Islam in 1926. She writes: <disp-quote>
        <p>Comparing the three thinkers, Iqbal, Asad and Maududi, it is clear that each was
          interested in Muslims yet to come. In some ways Asad’s understanding of Muslim aspiration
          was most similar to Iqbal’s. He drew upon similar language of the Muslims to reconstitute
          themselves. He advocated a project of Muslim self-making that aligned itself both to the
          past of Islam and the historical present so that the new Muslim might be the best
          expression of Islamic renewal in the modern world. And he urged that Muslims always keep
          in mind their own finitude in striving towards absolute perfection. (p. 87)</p>
      </disp-quote></p>
    <p>Of course, it is a different matter that the aspirational model held out by early Muslim
      reformers and vision sullied soon after the dream of a separate homeland was achieved. The
        <italic>mard-e-kamil</italic> (‘perfect man’)—an archetype for a Muslim who would strive
      ceaselessly towards self-perfectibility—fell prey to sectarian strife. Khan studies the
      treatment of the Ahmadis, the anti-Ahmadiyya riots of 1953 and the role of the State in
      severing their relations to Islam through the constitutional amendments of 1974 declaring them
      non-Muslims and explores the consequences of this bit of ‘legal history’ in the everyday life
      of Pakistanis. She then goes on to include Urdu writers such as Mumtaz Mufti and the voices of
      dissent that make the literature coming out of Pakistan a valuable site for ‘alternative
      visions and dissent’. She notes that the question ‘Who is a Muslim?’ is asked again and again
      by different writers with varying degrees of despair.</p>
    <p>Regrettably, the affirmative note that Khan sought to strike sounds shaky and frail at best;
      the realities on the ground, attested by recent events, do not bode well for ‘Muslim
      becoming’, a theme that underscores every argument in this book. Surely it is a sad day when a
      scholar, ‘making the argument of a contrarian’, concludes by drawing satisfaction from the
      ‘consistency’ in the Pakistani State’s relationship to Islam, ‘a consistency in its myriad,
      many say insincere efforts, to establish authority over Islam’. One is also hard pressed to
      applaud Khan’s eagerness to ‘affirm’ the aspiration she records among modern Pakistanis, the
        <italic>aam admi</italic>, while acknowledging its capacity towards violence.</p>
