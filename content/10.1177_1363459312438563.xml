<abstract>
<p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) is now firmly embedded in the policies of the Department of Health in England. This article commences with a review of the changing structures of PPI in English health and social care, largely in terms of their own explicit rationales, using that as a spring board for the development of a general theoretical framework. Arguing that all democratic states face major dilemmas in seeking to meet conflicting demands and expectations for involvement, we identify the diverse and sometimes conflicting cultural and political features embedded in current models of involvement in England, in a context of rapid delegitimation of the wider political system. We identify some of the major inherent weaknesses of a monolithic, single-track model of patient and public involvement in the management and running of health and social care systems. Although the mechanisms and methods for delivering this may vary we suggest the model remains fundamentally the same. We also suggest why the current structures are unlikely to provide an effective response either to the pluralism of values, ideologies and social groups engaged in the sector or to the valuing of lay knowledge which could potentially sustain the social networks essential for effective participation and service improvement. The article proposes a four dimensional framework for analysing the nature of PPI. These dimensions, it is argued, provide the co-ordinates along which new ‘knowledge spaces’ for PPI could be constructed. These knowledge spaces could facilitate and support the emergence of social networks of knowledgeable actors capable of engaging with professionals on equal terms and influencing service provision.</p>

<title>Introduction: the policy background</title>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the 1990s saw an increasing interest in PPI not least within the National Health Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459312438563">Barnes, 1997</xref>). Superficially, these developments may be seen as a response to two major factors: public demands for a greater voice in decisions about their services, and demands from politicians for greater efficiency, quality of services and effectiveness in the use of public funds reflecting the growing influence of the New Public Management approach to health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312438563">Rowe and Shephard, 2002</xref>). There was certainly increasing pressure from service users themselves for greater involvement and there were several attempts to re-model the relationship between the NHS and service users along consumerist lines by the Conservative government in the early 1990s. Documents such as <italic>Working for Patients</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312438563">DoH, 1989</xref>) and <italic>The Patient’s Charter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312438563">DoH, 1991</xref>) attest to the emphasis on both individual ‘rights’ and public ‘choices’.</p>
<p>A dualist approach, combining ideologies of democratic public engagement with an economically motivated ‘consumerist approach’ aiming at greater efficiency, continued to provide the overt inspiration for reform for much PPI work within the NHS. From the election of the Labour government in 1997, that momentum strengthened and public involvement became a central trait of both health and social care policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312438563">Milewa et al., 2002</xref>). Within the English context the Labour government retained the previous Government’s emphasis on greater consumerist choice but strengthened the emphasis on patients and public involvement in corporate decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459312438563">Sitzia et al., 2006</xref>) and shifted the justification away from improving efficiency to improving quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312438563">Tritter, 2009</xref>). Successive legislation was introduced requiring NHS organizations to engage with service users in the planning and delivery of local services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312438563">Health and Social Care Act, 2001</xref>: specifically Section 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312438563">Local Government and Public Involvement Health Act, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312438563">National Health Service Act, 2006</xref>). Further embedding the concept of patients and the public influencing policy decision, new legislation in April 2010 compelled Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities to report annually on what influence people’s views have had on their decisions, and the Department of Health coined the term ‘real accountability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312438563">DoH, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, involvement initiatives now cover a wide range of activities aimed at, for example, improving choice over specific treatment decisions at an individual level through to engaging with service users and members of the public in the redesign of local services at a community level.</p>
<p>These legislative developments were also accompanied by organizational changes in the structures of public involvement in England. In the context of health services these were fundamentally changed on two occasions with a third being proposed by the Coalition government elected in May 2010.</p>
<p>Community Health Councils, abolished in 2003, were replaced by the Commission on Patient and Public Involvement in Health and PPI Forums. These forums aimed to improve public engagement in NHS organizations but were criticized on the basis that their members did not accurately communicate with, or reflect the views of, their local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312438563">Tritter, 2009</xref>). In April 2008 PPI Forums were in turn abolished and replaced by Local Involvement Networks (LINks). These emerged from a desire to improve engagement with local community and voluntary organizations within a discrete local authority area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312438563">Tritter, 2009</xref>). In particular LINKs had a role in commissioning local services, albeit that the power to ‘inspect’ was replaced by the weaker power to ‘enter and view’ in the 2007 Act.</p>
<p>However, the Coalition government elected in May 2010 has now unveiled its plan for the future of PPI within the NHS. Its NHS White Paper: <italic>Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312438563">DoH, 2010</xref>), proposes the replacement of LINks by HealthWatch England at a national level and a network of local HealthWatches. These will assist patients in making complaints about poor services and provide patients and carers with information about the quality of local services. HealthWatch England will support the work of local HealthWatch organizations and will be able to recommend inspections of services which appear to be failing. This emphasis on improving the choice and information available to patients and their ability to make complaints perhaps signals a stronger government emphasis in future on the comsumerist approach to involvement.</p>
<p>Influential reports on health and social care have also echoed an apparently universal conviction of the value of and need for public engagement. Specifically, the Darzi Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312438563">DoH, 2008a</xref>), advocating ‘High Quality Care for All’ explicitly reinforced the dual agenda, emphasizing a broad spectrum of engagement, from individual patient decision making through to community involvement and calling for both more patient choice and a more patient-centred partnership approach.</p>
<p>Similarly in reviewing the lessons to be learnt from the failure of care at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, the National Director for Primary Care wrote that he felt very strongly that a lack of good patient engagement was the key to why Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust continued to provide poor care for a protracted period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312438563">DoH et al., 2009</xref>). The inquiry into the management of care of children receiving complex heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary had made similar comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312438563">DoH, 2002</xref>). Indeed the inadequate levels of care uncovered at Bristol resulted in the Department of Health imposing new duties on NHS Trusts to <italic>prove</italic> patient involvement. World Class Commissioning, introduced in mid-2008, also placed strong emphasis on the importance of engaging with patients and the public.</p>
<p>It therefore seems beyond dispute that those controlling health and social care at all levels in England have expressed a declared commitment to implement PPI. PPI is now more than ever embedded as an official ideology in legislation and apparently official practice at all levels and in every aspect of policy. A provision of £84 million over a period of three years was made for this purpose from 2008/11. Furthermore, it is widely endorsed by both lay and professional groups within health and social care and in academia and medical research in the UK. It has become the contemporary shibboleth and a major part of the means to suggest that the NHS is accountable to patients and the public.</p>

<sec id="section2-1363459312438563">
<title>State dilemmas and cultural and social pluralism</title>
<p>In contrast, a process of rapid delegitimation of the wider political system has occurred in recent years. Electorates are increasingly sceptical of the motivation and values of the political class and its associated systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312438563">Curtice and Jowell, 1995</xref>). This process of delegitimation may partly explain the rationale for the changes wrought to PPI in the last decade, although it may be that a deeper social and cultural malaise is also a substantive motivator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312438563">Habermas (1973)</xref> contends that nations in modern capitalist societies face major dilemmas in seeking simultaneously to meet demands for rational problem solving, democratic involvement and cultural identity. From this perspective, the adoption of PPI by the political mainstream could be understood as one government response in a late capitalist system to a complex array of major legitimation crises.</p>
<p>In addition to recognizing the underlying ideological turmoil, any assessment of the current structures for PPI in health and social care has also to take account of the conflicting political values at play. The almost universal endorsement of greater PPI must be viewed against the very real conflicts, contradictions, inefficiencies and ambiguities underlying the way that the ideology of PPI has been put into practice, and the weaknesses of the systems put in to place to deliver public involvement.</p>
<p>Thus, whatever government policy states, the values and ideologies of such groups as clinical professionals or NHS administrators and managers play a central role in affecting the outcome of any involvement initiative. For example, NHS managers, while convinced of the need to consult their patients or clients, may also feel that in a highly litigious society, they need to restrict the margin of uncertainty, where the public might perceive inadequacy, incompetence, error or negligence. Although not an entirely separate group, salaried involvement professionals, that is, people who have been funded to implement and administer PPI in a parastatal enterprise may wish to encourage public criticism of health and social care services, but they rely for contract renewal and their livelihood on not overly antagonizing the NHS administrative and clinical professionals.</p>
<p>A paper from the Local Government Information Unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312438563">LGIU, 2008</xref>) describes ‘five elements of accountability’ within the health sector (Local Strategic Partnerships, Health Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Non-Executive Directors, Local Involvement Networks (LINks) and Foundation Trusts). The document argues that accountability within the system represented by the five components is almost ‘entirely upwards’. In Parliament voices too have been raised accusing legislators of making the mistaken assumption that the public are too stupid to notice that they have absolutely no power over what happens in their local NHS, of fearing that democratic decision making would lead to unworkable populism and that expert government is better than public governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312438563">Pugh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus current and past models of PPI may be seen as dedicated in reality to the production of systems which are controlled by salaried involvement professionals with committed volunteers being allocated a secondary, relatively impotent and subservient, role in organizational and bureaucratic labyrinths. These characteristics are evidently aligned with the need at each level to secure system control and ensure predictability. It appears, therefore, that despite the apparent unanimity of support for greater lay involvement in health and social care, and notwithstanding a NHS Constitution, which declares that ‘the NHS belongs to the people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312438563">Department of Health, 2008b</xref>: 2), there are a number of significant concerns about the ability of current arrangements to deliver ‘genuine’ involvement and consequential improvements in quality and efficiency.</p>

<title>Theorizing about public involvement</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312438563">Beresford (2002)</xref> argues that it is unlikely that participation is understandable in isolation from its broader political context, given the inherently political and ideological nature of participation. He suggests that the ‘flight to empiricism’ (as represented by the copious production of ‘how to’ manuals) reflects a search for a safe option, which divorces participation from concepts such as politics and ideology, replacing them with cosier terms like engagement. Our earlier comments indicate not only that there are grounded concerns about the fitness for purpose of the current system of public involvement in health and social care, but that it is a battleground of competing interests, where the cumulative objectives expressed are diverse, controversial and on occasions incompatible. Indeed in a society divided along lines of class, race, religion, disability and gender the achievement, in total, of the declared objectives of PPI may be described as nothing less than utopian.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there is no simple solution to grasping the complex and ever-changing spectrum of influences, pressures, demands, initiatives, folklore and ‘facts on the ground’ concerning PPI. This article argues that analysis is required to map out a more genuinely emancipatory framework for PPI in health and social care: an analysis which incorporates cultural, political and social dimensions of a diverse and unequal society and sector. By emancipatory framework we mean a system which empowers, capacitates and supports people to hold the NHS to account.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing a complex social phenomenon such as PPI is not unproblematic. A deliberate and explicit conceptual scheme has marked advantages, however, over sporadic and unrelated assumptions and assertions about policy options unrelated to any analytical framework. An explicit analytical framework also makes for a more structured and disciplined assessment of the available policy options. The challenge of conceptualizing such a framework has already been addressed by several authors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312438563">Arnstein (1969)</xref>, for example, conceptualizes civic involvement as citizen power and in spite of the many years since her work first appeared, it helpfully points to the way in which participation in the process may often be little more than manipulation. She envisaged a ladder of ascent from manipulation through tokenistic steps to full citizen power with, at its peak, citizen control. Her work provides a useful first base for anyone considering a broader conceptualization of public involvement. It highlights the need for any discussion of PPI to be firmly based in an understanding of the central role of power.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312438563">Oliver et al. (2008)</xref> develop a conceptual framework of patient and public involvement in research. This framework combines a simplified version of Arnstein’s ladder with Mullen et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312438563">1984</xref>) distinction between proactive and reactive involvement to create a matrix, which describes public involvement in research agenda setting. This framework is potentially applicable to a wide range of activities associated with public involvement in research. It generates an overview of policies and practices in this area and helps to identify gaps in current practice and understandings of public involvement in research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312438563">Tritter and McCallum (2006)</xref> pick up the baton of Arnstein’s work, criticizing the static nature of her linear model, its missing rungs and the emphasis placed on the single dimension of ‘power’, ignoring the existence of other relevant forms of knowledge and expertise. They examine in detail the justification of lay involvement in health policy in the UK and elsewhere, emphasizing the importance of lay expertise and making a plea for the greater development of service providers’ ability to engage with the people who use their services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312438563">Tritter (2009)</xref> proposes a conceptual framework for PPI, which builds on Oliver et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312438563">2008</xref>) work. This differentiates between types and aims of involvement and their potential impact, highlighting the way in which approaches to involvement are different in countries which adopt a rights-based rather than a regulatory approach.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312438563">Popay and Williams (1996)</xref> argue for greater recognition among social scientists in health research of the nature and significance of lay knowledge within their disciplines. They argue that the theoretical and conceptual insights of such an approach are essential for a more robust and holistic understanding of contemporary health problems. For this, PPI requires an engagement with both lay and professional experts on a shared terrain, which acknowledges the valid contribution that each can make. This development in turn may require the creation of what may be termed ‘knowledge spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312438563">Elliott and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312438563">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>), within which both expert knowledge and forms of lay knowledge can interact with each other on an equal basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312438563">Elliott and Williams (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459312438563">Popay et al. (1998)</xref> argue that lay knowledge existing within everyday understandings is a form of legitimate expertise, which can become the basis for a powerful form of knowledge production. This is possible, they suggest, because lay people are constantly involved in a process of interpretation and theorization about the social and physical world they inhabit and their place within it. They suggest that the knowledge this process produces, when brought into engagement with the knowledge of scientific and technical experts through a process of debate, discussion and dialogue, has the potential to create not just a more inclusive and democratic form of science, but also a more reliable, valid and effective science linked to a richer conception of knowledge, which is able to inform social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312438563">Forrester et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1363459312438563">
<title>Directions for a theoretical grounding for an emancipatory concept of public involvement</title>
<p>In the next section, we build on the relevant theoretical and empirical work of Habermas, Bourdieu and Fraser, and on the concept of ‘knowledge spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312438563">Elliott and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312438563">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>) to develop a framework which can encompass the cultural, political and social dynamics of involvement. We identify four dimensions to map the terrain of interactions between different kinds of expertise, in which new knowledge spaces may be constructed. We view these dimensions as points along a continuum that may move to and fro over time and are interdependent. Such an analysis can encompass diverse and competing value orientations and their social structural and systemic corollaries. The dimensions we propose are: expressive to instrumental action; weak to strong publics; monism to pluralism; and conservation to change.</p>
<sec id="section5-1363459312438563">
<title>Expressive to instrumental: Habermas’ lifeworld and system</title>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459312438563">Habermas (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312438563">1998)</xref>, society consists of two basic social spheres, lifeworld and system. Although there are dangers in drawing too sharp a distinction between the system and lifeworld (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312438563">Cook, 2005</xref> for a critique) we find the distinction helpful in providing a theoretical tool for considering the relationship between lay and professional expert perspectives on science and society. It provides a means for linking the macro and micro levels of society while also allowing a detailed analysis of lay perspectives.</p>
<p>‘Lifeworld’ consists of both public and private aspects. It refers to the background contexts of social action, including public opinion, norms and values, as well as individual experiences and behaviours. It contains knowledge of the everyday social world as well as the interpretive work of previous generations. It provides culturally transmitted ways of interpreting experience as well as the language required to articulate and share them with others. It is, therefore, the medium within which cultural and social integration is sustained and reproduced.</p>
<p>In contrast the ‘system’, the prime examples of which are bureaucracies and markets, the ‘steering media’ of capitalist society, provides a mechanism for material reproduction. In the context of PPI in health and social care, system-level imperatives might include economic considerations, governmental health policies, the influence of professional bodies, the compliance or non-compliance of patients with medical treatment and efficient administration.</p>
<p>In the sphere of health policy and practice we suggest that the system/lifeworld distinction is an appropriate means of analysis because it highlights the tensions between the experiences, needs and concerns of patients and carers and the need to administer healthcare in as rational and as efficient a manner as possible within strictly limited resources. Individuals who become ill frequently find themselves in contact with an unfamiliar healthcare system with rules and modes of behaviour frequently at odds with those that they are familiar with from their own lifeworld.</p>
<p>Linked to the idea of lifeworld and system are Habermas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312438563">1998</xref>: ch. 7) concepts of communicative action and strategic action. Communicative action is a consensual form of social co-ordination, orientated to understanding and interpretation, whereas strategic action is orientated to achieving specific goals or aims as defined by the people or organization involved. Broadly speaking, the reproduction of the lifeworld, that is, the everyday social world, is achieved through communicative action, whereas the system is predominantly reproduced through strategic action. Furthermore, strategic action may be open or concealed. Concealed strategic action may involve a degree of deception, which may be more or less conscious or unconscious on the part of the people who perpetrate it. Habermas suggests that unconscious strategic deception results in systematically distorted communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312438563">Scambler, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Confusion arises when actions orientated to understanding become confused with actions orientated to particular aims or goals. This is particularly likely where achieving the goals of the system involves a degree of strategic deception, whether conscious or unconscious. Within the context of various policies and structures designed to engage with the public, patients and carers in the process of delivering health and social care, the emergence of an involvement ‘industry’ complete with its own ‘experts’ may, therefore, represent a tacit recognition of a cleavage between the system and lifeworlds. This cleavage has important negative consequences for the delivery of healthcare and the maintenance and legitimation of existing structures. Indeed, the very emergence of such an involvement ‘industry’ implies a carrying over into the lifeworlds of patients and carers of the strategic and instrumental aims of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Habermas’ notion of colonization of the lifeworld by the system, which occurs when system imperatives come to dominate and distort the lifeworld resulting in certain ‘pathologies’, is also of relevance here. Within the health context these ‘pathologies’ may include a lack of attention to service users’ own perspectives, treating patients solely as a source of information which can be fed into a bureaucratic planning process and a tendency to treat healthcare decision making as a purely technical process, thus privileging the knowledge and expertise of technocrats over that of lay people.</p>
<p>In consequence many lay groups may be alienated by PPI systems where people relate according to ‘purposive-rational’ means rather than through the expressive modes of communication of their ‘lifeworlds’, where they can generate common norms and values for their communication, understandings and co-ordinated joint actions. This suggests that a continuum from expressive to instrumental action should provide one dimension of an analytical framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1363459312438563">
<title>Weak to strong publics: Fraser and the development of the public sphere</title>
<p>There can be few surer means to alienate the public from engagement than the realization that their participation is purely tokenistic. This concern raises important questions about the relationships between what Fraser terms weak and strong publics and the institutions that represent them. What institutional arrangements best ensure accountability of decision-making bodies to external publics? How would this operate within a complex and colossal sub-system of the State such as the NHS?</p>
<p>Drawing on Habermas’ work on the rise of the public sphere in bourgeois society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser (1997)</xref> suggests that a public is formed where private individuals come together to discuss issues publicly. The public sphere is distinguished from both the nation state and the economy, and its rise is seen as potentially providing an important counterweight to both to the power of the State and to the interests of capital. Fraser argues, however, that there is not one unitary public. Her analysis provides space for a plurality of ‘publics’ and their inter-public discursive interactions. For example, within health and social care there are the differing interests of those with chronic conditions, and the general public who may be occasional users of health services and carers (often family members having their own needs and requirements). The interests of these constituencies frequently overlap but there are also significant areas of divergence and of potential conflict. Fraser claims that the public sphere is always constituted by conflict.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the boundaries of the public sphere are not fixed. Differing social groups, including professional elites, may have an interest in keeping certain issues in or out of the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser, 1997</xref>), while at the same time legitimating that objective by offering ‘palliative’ public involvement as a placebo. For example, in the past, decisions about medical treatment were largely seen as the exclusive realm of doctors. But various service user and patient groups, for example, in mental and reproductive health have successfully challenged the right of doctors to make decisions about their care without involving them.</p>
<p>The process of challenging boundaries may involve creating what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser (1997)</xref> terms subaltern counterpublics, where subordinate social groups can develop and circulate alternative understandings and descriptions of the social world. For example, disability groups have, via a diversity of strategies, developed a counterpublic that has challenged conceptions of normality and disability in order to highlight aspects of the social world previously ignored or suppressed in public discourse. Arguably the Government’s technicist approach to this social phenomenon has been the development of LINks in an attempt to incorporate these counterpublics within a manageable ring fence and ensure greater predictability. Of course the degree to which counterpublics challenge the boundaries of public discourse varies, as do the methods they use to achieve their aims. Neither can the political direction of counterpublics be assumed in advance. They can and do attempt to shift public discourse either to the ideological left or right of the political spectrum.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser (1997)</xref> points out that not all publics have an equal ability to influence decision making. She makes a distinction between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ publics. She defines a strong public as one, where not only discussions take place, but which also has the ability to influence decision making. This may occur through having access to the State’s decision-making bodies or being able to bring pressure to bear on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312438563">Davies, 2007</xref>). Weak publics may discuss issues, but have little chance of influencing decision making.</p>
<p>Related to this is Fraser’s concept of participatory parity. Fraser is critical of liberal attempts to bracket rather than eliminate or reduce the impact of social inequality on public participation. She argues that it is inadequate for liberals to suggest that participants should act ‘as if’ they were equal when participating in the public sphere, because inequality inevitably taints deliberations within publics. This occurs not simply because of inequalities in economic resources (the politics of redistribution), but also because of subtle processes of social and cultural distinction (the politics of recognition). Here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser (1997)</xref> references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312438563">Bourdieu’s (1984)</xref> work on the role played by cultural capital in social reproduction and maintaining social distinctions. Thus for Fraser achieving participatory parity is only possible if underlying economic and status inequalities are first addressed. From this perspective the task of critical analysis is to reveal how these inequalities continue to taint public debate.</p>
<p>Fraser’s discussion of the politics of needs interpretation is also pertinent. She points out that at a general level it is relatively uncontroversial to argue that homeless people need shelter in order to survive; what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312438563">Fraser (1989)</xref> calls ‘thin needs’. As soon, however, as questions arise, such as precisely what form of shelter is to be provided or how it is to be supplied, disagreements emerge. For example, should homelessness be tackled through state provision of housing or through stimulating the private sector? Should state provided housing be subsidized to make it affordable to the least well off? What impact will this have on the profitability of the private sector?</p>
<p>From this perspective, the development of lay involvement might be seen as the identification of a specific need, but the legitimacy and scope of the need and how it might be met, for example in consumerist or democratic terms, along with the potential impact of these approaches on existing power relationships, might all be highly contested. The attempt to restrict the debate to the technicalities of implementation might be seen as an attempt to depoliticize the process.</p>
<p>Fraser’s analysis alerts us to the fact that the boundaries of public debate are dynamic and highly contested. These boundaries do not merely consist of which issues are in or out of the public sphere, but also which solutions may be deemed acceptable or unacceptable resolutions to a particular problem. Her analysis of counterpublics suggests that what happens outside the ‘system’ may be at least as important, if not more important to the trajectory of public debate than what happens within it, not least because counterpublics are frequently formed in opposition to the top–down construction of overly weak publics. The drawing of these boundaries and the nature of the decisions made depend on the pressure that the competing parties can exert. These considerations suggest that a continuum from weak public power to strong public power should provide the second dimension of the proposed framework.</p>

<title>From monism to pluralism: Bourdieu and differing forms of capital</title>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312438563">Bourdieu (1990)</xref> the social structure of society is characterized by the struggle and conflict to appropriate rare social goods or forms of capital. Although the specific type of social goods or resources at stake in this struggle may vary over time and place, Bourdieu argues that there is an underlying ‘logic’ involved, that is, the need to appropriate socially valued goods as efficiently as possible. But, for a particular resource to function as a form of capital, it must be recognized as such by other actors in a particular social field. Thus the knowledge and skills possessed by working class people may be recognized as a form of capital within their own communities but not by their middle class counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459312438563">Bourdieu (1987)</xref> suggests that four broad categories of capital commonly operate in contemporary, industrialized capitalist societies; these are economic, cultural, social and symbolic capital.</p>
<p>Bourdieu does not consider these differing forms of capital to be equitably distributed between or within social classes. Schoolteachers may be well endowed with a particular form of cultural capital, but relatively lacking in economic capital. For large employers and business people the reverse might be true. According to Bourdieu, it is the uneven distribution of these differing forms of capital that gives rise to a constant struggle in which the social actors involved take advantage of the resources in which they are relatively well endowed to defend their position within society.</p>
<p>Within healthcare, doctors are in possession of a particular form of cultural capital based on their medical qualifications. However, academics or managers may attempt to mobilize different forms of cultural capital based on their own knowledge and skills to impose their view of the legitimate set of power relationships between themselves and other professional groups. Within this struggle the expertise and experience of ‘lay’ people may not even be recognized as valuable.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312438563">Bourdieu (1990)</xref> argues that symbolic capital plays a very specific role because it can be used to legitimize one class’s dominance of another. This is possible because symbolic capital allows the economically dominant class to secure consent for its rule by fostering feelings of respect and obligation among the dominated. Within the context of healthcare, the particular form of institutionally recognized cultural capital that doctors possess has an important symbolic power related to it, in part associated with the ability to save life, which helps to legitimize and perpetuate a set of paternalistic relationships with patients.</p>
<p>The danger inherent in many current PPI statutes is that, although creating nominal equality of participation, they invoke situations in which the abstract and technical forms of knowledge that professionals tend to have acquired through formal education are more highly valued than the practical, experiential knowledge that patients or members of the public may possess. For Bourdieu, they devalue the forms of social, cultural and symbolic capital that lay groups of service users may recognize and value, while valorizing those held by various professionals and parastatal administrators, making the achievement of participatory parity, to use Fraser’s terminology, difficult if not impossible to achieve. Lay persons may sit on prestigious medical committees, but their contribution may be unconsciously downgraded, or they may be outmanoeuvred, because they do not have access to the dominant forms of capital that professionals have access to.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459312438563">Wakefield and Poland (2005)</xref> suggest, only particular individuals who originate from within dominated groups, but who have been able to access mainstream forms of capital (e.g. through formal education) are enabled to participate. Attempts at building public participation can, therefore, have the unintended consequence of concentrating the power of marginalized groups into the hands of a few spokespersons or established community leaders, while at the same time introducing social distance between those speaking and those being spoken for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312438563">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>As a response to these problems, various service user movements have developed alternative forms of social, cultural and symbolic capital, built through meetings, conferences and other ‘interactive’ events in their lifeworlds. These interactions have facilitated the development of alternative understandings of health and illness, which have challenged medicalized understandings and the medical profession’s right to make decisions about service users without involving them.</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s work on different forms of capital alerts us to the potential for knowledge to take on different forms (e.g. abstract and conceptual or concrete and experiential), but also that these forms may not be equally valued, helping to perpetuate inequality. It is also important to recognize that although there may be underlying similarities in how the different forms of lay knowledge are produced, the specific content of these forms of knowledge is likely to vary from place to place dependent on geography, local context and history.</p>
<p>A unitary system is therefore unlikely to cope with this diversity or engage with people on terms that allow them to participate with other experts on an equal footing. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312438563">Fraser (1997)</xref> indicates, channelling diverse cultural forms of expression through a single mechanism is likely to perpetuate inequality, since any single mechanism is liable to privilege the expressive norms of one cultural group over another, thereby making discursive assimilation a condition for participation. She concludes that in general the idea of engaging with diverse social groups on an egalitarian basis only makes sense if there is a plurality of public arenas in which groups with diverse values and discursive norms can participate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attempts at engagement must be marked by recognition that far from representing a potential block to effective policy-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312438563">Pickin et al., 2002</xref>), the diversity and strength of lay expertise may contribute to the generation of integrative forms of knowledge to complement the analytic and reductionist approaches of much scientific reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312438563">Popay and Williams, 1996</xref>). This in turn requires the development of initiatives, which may require professionals to engage in deliberations outside their traditional professional terrains both intellectually and sometimes physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312438563">Elliott and Williams, 2008</xref>). A continuum from structural monism to pluralism, therefore, forms the third dimension of the proposed theoretical framework. This dimension interplays with the other dimensions of weak to strong public power, and expressive to instrumental communication, to describe the social terrain occupied by any new ‘knowledge spaces’.</p>

<sec id="section8-1363459312438563">
<title>A cross-cutting dimension: conservation and change</title>
<p>The degree to which decision-makers can respond to the issues that have been highlighted depends on one final policy dimension, which integrates with all the others. Some policy options available to policy makers will tend towards conservatism for many reasons, including predictability or the retention of valued structural or political components of existing systems. Others may embrace systematic and deliberate change, termed innovation. In other words policy- and decision-makers have to legitimate the structure they are supporting or proposing by reference to a value dimension from conservation to deliberate change. The exact point along that dimension which can ensure the most effective legitimation is a function of many factors, including effectiveness of any rationale, the persuasiveness of the modalities chosen and the interaction in a system with the other three dimensions. The dimension of conservation and change is thus cross-cutting, in that it applies to all facets of the model.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-1363459312438563">
<title>Mapping the co-ordinates of new knowledge spaces</title>
<p>The dimensions we have proposed provide the major co-ordinates with which the terrain of ‘knowledge spaces’ can be mapped. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459312438563">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this framework in the form of interactive continua, which map knowledge spaces.</p>

<caption>
<p>A four dimensional view of knowledge spaces</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1363459312438563-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>This framework is intended as a theoretical and a practical tool, which can offer either a medium for reflection on current practice or a means to develop new ways of thinking about involvement. It also alerts us to the potential heterogeneous nature of new knowledge spaces and the activity that may take place within them.</p>
<p>For example, those people involved in establishing new involvement processes could use this framework to help identify the potential barriers and facilitators to the creation of any new engagement structures. The following questions are derived from this framework and can be used to investigate the type and quality of any new proposals for engagement activity. For example, do any proposed new structures relate to lay people in solely ‘purposive-rational’ terms or do they recognize and value the emotional and expressive content of interactions with patients and members of the public? Will these new systems provide an appropriate plurality of arenas capable of engaging with a potentially diverse range of social groups? Which areas of decision making will be open to influence by patients and members of the public and which will not? Which solutions are likely to be deemed acceptable or unacceptable resolutions to a particular problem by the various constituencies involved in the decision-making process and finally to what degree is the host organization prepared to embrace change in order to accommodate the implications of the answers to these questions? A similar process can also be applied to current engagement initiatives, thus generating a framework for the evaluation of existing systems.</p>
<p>The framework can also be used to map the diversity and fluidity of different patient and public involvement initiatives and groups. For example, many service user groups value peer support. These groups are likely to occupy a space within this framework, characterized by an expressive mode of operation and relatively pluralistic approaches to engaging with people. They may, however, form a relatively weak public because their ability to influence policy may be limited. Indeed this may not be their aim. In contrast, campaign groups may be more instrumental in their modes of operation and vary in the degree to which they employ a pluralistic approach to engaging with people, but they may form a relatively strong public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459312438563">Baggott et al., 2005</xref>). Attempts to engage with these different groups will need to take these features into account if they are to be successful. Similarly, a group of individuals may move back and forth within this framework during the course of a particular ‘involvement’ project. A regeneration project within a deprived community may be pluralistic and expressive in its initial approach to engagement but may need to become more instrumental in its approach later, if it is to be effective in bringing about change. Attempts at engagement need to recognize and take account of this dynamic.</p>
<p>In this way the framework highlights the tensions and contradictions involved in engaging with various groups. Effective engagement will always involve achieving at best a dynamic equilibrium between differing, sometimes contradictory points along the dimensions described above. This suggests that policy initiatives are required which facilitate these processes rather than trying to control them artificially.</p>
<p>Finally, the framework suggests that much current involvement practice is clustered in a relatively small area towards the creation of weak publics, and monistic and instrumental approaches to involvement. Many of the consultation exercises by health and social care and government agencies would fit into this frame. The creation of knowledge spaces, which occupy different regions within the framework and where both lay and professional people may meet on a more discursive and equal footing, could obviate such extremes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1363459312438563" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Concluding comment</title>
<p>Evidently attempts to engage with the public, patients and carers require a variety of modalities to achieve often conflicting goals within a wide variety of community, locality, regional, national and even international contexts. Some suggest that there is the possibility of creating ‘knowledge spaces’, where experiential evidence, interpretations and opinions, on the one hand, and rigorous evaluations and scientific rationality on the other, can come together in creative dialogue to inform healthcare policy decisions. This is, however, currently only a theoretical possibility dependent on a number of factors, including the right policies and the appropriate cultural and social delivery. Where politicians require predictability of public response and safety in the final decision, where there is widespread alienation from the political process, a lessening of the traditional patterns of volunteering, and disenchantment with the quality of much service provision, broad strategies are required seeking to involve the public by those in power. Those policies need to engage with the cultures of a diversity of groups on a more equitable basis.</p>
<p>Government responses thus far to multiple ‘legitimation crises’ have evidenced a predominantly technicist or instrumental approach to public involvement, with an overriding concern for the construction of a unitary system. As a consequence, whereas the declared values and aspirations appear to be of an open, transparent, participatory and pluralist structure of involvement, which values volunteers, it appears in practice to be a closely managed, unitary system and top–down model with predominantly upward accountability, where salaried involvement professionals run state ideological apparatuses for a highly regulated public participation as monolithic and monopolistic, businesses.</p>
<p>Thus, the discrepancies between pluralism and unitary structures, between top–down and bottom–up approaches to social construction, between inclusion and exclusion, between openness and closure, between downward and upward accountability, between unpaid voluntary work and salaried involvement professionalism, could be seen as major tensions contributing to, rather than lessening, what Habermas has called the legitimation crisis of late capitalist society. These tensions further accentuate rather than attenuate alienation from all ‘political’ systems, producing a centrifugal force either for the exclusion of the very groups the system was intended to involve, such as committed volunteers and seldom heard groups, or for their consumption by a black bureaucratic hole of powerless conformity.</p>
<p>In contrast this article suggests that professionals and lay people need to be able to participate from a position of equality, each acknowledging that there are complex questions of evidence and value in healthcare policy decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312438563">Elliott and Williams, 2008</xref>). One of the aims of involvement may be to break down boundaries, share experience and build understanding. This, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312438563">Tritter and McCallum (2006)</xref> point out, suggests complementarity between different forms of understanding, rather than a hierarchy of knowledge. However, such deliberations must be empowered for real influence on decision-making processes rather than creating forums for debate which have been artificially denuded of any decision-making capability. To enable this to take place government, together with its state ideological apparatuses, has to retreat and increase its trust in the citizenry of a democracy and its respect for their diverse cultures. Unless it does, the danger is further and deeper alienation. Unless professional, salaried PPI ‘experts’ are able to recognize and respond to the diverse forms of expertise described above and the emergence of different arenas for knowledge production, the structure and initiatives that they set up are likely to become increasingly irrelevant to all those outside the professional ‘involvement industry’.</p>
