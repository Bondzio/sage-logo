<p><bold>Aims:</bold> Proponents of theory-based evaluations argue that the type of evidence needed by public health decision-makers is not simply whether interventions work or not. A more fruitful approach is to understand the contexts and circumstances associated with effectiveness.</p>
<p>This article aims: to firstly understand factors influencing professionals’ practice following their participation in training that aimed to reduce children’s exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) in the home via increased usage of brief interventions; and secondly to consider the implications of these factors for improving the skills of a diverse workforce.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Questionnaires were issued to the 231 participants pre- and post-training and at three-month follow-up. Four focus groups and four interviews were run with 16 people who had attended the training in the previous four to eight months and who performed a wide range of professional roles, reflecting the diversity of those trained.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The three-month follow-up data indicated that some, but not all, participants had engaged in components of the brief intervention and changed their practice. This difference was largely explained by professional role. Those working in a health-visiting role or team were considered better placed to support families through a process of restricting SHS exposure in the home. Triangulated data also indicated that these professionals more often practised elements of the brief intervention. There was also some evidence that the training did not equip participants with the full range of information they wanted, or with the skills that they felt that they needed.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Decisions on who to target for training need to be informed by an understanding of the contexts in which professionals work and the opportunities and constraints within these. Those working in a health-visiting team are credible message carriers, have opportunities to develop a relationship with families, and can be well placed to provide families with sustained support. To do so, they need clear messages on precisely how to reduce exposure. In addition, they need the skills to support families through a process of change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Second-hand smoke (SHS), also known as ‘environmental tobacco smoke’ or ‘passive smoking’, comprises exhaled mainstream smoke and side-stream smoke from the lit end of a cigarette.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912442271">1</xref></sup> Due to its noxious mix of toxins and human carcinogens, SHS has been classified as a significant public health hazard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912442271">2</xref></sup> leading to legislation across the UK prohibiting smoking in most enclosed public spaces and workplaces (Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, Health Act 2006 and Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006). These acts place no legislative restrictions on whether people smoke in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>Babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of SHS: because of their smaller bodies, they breathe more quickly and inhale more pollutants per pound of body weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912442271">3</xref></sup> placing them at increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, lower respiratory infections, bronchitis, middle ear disease such as glue ear and bacterial meningitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912442271">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912442271">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parental tobacco smoking is the predominant source of SHS among children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912442271">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912442271">8</xref></sup> making the domestic home the most significant environment for children’s exposure to SHS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913912442271">9</xref></sup> particularly for those under the age of five who spend so much of their time at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913912442271">10</xref></sup> As a consequence, there are concerns, including in the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912442271">4</xref></sup> and the USA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912442271">5</xref></sup> regarding the substantial exposure that is experienced by babies and children in households with smokers.</p>
<p>Children’s exposure to SHS is an inequalities issue too: as smoking is more prevalent in lower socio-economic groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912442271">11</xref></sup> and as children from poorer backgrounds are less likely to spend time in regulated child care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913912442271">12</xref></sup> and therefore more time being cared for by their parents, relatives or neighbours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912442271">13</xref></sup> children from poorer backgrounds are at a heightened risk of exposure to SHS in the home.</p>
<p>Health professionals are seen as potentially playing an important role in tackling this issue, but to do so they need to be armed with improved knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913912442271">14</xref></sup> However, information provision by itself may not be enough: the issue is acknowledged as an extremely sensitive and challenging one as professionals need to guard against stigmatising families for failing to have a smoke-free home and also manage the tension between the rights of smokers in a private space and the rights of the child to be protected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913912442271">14</xref></sup> Such challenges are likely to be compounded where smoking takes place within a context of multiple disadvantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912442271">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation produced a pack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913912442271">15</xref></sup> that provides materials and a structure for delivering a half-day training session intended to reduce children’s exposure to SHS in the home and car. The training, intended for people in regular contact with parents, aims to increase the number of SHS brief interventions that they deliver.</p>
<p>The training itself comprises a combination of presentations and interactive activities in the form of quizzes and discussions on: the components of SHS and risks associated with children’s exposure to this; indications that a child may be exposed; how to protect children from exposure; processes involved in behaviour change (based on Prochaska and DiClemente’s Cycle of Change model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913912442271">16</xref></sup>); various potential SHS scenarios and how these might be addressed; and provision of information and a take-home aide-memoire on the ‘five-point plan’ as a framework for SHS brief interventions. This latter plan involves: assessing exposure to SHS; raising the issue; assessing readiness to change; taking action according to readiness to change; and follow-up.</p>
<p>This training programme is being implemented across the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913912442271">17</xref></sup> An evaluation of its impact in Liverpool involving interviews with a sample of 19 participants indicated that while they expressed increased confidence on the topic, some did not go on to mention the risks of SHS in their encounters with families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912442271">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article builds on this finding by reporting a subsequent evaluation of the training in its first phase of roll-out by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GG&amp;C) Health Board and its partners in the local Community (and Health) Care Partnerships (CH(C)Ps).</p>
<p>Those responsible for rolling out the training held various views on whether or not the training should be targeted at specific professional groups or whether it should be available to anyone with regular contact with young children. A compromise position was agreed such that certain professional groups would be prioritised but that participation would not be restricted to these. The professional ‘types’ that were identified as priorities were those who were deemed likely to have an ongoing relationship with families of young children and who were considered to be viewed by parents as credible message carriers on SHS, for example those working as health visitors or within a health-visiting team.</p>
<p>The scale of the roll-out by NHS GG&amp;C is believed to be the highest in the UK:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913912442271">17</xref></sup> over the period 1st November 2009 to 1st June 2010, 231 people in the NHS GG&amp;C area completed the half-day training session.</p>
<p>NHS GG&amp;C produced a leaflet to complement the training, for distribution across the health board area more generally. This was created specifically for (and pre-tested on) parents and carers of young children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757913912442271">18</xref></sup> detailing risks associated with SHS exposure and truths and myths on how to reduce these.</p>
<sec id="section2-1757913912442271">
<title>Rationale for Evaluation</title>
<p>Proponents of theory-based evaluations argue that public health evaluation should be purposefully designed to assist in the process of policy making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757913912442271">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757913912442271">21</xref></sup> and that this requires moving beyond simply identifying whether or not things ‘work’ or ‘don’t work’. Instead, it is argued, programme evaluations need to understand the interplay between interventions and effects. This includes consideration of the context in which recipients operate in order to understand the circumstances in which, and the reasons for, a programme’s effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757913912442271">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a consequence, the evaluation reported here aimed to identify not simply whether participants increased their use of brief interventions in the manner intended by the training, but importantly, the particular circumstances associated with them doing so. In doing this, we hoped that we would develop insights and evidence regarding whether the training should be targeted at certain professional types, and if so, the implications for the content of this intervention. In this way, it was intended that subsequent targeting and roll-out of the training across GG&amp;C would be evidence-based.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we hoped that the evaluation would contribute more generally to the evidence base by providing insights into the opportunities and limitations experienced by professionals in relation to tackling this important public health issue.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757913912442271" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The evaluation involved a mixed-methods design, which is detailed in full in a report on the NHS GG&amp;C website.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913912442271">23</xref></sup> Questionnaires were issued to all participants before attending the training, at the end of the training and at three-month follow-up. Participants were required to complete the pre-training questionnaires as part of the registration process, and then at the end of the training session. These questionnaires were completed on an anonymous basis. Although respondents were required to provide their names on the follow-up questionnaire, they were informed that these details were for office use only (so that non-responders could be ‘chased up’) and would be separated from responses prior to data entry. Response rates for pre-training, post-training and follow-up questionnaires were 98%, 99% and 70%, respectively. At follow-up, there was a slight over-representation of participants working in a health-visiting team: 35% compared with 28% at the pre-training administration.</p>
<p>At the outset of the training, all participants were asked (via an information sheet) whether they would be willing to be contacted by an independent consultant (JG) in order to be invited to take part in an interview or focus group that would run several months after the training. Those who were willing to be contacted were asked to complete a consent form that was developed for this purpose. Consent was provided by 53% of participants and from these a sample was selected to include individuals from across all 10 CH(C)Ps and from the range of professional groups attending the sessions. Subsequently, four focus groups and four follow-up in-depth interviews were conducted. All participants had attended the training in the preceding four to eight months.</p>
<p>In this article we report findings from the focus groups and interviews and triangulate these with findings from the follow-up questionnaires.</p>
<p>The follow-up questionnaire aimed to identify whether there had been any changes in practice in the three months since the training and provided opportunities for respondents to provide any additional comments as to why their professional practice had or had not changed.</p>
<p>The focus groups and interviews aimed to look in more depth at the factors/circumstances associated with putting (or not putting) the training into practice.</p>
<p>Sixteen people in total participated in the focus groups and interviews. These individuals performed a wide range of professional roles, reflecting the diverse range of those trained. They included: health visitors and staff nurses working in a health-visiting team; dental health support workers (one who worked as part of a health-visiting team and two who did not); family centre and nursery school staff (managerial and operational); a health improvement practitioner; a health care assistant; and an individual working within the childminding field.</p>
<p>Focus groups lasted between 40 and 55 minutes, three of the interviews lasted 20–25 minutes, and the remaining interview ran for just nine minutes as the individual involved could not remember much about the content of the training and had not applied it at all in practice.</p>
<p>As this was a service evaluation and no patients were involved, NHS GG&amp;C did not require ethical approval. However, ethical principles were practised throughout in line with the guidelines of the Social Research Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757913912442271">24</xref></sup> Thus all participants were informed about the details of the evaluation and how findings would be used and reported. The independent consultant carrying out the evaluation did not have access to the names of the training participants except for those individuals who provided written consent to say they could be contacted for evaluation purpose. Consent to participate in the interviews and focus groups was obtained as a subsequent and separate process.</p>
<p>All focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded (with consent), fully transcribed and analysed thematically. The analytic approach was informed by Framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757913912442271">25</xref></sup> (an approach devised for qualitative policy evaluation and used by the National Centre for Social Research). This involved developing an analytical framework that reflected the evaluation objectives and the content of the collected data, and which used descriptive headings under which data were summarised.</p>

<p>In the follow-up questionnaires, respondents were asked to indicate whether, and if so approximately how many times over the past three months, they had carried out a range of actions (each of these being a specified element of the brief intervention) to address children’s exposure to SHS in the home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913912442271">Table 1</xref>) and whether or not these represented a change in practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757913912442271">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>These self-reported assessments indicated that the majority had engaged in practices intended to tackle the issue on at least one occasion, most commonly by giving out the leaflet that the health board had produced. However, the findings provide a ‘mixed picture’ in-so-far as some respondents reported that they had engaged in practices to tackle SHS and that these represented an increase, whereas others indicated that they had not engaged in the listed behaviours at all and/or that the frequency with which they engaged in these practices had not changed since the training.</p>
<p>The focus groups and interviews were used to explore and understand why the training produced such variations in behavioural outcomes. The findings from these are reported below.</p>
<p>Before we describe these, it is worth noting that these findings are consistent with brief comments made in response to open-ended questions in the follow-up survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913912442271">23</xref></sup> and that no one suggested in the questionnaires, follow-up focus groups or interviews that they intended to change their practice but simply had not yet had the opportunity to do so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913912442271">
<title>Responding versus raising the topic</title>
<p>Virtually all individuals participating in the focus groups and interviews (hereafter collectively referred to as ‘participants’) talked of the training leading to an increased awareness of SHS and health risks, and that it served to ‘prime’ them that SHS is an important issue: ‘<italic>[It] put it to the forefront of your mind</italic>’ said one (I3: staff nurse); ‘<italic>It’s made me more aware of it and bring it into my attitude and made me aware that I should be doing it</italic>’ said another (FG4, P2: health care assistant).</p>
<p>Similarly, across participants many talked of increased confidence in <italic>responding</italic> to parents’ interest in, or questions about, SHS. In this respect, the leaflet produced by the health board was considered to be helpful: not only was it considered to be a good resource to give to parents, it also served as a useful aide-memoire for the professionals in detailing the health risks of SHS for young children and providing tips on how to reduce their exposure.</p>
<p>Proactively raising the topic was another matter altogether: whereas some felt able to do so, others did not, as exemplified in these contrasting accounts:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>Having gone through the training, it gave me the confidence to feel that I had learned more so that I could then go and speak to the families. … the important thing was the training gave you permission to bring the subject up</italic>.’ (FG4, P4: staff nurse)</p>
<p>‘<italic>I think maybe if someone said that they want to give up you could maybe follow on but just now I feel I wouldn’t want to initiate the conversation</italic>.’ (FG1, P4: nursery nurse)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two key (related) factors emerged as influencing practice in this respect: (1) whether participants had concerns that raising the topic might be harmful to their relationship with the families; and (2) having a window of opportunity to raise the topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757913912442271">
<title>Concerns about damaging relationships</title>
<p>Many expressed concerns that proactively raising the topic might harm their relationship with families and thereby undermine their effective engagement on those matters that were their professional priorities or indeed the priorities of the families themselves. These participants were particularly concerned about jeopardising their relationships with those families who were highly vulnerable and had multiple needs such as mental health problems, addictions, or for whom there were child-protection concerns. Rather, they stressed the importance of building and sustaining a good relationship, viewing this as paramount:</p>

<p>‘<italic>I think because families we are going into regularly are quite hard to engage with services and given that I am only going in on a one-off situation most of the time, I perhaps don’t want to alienate them.

<p>As a result, many viewed the existence of an ongoing relationship with the family as <italic>necessary</italic> in order to raise the topic.</p>

<title>Windows of opportunity</title>
<p>The leaflet was frequently identified as providing participants with a soft and non-threatening opening to talk to families about SHS. In fact, in some instances the leaflet was viewed as actually <italic>creating</italic> the opportunity to raise the topic:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>It’s easy to broach it because it is easy to say, oh, I’ve got this leaflet as well, does anyone smoke in the house? … it’s easy really to bring it up because you are going through this list of things that needs to be done so it’s not as if you’re bringing it up and offending people.</italic>’ (FG3, P1: oral health promoter)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Giving out the leaflet was not just an opportunity to raise the topic: some talked of the leaflet providing the only opportunity to raise the topic that they felt was appropriate within their role. Such individuals valued the leaflet as a mechanism to bring up the topic without them requiring to launch into personal questions about whether an individual, other family members or visitors smoked in the house. Several talked of the training together with the leaflet ‘giving them permission’ to broach the topic, and legitimising their role in doing so.</p>
<p>Triangulated data from the follow-up questionnaires reinforced this: giving out the leaflet was not only an activity performed frequently (73% said that since the training they had given out the leaflet at least once and over 40% indicated that they had done so four or more than four times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913912442271">Table 1</xref>)), it was the activity for which there had been the greatest change: using a five-point Likert scale, 36% indicated that they did this ‘far more now’ and 43% indicated that they did this ‘a bit more now’. This compared with 20% reporting no change on this item, 1% indicating that they do this ‘a bit less now’ and 0% responding ‘I do this a lot less now’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1757913912442271">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1757913912442271">
<title>Role appropriateness</title>
<p>Time and time again, participants described and justified their current practices in terms of their professional roles, with some feeling that raising the topic was appropriate to their role while others felt that it was not:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>It’s not really my job to question people on their smoking habit… I think it’s more the health visitors and the staff nurses that would be raising issues like that. I mean I’m more or less just going out to do what I’ve been asked to do and no’ [not] anything else.</italic>’ (I2: health care assistant)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This account highlights another recurring theme: that some professional groups, most notably those performing a health-visiting role, were viewed as being best placed to raise the topic. Conversely, those not working as part of a health-visiting team frequently expressed a reticence and indeed reluctance to raise the topic in a proactive manner, although as reported above, the leaflet did provide an opening or opportunity for some to do so.</p>
<p>We returned to our follow-up questionnaire data to explore whether the apparent difference between the practices of health-visiting team staff and those performing other roles was confirmed. Specifically, we analysed the data on the self-reported frequency of engaging in the various elements of the brief intervention three months after the training: respondents had the option of indicating whether they had engaged in each of these practices ‘never’, ‘one to three times’, ‘four to six times’ or ‘seven times or more’. Performing cross-tabulations (using Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> tests), we compared the responses provided by health visitors, staff nurses and others who described themselves as working as part of a health-visiting team (<italic>n</italic> = 55, 35%) with those provided by all other respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 103, 65%).</p>
<p>These analyses (using χ<sup>2</sup>) indicated that health-visiting team staff had engaged more often in the following practices: asking parents what they know about SHS; talking about the dangers of SHS in the home; discussing parents’/carers’ readiness to change; suggesting ways to reduce children’s exposure in the home; identifying obstacles to reducing exposure in the home; and following up parents/carers about the topic (all were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> = .000). In addition, health-visiting team staff reported that they had given the leaflet to parents more often than the other professionals (<italic>p</italic> = .002) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1757913912442271">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>There are two issues to acknowledge here: firstly those in a health-visiting team were more likely than other participants to engage in the actions intended by the training; and secondly the emerging picture regarding the frequency with which participants overall engaged in the intended practices may have a positive bias, albeit a very minor one, in view of the slight over-representation of health-visiting team staff in the follow-up sweep.</p>
<p>Analyses were also conducted to compare the level of reported <italic>changes</italic> (using a five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘I do this a lot less now’ to ‘I do this a lot more now’) with these findings, suggesting that the practice of those working in health-visiting teams changed (i.e. increased) more than the remaining respondents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913912442271">23</xref></sup> However, for statistical reasons (more than 25% of cells having an expected count less than five), these findings, although mostly having <italic>p</italic> values of .000, are not reported here as they may not be robust.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1757913912442271">
<title>Being effective</title>
<p>Most participants were unable to say whether they had been effective in reducing children’s exposure to SHS in the home. In fact, several were quite pessimistic about the likelihood of having changed families’ behaviour:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>I’m not really going to get an outcome and I’m not going to make an appointment to come back and see them about that because that’s not my role</italic>.’ (FG2, P1: oral health worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was acknowledgement that certain practitioners, notably those in a health-visiting role, are not only better placed to tackle SHS because families will be amenable to discussing the issue with them and receptive to their advice, but also because they are likely to be more <italic>effective</italic> as they have the opportunity to develop good relationships with the families, and to provide sustained (follow-up) support.</p>
<p>However, two further factors emerged as impeding (perceived) effectiveness. First, there was some confusion about what actually constituted an effective exposure-reduction measure in those circumstances where a family was willing to restrict but not eliminate SHS exposure in the home – i.e. some identified their outstanding need for information on third-hand smoke (the residual contamination after a cigarette has been extinguished and SHS has dissipated):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>…So say they only smoke in the kitchen with the window open and they don’t smoke in the main living room and things like this, what happens if the clothes that they are wearing – how does that affect the baby? Should we maybe be telling parents to put on something to smoke in, perhaps like a top they just smoke in, and they take that off…. So that kind of information I would have kinda liked – to be able to tell people, tell parents, knowledgably, well that’s better than smoking all round the house.</italic>’ (FG3, P2: health visitor)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second issue that seemed to undermine effectiveness was a sense of not having the necessary skills to tackle the topic in a comprehensive manner, in particular not feeling equipped to carry out the brief intervention by delivering the full five-point plan promoted by the training programme. Not only could no one describe what the five-point plan actually involved (in fact, many could not remember anything about it), but when prompted about its various steps there was evidence of the training failing to be effective in developing skills across these. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>Do you feel that you have a role in relation to the step – taking action according to readiness to change?</italic>’ (JG)</p>
<p>‘<italic>That’s where my confidence plummets. I really don’t know that I would have the confidence to help someone through that. I can give them the information but if someone turned round and said – right, I’m gonna completely change – I don’t know what I would do from there.</italic>’ (FG2, P2: health visitor)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So while participants came away from the training feeling more knowledgeable and confident to talk about the effects of SHS exposure – a finding that was reinforced by statistically significant differences in reported confidence pre- versus post-training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913912442271">23</xref></sup> there was a lack of evidence of improved skills across key elements of the five-point plan. In fact, it appeared that the training had been <italic>ineffective</italic> in equipping participants with the skills to support families through a process of change.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1757913912442271" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our triangulated findings are consistent with the previously conducted Liverpool evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912442271">13</xref></sup> in-so-far as they indicate that the training led to improved confidence in talking about the topic but that not everyone went on to actually raise the issue in their day-to-day professional lives. Our findings provide some insight into possible reasons for such variation.</p>
<p>In our evaluation, those in a health-visiting role or team were more likely to proactively engage families on the topic of SHS and indeed to engage them on this issue in a sustained manner. This is not to say that others would not or did not benefit from the training: they did. But in view of the intended outcome of the training being children’s reduced exposure, the issue here is which professional groups are most likely to achieve this? On the strength of our findings, health visitors, staff nurses and others in a health-visiting role are ‘good bets’ as they are credible message carriers for this topic, they are well placed to establish an ongoing rapport with families, and they have the opportunity to support families through a <italic>process</italic> of change.</p>
<p>The training (and indeed the NHS GG&amp;C leaflet) is premised on the belief that if exposure to SHS in the home cannot be eradicated, restriction should be encouraged as this represents a step in the right direction. We suggest that this is an assumption that requires testing.</p>
<p>While the training and the leaflet highlight that restricting access in the home does not offer full protection, participants nonetheless felt that they needed clarity on precisely what steps can be taken to reduce harm in those instances where a smoke-free home is not a possibility. We suggest that this indicates a need for the training to provide better clarity on the current evidence base regarding reducing exposure to SHS and to third-hand smoke. Indeed, this is an issue that NHS GG&amp;C is seeking to address.</p>
<p>Not everyone needs to be trained in delivering the full five-point plan: this evaluation has revealed that some professional roles do not easily lend themselves to carrying out the full intervention, in part because there are no opportunities for follow-up. We therefore suggest that the training should be better tailored to the needs of its participants. Those whose roles are only conducive to raising awareness and/or providing information could be offered a course that is more focused (and restricted) to these issues. In view of the difficulties that busy professionals have in ring-fencing time to attend training and, in some cases, the resources required to cover their absence from work, a shorter course may also be a very desirable option.</p>
<p>By contrast, the training’s more ambitious aim to improve the skills of participants to support families through a whole process of change is likely to be appropriate for those whose roles allow them to intervene in a more intensive and sustained manner. Yet this evaluation suggests that the training did not equip participants with the confidence and/or the complement of skills they needed to deliver brief interventions using the full five-point plan. We suggest therefore that this is a limitation that needs to be addressed in the training package and/or its delivery to certain professional groups, perhaps by creating and showing DVDs of professionals using the five-point plan in challenging situations and/or creating more opportunities for participants to practise the techniques within the training session.</p>
<p>While our evaluation indicates positive, although variable, outcomes in professionals’ knowledge and practice, it is important to acknowledge that our follow-up data collection was (only) several months after the training: our evaluation does not tell us whether changed practices are sustained over time – an important consideration in assessing its likely impact. As several people in this evaluation highlighted the competing demands that they face in their jobs, particularly when working with people experiencing multiple disadvantage, this suggests an ongoing need to keep SHS high on their professional agenda and, perhaps, to offer updates and refresher courses as required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1757913912442271" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The Roy Castle training is intended to increase the number of brief interventions carried out by people in contact with parents and, through these, reduce children’s exposure to SHS in the home.</p>
<p>With the increased emphasis on evidence-based practice in public health and demands for accountability on how the public purse is spent, those rolling out this training need to pay due consideration to the question: who is most likely to bring about and/or support the intended changes? Idealised notions that ‘anyone in contact with parents’ should be targeted fail to understand the context in which people work and the opportunities and constraints within these.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding who should be targeted to attend training should be informed by realism not idealism. Our evaluation indicates that those in a health-visiting role or team are one obvious target group. There are likely to be others who should be targeted too because of their position as credible message carriers, their opportunities to develop a relationship with families, their potential to offer sustained support and the level of contribution that they might plausibly make to population-level impact. However, they need clear evidence-based messages to impart: there is little point in them encouraging reduced exposure in the home unless they have the information on how to do so effectively. Information alone is not sufficient though: while our evaluation indicated that the training was extremely well received by participants and was demonstrably effective in increased knowledge about SHS, there was less evidence of its effectiveness in developing skills. Although we cannot conclude whether this reflects a weakness in the content of the training or if it was a weakness in its delivery, it does nevertheless point to an issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Finally, while the focus of this article has largely been on the likelihood of professionals going on to tackle children’s exposure to SHS in the home following their participation in training, this is not to negate the contribution of others in contact with parents. The more people there are using the same terminology, delivering the same message, and singing from the same song sheet, the more consistent and louder the message will be.</p>
