<abstract>
<p>Disc brake calipers are subjected to significant mechanical loading, with design requirements being particularly stringent with respect to the stresses, the deflections, the installation envelope, the noise, vibration, and harshness, and the thermal aspects. Modern finite element (FE) techniques can successfully model caliper assemblies; however, the limitations in predicting the caliper behaviour are primarily related to accurate definition of the boundary conditions, because of complex interactions between the individual components. Traditionally, strain gauges and displacement transducers have been used for measuring the caliper strains and deflections. This approach is expensive and time consuming, requiring installation of numerous transducers and complex data processing, and has limited accuracy.</p>
<p>The application of digital image correlation (DIC) to a commercial vehicle disc brake caliper provided valuable strain results. In comparison with strain gauges, DIC proved to be exceptionally easy to use and enables straightforward comparison of measured strains with FE predicted values. Initial work dealt with the static actuating forces, and excellent correlation between the predicted and the measured strain values was achieved throughout the operating range of clamp forces. The present authors are confident that the addition of the dynamic frictional forces will give even more interesting results, providing insight into the interaction of different components within the brake assembly.</p>

<title>1 Background</title>
<p>Over the years, all types of brake caliper have been substantially developed and finite element (FE) modelling has, in recent times, considerably helped to create new higher-performance designs. However, most published work deals with the design aspects of sliding calipers for passenger cars, such as the papers by Rath and Micke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011423447">1</xref>], and Samie and Sheridan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011423447">2</xref>]. In addition to design considerations, other aspects of the caliper operation have also been researched and reported: thermal aspects by Day <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011423447">3</xref>]; pressure distribution by Tirovic and Day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011423447">4</xref>], Bakar and Ouyang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011423447">5</xref>], and Kim <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011423447">6</xref>]; brake squeal by Bajer <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407011423447">7</xref>]; pad wear by Hohmann and Schiffner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011423447">8</xref>]. There is little information about the influences of the boundary conditions and component interaction on the caliper loading and design optimization. There is even less published work on commercial vehicle disc brakes, which mostly deals with disc thermal aspects, the exception being the papers by Micke <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011423447">9</xref>], and more recently by Thomas and Jackson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011423447">10</xref>], who explained in detail the complexities of commercial vehicle caliper design.</p>
<p>Some interesting results regarding the analysis, boundary conditions, and design optimization of a fixed (opposed hydraulic piston) type of caliper for high-performance cars were presented by Sergent and Tirovic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011423447">11</xref>]. The results indicated that, by carefully considering the loading cases and boundary conditions and by applying optimization procedures, the caliper mass can be considerably reduced. The present authors are following this approach and investigating all parameters and procedures related to caliper structural optimization. The initial results obtained by the present authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011423447">12</xref>] in studying the caliper structural performance were published in 2008, with further work reported here.</p>
<p>Modelling and analysis of commercial vehicle calipers remain considerable challenges for numerous reasons. The definition of the boundary conditions is related to interaction of the components, and in particular to interface friction (on all contact surfaces), thermal aspects (expansion, and change in the material properties), and friction material wear. These aspects, in addition to numerical problems (model instability), are the limiting factors in obtaining accurate and reliable modelling results. It should be noted here that experimental results, even when the measurements are conducted under ‘nominally identical conditions’, may vary owing to the changes in the parameters listed above.</p>
<p>The values of the interface parameters are difficult to obtain ‘in isolation’, and measurements of deflections and stresses on the entire caliper assemblies are necessary in order to validate modelling work. Obviously, such experimental work can only be conducted on existing calipers, and utmost care is necessary in applying the findings to any new designs, regardless of their apparent similarity to existing solutions. Digital image correlation (DIC) provides a practical method to measure deflections and strains in the caliper assemblies for validation of the analysis results.</p>
<p>DIC is a non-contact optical technique that uses one or more cameras to take a series of images during an experiment. These images can then be post-processed to give full-field deformation information, allowing the strain field to be calculated. This method requires a stochastic pattern to be applied on to the surface of the test object. The experimental deformation and strain fields for the region of interest can then be directly used and/or compared with other experimental or modelling results. Publications on the use of DIC in structural analysis are becoming more numerous but the present authors are not aware of any publication related to friction brake analysis. Nevertheless, the work conducted by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011423447">13</xref>], addressing FE model updating from full-field strain data, is considered particularly useful since it combines DIC experimental and FE modelling techniques. Pottier <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011423447">14</xref>] applied the FE updating inverse method to several sample geometries using DIC. The boundary conditions obtained from the measured displacements at the sample border were applied to FE models. Although the paper deals with the fracture occurring in deep-drawing forming, the basic approach in using the boundary conditions from experimental investigations can be suitably applied in brake caliper modelling, in dynamic conditions, when frictional forces are applied in the contact areas. Fagerholt <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407011423447">15</xref>] conducted an experimental and numerical investigation of the fracture behaviour of a cast aluminium alloy. Newly developed software features allowed DIC to be used for detecting and following crack propagation. Numerical calculations included a user-defined material model implemented in an explicit FE code. This is an interesting approach which has potential application in studying brake component fatigue in endurance tests.</p>
<p>Brake calipers are notoriously difficult to model under braking conditions because of complex interaction between the caliper components. As a result, the FE modelling results are highly dependent on the boundary conditions, which can vary considerably. DIC is expected to help to assess the caliper strain fields in these dynamic conditions. It should be noted that the maximum strain (stress) levels are often reached in non-accessible areas. Since DIC can (only) measure strains within the field of view (of two cameras), combination with strain gauge measurements and FE analyses is necessary, at this stage, to obtain full information about strain levels. The effective combination of the three methods is seen as the next important development tool in designing stiffer and lighter calipers.</p>
<p>As a first step in analysing the brake caliper structural behaviour, only actuating forces are applied, without any torque or thermal loading. In this manner, all components will have a ‘nominal’ geometry and the caliper behaviour should be consistent; the measurements are expected to give reliable and repeatable results. No doubt, friction material properties represent the most likely source of uncertainty. To limit potential variations in the results obtained, a new caliper and brand new pads with known friction material compressibility were used.</p>

<p>The principle of caliper and brake operation is schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011423447">Fig. 2</xref>. The disc 1 can rotate but cannot move axially; the fixed (carrier) part 2 of the caliper is bolted on to the axle or an upright or a knuckle; this part 2 ‘houses’ the pads and takes on (reacts with) the frictional forces developed at the pad–disc interface. The carrier 2 also guides the sliding (actuating) part 3 of the caliper. The actuating force is provided by the pneumatic actuator 4, which is attached to the body of the sliding part 3 of the caliper. It should be noted here that ‘infinitely rigid’ mounting of the fixed part 2 of the caliper is considered adequate for modelling the actuating forces at this stage (as tested on the rig) but, owing to the high torques developed when frictional forces are generated on friction surfaces, the carrier 2 is usually modelled with part of the axle, torque plate, or knuckle, as the axle deflection can have a significant effect.</p>

All these forces deform the components and, as a result, considerable frictional forces will also be developed at all contact surfaces where there is relative movement and/or load transfer.

</mml:math></inline-formula> between the sliding part of the caliper and the back plate of the outboard pad 6. Furthermore, deflection of the pad back plates will cause frictional forces in the contacts with the fixed part 2 of the caliper; forces <italic>R*</italic> and <italic>R**</italic> will be generated. There will be further forces (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011423447">Fig. 2</xref>) in the actuating pistons guiding the mechanisms and in the sliding mechanisms (pins) guiding the sliding part 3 within the fixed part 2 of the caliper. It is important to note that all these ‘secondary’ frictional forces will change throughout the brake application, even if the actuating forces remain constant. Heat generated at the disc–pad interface will cause the components to expand, which will alter the relative positions and also influence the local coefficients of friction. The change in the secondary frictional forces is influenced by many other parameters such as the local temperatures, the interface pressures, the friction lining wear, and the conditions of the surfaces (lubricated, painted, or corroded). As a result, these forces can vary substantially in magnitude and direction.</p>
<p>Such complex relationships require careful experimental investigation in order to obtain the data necessary to define the boundary conditions and component interactions required for adequate FE modelling and ultimately model validation–correlation. As the first step in this direction, a study of the static loading conditions has been performed; the pressure is applied in the system but the disc is not rotating.</p>

<title>3 Experimental Investigation</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, DIC was employed for measurement of the experimental strain field. This is a non-contact test procedure, which allows three-dimensional (3D) measurements of the strain and deformation. The DIC method also has the ability to cancel any rigid body motion. The DIC system used in this work was a Dantec Dynamics Q-400. The basic principles are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011423447">Fig. 3</xref>. The two cameras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011423447">Fig. 3(a)</xref>) are directed towards the area of interest of the component tested.</p>

</fig>
<p>Each camera takes the image of the component from a different view angle and both images are captured, logged, and processed by the computer and supporting software. When the component is loaded, it will deform, which will result in changes in both images (as captured by the two cameras), and this is the fundamental principle of DIC operation. It is possible to measure small strains but the surfaces must be prepared and the set-up must be calibrated. The area of interest on the component surface is first painted white and then sprayed with a mist of black paint, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011423447">Fig. 3(b)</xref>. A fine random pattern is necessary for the measurement to give accurate results. Furthermore, the system requires calibration by placing a special calibration plate (with a precisely produced chequered pattern, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011423447">Fig. 3(c)</xref>) in the proximity of the measured area in various positions towards the cameras.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011423447">Figure 4</xref> shows the brake assembly installed on a brake spin rig, with the DIC equipment set-up for taking the measurements. More information about the brake assembly and rig installation has been given by Culierat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407011423447">16</xref>]. The figure also shows numerous thermocouples for investigating the thermal effects. The actuating air pressure is measured using a pressure transducer, and the rod of the pneumatic actuator is strain gauged for measuring the actuating force. A specially adapted displacement transducer was suitably attached to the actuator rod to measure the stroke (displacement) during brake application. For conducting the measurements and data collection, a National Instruments (NI) DAQ-9172 data measurements, control, and logging system, suitable NI modules, and a computer running LabVIEW software were used. All transducers were calibrated and, in order to assess the actuating force losses within the caliper, a special set of pads with built-in force transducers was also used during the set-up process. The entire procedure is well established and the caliper was precisely adjusted prior to mounting on the spin rig, with the set-up shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011423447">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted as follows. First, images of the caliper (area of interest) were taken when no air pressure (actuating force) was applied. This corresponds to the zero-strain state. Then, air pressure was applied in 1 bar increments, up to 6 bar, and subsequently decreased also in 1 bar increments to 0 bar. Images were taken for each step.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011423447">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the principal strain contour and also a selected point (within the area of interest) on the caliper for which the full history plot (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011423447">Fig. 7(b)</xref>) is presented for all 12 steps. Each step represents a 1 bar increase and a subsequent decrease in pressure in the pneumatic actuator. It was possible to adjust the air pressure using a closed-loop system; however, it was found that this was not necessary since the pressure values were stable throughout each step (lasting approximately 1 min). The pressure was therefore changed using a manual control valve (adjustable visually to within +0.05 bar). The actual pressure values were measured using a pressure transducer and, in order to measure the resulting actuating force accurately, the pneumatic actuator rod was suitably strain gauged.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using DIC, it was possible to measure the strain over a relatively large area, and also to monitor the strain change during time (loading and offloading), i.e. to create a history plot. DIC enables rigid body motions to be identified and isolated.</p>
<p>Uncertainty analysis of the entire experimental process is a complex task, considering the variables measured and the equipment used. For measurements of the caliper force–displacement relationships, which also include the actuating air pressure, a wealth of experience has been gained over the years. This enables accurate prediction of uncertainties and detailed insight into the caliper amplification ratio, caliper and pad deflections, friction losses, and hysteresis within the actuating mechanism. For the measurements presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011423447">Figs 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011423447">7</xref>), of particular interest are the uncertainties related to DIC measurements. From the information provided by the system supplier Dantec Dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011423447">17</xref>], the accuracy of DIC analysis is strongly linked to the resolution and quality of images. More specifically, the Dantec Technical Note for the system used (Q-400) states that corresponding data uncertainties, originating from different sources, can be grouped into two categories: <italic>correlation errors</italic> and <italic>3D reconstruction errors</italic>.</p>
<p>Correlation errors can be divided into <italic>statistical</italic> and <italic>systematic</italic> errors. Statistical errors primarily result from the limited number of pixels and corresponding grey values in each facet. These errors decrease with increasing square root of the number of facet pixels. Different illumination conditions for the two cameras, the image contrast and size of the speckle pattern on the specimen surface, and the statistical noise of the grey values all contribute further to the statistical errors. Systematic errors are introduced by the subpixel effects due to the discretization of the real speckle pattern by the charge-coupled device pixels and potentially by non-linear distortion of the facets.</p>
<p>3D reconstruction errors are related to the uncertainties in the calibration parameters, which lead to errors when reconstructing the 3D coordinates from correlated facets of the two cameras. Calibration errors appear in a systematic manner as a function of the facet positions in the camera frames, causing local distortions of the reconstructed 3D space.</p>
<p>Detailed uncertainty analysis is very complex but typically, for full-field displacement and strain measurements on a specimen’s surface, the displacement errors are of the order of less than 0.02 pixels, and the strain errors are limited to 0.05 m Strain, when using a lens with 50 mm focal length. If the displacements are small (less than 50 pixels), the errors scale linearly. The relative displacement errors are of the order of 0.01–0.05 per cent, and the strain errors typically are 1–5 <inline-formula id="inline-formula15-0954407011423447">

<p>Based on the above consideration, the accuracy of DIC analysis is strongly linked to the resolution and quality of the images. The DIC measurements were conducted in a relatively small caliper area, within the middle ranges of the field of view of the camera (lens), the distance, and the angle of view, with good light conditions, a suitable camera focal length and resolution (1392 × 1040 pixels), and successful repetitive calibration. The estimated errors are considered to be within <inline-formula id="inline-formula16-0954407011423447">

<title>4 Finite Element Analysis</title>
<p>A FE model of the brake assembly was created on the basis of the CAD model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011423447">Fig. 1</xref>. More details about the FE meshing and modelling have been given by Robinet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407011423447">18</xref>]. The caliper geometry is not quite symmetrical primarily owing to the long and short guide sleeve and to the manual adjuster; however, for the considered static load case and concentrating on the area of interest away from variations between the geometries of the two caliper ‘ends’, it is considered sufficient to model only one half of the caliper. Obviously, the experimental result will be used to validate the assumptions made. As mentioned earlier, introduction of the frictional forces will require modelling of the entire caliper and even parts of the axle or torque plate or knuckle in order to take into consideration the actual boundary conditions during braking. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">Figures 8(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">(b)</xref> show the entire FE model and the details of the contact definition respectively. The FE assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">Fig. 8</xref>) consists of the brake disc, the fixed and sliding parts of the caliper, and the pads (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011423447">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011423447">2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The mesh was created and FE analyses conducted using the ABAQUS software package. Several FE models were created, varying the mesh type, complexity, and contact definition between the caliper components. The model shown has been established as a reliable and effective tool in predicting the caliper behaviour in static loading conditions. Linear hexahedral elements have been used for all contacting parts for better accuracy. However, for more complex geometries, linear tetrahedral elements were necessary. The disc (made from grey cast iron) was meshed using 14 188 hexahedral elements. The fixed part of the caliper (made in spheroidal graphite (SG) cast iron) consists of 14 596 tetrahedral elements and 15 hexahedral elements. The sliding part of the caliper, also made of SG iron, was modelled using 346 hexahedral elements and 117 824 tetrahedral elements. Finally, each pad was meshed with 7130 hexahedral elements, with steel for the back plates and composite organic friction material.</p>
<p>The contact between the pad faces and the disc as well as the contact between the back plate of the outboard pad and the caliper were defined as surface-to-surface contact, with a ‘frictionless’ tangential behaviour and ‘hard’ normal behaviour, meaning no penetration of nodes between surfaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">Figure 8(b)</xref> highlights the contact areas.</p>
<p>Since the assembly was considered symmetrical, appropriate boundary conditions (zero displacement through the plane of symmetry) were specified for all nodes in the symmetry plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">Fig. 8</xref>). To ensure model stability and robustness of the simulations, several approaches were tried for introducing the actuation forces. The most appropriate solution was found to be the application of the actuating forces on actuating pistons (<inline-formula id="inline-formula17-0954407011423447">

However, rather than allowing the sliding part of the caliper (component 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011423447">Fig. 2</xref>) to move, this caliper part was fixed (by specifying zero displacement) at the actuator attachment area, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011423447">Fig. 8(b)</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011423447">Fig. 2</xref>).

<title>5 Comparison of Results</title>
<p>The strain results obtained from the FE analyses are compared with the DIC experimental results for two cases. First, a node was selected in the high-stress area of the sliding part of the caliper, in a position identical with the point selected for DIC data processing, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011423447">Fig. 7</xref>. The DIC strain measurement results (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011423447">Fig. 7</xref>) are compared with FE predictions for a range of actuating forces, corresponding to pneumatic pressures from 1 bar to 6 bar, in 1 bar increments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407011423447">Figure 10</xref> shows the maximum principal strain at the selected point for the pressure range used (0–6 bar). The FE results show a linear change in the strain with the actuating pressure, with the DIC values following closely. It can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407011423447">Fig. 10</xref>) that the DIC measurements are similar to the FE predictions except for the values at an actuating air pressure of 2 bar, which showed some differences, and the values at an actuating pressure of 5 bar, which demonstrated more pronounced differences and deviation from the linear trend. It should be noted here that the experimental (DIC) values can be affected by numerous influences (the friction in the guiding pins, the temperature, etc.) despite the fact that the measurements being conducted ensure a high accuracy of the actuating force in a controlled laboratory environment within a short period of time. The average difference between the strains found by the FE results and the DIC results is only 0.045 mm/m (6.5 per cent difference) with a maximum difference of 0.1 mm/m at a pneumatic actuating pressure of 5 bar.</p>

</fig>
<p>A similar comparison was carried out for a sustained pressure of 6 bar across a geometrical line on the caliper. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011423447">Figure 11(a)</xref> shows the area of interest and the line selected for comparing the DIC results with the FE results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011423447">Figure 11(b)</xref> shows the DIC strain contour plot and the selected line. The strains were extracted on each node along that line. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011423447">Figure 11(c)</xref> shows the measured (DIC) and the calculated (FE) maximal principal strains along the selected line (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011423447">Fig. 11(a)</xref>, with zero distance corresponding to the left end, i.e. the proximity of the caliper edge). The results are very similar, with FE results showing some ‘scatter’ because the actual, nodal strain results were used without any averaging. The maximum difference is only 0.07 mm/m, which is encouraging in building the necessary confidence in both the theoretical method and the experimental method. The maximum strain along the selected line was about 1.4 mm/m (both calculated and measured). The maximum principal predicted strain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011423447">Fig. 9(b)</xref>, is 1.857 mm/m (i.e. 1.857 × 10<sup>–3</sup>). Considering that Young’s modulus for the SG iron is 170 GPa, the maximum stress is just over 300 MPa. This is well within acceptable limits but, for the final strain (and stress) assessment of the caliper, it is necessary to analyse also the influence of the frictional forces and the distribution of the service loads.</p>

<title>6 Conclusions</title>
<p>The use of FE modelling and DIC for assessing the strain levels of a commercial vehicle caliper proved successful. The results are almost identical, with only minor differences across the large, most stressed area of the caliper. DIC proved to be easy to use and the comparison of the strain values with the FE results is straightforward, requiring little time. Initial investment in DIC equipment is high but the ease and speed of use at almost no additional costs, combined with the ability to investigate large caliper areas, make the technology cost effective. The only limitation in using DIC is related to the ability to obtain a clear view of the area of interest by the two cameras.</p>
<p>The study presented here concentrates on the actuating forces, and further work in strain assessment is required, in order to include the frictional forces. This will give better insight into caliper loading conditions but ultimately, to simulate true service duties, pad wear aspects would also need to be considered.</p>
<p>The results obtained so far are building confidence in FE analyses and present a good base for further modelling work and design optimization. The use of DIC is seen as a necessary and effective way to define interactions between brake assembly components. These studies are vital in providing improved boundary conditions for defining and loading brake components in numerical modelling analysis for existing calipers and, more importantly, for the synthesis of novel optimized caliper solutions. DIC’s further crucial role is in validating these designs.</p>
