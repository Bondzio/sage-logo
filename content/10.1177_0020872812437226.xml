<p>This article analyzes the controversial relationship between theory and practice in social work and its positivist divorce and forced unity which reduces theory to an ‘instrumental-operational’ knowledge. The objective of this article is to contribute towards overcoming the positivistic rationality approach toward the theory and practice relationship. Based on a critical perspective, the author presents proposals to overcome some limitations of the conservative theory and practice approach.</p>

<title>I. An introduction to Latin American developmentalism, within the process of reconceptualization of Social Work</title>
<p>The transition towards a capitalist system in Latin America between the 1930s and 1970s, unlike the European and the North American experience, featured two characteristics that generated an oligarchic and dependent capitalism. First, there was a lack of rupture with the oligarchic base in a bourgeois revolutionary process. Second, the principal countries were kept in a relationship of dependence in the periphery of the capitalist system that was still based on traditional latifundia and a colonial system of exploitation of raw materials and importation of industrialized products, as well as the exploitation of labor, including slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812437226">Furtado, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812437226">Prado, 1994</xref>). Thus, Latin American capitalism, oligarchic and dependent, was initially constituted as a ‘de-industrialized’ system for extraction and exporting of raw materials and importing and consumption of industrialized products from ‘core’ countries.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this situation, industrial development took place in Latin America from the third decade of the 20th century, but became subordinated to the expansionist international capital interests. Peripheral Latin American countries ceased to be mere traditional colonies and became industrial processors of commodities. The great international capitalism required cheap production and more consumption. Latin American countries could produce at lower costs (cheaper labour and abundant natural resources) and expand their consumer markets.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, it was necessary to promote an economic and social process that transformed Latin American countries (former colonies) into industrialized and consumer nations. The great capitalist need to expand the production and consumption capacity of Latin America and the subsequent social pressures, struggles and popular movements gave birth to the ‘Latin American developmental’ process known as ‘Developmentalism’. The formation of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Alliance for Progress are examples of institutions and programs for the promotion of development from the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>To accelerate local and national production, Latin American governments started stimulating domestic consumption through protectionist mechanisms, increasing domestic demand and limiting imports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437226">Furtado, 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437226">2001</xref>). Within this context of ‘Developmentalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812437226">Cueva, 1990</xref>) and the struggles of social movements in Latin America, the so-called ‘Reconceptualization Movement’ was born and expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. This professional movement represented an internal process of critical reflection that was clearly in tune with its time, namely, the expansion of social and popular movements and organizations, Latin American capitalist development, the Cold War and the ‘golden age’ of global capitalism of the post-war period. ‘Reconceptualization’ was a movement that introduced into the social sciences a kind of Marxism that questioned the social role of the state, social policy and social work. It was a heterogeneous professional movement – differences that were reflected in its ideological and political stands, the social origins of the main protagonists, in its national and regional particularities and in its political and theoretical standpoints – but its main goal was to break with the positivism and traditionalism of the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812437226">Alayon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812437226">Ander-Egg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812437226">Netto, 1981</xref>). It is this contextual framework that will guide this discussion.</p>

<sec id="section2-0020872812437226">
<title>2. The foundational rationality of social work</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812437226">Marx and Engels (1993)</xref> noted that the hegemony of the capitalist class (particularly in the era of monopolies) is maintained not just through <italic>coercion</italic>, but also requires a certain degree of <italic>general acceptance</italic>, and <italic>consensus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812437226">Gramsci, 1985</xref>). Thus bourgeois ideology, values and norms must be incorporated by the majority of the population as ‘official culture’ in order to guarantee the bourgeoisie class hegemony.</p>
<p>This is how positivism presents itself as the ‘hegemonic rationality of the ‘‘official culture’’’ – a way to see and produce reality – in the Western world, given its functionality within the bourgeois order. This form of rationality is based on: a) segmentation of reality in autonomous spheres such as economic, political, social, cultural, etc.; and b) separation between knowledge and action, knowing and doing, theory and practice (Montaño, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Monano, 2000</xref>: 12; Netto, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>Therefore the kind of knowledge produced by this notion of ‘naturalized’ (i.e. not conceived as a result of historical action human) society must be <italic>fragmentary</italic> and <italic>phenomenal</italic>. Through this notion a knowledge is born and developed in ‘particular social sciences’. These disciplines must also share among themselves the <italic>knowledge</italic> of ‘reality bites’ and the ‘corrective’ <italic>intervention</italic> (manipulation) of variables of this fragmented reality (or ‘realities’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812437226">Lukács, 1992</xref>: 132).</p>
<p>Based on this positivist double segmentation, the social work profession developed as part of a <italic>socio-psychological field</italic> mainly geared toward <italic>action, practice and immediate intervention</italic>. Therefore, social work has its origins in the historical context of consolidation of monopolistic capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437226">Iamamoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437226">Netto, 1997</xref>; Montaño, 1998) and in its positivistic perspective and rationality (that segment and manipulate aspects of reality) (Netto, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437226">Iamamoto, 1997</xref>). Netto argues that any perspective that pretends to incorporate one theory or one method of social work is linked to ‘the positivist conception that has nothing to do with Comte, but is based on the <italic>functionalist, structural functionalist or structuralism</italic> conception … where it is assumed that it is possible to separate a social phenomenon in parts to develop abstractions, to study it in isolation and then reincorporate it into the full social reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>: 73). Therefore, the search for <italic>specialization</italic> in social work starts from a perspective of <italic>reduction and segmentation</italic> of reality when exploring ‘social questions’ or ‘problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437226">Iamamoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437226">Netto, 1997</xref>) and a compartmentalized diversification of the studies and responses to these particular problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812437226">Netto, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, the segmented knowledge of reality influences the kind of responses and leads to partial and segmented changes. ‘Social questions’ based on this framework contribute to partial and compartmentalized instruments, namely <italic>segmented and sectorial social policies</italic>.</p>
<p>We can conclude that both the origin and development of social work are closely interwoven within this formal rationality and reductionist notion of reality which assumes as ‘natural’ the compartmentalization of disciplines and professions; the divorce between knowledge and action; the segmentation of responses to seemingly ‘independent’ micro-realities that belong to a global reality deemed incomprehensible to the professionals and that set rigid boundaries among the different professions that cannot be crossed except via inter-disciplinary pretensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020872812437226">
<title>3. The unsuccessful attempt to overcome the ‘divorce’ between theory and practice in reconceptualized social work</title>
<p>This segmentation (the positivistic divorce of theory/practice) is characterized by the reproduction of professional separation, between the ‘social scientist’ (sociologist, economist, etc.) and the one who acts, the ‘technician’, the field professional (social worker, educator, etc.) who are seen as ‘agents of practice’.</p>
<p>It was mainly from the Latin America reconceptualization that attempts were made to overcome such fragmentation, but in the end, this segmentation was renewed. However, it is characterized now by the incorporation of knowledge production in professional practice, although identifying the supposed ‘specific theory’ of social work as ‘knowing to act’ (as opposed to the ‘pure theory’ of ‘scientists’) where the <italic>specific theory</italic> (‘of social work’) is reduced to the mere <italic>systematization of practice</italic> or a <italic>social diagnosis</italic>, that is, an instrumental/situational knowledge for action (Montaño, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812437226">Montaño, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first case (of positive separation between science and technical knowledge), social investigation and the theoretical elaboration of the ‘specific’ activity of social work are clearly excluded; this would be considered a ‘practice’ profession while research would be merely for ‘scientists’. In the second case (where ‘pure’ theory is separated from ‘theory for action’), research is incorporated into the methodological process of the professional intervention of social work, but reduced to just systematization and/or diagnosis; as if <italic>only</italic> the immediate, direct reaction between knowing and acting, knowing <italic>to</italic> act, would make sense. Thus, this approach keeps the separation between theory and practice, separation now renewed as ‘pure theory’ and ‘applied theory’. Critical theoretical knowledge is deprived of the possibilities of intervention; the intervening practical action is cut off from any critical possibility of knowledge. The <italic>praxis</italic> is reduced to everyday immediate practice; <italic>social theory</italic> is wasted in abstractions and the ‘<italic>specific theory</italic>’ of social work is reduced to operational knowledge. Positivist segmentation between knowledge and action is thus reproduced in brand new clothing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872812437226">
<title>4. A proposal to break with the positivist rationality: Theoretical conceptualization and critical practice in social work</title>
<p>This section will try to develop a few points for overcoming the positivist rationality in the production of knowledge and professional practice. It will also clarify some important concepts used in disciplinary debates. First, it is important to distinguish between <italic>productions</italic> of <italic>use</italic> of scientific (theoretical) knowledge. The ‘use’ of accumulated theoretical knowledge is a necessary and fundamental part of professional practice of any type. Whether in academic, political-institutional or interventional work, every professional should <italic>make use</italic> of theoretical knowledge; without it, the professional would develop an intuitive voluntaristic mode of work, based on common sense. However, the ‘production’ of theoretical knowledge should not necessarily be present in every professional activity. Theoretical knowledge can be used for professional practices without elaborating it or producing any new theories – this does not diminish the rigor of such action. In certain contexts, the social worker does not need (and/or does not have the opportunity) to elaborate, create or produce new theoretical knowledge. On the contrary, by making use of the accumulated theoretical knowledge, situational diagnosis and other pieces of information, he or she can develop a conscious, scientifically oriented intervention without (necessarily) elaborating a single original theoretical proposal.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to recognize the existence of different types of ‘knowledge’: instrumental, operational, situational, religious, artistic, intuitive, common sense or ‘popular’ knowledge. <italic>Theoretical knowledge</italic> is just one form of knowledge, and therefore knowledge (in general) cannot be identified as ‘theoretical knowledge’ or ‘theory’ (in particular). However, this is usually the case. Often ‘theoretical knowledge’ is identified as rationalization, perception, reflection on reality, and finally, in turn, as ‘the specific theory’ of the profession as if everything we ‘think’ constitutes a ‘theoretical moment’ and therefore a ‘theory’. In this manner, in an intervention process it is essential in reality to ‘use’ <italic>theoretical knowledge</italic> to elaborate and produce situational (diagnosis), instrumental and operational knowledge (absolutely necessary for programming, strategy planning and action techniques), the ‘production’ of <italic>theoretical knowledge</italic> not being necessary or essential (and in many cases not possible). In contrast, in investigative activities (scientific or academic) it is often necessary to ‘use’ <italic>empirical knowledge</italic> (i.e. practice systematization) that is not necessarily ‘elaborated’ by the same professional.</p>
<p>Third, we understand that it is also necessary to characterize the existing differences (distinct mediations, opportunities, conditions, relations) between <italic>theoretical activity</italic> and <italic>direct practice</italic> (whether political or the practical-institutional intervention). To transfer a modality specific to scientific production into direct practice is both reckless and a huge mistake. On one hand, <italic>political action</italic> requires alliances, agreements and negotiations that depend on the correlation of forces, opportunities and limits, and therefore, on tactics and strategies, on taking ‘a step forward and two steps back’, the classic formulation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812437226">Lenin (1984)</xref>. On the other hand, <italic>institutional professional intervention</italic> (or ‘field practice’) also presents different mediations of theoretical production: specific institutional objectives, contractual employment relations, institutional hierarchies, correlation of forces and alliances with other institutional actors, as well as the role of users, the existence (or not) of sufficient resources, the type of social policies developed by the institution where the professional works, the demands of the contracting parties and user demands (or needs), urgency level of these demands, etc. It is not the same to ‘think’ the reality (even when a theoretical, scientific knowledge is produced) as to ‘act’ upon it; therefore it cannot be assumed that the result of <italic>scientific elaboration</italic> (theory, or theoretical knowledge) will be identical to the product of <italic>practical action</italic> (be it political practice or professional intervention).</p>
<p>We can now move to discuss the need to break with positivist limitations, renewed today under different clothing (neo-positivism, functionalism, system theory or even postmodernism). The production of knowledge in social work when underpinned by positivist rationality is fragmented and its practice tends to be too. However, theoretical knowledge (particularly in social work), to overcome the positivist double segmentation can theoretically appropriate a non-fragmented reality in particular knowledge. For the professional to overcome this limited rationality either in theory or practice it is indispensable to consider the following:</p>
<sec id="section5-0020872812437226">
<title>1. Break away from any partial perspective of reality, such as in the positivist rationality, or even (at present) postmodern thought</title>
<p>These particular perspectives (positivist, postmodern) lead, as already mentioned, to the compartmentalization and pulverization of fields of knowledge (economic, sociological, political, anthropological), the separation of science and technology (which means for social work a functional subordination, distancing from the global reality, loss of critical perspectives and failure to respond substantively to the complex realities). In fact, the <italic>perspective to adopt</italic> by the professional (in knowledge and intervention) in order to have a knowledge and critical practice must be <italic>given by the object itself</italic> (to be known and/or intervention), considered as a <italic>totality</italic>, which tries to grasp the reality in its complexity (and all its economic, social, political, cultural, macro- and micro-dimensions), not fragmented or artificially dividing the object into different ‘perspectives’, in various sub-areas, or even at different levels of social reality. Therefore, we gain a perspective from the object defined, a posteriori, and not from a particular profession, a priori.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020872812437226">
<title>2. To overcome the demand for an immediate articulation between theory and practice</title>
<p>Practice is often perceived as the starting point of theory. In fact, it is the ‘processes prior and necessary to theoretical reflection’ (Netto, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>: 79) which constitute a <italic>starting point of knowledge</italic>. It is not the systematization of (individual, personal, local and immediate) practice, but the ‘<italic>systematization of data</italic>’ (quantitative and qualitative that are not necessarily extracted from the researcher’s practice). These data can be empirical – originating in practice – or theoretical and statistical – originating in accumulated knowledge. Thinking of practice (specific, singular) as a (direct, immediate) source of theory prevents us from ‘dislocating’ ourselves from the factual, the singular and overcoming it. In this case, theory is reduced and subordinated to practice; theory is then ‘pragmatized’. It proposes <italic>a pragmatic conception of theory</italic>.</p>
<p>This approach presumes ‘theoretical knowledge’ as reduced to an instrumental understanding and/or situation diagnosis. Thus, it treats theory as a direct derivation of localized practice which implies falling into pragmatism and utilitarianism. It assumes that only what is applicable and useful to that singular practice is real. It also views practice (specific and singular) as a direct objective of theory that eliminates any theory or research that does not have a direct intention in imminent, immediate practice. It finally views practice (specific and singular) as a criterion of truth that would imply the inexistence of any theory that is not at least an ‘instrumental knowledge’, empirically applicable.</p>
<p>Really, the practice is not the source and goal (immediate) of the theory, in a pragmatic or utilitarian relationship. Practice is the fundation, purpose and criterion of truth of the theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812437226">Sánchez Vázquez, 1990</xref>: 233-4). But not this “practice” and that “theory” specific, individual, unique, but the historical social practice (not individual practice, or professional, but human-generic practice) and theory (social). The theory/practice relationship is neither a ‘marriage’ (direct and immediate relationship) nor a ‘divorce’ (disarticulation), but a ‘free union’ (related through different mediations). The theory and practice relationship is not direct and immediate. We must overcome the positivistic divorce between theory and practice, but not by means of forced marriage matching theory to practice or systematization of the practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020872812437226">
<title>3. Breaking away from the rigid, methodologistic and a prioristic models</title>
<p>Not every social worker has to produce theoretical (or scientific) knowledge, particularly when they work on the front line but social workers have to make use of knowledge based on a particular theoretical-methodological perspective. Similarly, not every professional should extract the necessary data for their theoretical reflections from <italic>their</italic> singular and immediate practice. Likewise, not every professional has to fully comply with a supposed methodological guideline (nor should it be pre-established) to be able to perform professionally. Heterogeneity of responsibilities, integration of different tasks and cooperation, can and must take place from within the profession.</p>
<p>Situational knowledge (to intervene) is no less important than theoretical knowledge and vice versa. Each of them has its own functions and productive space and each respond to different needs. The <italic>production</italic> of theoretical (scientific) knowledge is almost impossible or unnecessary for professional practice. The <italic>incorporation of theory</italic> is fundamental in direct practice as an explanation of social processes and the <italic>elaboration of situational knowledge</italic> (<italic>situational diagnosis and the intervention techniques</italic>) (Montaño, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437226">Borgianni and Montaño, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020872812437226">
<title>4. Overcoming the scope of interpretations of reality that is reduced to micro-local experience</title>
<p>Derived from a strong conservatism as well as from current postmodern thinking, professional practice incorporates a strong appeal to <italic>singular and localized micro-experiences</italic> when inserted mainly in local spaces. There is a tendency to ignore social structure, class relations or universal questions and some considerations to local community spaces, interpersonal relations and singular questions are considered.</p>
<sec id="section9-0020872812437226">
<title>The scope of intervention is identified to the scope of analysis</title>
<p>The space of direct intervention (local, micro, individual) of the professional also determines and limits the scope of social analysis. If the professional intervenes purely at a local level, he or she can generate ‘changes’ but is unable to transform the social structure or the complex wider social realities. Therefore it may seem that the study and consideration of these realities would be unnecessary. Traditional professionals believe that the ‘macro-theoretical’ knowledge incorporated in the academy is unnecessary and far from the ‘micro’ realities where frontline professionals carry out their work. Additionally, it creates the (Marxist) idea that ‘critical theory’ is good for studying macro social structures, but to understand and intervene in micro realities where the social worker is inserted, it then has to be replaced by ‘operational theories’ (such as phenomenology and systems theory).</p>
<p>Thus, it is important to first <italic>understand different realities</italic>, regardless of how ‘micro’, local or singular they may be, as phenomena within more complex and universal social structures and circumstances that to some extent may determine, or be determined by, these realities. Besides making the connection between local reality and macro-social structure and dynamics more explicit, it becomes necessary to fully understand the knowledge of the local context of existing mediations and particularities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020872812437226">
<title>The disregard of the profession’s social function in the system and its identification with immediate actions and tasks</title>
<p>If social work cannot ‘transform’ the macro-structural determinants with its practice, it cannot eliminate exploitation and the contradictions between capital and work. Therefore, from traditional and conservative perspectives as well as postmodern, we should disregard the critical analysis of the profession’s role in such a structure. Some professionals seem to assert that if social work does not determine the structure, then the latter would not determine social work. This amounts to something like: ‘if the profession cannot alter macro-reality, we should not worry about it’. Social work would not have a role in social structure then; instead it would have several localized roles, reduced to their own everyday functions, tasks and activities. For these authors the everyday activities of professionals would determine their social function.</p>
<p>However, without expecting that social worker intervention could alter macro-structural relations, it is in the space between classes, between class interests and social sectors that the professional fits (not as a mediator of course), in an ethical-political role. The fact that professional intervention takes place around manifestations of the ‘social issue’ question (unemployment, malnutrition, domestic violence, hunger, lack of access to certain commodities or services) in a local environment and without being able to alter its fundamentals (exploitation, class struggle) does not deny that social work has <italic>a role in social structure</italic> (mainly functional in the reproduction of the system and the status-quo, and contradictorily, the eventual reinforcement/weakening of social rights and achievements).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0020872812437226">
<title>5. To overcome the reduction of professional responses to emergencies and immediate situations and the rejection of long-term strategies and projects</title>
<p>As mentioned above, traditional and postmodern conservative social work rejects all forms of knowledge of the universe including medium- and long-term actions, emphasizing the local and the immediate.</p>
<sec id="section12-0020872812437226">
<title>The long-term scope discarded for short-term demands</title>
<p>If we begin from the idea that the reality that the social worker is interested in is the reality that is close to his or her own direct professional practice limiting his or her ability to engage with long-term practices. Micro-practices emphasizing ‘local power’, ‘empowerment’ or ‘particular identities’ are privileged at the expense of universal theories such as Marxism which emphasize structural social aspects – exploitation, domination, class struggle.</p>
<p>Emergency and immediate demands seem to become social worker priorities. The reproduction of this emergency demand/immediate response relationship leads the professional and the profession as a whole to a pragmatic logic, moved by ‘pre-occupation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812437226">Kosik, 1989</xref>: 63). Namely, the professional responds to singular and immediate needs within a given, apparently unchanging, naturalized, perpetuated world. He or she has a merely reproductive practice, without creating anything new and therefore without transforming it.</p>
<p>Therefore, traditional social workers barely operate; they manipulate the instruments of practice, without knowing how the structures and their dynamics operate, without understanding the reality beyond the immediate phenomena and pseudo-concrete reality. Traditional social workers have an instrumental, operative, non-critical and non-foundational knowledge. Traditional social workers are the ones that are instrumentalized, manipulated and reorganized to become in charge of reproducing the system which they do not know, can be taken for granted and structurally unchanging.</p>
<p>Traditional or postmodern social workers (and the implicit conservative project) tend to become absorbed in ‘occupying’ themselves in activities within a taken-for-granted and perceived unchanging system. They tend to ‘preoccupy’ and <italic>act without criticism</italic>. Here lies a duality of that conservatism: emphasis on the <italic>local, singular and the immediate</italic>, at the expense of a long-term, universal and mediate scope of practices. The conservatism assumes here a new <italic>postmodern</italic> clothing.</p>
<p>It is essential to articulate the short- and long-term goals, those that are achievable ‘now’ and those with longer-reach objectives, including those practices that take place in ‘social emergency’ spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812437226">Mészáros, 2003</xref>: 122):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>to emphasize the importance of a long term perspective does not mean that we ignore the ‘here and now’. On the contrary, the reason why we should take interests in a horizon much broader than the usual is so that we can realistically conceptualize a transition towards a different social order based on present determinations. The long term perspective is necessary because the real goal of transformation can only be established within such horizons [. . .] Persons that advocate for a great structural change should always be aware of the limitations they will have to face. At the same time, they should be ready to stop the weight of such limitations from freezing and becoming a paralyzing force.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore it is important to include in professional practices approaches that break the immediate, utilitarian, relationship between fact/perception/response and allow the understanding of everyday life as a particular instance that articulates singular situations with social totality.</p>

<title>6. To view social work, social policies, the state and civil society, as well as singular phenomena in practice facing the field, from social dynamics, according to a perspective of totality</title>
<p>We should look for the foundations of the profession and social meanings of social policy practices. We must understand social policies as historically determined instruments of social intervention, under state responsibility. Likewise, we need to think of the state and civil society as spheres that are produced and conditioned by social dynamics, mediated by class struggles and relations of capitalist production, not as autonomous spheres. Thus, we should refer to the critique of political economy as a means to study social reality in monopolistic capitalism under the influence of financial capital and the neoliberal project in our dependent countries.</p>

<title>Politicizing professional practice in the different areas of action</title>
<p><italic>Politicizing professional practice</italic> does not only mean to ‘align’ with any political party (‘partidarization’) or militant groups as is attributed to the professional role in many cases, but also to attempt to overcome ‘depoliticization’, apathy or resigned attitudes that feature so strongly in the actions of social workers. Considering the previous discussion, this politicization of professional practices comprises four aspects.</p>
<p>First, politicizing professional practices means to unveil, explicitly acknowledge and discover the interest contradictions and tensions (manifest or latent, explicit or implicit) that affect the subjects/actors in realities where the professionals intervene. To explicitly acknowledge these contradictions is a fundamental task of a professional practice committed to ethical-political practice in the most underprivileged populations. The professional social worker working in the context of interest-based contradictions between classes and social sectors should not become a conflict ‘mediator’. More than mediating in conflicts, the social worker should <italic>explicitly state</italic> what are the existing contradictory interests, so that all players can face them and solve the problems they present depending on the specific correlation of forces.</p>
<p>Second, politicizing professional practice means to explicitly acknowledge the difference of interests (transformed in different demands to the professional) between the contracting institution of the social worker (generally directly or indirectly associated with capital) and the subjects in care of the actions performed by the professional. We consider the existence of different interests and objectives between institution and users, and therefore of different demands from the social work professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812437226">Montaño, 2007</xref>). Social policies are not mediations between the in-need subject and the social work professional, but mediations between those subjects and the institutions that respond to those needs/demands under which the social work professional falls; or indirectly, mediations between social classes.</p>
<p>Third, politicizing professional practice means to develop the ability to establish connections between ‘micro’ (singular) reality where the professional intervenes and ‘macro’ (social structure and dynamic) reality under which he falls, partially conditioning and determining it; between the short, medium and long reach of professional actions; the clear comprehension of the universal categories of surplus value, exploitation, imperialism, segregation, commodities, labour value, class antagonism, inequality, poverty, etc., and how they influence the reality in which the professional is acting.</p>
<p>Finally, politicizing professional practice provides clear, explicit comprehension of the ultimate diversity of interests, expectations, objectives and concepts of the social work professional in relation to the institution where he or she works. If it is true that, by overcoming voluntarianism or messianism, the options, wills and concepts of the professional do not determine the social meaning of his practice (as they are much stronger than the historical-social conditions) then it is true, by overcoming a fatalist view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437226">Iamamoto, 1997</xref>), that they can be absolutely irrelevant. The professional and his or her options, orientations, concepts and theoretical-methodological perspectives, even if not entirely determined, still provide a ‘profile’ to professional practice: how the professional will position himself in front of the other institutional actors and the subjects involved in his professional actions, how he or she conceives poverty, the relationship between the actors in question, what he or she intends to do with his actions in the short, medium and long terms, etc. Politicizing professional practice (in the short term) then means, in this case, to guide the actions towards a horizon (in the long term) of human emancipation, of a society without exploitation, without social inequality, discrimination, of full freedom, democracy and social justice; and in this sense (medium term) to direct professional actions towards the defense of universal social policies, that constitute the rights of the citizenry and the duty of the state towards the consolidation and expansion of civil, political, social and economic rights, labour rights, gender and race equality.</p>
