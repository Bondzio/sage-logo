<p>What happens when territorially bounded nation states of a liberal democratic fashion meet increasingly mobile individuals who want to travel, study, work, retire and live in countries in which they were not born? Setting out to find novel and convincing answers to a puzzle that counts among the oldest, most frequently tackled and yet most unyielding in human migration and mobility research is certainly ambitious. In <italic>Liberal States and the Freedom of Movement</italic> the research team of the Transformations of the State project at Bremen University lives up to this ambition with regard to their sound conceptual reflections, convincing methodological approach and exceptionally rich empirical analysis.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters subsequent to the introduction the authors engage with philosophical tensions between: (1) nation states, their monopoly over the ‘legitimate means of movement’ and their built-in impulse to control territorial borders, ‘legitimate’ populations and public goods production on their territory on the one hand; and, on the other hand, (2) the constitutive values of liberal democratic states – including individual mobility rights – and the economic impetus to remove physical barriers to movement of capital, goods, services and also people in capitalist globalization. Whilst this philosophical tension hardly comes as news – scholars such as James Hollifield, Christian Joppke, Gary Freeman, Christina Boswell or Andrew Geddes (to name but a few) have theorized the associated public policy dilemma from different angles in fruitful ways for the past two decades or so – Mau and colleagues offer two important innovations.</p>
<p>The first is their focus on selectivity as a key remedy for achieving competing policy objectives in the statutory regulation of mobility. The conceptual recognition that borders are never fully closed or fully open requires us to scrutinize the ways in which states select and the mechanisms by which selectivity is secured. The empirical chapters of the book do exactly that: chapter 4 gives an overview of selectivity in visa policies of three Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Austria, Finland and the US); chapter 5 studies the spatial flexibilization of territorial borders (among others, the externalization of control to sending countries); chapter 6 scrutinises internationalization strategies (such as European harmonization); and chapter 7 assembles in-depth case studies of historical changes in border regimes designed in the three countries with regard to two key neighbouring countries (Mexico and Canada for the US, Hungary and Switzerland for Austria, Russia and Sweden for Finland). The empirical focus on visa policies as a regulatory tool implies, however, a relatively narrow definition of mobility. The exclusion of migratory movements for common purposes such as work, family reunion or asylum from the scope of their mobility concept creates a false dichotomy between migration and mobility. Whilst this might help to cut off the usual baggage that comes with ‘migration’ policy – especially regarding settlement patterns and integration requirements – a narrow mobility policy analysis bears the slight danger of reifying arbitrary legal categories that often co-exist in movers’ formal and informal border-crossing practices as well as in policymakers’ strategic planning.</p>
<p>The range of statistical, documentary and interview analysis carried out, paired with the coverage of three countries and six different cases (two borders per country) over a time span of no less than 40 years, is frankly impressive – and unequalled in existing research on the topic. The mixed methods approach is methodologically astute and the interpretation of the rich and diverse data convincing; yet, the selection of the US, Austria and Finland as cases for comparison remains somewhat debatable. Their comparative approach, a ‘most different system design’, inquires which commonality across otherwise different cases explains a common outcome. Here, it is argued that the common outcome is a highly selective visa policy that can be explained with the specific relationship of a state with its respective neighbouring countries. The argument developed in the statistical analysis in chapter 4 holds that the more democratic and the richer a sending country is, the more liberal is the visa policy in the issuing liberal democracy. This is convincing as an overall pattern; however, as some important factors of dissimilarity remain unobserved in the small-n study (especially as conducted in chapters 5–7), some doubts surface as to the wider applicability of the book’s comparative conclusions. Most importantly, post-colonial ties across the globe are unfortunately disregarded. The pertinence of movements from former colonies co-shapes French, British, Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch border policies to date, as the plethora of bilateral visa, work, student exchange and return agreements indicate. Including a post-colonial context in yet another different system could thus have tackled a crucial source of variation in mobility regulation. This might even have led to the conclusion that despite common selectivity trends some key nuances persist in the border regimes of former colonial powers. Further: Does the geographical shape of borders at land or sea make any difference? Is there something specific to the border management strategies in countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand, for instance, when all neighbours (Ireland apart in the UK case) are by default ‘overseas’? Countries with weaker central administrations and large informal migrant residence and labour pools – say Greece, Italy or Spain – might equally have added a further pertinent dimension to the comparative analysis of border regimes and selectivity strategies.</p>
<p>The second important contribution of the book luckily offsets these minor criticisms by and large. Rather than remaining on a regulatory level of reasoning the authors plentifully discuss policy effects with regard to the unequal distribution of mobility rights to individuals across the globe. What emerges from visa policies overall then is ‘a hierarchical status system of unequal mobility rights’ in which ‘the promise of increased mobility in the context of globalization holds only for a part of today’s world’ (p. 194). Its profound and well tuned equality lens renders <italic>Liberal States and the Freedom of Movement</italic> a particularly rewarding read for social policy scholars. More than that: Mau and colleagues impressively demonstrate the necessity for social policy analysis to take more seriously mobility policies in the rich world as a crucial source of global inequalities.</p>
