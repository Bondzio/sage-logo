      <abstract>
        <p>Pablo Neruda has been described by some as the most widely read poet ever. His output was
          prodigious and diverse. He was also very much a man and a poet of his time, that of the
          first three-fourths of the ‘short’ twentieth century, a time very different from our own.
          That raises the question: Is it possible to split the poet from his politics? A standard
          recommendation of literary critics is to stick to Neruda’s ‘non-political’ work and forget
          the rest. Yet, Neruda himself insisted that not only his poetry but also his personal life
          and his politics formed an indivisible whole. At a time when the rise of Asia and South
          America is changing the global landscape, it is especially important to come to terms with
          the central perspective that inspired Neruda’s <italic>oeuvre</italic>: his identification
          with the common man and with the South; his anti-colonial spirit (honed during his Asian
          sojourn) and his extraordinary grasp of what José Martí referred as ‘nuestra América’.
          This article explores how Neruda provides us with a vocabulary and a grammar that allows
          us to look at the emerging new world of the twenty-first century with fresh eyes.</p>

    <p>The man whom Gabriel García Márquez called the greatest poet of the twentieth century in any
      language, often described as the most widely read poet ever, and certainly one of the most
      translated, changed the way we relate to Spanish and language more generally, recast Latin
      America and the Americas through his unadorned, straightforward verses, and embraced the cause
      of the dispossessed of the world. To this day, he is widely read in India, a fact that speaks
      volumes of his range and reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0974928413489469">2</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Under the early influence of Rabindranath Tagore (one of whose poems he paraphrased in his
        <italic>Twenty Poems of Love and a Song of Despair</italic>, written when he was 20 years
      old), Neruda visited India four times. In November 1927, he did so in Madras, writing
      rapturously about Indian women and their saris, wrapped ‘around the body with supernatural
      grace, covering them in a single flame of shining silk’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0974928413489469">3</xref></sup> In December 1928 he attended a meeting in
      Calcutta of the All-India Congress Committee (AICC), the last one chaired by Pandit Motilal
      Nehru, and one in which young Jawaharlal Nehru’s star was starting to shine. It was there that
      he met not only the Nehrus but also Mahatma Gandhi, whom he saw sleeping on the street to
      recover ‘that immense mystical energy that has confronted the great empire’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0974928413489469">Loyola 2006</xref>, 380). Impressed by India’s
      freedom fighters, he concluded that ‘the entire awakening of Asia’ originated in India. Two
      decades later, in November 1950, he came again, on behalf of the World Peace Council, to
      deliver a message to the then Prime Minister Nehru. His melancholy poem ‘India 1951’ (‘Womb of
      the land, closed territory in which the grapes of history ferment. Ancient sister of old
      planets’) arose from that occasion. His final visit to India took place in 1957, once again to
      Calcutta, at the invitation of Bengali poet Bishnu De.</p>
    <p>For many, Neruda’s most significant work is <italic>Residence on Earth</italic>, first
      published in English by New Directions in New York in 1946, and mostly written during his
      ‘Eastern sojourn’, that is, his years has Consul of Chile in Rangoon first, in 1927, then in
      Colombo, subsequently in Batavia, Java, and finally in Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0974928413489469">4</xref></sup> This book gave shape to a certain poetic style
      dubbed as <italic>nerudismo</italic>, which had enormous influence on Latin American poets.
      Neruda’s work also had a strong impact on Indian, especially Bengali, poets, starting with his
        <italic>España en el Corazón</italic>, which draws on his years in Barcelona and Madrid just
      before the Civil War, a time when he associated with Federico García Lorca, Rafael Alberti,
      Miguel Hernández, Vicente Aleixandre and others of that remarkable generation of Spanish
      poets, which flourished and came into their own during the early years of the Spanish
      Republic.</p>
    <p>It has been said that nothing ordinary was alien to Neruda. He has odes to red wine and
      tomato, to onion and to artichoke, to bees and the bicycle, among other subjects. He loved
      life and life’s simple things. That is why he sang to them with such directness, brio and
      gusto. When writing about love, he would write about the thighs and the breasts of his
      beloved; when about the Americas, about its minerals and volcanoes; when about politics, he
      would use names and last names of countries and leaders. He did not mince words and did not
      use euphemisms. No abstract theorising for him, no vague metaphysical reflections—(‘I am no
      thinker’, he said of himself). He liked what he could touch and feel and, as Federico García
      Lorca puts it, ‘was closer to blood than to ink’.</p>
    <p>Quite apart from his extraordinary mastery of the Spanish language, whose cadences and
      rhythms he handled like few others, this was also the product of a conscious decision. As he
      puts it, <verse-group>
        <verse-line>We write for simple folk…We write for modest people that often</verse-line>
        <verse-line>do not know how to read. However, on this Earth, before there was</verse-line>
        <verse-line>writing and the printing press, there was poetry. That is why we
          know</verse-line>
        <verse-line>that poetry is like bread, and must be shared by all, by the literate
          and</verse-line>
        <verse-line>by the peasants, by all our vast, incredible, extraordinary family of
          peoples.</verse-line>
        <verse-line>I confess that to write simply has been my most difficult endeavor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0974928413489469">5</xref></sup></verse-line>
      </verse-group></p>
    <p>His output was prodigious and diverse. He was also very much a man and a poet of his
      time—that of the first three-fourths of the ‘short’ twentieth century, a time very different
      from our own. That raises the question: Is it possible to split the poet from his politics? A
      standard recommendation of literary critics is to stick to Neruda’s ‘non-political’ work and
      forget the rest. Yet, Neruda himself insisted that not only his poetry but also his personal
      life and his politics formed an indivisible whole.</p>
    <p>To what extent does Neruda help us ‘renew the intellectual and moral solidarity required to
      meet the challenges faced by humanity today’, on the basis of ‘renewed reflection and action’,
      towards the theme of a ‘reconciled universal’, as UNESCO put it in 2009?</p>
    <p>For many, particularly his political and literary rivals and adversaries, which he never
      lacked, his adherence to Marxism and Communism would banish much of his work to the dustbin of
      literary history (in an extraordinary phrase, Octavio Paz once described him as ‘a servant of
      fascism’). Yet, this narrow-minded and self-serving interpretation fails to come to terms with
      the much broader and ample perspective that inspired Neruda’s oeuvre: his identification with
      the common man and with the South; his anti-colonial spirit (honed during his years in Asia);
      and his extraordinary grasp of what Cuban patriot José Martí referred to as ‘nuestra América’
      (‘our America’) or others call ‘la América morena’ (‘brown America’), that is, Latin America
      and the Caribbean. At a time when the rise of Asia and of South America is changing the global
      landscape, it could well be argued that Neruda is more relevant than ever.</p>
    <p>How and why is that the case? The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that Neruda
      provides us with a vocabulary and a grammar that allows us to look at the emerging new world
      of the twenty-first century with fresh eyes. On the occasion of Tagore’s 150th anniversary,
      such a perspective is especially apposite. The first section examines the change that has
      taken place in how we refer to the developing world and the reasons for it; the second deals
      with Neruda’s unvarnished style; the third, with his exposure to Asia, particularly India, and
      how it affected his <italic>Weltanschauung</italic>; the fourth analyses Neruda’s conception
      of what Latin America is all about; the fifth draws some conclusions.</p>
    <sec id="section1-0974928413489469">
      <title>From Third World to New South</title>
      <p>In a widely cited speech, in 2010 World Bank president Robert Zoellick pronounced the
        expression ‘Third World’ as dead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0974928413489469">6</xref></sup> This came with some delay. Strictly speaking, use of the term should
        have ceased more than 20 years ago, in November 1989, after the fall of the Berlin Wall
        marked the beginning of the end of the ‘Second World’, that of ‘actually existing
        socialism’. Without a Second World, is it possible to have a Third World? There is a lag
        between events and language, but, 20 years?</p>
      <p>There are at least two reasons why the term ‘Third World’ had such a good run ever since
        Peter Worsley popularised it in 1964 with his now classic book <italic>The Third World: A
          Vital New Force in International Affairs</italic>. The expression captures well the
        condition of the post-colonial world in Africa, Asia and Latin America emerging at the time.
        Worsley, who held the first professorship in Sociology at the University of Manchester,
        spent part of Second World War in Africa and in India, and had first-hand knowledge of the
        changes taking place there. He did not like the ideological straitjacket imposed by the
        ideological divisions between East and West. He felt energised by what was happening in the
        South, as the colonial empires crumbled, and the Castros, Nehrus, Nkruhmas and Nyereres
        disposed of the debris left behind and embarked on the arduous task of nation-building. He
        was one of the very first Western social scientists to capture that what was happening there
        was giving new meaning to old movements like nationalism, populism and socialism.</p>
      <p>The second reason is that no alternative term captured with the same precision and élan the
        true condition of the young nations. Other technocrats from the international financial
        institutions (IFIs) gave us, <italic>seriatim</italic>, a variety of terms—underdeveloped,
        developing, lower-income—each more anodyne than the other. Their blandness seemed to
        relegate the post-colonial nations to a mere footnote to the real History (with a capital H)
        being written in the First World.</p>
      <p>The term ‘South’ was perhaps the one that came closest to substitute ‘Third World’. I still
        remember an excellent monthly magazine—alas, no longer in existence—published out of London
        in the 1980s and 1990s, entitled <italic>South</italic>, which took as its brief serious
        reporting on what happened in that part of the world—but perhaps because of its rather
        neutral, mere geographical connotation, never took on the way it should have. It also had
        the problem, as <italic>The Economist</italic> never ceased to remind us, that it left out,
        at least nominally, such heavyweights as China, India, Algeria and Egypt that happen to be
        located in the Northern Hemisphere. That is why the term ‘Global South’ took centre stage,
        and is in many ways the expression of choice these days, with its conceptual rather than
        strictly geographic umbrella. Its undisputed capital is New Delhi.</p>
      <p>That said, the term ‘Global South’ does not do justice to the enormous changes that have
        taken place in the global political economy over the past two decades. Newly coined acronyms
        like BRICs, IBSA and BRICSAM reflect a whole new world that has been emerging before our
        eyes in the course of the past decade. What do they embody and where are they headed to?
        What should we make of them?</p>
      <p>Truth is, the rise of China (since 1978) and India (since 1991) has led to the emergence of
        a very different setting from the one described by Worsley in his classic book. This has
        radically altered the terms of reference in which nation-states operate.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the new nations in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and to some
        extent the older ones in Latin America (seen by some as ‘the middle class of nations’,
        though never really fitting that somewhat pretentious category) were economically weak,
        highly dependent on trade and investment links with the North and resentful about the legacy
        of colonialism. Believing there was strength in numbers, they gathered in a vast array of
        entities, led by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Group of 77 at the United Nations.
        Speaking from weakness, they still banged on the table and engaged in the ‘diplomacy of the
          <italic>cahier des doléances</italic>’, with proposals like that of the New International
        Economic Order (NIEO), demanding massive transfers of resources from North to South. Though
        they sometimes found sympathetic ears up North (during the early years of the Carter
        administration in the US, and in documents like the Brandt Report), by and large they had
        little to back up their demands with (beyond their voting power in the United Nations
        General Assembly). They thus ended up empty-handed.</p>
      <p>Over the past 20 years, and particularly over the past 10, this has changed. It is now a
        whole new ball game. With the rise of China and India, but also of Brazil, South Africa,
        Mexico and countries like Indonesia and Turkey, with fast-growing, large economies that
        speak from strength rather than weakness, the South does not ask for aid, but demands to be
        able to trade. It expects a greater voice at the IFIs, and a place at the high table of
        global governance. It wants access to Northern markets, and is able to hold out in terms of
        access to its own, if its demands are not met. In many ways, the lopsided relationship
        between China and the US, in which the latter, which has turned into the world’s largest
        debtor nation, has become largely beholden to the former, the world’s largest holder of US
        Treasury bills, is emblematic of this seismic change between North and South.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Southern countries are no longer beholden to trade and investment ties with the
        North. They can also do that among themselves. Growth rates in many Asian nations are three
        times that of Western nations, while their debt-to-GDP ratios are often much lower than
        those of G8 members. Latin America emerged largely unscathed from the Great Recession of
        2008–2009, one largely triggered by Wall Street, and whose most devastating repercussions
        were to be felt in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>There is, in other words, a New South that has emerged in this new century. It is already
        redrawing the boundaries and patterns of behaviour of the current international system. Yet,
        we still do not have an adequate language to express this new reality. Are we simply
        witnessing the replacement of some hegemons by others? Is it true, as Jorge Castaňeda has
        put it, that the BRICs are ‘not ready for prime time’, because they do not behave as North
        Americans and Europeans would like them to? Will, say, China and India simply replace the US
        as leading powers as we progress into what has been said will be the ‘Asian century’, or
        will they aim to bring up with them the ‘dispossessed of the Earth’ as they do so, doing
        their best that what was once referred to as ‘the Fifth World’, does not remain in that
        condition?</p>
      <p>These are big questions, for which I don’t have any ready answers. My purpose in raising
        them, however, is to underline the degree to which it is not just analysis, but the very
        tools with which we undertake it, that is, words that are failing us. As the shape of the
        international landscape is shifting before our very eyes, we are often unable to capture
        what is happening by using a vocabulary that is mired in the past.</p>
      <p>On the face of it, Neruda seems an unlikely candidate to be of help in this regard. The
        standard view of Neruda in some quarters is that of an unrepentant Stalinist, who wrote some
        interesting love poems in his youth, but was then the victim of ideology, which captured
        both his politics and his poetry, leading him astray. At a time when that ideology, that is,
        Marxism, has few takers, it would seem, at least at first sight, that there is little new
        that the Nerudian vocabulary can offer if we want to look at the twenty-first century with
        fresh eyes. Yet, this caricature—because that is what it is—does not do justice to Neruda’s
        enormous and multifaceted work. His membership in the Communist party is but one among many
        dimensions of an extraordinary life, ‘at once witness and participant in some of the major
        events of the 20<sup>th</sup> century’, as <italic>The Washington Post Book World</italic>
        puts it.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-0974928413489469">
      <title>Anachronistic or Contemporary?</title>
      <p>It is in this context that we must re-examine Neruda’s language and his work, as well as
        his relevance (or lack thereof) for today’s South. Neruda himself was fully aware of the
        dangers that came with his direct, unvarnished style: <verse-group>
          <verse-line>Some people ask me that human affairs</verse-line>
          <verse-line>with names, surnames and laments</verse-line>
          <verse-line>not be dealt with in the pages of my books,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>not to give them space in my verses:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>they say poetry died here,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>some say I should not do it</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>Yet, he rejected such advice outright, out of his humanist convictions: <verse-group>
          <verse-line>With my lamp I search for those who fall:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>I soothe and close their wounds:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>those are the chores of the poet</verse-line>
          <verse-line>of the aviator and of the stonecutter:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>we should do something on this earth</verse-line>
          <verse-line>because we were born on this planet</verse-line>
          <verse-line>and we must arrange man’s society</verse-line>
          <verse-line>because we are neither birds nor dogs</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>His ‘Ode to Stalin’ is in many ways emblematic of the dangers he alludes to. No doubt, it
        would have been wiser for Neruda not to write it. Many fiction writers stay away from real
        names and actual events—they are not journalists, they say. Yet, Neruda’s poetic passion and
        his view of the role of the poet and of words themselves would not allow for such caution,
        for such prudence, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>The word</verse-line>
          <verse-line>was born in the blood,</verse-line>

          <verse-line>and took flight through the lips and the mouth</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>As he saw it, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>…for human beings, not to speak is to die, [as]</verse-line>
          <verse-line>…cup and water and wine</verse-line>

      <p>More significant than Neruda’s misguided admiration for Josef Stalin is the broader
        perspective from which he wrote and sang. What makes him special is the extraordinary
        combination of humble origins (the son of a provincial railway worker, raised in a small
        town), born in a country <italic>finis terrae</italic>, who, defying all expectations,
        witnessed some of the key events of the twentieth century, and painted them with words so
        forceful and bright that they are still with us. This he did from a certain viewpoint—that
        of the downtrodden and the underprivileged, as he dwelt on the depths of injustice, poverty,
        inequality and oppression that are the hallmark of our world, then and now. To disqualify
        him, as Paz did, because of his membership in the Communist party is to embrace the opposite
        perspective—that of the North, rather than the South—and to adopt the view that the main
        cleavage in the world was (and in some ways is) between East and West rather than between
        North and South. It is the equivalent of attempting to disqualify Picasso’s work, according
        to some, the leading artist of the twentieth century, for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Around the world, Neruda is often known as the ‘poet of the people’. He wrote for those
        without a voice, those who needed a speaker. In his own words, ‘my poetry has the quality of
        an organism—infantile when I was a boy, juvenile when I was young, desolate when I suffered,
        combative when I had to enter the social struggle’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0974928413489469">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The latter viewpoint was given particular force by Neruda’s distinct style of writing. In
        response to a question about the symbolism of doves and guitar in an interview with the
          <italic>Paris Review</italic>, Neruda answered, <disp-quote>
          <p>The dove signifies the dove and the guitar signifies a musical instrument called the
            guitar… When I see a dove, I call it a dove. The dove, whether it is present or not, has
            a form for me, either subjectively or objectively—but it doesn’t go beyond being a dove.
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0974928413489469">Gilbert 1971</xref>)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>The directness with which he described the nature that surrounded him—Chile’s perhaps most
        distinct feature is its dramatic geography, from the driest desert in the north, to the
        icebergs-filled fjords and channels of Patagonia in the south—also expressed itself in his
        portrayal of society and history. He wrote what he saw, what he experienced, in his
        eloquent, magical way.</p>
      <p>One reason Neruda wrote of and to the marginal in society is because he identified with
        them—for much of his life he <italic>was</italic> one of them. Born in Parral, a small town
        in Central Chile, he was taken, still a baby, to Temuco, in Chile’s deep south (‘from the
        dusty breast of my fatherland, I was taken, speechless, to the rains of Araucanía’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0974928413489469">8</xref></sup>). The son of a railwayman, and
        baptised as Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí Reyes Basualto, he would be marked forever by the
        landscape and the surroundings of the country’s lake region, which he would often describe
        as Chile’s Far West. It was his upbringing there, surrounded by woods, rivers and lakes, and
        very different from that of a city boy, that would trigger his life-long fascination with
        Mother Nature in its manifold expressions. As he puts it himself, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>Nature there gave me a sort of drunkenness. I must</verse-line>
          <verse-line>have been ten years old, but was already a poet. I</verse-line>
          <verse-line>did not write verses, but I was attracted to birds,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>beetles, partridge’s eggs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0974928413489469">9</xref></sup></verse-line>

      <p>While still in his teens, he started publishing poetry, and by age 16, he took on the
        pseudonym Pablo Neruda to sign his work, which earned him many accolades and prizes.</p>
      <p>From Chile’s deep south, and after overcoming many obstacles (his father would throw out
        his poetry literally out the window of their Temuco home), he managed to make it to
        Santiago, the capital, to start his university studies. At age 20, he published
          <italic>Twenty Poems of Love and a Desperate Song</italic>, the love poem that launched
        his literary career, and made him instantly into Chile’s most popular poet.</p>
      <p>His years as a university student at the University of Chile’s Pedagógico (the Faculty of
        Education, known as a hotbed of radicalism) were also critical in shaping his political
        outlook, as students joined striking miners in demonstrations in downtown Santiago. As he
        puts it, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>It is from that moment on that, intermittently, politics</verse-line>
          <verse-line>joined my passion and my life. It is not possible to shut</verse-line>
          <verse-line>the door to the street in my poems, much as it is not</verse-line>
          <verse-line>possible to shut the door to love, to life, to joy or to</verse-line>

        </verse-group></p>
      <p>His rebelliousness and contrarian spirit was cast from early on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0974928413489469">11</xref></sup> However, despite his early successes, Neruda
        had great difficulty in making ends meet. His memories of his college days are full of
        harebrained schemes on how to make some money, ultimately dropping out altogether of the
        University of Chile, where he was studying French, in keeping with his love of French poets
        like Rimbaud.</p>

      <title>Eastern Sojourn</title>
      <p>It was then that he would shake loose, for a second time, from his surrounding environment
        and place himself in a totally new and alien one. Much as his move from Temuco to Santiago
        had allowed him to exchange the depressing setting of provincial life in a small town in
        Chile’s deep south, for the somewhat more stimulating one of the country’s capital, with its
        bohemian—albeit small-bore—literary scene, and active student politics, he now looked to the
        wider world.</p>
      <p>In some ways, his efforts to join the diplomatic service were a <italic>fuite en
          avance</italic>, a way of getting a job, any job, even if thousands of miles away from his
        beloved Chile. And one reason he succeeded in getting the position of consul <italic>ad
          honorarium</italic> in Rangoon is because there was not that much competition for it—as
        the name indicates, the job entailed no regular salary, only a commission when ships came by
        to collect Chile-bound merchandise, which was not very often.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0974928413489469">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>His five years (1927–1932) in Asia—in Rangoon, Colombo, Batavia and Singapore—were thus not
        easy, with little money, all by himself, in unfamiliar surroundings. It was there that he
        wrote the bulk of what some consider to be one of his major works, <italic>Residence on
          Earth</italic>. As a newly arrived consul in Burma, Neruda was eager to learn about the
        local mores and customs, and keen to ‘absorb the spirit of the Orient and ancient way of
        life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0974928413489469">Goodnough 1998</xref>, 41). Yet,
        from the start, British colonial officials and businessmen warned him about ‘crossing rigid
        class lines’ (ibid.). Living in Rangoon was a ‘living cosmorama of rapaciousness, oppressive
        colonialism, solitude’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489469">Bloom
        1989</xref>, 75). He witnessed the stark social chasm and inequality of wealth and income
        between the British and the Burmese, and described it as two separate worlds that ‘never
        touched’, as ‘the natives were not allowed in the places reserved for the English, and the
        English lived away from the throbbing pulse of the country’.</p>
      <p>Three words describe Neruda’s experience in Rangoon: poverty, boredom and solitude. As he
        puts it in a letter to his sister, ‘life in Rangoon is a terrible desert; I was not born to
        spend my life in such a hell’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489469">Olivares
          2000</xref>, 106). Besides calling Rangoon a ‘hell’ on several occasions, due to the
        intolerable heat as well as the colonial oppression, he also witnessed the caste system, in
        which ‘they had classified the Indian population as if in a parallel coliseum of
        superimposed galleries, on whose top the gods sat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0974928413489469">Olivares 2000</xref>, 84).</p>
      <p>During his first year in Burma, he composed a poem, <italic>Rangoon 1927</italic>, noting
        both the social inequality and the racial discrimination: <verse-group>
          <verse-line>In Rangoon it was late for me</verse-line>
          <verse-line>Everything had been done:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>a city</verse-line>

          <verse-line>and a golden temple for golden people</verse-line>

      <p>Neruda spoke neither English nor Burmese, and solitude became the favourite topic of his
        poetry at the time. He was miserable, which is reflected in <italic>Residence on
          Earth</italic>. Neruda’s longing for the Spanish language went so far as to ask his
        friend, the Spanish poet Rafael Alberti, to send him a dictionary, as he feared ‘losing
        contact with my own language’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0974928413489469">13</xref></sup> Poetry thus served several purposes—to conserve his ties to his roots and
        the Spanish language, to express his observations of a seemingly cruel, pitiless world, and
        to escape from the harsh alienation and solitude of his surroundings.</p>
      <p>In stark contrast to what is sometimes described as his carefree diplomatic life in the
        ‘exotic Orient’, Neruda’s years in Burma, enduring unbearable heat, observing the seamier
        side of British colonialism and feeling utterly ostracised, were among the most difficult in
        his life, something reflected in his poetry, and in his letters. As he puts it in one of
        them, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>Those intolerant Europeans were not interesting and, after all,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>I had not come to the Orient to spend my life with transient</verse-line>
          <verse-line>colonizers but rather with the ancient spirit of that world, with</verse-line>
          <verse-line>that large, hapless human family. (Feinstein 2004, 59)</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>In letters to Enandi, he describes his frequent desire ‘to throw yourself into the sea
        every five minutes’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0974928413489469">Teitelboim
          1991</xref>, 129), yet, there is little doubt that it gave him an appreciation of the
        ordeal of the oppressed. In his memoirs, he describes how the division between the worlds of
        the British and that of the Asians ‘ensured an inhuman isolation, a total ignorance of the
        values and lives of the Asians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489469">Feinstein 2004</xref>, 67).</p>
      <p>At the time, poetry on the Orient tended towards the exotic and mysterious, but Neruda was
        reluctant to be drawn into that approach: <verse-group>
          <verse-line>I am in no hurry to write about India and about Burma and Ceylon,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>because many things and origins seem to me veiled and many</verse-line>
          <verse-line>phenomena still unexplainable. Everything appears to be in ruins
            and</verse-line>
          <verse-line>tearing itself apart, but the truth is that strong elementary and living
            ties</verse-line>
          <verse-line>unite these appearances with almost secret and imperishable links. (cited in
            Dawes 2006, 106)</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>A fascinating issue is the ambivalence Neruda felt towards the Indian Congress movement—on
        the one hand, he couldn’t but sympathise with its objectives and goals. On the other, during
        his visit to the All India Congress Committee meeting in Calcutta in 1929, ‘the vast crowds
        only added to his developing feelings of alienation and loneliness’. Asked about his
        exposure to India, he replied, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>My stay there was an encounter I wasn’t prepared for. The splendor of
            that</verse-line>
          <verse-line>unfamiliar continent overwhelmed me, and yet I felt desperate, because
            my</verse-line>
          <verse-line>life and my solitude there were so long. Sometimes I seemed locked into
            an</verse-line>
          <verse-line>unending Technicolor picture, a marvelous movie, but one that I
            wasn’t</verse-line>
          <verse-line>allowed to leave. I never experienced the mysticism which guided so
            many</verse-line>
          <verse-line>South Americans and other foreigners in India… I was immensely
            moved</verse-line>
          <verse-line>by the sociological conditions—that immense unarmed nation, so
            defenseless,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>bound to its imperial yoke. Even the English culture, for which I had a
            great</verse-line>
          <verse-line>predilection, seemed hateful to me for being the instrument of the
            intellectual</verse-line>
          <verse-line>submission of so many Hindus at that time. I mixed with the rebellious
            young</verse-line>
          <verse-line>people of that continent; in spite of my consular post, I got to know all
            the</verse-line>
          <verse-line>revolutionaries—those in the great movement that eventually brought
            about</verse-line>

      <p>In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Neruda looks back on Asia as an almost necessary
        learning experience where he learns ‘through other people’ that ‘there is no insurmountable
        solitude’. Through his ‘solitude and difficulty, isolation and silence’, he is then able to
        ‘reach forth to the enchanted place where we can dance our clumsy dance…in this dance…there
        are fulfilled the most ancient rites of our conscience in the awareness of being human and
        of believing in a common destiny’.</p>

      <title>‘Brown America’</title>
      <p>Much as in Asia Neruda became acutely aware of his ‘otherness’, his return to Chile in
        1932, while not necessarily solving his eternal economic problems (being made a ‘librarian
        in a library which didn’t exist, with a salary that also hardly exists’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489469">Feinstein 2004</xref>, 84]). A posting to
        Buenos Aires in 1933 provided welcome relief, and he felt very much at ease in the great
        metropolis on the Río de la Plata, though not for long, as he was quickly transferred to
        Madrid, where he soon witnessed the horrors of the Spanish Civil War. It is in these years
        that his sympathy for the oppressed started to express itself in a direct communication with
        the people. As so many of his generation, the Spanish Civil War left a deep mark on him,
        redefining his mission as a poet and as a human being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0974928413489469">15</xref></sup> Upon returning to Chile in 1937, he began to
        give poetry readings to working class audiences across the country. In particular, his
        readings to the Santiago porters’ union became, according to Neruda himself, ‘the most
        important event in my literary career’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489469">Feinstein 2004</xref>, 132). It was at this moment that Neruda found his calling to be
        the voice for the ordinary man. While standing in front of the members of the porters’
        union, who emanated the ‘Chilean silence…the heaviest silence in the world’, he read from
        his collection <italic>España en el Corazón</italic>. At the end, the union leader stood up,
        and, according to Neruda, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>….got up, leaning with his large hands on his chair, looked at me and
            said:</verse-line>
          <verse-line>‘Comrade Pablo, we are a totally forgotten people. And I can tell you that
            we</verse-line>
          <verse-line>have never been so greatly moved. We would like to say to you…’ And
            he</verse-line>
          <verse-line>broke down in tears, his body trembling with the sobs. Many of those
            around</verse-line>
          <verse-line>him were also crying. I felt a knot form in my throat. (Feinstein
            2004)</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>From then on, Neruda felt a bond, a sense of empathy, a need to represent the common man
        and committed himself to making the working class ‘his readers, not the intellectuals’ in
        order ‘to reach out to ordinary people’; he now ‘wrote for them’ (ibid.).</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, in 1940, he began his <italic>Canto General</italic>, his ode to Latin
        America—its history, its geography, its injustices. It started as an ode to Chile: <verse-group>
          <verse-line>Night, snow and sand give shape</verse-line>
          <verse-line>to my narrow fatherland</verse-line>
          <verse-line>all the silence is to be found in its long line</verse-line>
          <verse-line>all the foam comes out of its marine beard</verse-line>
          <verse-line>all the coal fills it with mysterious bags</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>Chile’s odd geography had always enchanted Neruda, and this is especially true of his
        beloved South. Yet, suddenly, he started to paint Chile within the broader canvas of the
        Americas. His next diplomatic posting, to Mexico, allowed him to fuse seamlessly his
        professional and literary undertakings. In Mexico City, often described as Latin America’s
        cultural capital, and in association with fellow artists, such as David Alfaro Siqueiros,
        Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, Neruda thrives, articulating and elaborating his poetic take
        on subjects, such as, colonialism, imperialism, underdevelopment and, perhaps most
        significantly, the meaning of Latin American identity (whose very existence is increasingly
        questioned today by the same who would have us believe Neruda’s ‘political’ works should be
        banished from our reading lists).</p>
      <p>As a poet and as a writer, Neruda was a witness, someone who testifies to the injustices he
        sees. But far from being the pamphleteer he is often accused of being, he wrote from the
        heart with such brio that his verses and cadences resonate to this day. He was fascinated by
        Mexican culture, a country he saw as ‘the last of the magic countries, because of its age
        and its history’ and frowned upon the ‘false image of the Mexican in sombrero’. He considers
        Mexico as ‘the touchstone of America’ and praises it for having ‘carved’ the ‘solar calendar
        of Ancient America, the node of irradiation, wisdom and mystery’. Not surprisingly, his
          <italic>Canto General de América</italic> has been described as the poetic equivalent of
        the <italic>murales</italic> painted by Rivera and Siqueiros, given its force, colour and
        epic character. But the <italic>Canto</italic> is not just a description of the New World’s
        vast expanses. It is also a call for action, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>We write for a continent in which everything is being made,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>and, above all, in which we want to make everything. Our</verse-line>
          <verse-line>peoples are only now learning their professions and their trade,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>or at least recovering them. Our old stonecutters, sculptors and</verse-line>

      <p>Neruda travelled to Panama, Colombia, Peru and the US while assembling material for the
          <italic>Canto General</italic>. His portrayal of the Americas showed lands of great
        diversity and striking natural beauty, yet oppressed by censorship, violence and
        discrimination, as he tried ‘to fill with words the vast empty spaces of South America’, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>I am here to tell the story.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>From the peace of the buffalo</verse-line>
          <verse-line>to the pummeled sands</verse-line>
          <verse-line>of the land’s end, in the accumulated</verse-line>
          <verse-line>spray of the antartic light</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>And in an almost encyclopaedic effort, in some ways so contrary to the poetic craft, he
        goes on to describe rivers and birds (‘the condor, murderous king, solitary monk of the sky,
        black talisman of the snow, hurricane of falconry’) mountains and volcanoes, countries and
        dictators. His most impassioned pleas go for the tragic fate of the Amerindians—most
        eloquently in his ‘Heights of Macchu Picchu’, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>Come to my very being, to my own dawn,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>into crowned solitudes.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>The fallen kingdom survives us all this while.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>And on this dial the condor’s shadow</verse-line>
          <verse-line>cruises as ravenous as would a pirate ship.</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>He also took on that classic Latin American figure—the dictator. While imbibing the natural
        beauty of Guatemala, the most striking of all countries on the Central American Isthmus, he
        also became acquainted with the horrors of the Jorge Ubico dictatorship, where ‘walls had
        ears’, and four machine guns were aimed at Neruda without his knowledge, at a public reading
        of his poetry.</p>
      <p>On the Americas, Neruda is both liberating and empowering: yes, the Spanish
          <italic>conquistadores</italic> did their best to destroy the pre-Columbian civilisations;
        yes, dictators of various stripes may be oppressing them right now. But there is a way out,
        and in due course the people will write their own history and recapture their own Latin
        American identity. At a time when Bolivian president Evo Morales has become the first
        Amerindian elected head of state in South America, history is being rewritten in the
        Americas, much along the lines Neruda envisioned.</p>
      <p>Neruda is especially eloquent on the relations between Mexicans and Chileans, the nationals
        of the countries at the two extremes of the continent, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>As Mexicans and Chileans, we meet only in our roots, and that’s where
            we</verse-line>
          <verse-line>should look for each other—in our roots’ hunger and dissatisfaction, in
            the</verse-line>
          <verse-line>search for bread and truth, in our same needs, our same anxieties—yes in
            earth, in our origins, and in our earthly struggle in where we mix all our
            brothers,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>With our slaves of hunger, with all the poor of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0974928413489469">17</xref></sup></verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>In his travels around the continent, he also came across the despoliations of big business,
        particularly that of US corporations, memorably immortalised in his verses on United Fruit—a
        company so infamous it had to change its name, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>United Fruit reserved for itself the juiciest</verse-line>
          <verse-line>the central seaboard of my land</verse-line>
          <verse-line>America’s sweet waist.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>It rebaptized its lands</verse-line>
          <verse-line>the ‘Banana Republics’,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>upon the restless heroes</verse-line>
          <verse-line>who conquered renown</verse-line>

          <verse-line>unsheathed envy, drew</verse-line>

          <verse-line>Ubico flies, flies soaked</verse-line>
          <verse-line>in humble blood and jam,</verse-line>

          <verse-line>like serving trays.</verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>The parallels between the role of companies, such as United Fruit, in Central America and
        that of British companies in Burma are not difficult to see, and Neruda did not miss them.
        Be it in Asia, in Mexico, in Central America or in his native Chile, where visiting the
        homes of some miners in northern Chile, at Humberstone, Neruda described how his ‘heart is
        still shuddering with the memory of the poverty of those camps’, believing that he had ‘come
        into contact with the poorest, most desperate people in the whole of Chile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0974928413489469">Feinstein 2004</xref>, 180).</p>
      <p>As he struggled with the seemingly inchoate material of the many centuries of history of
        the vast continent, Neruda does not cease to be amazed by it all, <verse-group>
          <verse-line>…there is no anti-poetic material when it comes to our realities.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>The most obscure facts of our peoples must be brought to light.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>The stories of our plants and our flowers must be, for the first
            time,</verse-line>
          <verse-line>told and sang to. Our volcanoes and our rivers have been left in
            the</verse-line>
          <verse-line>empty spaces of texts. Their fire and their fertility must be
            brought</verse-line>
          <verse-line>to the world by our poets. We are the chroniclers of a delayed
            birth.</verse-line>
          <verse-line>Delayed by feudalism, by backwardness, by hunger. But this is not</verse-line>
          <verse-line>just a matter of preserving our culture, but to sustain it with all
            our</verse-line>
          <verse-line>strength, to nurture it and to make it flourish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0974928413489469">18</xref></sup></verse-line>
        </verse-group></p>
      <p>Driven by the passion of such experiences, Neruda attempts to create a Latin American
        identity based on shared experience. He points to the ‘shared roots’ of countries as distant
        and as different as Chile and Mexico. He searches for a national culture based not on
        imported mores from Europe and from the US, but on the roots and origins of ‘brown America’.
        As Comprone puts it, Neruda goes ‘past mere postcolonial critique of the imperialistic
        designs of Western Europe and North America and emphasizes the forging of a new Latin
        American self-consciousness through a poetic praxis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0974928413489469">Comprone 2008</xref>, 33).</p>

      <title>By Way of Conclusion</title>
      <p>Far from being an anachronistic relic of the Cold War, Neruda’s work shines as brightly
        today as it did half a century ago, be it in Chile, in India or in the US. At a time when
        Asia, and particularly the two Asian giants, that is, China and India, have come into their
        own, leading some to say that this will be the Asian century, and Latin America, undergoing
        a boom of its own, is partnering with Asian nations to forge a better future for its people,
        Neruda’s insights into Asia’s awakening and ‘our America’s’ destiny resonates. Rather than a
        throwback to an irrelevant past, Neruda’s work opens a window to the future. His Eastern
        sojourn, difficult as it was, personally and professionally, allowed him to understand the
        suffering and the predicament of colonial peoples everywhere. He captured the underlying
        force of India’s millenarian civilisation and the enormous energy and creative potential to
        be unlocked once unshackled from the colonial yoke. These realisations, in turn, made it
        possible for him to see the Americas in a different light—not as a mere European outpost in
        the Western Hemisphere, as many of his contemporaries did, but one with its own
        pre-Columbian roots and an identity markedly different from the Old World.</p>
      <p>At a time when both Asian and Latin American leaders and peoples, who know so little of
        each other, struggle to come to terms with the fact that goods and capital flows across the
        Pacific are bringing both regions closer than ever before, we can do worse than read and
        re-read Pablo Neruda.</p>

          <p>Neruda’s centennial celebrations in India generated an outpouring of anthologies,
            special issues of journals and publications of various sorts in several Indian
            languages. Some of these are in Hindi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0974928413489469">Singh 2004</xref>); in Malayalam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0974928413489469">Santosh 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0974928413489469">Satchidanandan 2004</xref>); in Telugu, the special
            issue of <italic>Jayantha</italic> 1:4 (summer 2004), published in Hyderabad; in Urdu,
            the special issue of <italic>Zhene Jadid Urdu Quarterly</italic> XV: 39 (June–November,
            2004); and in Bengali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0974928413489469">Shamsur
              Rahman, Belal Chauhuri and Mohammad Abdul Hye 2004</xref>). Perhaps the most
            significant of these works, though was published somewhat later, in 2006, is a special
            issue of the journal <italic>Udhbavana</italic> (No. 70, January 2006) edited by noted
            journalist Vishnu Khare. It includes a long list of essays on Neruda and India by some
            of the country’s leading specialists, as well as some interviews with the Indian press
            at the time, assorted poems and prose, and breaks new ground in the emerging field of
            ‘Neruda-and-India studies’. Its translation from Hindi into English and Spanish should
            be an important next step. A Hindi version of Neruda’s memoirs was published in
            2007.</p>
