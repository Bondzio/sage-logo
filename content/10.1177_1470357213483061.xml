<abstract>
<p>This article reviews recent attempts to analyse the visibility that is brought to human suffering within ‘social imaginaries’ committed to humanitarian concerns. It questions the conventions of critique that operate to cast the humanitarian social imaginary as a negative development within our political culture. It is designed to encourage a more critically reflexive and historically informed approach to the work of critique. It also argues that it is possible to trace a tradition in which humanitarian campaigners operate with the aim of appropriating the critical reaction to their work as part of their political strategy. In this regard, campaigners are more concerned to provoke moral controversy than to fashion ‘winning arguments’. Here the visualization of human suffering is valued more for its potential to generate value conflicts than for the extent to which it serves as an authentic or ideologically uncontaminated representation of social reality.</p>

<p>On many occasions the cultural experience of modernity has involved people ‘in a sort of frenzy of the visible’ which has induced quite dramatic awakenings to the moral and embodied experience of social worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213483061">Comolli, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483061">Flint, 2000</xref>). Social theorists now recognise the great multiplication and dissemination of visual representations of society, as well as the unprecedented expansion of the technological means to visualize human experience, as having radically transformed our capacity for self and social understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483061">Brighenti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213483061">Jay, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470357213483061">Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470357213483061">Woodiwiss, 2001</xref>). There is still no consensus, however, as to how we should venture to locate this within an historical and/or sociological assessment of how our humanity, and awareness of the humanity of others, is either culturally composed or subject to change. Indeed, whilst it is widely understood that ‘the visual’ is a vital component of social experience and serves as a motive force of social action, very little agreement surrounds how this should be analysed and explained. It often appears that, in attempting to piece together an understanding of the sociological significance of visual experience and how this has changed through modern times, we are left more with an appreciation of the ways in which our research methods have fallen short of accounting for the complexity of this matter, than with the conviction that it has been brought to an adequate level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357213483061">Murdock, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470357213483061">Stevenson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357213483061">Thompson, 1995</xref>: 9). In this context, the so-called ‘visual turn’ in contemporary sociology is taken to demand a radical rethinking of the ways in which social science has taken stock of human experience to date; and to require the development of new evaluative criteria for rendering this as a matter for critical judgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357213483061">Jay, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘new visibility’ that is brought to the experience of human suffering is held up as prima facie evidence that requires social analysts to work at reconceptualising the bounds of moral experience and formations of cultural and political consciousness. For example, when reflecting on the visibility brought to gross acts of violence, war and atrocity through modern news media, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470357213483061">John Thompson (1995</xref>: 225–227) advises that the ‘intermingling’ of everyday experience within the witness of human suffering on a grand scale now makes our lives ‘quite different from the lives of previous generations’. Whilst characteristically reticent when it comes to delineating the social implications of this development, he further contends that, at the very least, people are hereby set to experience themselves as ‘thrown into a world of baffling complexity’, and that many are liable to be burdened by the moral demands that are thrust upon them to respond to the desperate needs of strangers (pp. 233–234). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357213483061">Michael Ignatieff (1999)</xref> observes that through modern media of mass communication we are now made routine ‘voyeurs of the suffering of others, tourists amid their landscapes of anguish’ (p. 11) although, in contrast to Thompson, he is inclined to suggest that this serves ‘to create a single banalized commodity of horror’ that encourages viewers to treat people’s suffering more as a fleeting moment of ‘promiscuous representation’ than as an issue for serious moral debate and political concern (pp. 29–30).</p>
<p>In this article, I review further attempts to refine the analysis of this cultural experience in terms of its presence within the ‘social imaginaries’ of our times. To this end, I note some recent approaches to interpreting the moral, political and sociological significance of the visibility of human suffering in the public sphere; particularly, where this takes place out of a commitment to understanding contemporary forms of humanitarian culture and politics. I locate this as part of a longstanding tradition of critical debate that places the cultural artefacts of humanitarianism under ideological suspicion; and further, contends that this operates to the detriment of critical thinking.</p>
<p>I am concerned to approach this tradition itself as a subject for critical analysis and, to this end, this article is designed to encourage readers to question the form of critical questioning that tends to be brought to the role played by the visualization of human suffering in humanitarian campaign work. I highlight the need to locate the critical cultures in which we operate as a contingent product of a cultural history that is itself subject to processes of ideological conditioning and institutional bias. I am also interested to highlight a tradition within humanitarian campaign work that is configured not so much with the aim of disciplining thought in the direction of its interests, but rather to appropriate the critical response to humanitarianism as a spur to moral debate. In this setting, the attempt to render visible human suffering is recognised as an inherently unstable practice; both for the conflicts of interpretation that it is set to generate and for the many disputes it provokes over its authenticity as a document of human–social life. I argue that it is often the case that purveyors of humanitarianism are consciously and reflexively alert to the risk that they will fail to adequately convey the reality of human experience and will do more to court people’s hostility than their impassioned support for their concerns. Under this recognition, some are left campaigning more with the aim of using the critical reaction to their work as a means to agitate for human rights than with an investment in the understanding that publics will readily sympathize with a humanitarian point of view.</p>

<title>Locating Humanitarianism within the ‘Social Imaginary’</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470357213483061">Charles Taylor (2004</xref>: 23) argues that in any period of cultural history it is possible to identify distinct ‘social imaginaries’ through which ‘people imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations’. A social imaginary advances a conception of a presiding ‘moral order’ and the appropriate behaviours that can and/or should take place within this. The study of social imaginaries is understood to hold value as a means to bring analytical scrutiny to bear upon common understandings of how we should live and what we should do. It involves an attempt to expose the social meaning and ideological implications of the values enshrined in cultural representations of shared life problems. It invites us not only to question how people are being encouraged to imagine the reality of their world, but also to examine the symbolic portrayal of imaginable possibilities. In this regard, it is held to serve both as a means to expose common apprehensions of ‘how the world works now’ and as a guide to the forms of action that are commonly recognised as best suited ‘to bring change to our world’.</p>
<p>This is, however, a highly contested field of cultural analysis. It is characterised by a pronounced conflict of interpretations. Whilst many agree that we are living through a period of history in which, through their daily involvements with modern communication media, many people are involved in cultural experiences that are leading them to radically revise their understandings of what is socially possible or desirable, there is no consensus as to how we should depict the social and human consequences of this development. In this regard, it may well be the case that we are witness to the development of many ‘emergent patterns of self-formation’, ‘diverse forms of intersubjectivity’ and multiple revaluations of the meaning of, and the moral responsibilities involved in, being human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483061">Biehl et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of social and cultural commentators identify humanitarian culture and experiences of humanitarian impulse as integral features of the dominant social imaginaries of our times. It is argued that, in order to understand contemporary forms of social solidarity, we should be particularly attentive to the role played by humanitarian ideals and ideologies within their cultural constitution and institutional organisation. It is also suggested that by attending to the types of problems that are labelled as a ‘humanitarian concern’ in the public sphere, and more importantly, by documenting the forms of action that are advocated and justified by means of an appeal to ‘humanitarianism’, then we stand to gather valuable insights into how many people are disposed to articulate their political ambitions and engage with projects of political change.</p>
<p>More often than not, the analysis of these phenomena is geared towards critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483061">Chouliaraki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357213483061">Moeller, 1999</xref>). Generally speaking, it is out of a concern to issue warnings about the potential ways in which humanitarian campaign appeals and the appeal to humanitarian sensibility serves to corrupt sound thinking or political judgement, that this is addressed as a matter for social and cultural commentary. Whilst acknowledging the power of humanitarianism to shape public opinion, guide institutional behaviours and direct social actions, for the most part, this is addressed as a development that holds <italic>negative</italic> consequences for our terms of self and social understanding. It is, moreover, generally portrayed as operating to the detriment of ethical sobriety and political virtue.</p>
<p>For example, in his celebrated treatise on the cultural experience of being positioned as a voyeur of ‘distant suffering’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483061">Luc Boltanski (1999)</xref> contends that modern humanitarian emergency appeals, such as those orchestrated by Médecins Sans Frontières, ultimately work to undermine people’s sense of political agency as well as their faith in the possibility of substantive social change. He contends that the experience of being a ‘detached observer’ of human affliction creates a shared sense of powerlessness and moral inadequacy. On his account, the new visibility that is brought to mass events of human suffering now comprises a cultural scenario which leaves individuals feeling that they have no adequate means to respond to the imperative of action demanded of them by humanitarian appeal.</p>
<p>A further reading proffered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483061">Craig Calhoun (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483061">2008</xref>), whilst operating in broad sympathy with Boltanski’s concerns, suggests that we should not worry so much about the extent to which people are made to feel powerless through their witness of suffering, but rather, be more concerned with how this tends to be portrayed in terms of an ‘exceptional’ and ‘unanticipated’ human disaster. He contends that the mediatized spectacle of human suffering is often related to the promotion of an ‘emergency imaginary’ which normalizes a vision of the world as filled with frequent and unforeseen crises. Calhoun argues that, in this context, through the regular montage of disaster footage, news media are unwitting accomplices in a process of ‘de-politicization’ whereby the involvement of global capitalism in the systematic production of large-scale human suffering is obscured in favour of a focus on the immediate task of marshalling resources in support of the efforts made by humanitarian organisations to ‘manage’ its most damaging effects. Accordingly, his analysis works to unmask the ‘emergency imaginary’ as a component of ideological discourses that not only provide tacit support for a status quo of grossly unequal power relations, but also prevent this from being taken up as a matter for critique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483061">Calhoun (2004</xref>: 393) suggests that ‘approaching conflicts as emergencies is, perhaps, the least unpalatable way of accepting their ubiquity, but it feeds unfocussed fear even as it reassures, and it encourages responses that may do good, but usually not deeply.’</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483061">Lilie Chouliaraki (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483061">2012</xref>) has explored a new set of analytical considerations in her argument that ‘the humanitarian social imaginary’ should be studied as exhibiting distinct genres of ‘performativity’. She makes efforts to distance herself from the suggestion that there is a ‘necessary relationship’ between media representations of humanitarian concerns and how these are appropriated within public attitudes and behaviours; and in this regard, Chouliaraki works harder than most to acknowledge ‘the complex and dynamic ways in which particular moral imaginations of solidarity come to be articulated as public norms at different points in time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483061">Chouliaraki, 2012</xref>: 56). She declares herself to be operating from a position of ‘informed agnosticism’ that does not venture to pre-judge how people are set to interpret and respond to the images and messages configured in terms of a humanitarian appeal. Nevertheless, throughout her documentation of the ways in which humanitarian concerns are now profiled in rock concerts, articulated by celebrity ambassadors, symbolically packaged with the use of modern advertising techniques and stylized as part of the narrative aesthetics of news, her analysis is pitched towards critique. Chouliaraki still portrays the current ‘theatricality’ of humanitarianism as a largely negative development. For example, in profiling the ‘persona’ and ‘ethos of care’ performed on screen by Angelina Jolie in her role as a UNICEF ambassador, she argues that it now appears that ‘we’ are more concerned with ‘our own feelings of the sufferer’s pain’ rather than the actual situation of those in suffering (p. 173). Indeed, Chouliaraki contends that insofar as it is through the endorsement of emoting celebrities that humanitarian concerns are advertised for public attention, then publics are now being encouraged to relate to the symbolic portrayal of human misery more in terms of their feelings for the celebrity than the plight of people in suffering. On this account, it seems that the current ways in which ‘the humanitarian social imaginary’ is rendered as public performance are geared to promote the ‘low-intensity, fleeting sensibilities of a feel-good altruism’ that, if anything, operates more in ‘ironic solidarity’ with distant sufferers than from an impassioned and credibly informed ‘solidarity of pity’ (pp. 172–205).</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, my interest in these critical commentaries is twofold. Firstly, I hold that they are particularly noteworthy because they mark a return to a set of critical concerns that were heavily involved in nascent conceptions of ‘the social’ as a domain of human experience and action. In each case, the analysis of the cultural representation of human suffering is taken to expose presiding forms of social–moral experience and social–moral understanding. Indeed, since all these writers identify Adam Smith as one of the main progenitors of their interests and <italic>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357213483061">2006[1759]</xref>) as a seminal contribution to the analysis of the role played by the witness of suffering within the social imaginary, then this appears to be a conscious initiative on their part. Secondly, they are of interest to me for the extent to which, like Smith and other 18th-century critical analysts of ‘social sympathy’, they operate with an overwhelming emphasis placed on how the humanitarian courting of our social sympathies should be placed under ideological suspicion and identified as giving rise to forms of culture that compromise and curtail the space for critical thinking.</p>
<p>My concern lies in the extent to which, albeit with a new focus brought to the campaign work of international humanitarian non-governmental organisations, by taking up a position within this tradition of critique, analysts may not only fail to reflect critically upon the cultural and historical standpoint from which they operate, but also take no interest in the ways in which humanitarian campaigners might consciously respond to the critical objections to their work and incorporate this within their praxis and politics.</p>

<title>Reculer Pour Mieux Sauter</title>
<p>The 18th-century ‘Enlightenment of Sympathy’ provides us with a rich legacy of critical inquiry that still holds value as a means to draw out some of the complexities involved in analysing the humanitarian imaginary in sociological terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213483061">Frazer, 2010</xref>). Here we are not only presented with many subtle insights into the relative ways in which people might be motivated by their witness of suffering into acts of care for others, but also, with the challenge to understand how this is incorporated within the development of social understanding. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and Adam Smith recognise ‘social sympathy’ as a form of moral experience in which we are set to encounter ties of responsibility to others. Whilst by no means agreeing among themselves as to the means by or extent to which our ‘moral sense’ might be cultivated as a common good, they all share in the understanding that social life is founded on fellow feeling; and further, that such sentiment has a positive role to play in the pursuit of civic virtue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357213483061">Mullan, 1988</xref>). Through their works it is also possible to detect an increasing concern to defend such views against the charge of political naivety. Whilst in his earlier address to the topic Hutcheson simply promotes the idea that our human thought and behaviours can be motivated by benevolence, through Hume’s <italic>A Treatise of Human Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357213483061">1969[1739–1740]</xref>) and <italic>An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357213483061">2008[1751]</xref>) to Smith’s <italic>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357213483061">2006[1759]</xref>), it is possible to trace the development of a more conceptually elaborated analysis of the apparent frailties and partiality of our sympathetic attachments to others. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357213483061">David Raphael (2007</xref>: 7) contends that Smith is the first to subject this to an identifiably ‘sociological’ analysis.</p>
<p>When working to understand when and how people are most likely to be motivated by moral feeling to care for distant others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357213483061">Adam Smith (2006[1759])</xref> argues that this is limited by the social and cultural conditions under which they are made witness to their suffering. In this regard, moreover, he sees more cause to underline the frailties rather than strengths of our moral imagination and impulse. At one point he suggests that, on being presented with news of a great disaster in China, a European may be moved to express his sorrow on behalf of the misfortunes of the Chinese people; but nevertheless, he would quickly return to his own pleasures and<disp-quote>
<p>provided he never <italic>saw</italic> them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions [sic] of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude [would be] an object less interesting to him [a] paltry misfortune of his own. (p. 132, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elsewhere, Smith argues that, when provoked by moral feeling, people tend to be caught up in a complex struggle to moderate their sympathies in line with how they understand themselves to be judged by others (pp. 11–13). For Smith, social behaviour is akin to a dramatic public performance in which they are concerned to win the approval of a public audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357213483061">Marshall, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357213483061">Raphael, 2007</xref>). He further suggests that, in the majority of cases, it is more with a concern to look good in the eyes of their peers than from a genuine commitment to the welfare of others that they may be provoked into the actual practice of social care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357213483061">Smith [1759]2006</xref>: 113).</p>
<p>As contemporary analysts of the social imaginary observe, Adam Smith clears the ground for a more in-depth analysis of how ‘social sympathy’ is generated through the witness of human suffering. In this regard, he occupies an important cultural position as the first analyst of social life to locate visual experience as a vital component of human sociality and civic consciousness. It is important to appreciate, however, that even in its own time, Smith’s work was rapidly made to appear as a limited, under-developed and conservative account of how people might be made visually attentive to human suffering and be moved by what they see into political action.</p>
<p><italic>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</italic> was devised and published before the political and moral controversies surrounding the impact of humanitarian sentiment on late 18th-century public life were realised on a grand scale. In this regard, even among his contemporaries, his thesis was vulnerable to the criticism that he had not been sufficiently attentive to the ways in which the artefacts of our visual culture might be fashioned to attract public attention and direct opinion. The second half of the 18th century is now portrayed by many cultural historians as a period where, in Western Europe and North America, large numbers of people became infatuated with, and culturally disposed to be shocked by, the spectacle of human pain and misery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483061">Fiering, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357213483061">Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470357213483061">Spierenberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470357213483061">Thomas, 1983</xref>: 173–180). How this is best explained remains a topic of considerable controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213483061">Campbell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213483061">Elias, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357213483061">Haskell, 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357213483061">1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357213483061">Reddy, 2001</xref>). It is now widely recognised, however, that here, the possible ways in which people were inclined to interpret and respond to the moral feelings aroused through their witness of suffering became a matter of heated debate.</p>
<p>The period between 1780 to 1800 stands out as a time when the ethics and politics of ‘moral sentiment’ became a focal concern in national debates over the character of public virtue and the conduct of rational debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483061">Barker-Benfield, 1992</xref>). A critical storm gathered around the so-called ‘cult of sensibility’ as many rushed to decry the popular emotional response to the spectacle of suffering not only as a form of vice, but also as a force implicated in revolutionary social uprisings. In this context, essayists such as Henry Mackenzie turned from a heroic portrayal of ‘the man of feeling’ to adopt a position of critique that condemns the ‘enthusiasm of sentiment’ as a clear danger to society. Mackenzie now warned that all too often sentimentalists are to be found ‘talking of virtues which they never practice’ and as being all too prepared to separate ‘conscience from feeling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357213483061">Mackenzie, 2001a[1771]</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357213483061">2001b[1785]</xref>: 100). Similarly, albeit with the hope of rescuing moral sentiment as a public virtue, in the ‘Preface’ to his <italic>Lyrical Ballads</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470357213483061">2003[1800–1802]</xref>), William Wordsworth condemned the ‘degrading thirst after stimulation’ that he witnessed in the popular enjoyment of sentimentalism (p. 10). In addition to the widespread recognition that many people were more excited by the vicarious pleasures to be drawn from sentimentalism than by the possibility of making moral feeling a guide to the common good, it was also feared that the courting of high emotions in public life served as an incitement to violent conduct. Historical reviews of the period are now inclined to bring emphasis to the ways in which the fear that the French Revolution might spread further afield consolidated a movement to erase sentiment from public affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483061">Ellis, 1996</xref>). It was widely held that Robespierre had exploited a culture of unregulated sentimentality to initiate the Reign of the Terror, and thereby had brutally exposed the potential for moral feeling to be co-opted for the purpose of mob rule. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357213483061">William Reddy (2000)</xref> argues that more than any other factor at this time, it was the widespread belief, at least within governmental and élite intellectual circles, that an excess of moral feeling had fuelled a passion for revolutionary violence in France that subsequently led to it being cast as an anathema to civilized conduct and rational debate. On Reddy’s account, moreover, it is in this counter-revolutionary movement to portray moral sentiment as an intellectual weakness and political vice that we find the origins of a cultural tradition wherein ‘the Enlightenment’ is portrayed, and indeed celebrated, above all as the harbinger of modern rationality.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that, by the early decades of the 19th century, in both public and intellectual life, the politics of ‘social sympathy’ and cultures of moral sentiment were openly and widely held under ideological suspicion. For example, in the development of social <italic>science</italic> through the 19th century, there is a noticeable flight from ‘sentimentalism’ coupled to a discernible movement to promote rationalism as the authoritative means to gain social understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357213483061">Lepenies, 1988</xref>). Moreover, it is now widely noted that in the quest to acquire ‘professional’, ‘scientific’ and ‘academic’ status for disciplines such as sociology, there was a concerted movement to cast ‘sentimentalism’ as an intellectual pollutant that was always set to be a hindrance to rational social inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213483061">Bannister, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483061">Haskell, 2000</xref>). In this context, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357213483061">Martin Jay (1994)</xref> has referred to (albeit with other aims in mind) as ‘the denigration of vision’ in social thought was driven by a concern to banish moral feeling from social inquiry.</p>
<p>The visualization of human experience and the attempt to incorporate this within public documents of social life was identified with a move to engage us in understanding the world more by force of moral feeling than by strictures of rationality. Moreover, in the intellectual culture of élite sections of society where capitalist political economy and the philosophy of utilitarianism were in the ascendancy, this was often heavily associated with attempts to garner sympathy for the ‘undeserving’ poor and to promote the concerns of the politically disenfranchised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357213483061">Poovey, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357213483061">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357213483061">1998</xref>). The attempt to document the experience of human suffering and have this inform our social understanding of the world was cast as a cultural activity that was geared to promote a dissident point-of-view and as a provocation that was designed to unsettle establishment sensibilities; particularly as it worked to make <italic>visible</italic> the harms done to people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470357213483061">Roberts, 2002</xref>: 258–331).</p>

<title>Provocation as Praxis</title>
<p>Many humanitarian campaigners of the 19th century were keenly alert to the fact that by their use of visual materials to document human suffering, they were set to court public hostility. It was widely recognised that, insofar as a public appeal was made to moral feeling, one was set to be cast as a soft hearted liberal and further that, by working to visualize human suffering, one was liable to be denounced as a purveyor of ‘sensationalism’. They were left in no doubt that not only by their opposition to social practices and conditions that caused people much suffering, but also by the cultural means through which they sought to make humanitarian concerns a matter of social conscience, they were bound to attract many critical and moral objections to their work.</p>
<p>For example, it is now acknowledged that many of those involved in anti-slavery campaigns devoted considerable time and resources to justifying their campaign tactics and to crafting their materials in reflexive anticipation of the ways these were likely to be interpreted and used by people operating with no sympathy for the abolitionist cause. Whilst convinced that the pictorial representation of human suffering was the ‘ammunition’ that was most likely to convince people that slavery was morally objectionable and that it should be outlawed on humanitarian grounds, they often expressed much anxiety over their lack of control over the ways in which the imagery of suffering was set to be appropriated by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483061">Abruzzo, 2011</xref>). For example, campaigners such as Lydia Maria Child expressed much anxiety over the potential for images of physical torture and visual documentations of the terrible injuries suffered by slaves through beatings and whippings to be appropriated by some people as a ‘pornographic’ pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483061">Clark, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483061">Halttunen, 1995</xref>). Indeed, there is now a distinct literature devoted to the study of the varied and complex ‘textual strategies’ adopted by Child and her associates as part of their efforts to mitigate the risk that their writing would operate as no more than a form of ‘erotic exploitation’ of the victims of slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357213483061">Sorisio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470357213483061">Spelman, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, it might be argued that in <italic>Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp</italic> (1856), a book crafted in response to the many critical objections to <italic>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</italic> (1852), Harriet Beecher Stowe outlined the critical standpoint that informed her continued commitment to the cultural politics of sentimentalism; she makes clear that her concern lies not so much in disciplining the terms of public debate, but rather in provoking a moral reaction among her readers in the hope that this might serve as fertile ground for initiating critical reflection on prevailing moral codes and opinion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357213483061">Gregg Crane (1996)</xref> contends that Stowe believed that, all too often, the rational culture that presided over systems of law operated in a politically conservative manner and worked to obstruct the possibility of questioning established convention. In this regard, she took ‘the eruption of moral sympathetic feeling’ evoked by the graphic depiction of cruelty towards slaves as a ‘sure signal’ that all individuals were entitled to ‘fundamental human rights’ (pp. 177–186). She was also heavily invested in the understanding that it was only by being made to experience ‘moral-emotional dissonance’ that large numbers of people could be provoked into critical thinking and action in opposition to slavery. Crane contends that, although Stowe fully recognised the danger that by force of moral sentiment it was possible for people to rush towards the belief that they were morally licensed to seize power at all costs, nevertheless, she remained convinced that such passion was necessary for sustaining the political solidarity and strength of will to realise human rights. He argues that whilst her characterisation of Dred, the revolutionary leader of the slaves living on the swamp, conveys Stowe’s misgivings over the potential for moral sentiment to breed insurrectionary violence, nevertheless she held on to the belief that it was by the eruption of moral feeling that alternative social worlds were rendered imaginable; and further, that the struggle to realise more humane forms of society was sustained more by emotion than by point of principle. At the same time, it is possible to argue that Stowe reached an ‘imaginative impasse’ in her literary portrayal of a humanitarian revolution rooted in and sustained by social sympathy; she remained convinced that it was by being spurred into critical thinking about the causes and consequences of human suffering through the provocation of conflicted moral feelings that people might be inspired to campaign for humanitarian social justice.</p>

<title>For Discussion</title>
<p>Whilst I recognise a value in making the ‘humanitarian social imaginary’ the subject for ideological critique, I also hold that we should be working to understand how the critical objections to humanitarianism are reflexively incorporated within humanitarian campaign work. Indeed, many of those engaged in the cultural politics of humanitarianism in contemporary social science can be recognised as operating from a critical standpoint that is akin to that of Child and Stowe. For example, by presenting us with photographs of human suffering and giving privileged space in his work to personal narratives on experiences of material hardship and social deprivation, medical anthropologist and human rights campaigner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483061">Paul Farmer(2005)</xref> acknowledges that he is set to traverse many moral and political minefields. He openly worries over the extent to which his publications serve to make his readers ‘habituated to horror’ or encourage them to dismiss ‘displeasing images’ as ‘gratuitous’ or ‘pornographic’ (pp. 153, 164). At the same time, however, he remains committed to using visual and viscerally charged representations of human misery as a means to morally unsettle and shock his readers into critical thinking and political action. Farmer holds that the cultivation of moral sentiment is necessary for galvanizing movements to promote the rights of the poor and for forging ties of solidarity with the victims of social injustice. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357213483061">Susan Sontag (2003)</xref>, he operates with the resolve ‘to locate our privilege on the same map as the suffering of our contemporaries’ and to this end contends that ‘the road from unstable emotions to genuine entitlements – rights – is one we must travel if we are to transform humane values into meaningful and effective programs that will serve precisely those who need our empathy and solidarity most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483061">Farmer, 2005</xref>: 152–156).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, in their photo-ethnography of ‘dopefiends’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213483061">Philippe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg (2009</xref>: 9) openly admit to being concerned about the extent to which their images of drug users serve ‘to fuel a voyeuristic pornography of suffering’. Moreover, whilst crafting their text with the aim of contextualising visual representations of human suffering with authentic social and cultural meaning, they acknowledge the ever-present risk that their work leaves too much either distorted or undisclosed. Nevertheless, they still hold that it is vitally important to evoke an emotional response from their readers. They aim ‘to expose the distress of the socially vulnerable’ and make the moral disquiet that is thereby experienced by their readers, a means to ‘humanize’ the social perception of drug users. Once again, whilst openly acknowledging that their methods of social documentation involve them courting many contradictory tensions for the sake of bringing experiences of social suffering to public debate, they hold it necessary to broker with unstable emotions. In this regard, the promotion of practical measures of progressive health care and welfare reform is held to require not only a revision of common cultural categories of social understanding, but also a radical reconfiguration of moral feeling.</p>
<p>Whilst identifying many risks inherent within their praxis, Paul Farmer, Philippe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg retain a commitment to nourishing moral sentiment as a means to draw public attention to social suffering and to provoke debate over the bounds of the moral and political responsibilities ‘we’ bear towards ‘others’. Like many before them, they operate under the conviction that both the acquisition of social understanding and the desire to take action to create more humane forms of society are allied to a cultural politics of compassion. Although acknowledging that they are using ‘unstable’ cultural practices that often fail to meet with the humanitarian ambitions to which they are set, they nevertheless recognise these as indispensable for the provocation of critical thinking about the moral condition of society. They work to involve us in many of the ethical anxieties and methodological frustrations that they have borne through their research and writing. They do not seek, moreover, to remove themselves from bearing responsibility for the possibility that their texts and photographs might be culturally appropriated to ends opposed to their original design. At the same time, it is by working to infuse their works with these tensions and by confronting such risks that they aim to make possible forms of social disclosure that would otherwise remain hidden from view. Indeed, they often credit the most morally difficult, emotionally charged and semantically unstable passages of their work as being most capable of raising the human–social situation up for political recognition and critical debate. It is the provocation to critical thinking and moral debate that is important here.</p>
<p>I am interested not only in how we should venture to place humanitarian culture in question, but also how we should analyse the values and premises by which it is approached as questionable. To this end, it is not my intention to argue for a position in opposition to critics such as Boltanski, Calhoun and Chouliaraki, but rather to suggest that at the same time as taking them as a useful guide to understanding the cultural experience of our society, we should also attend to the limitations of their cultural standpoints and how these can be located within particular traditions of critique. We should not only be working to unmask the ideological potential of humanitarianism when enacted as a cultural performance, met as a cultural experience or when featured as a component of media representations of world problems, but also to sensitize ourselves to the cultural origins and value commitments of the critical conventions through which we seek to render the moral and political meanings of these phenomena as matters for debate.</p>
<p>A politics of truth is at stake here, and the risk is that, whilst so heavily involved in the critique of humanitarianism, we position ourselves beyond the reach of critical scrutiny. Moreover, a further risk is that by our critical ardour we diminish the object of our critique. As far as the ‘humanitarian social imaginary’ is concerned, this may lead us to the point where we fail to recognise that it holds cultural significance not so much as a moral guide to social action, but more as provocation to think about the conflicted moral terrain on which we are required to act. On this understanding, we should not be so much interested in how the ‘humanitarian social imaginary’ operates to the detriment of critical thinking, but rather attend to its potential to provoke us into taking this up as a valued part of public life.</p>
