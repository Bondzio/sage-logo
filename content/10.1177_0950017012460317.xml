<abstract>
<p>The article focuses on emotional labour and self-identity at the Irish-owned Aer Lingus airline from 1998 to 2008. It has been suggested that emotional labour is likely to be an increasingly important feature of frontline service jobs. However, in this case management has reduced the level of emotional labour requirement while work organization, recruitment policy and training have changed to focus on sales and lower labour costs, intensifying workloads and reducing cabin crew autonomy. Although some may suggest that a reduction in emotional labour requirement would be a positive outcome for employees, this is not how it has been perceived by some cabin crew. Long-serving cabin crew in particular see these changes as an attack on their professionalism and a challenge to their identity as skilled emotion workers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been suggested that customer-facing service work will increasingly require workers to control their emotions as an important dimension of the service provided to the customer, particularly as a means to differentiate the product or service in a context of an increasing proliferation of similarly priced products. This suggests that the psychological nature of the product has become more significant, placing more importance on the interaction between employees and customers, leading some employers to require employees to suppress or display specific sets of emotions with the aim of inducing particular feelings or responses in customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460317">Noon and Blyton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460317">Gabriel, 2009</xref>). Emotional labour (EL) therefore involves the display of emotions which may or may not be truly felt. In cases where employees have to demonstrate feelings that they do not share, they can be seen as performing or ‘acting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460317">Fineman, 2000</xref>). In some respects ‘acting’ is a normal part of social life: individuals carry out a series of scripted performances ‘acting out’ parts which are consistent with their self-identity, performing different scripts in different social situations and adjusting their performances as conditions change. However, the key difference between such behaviour inside and outside of work is that, in the former, workers’ discretion over the choice of displayed feelings may be removed or reduced with the emotional performance forming part of the wage effort bargain and supported by sanctions and rewards suggesting a commodification of workers’ emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460317">Jocoy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460317">Noon and Blyton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Workers perform EL in different ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild (1983)</xref>, for example, suggests that workers engage in ‘surface acting’ or ‘deep acting’. The former requires the faking of emotions, resulting in some level of behavioural compliance, but with no attempt to internalize display rules. Deep acting, however, involves employees internalizing their role in an attempt to experience the required emotions, facilitated by organizational training programmes which attempt to develop a set of inner feelings towards the organization, the customer and the job role which are intended to automatically lead to the required behaviour. Nevertheless, it also quite possible that, in some circumstances, the employee does not need to act at all as the expected emotional display is fully consistent with the employee’s own feelings (Ashforth and Humphrey, 1993).</p>
<p>Organizations draw on societal emotion rules and then adopt them to create their own codes of emotion propriety which dictate what is the ‘right’ behaviour for different job roles and workers can draw on these social norms and organizational ‘feeling rules’ to balance EL demands in the workplace. In other words, professional and organizational norms underpin what people in such roles should and should not display or feel. However, there can be tension between organizational rules and societal norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460317">Fineman, 2000</xref>), especially where management attempts to produce the ‘appropriate individual’ by tightly prescribing the self-identities of workers by aligning the individual’s self-conceptions with organizationally inspired discourses, in order to enhance commitment, loyalty, motivation and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460317">Alvesson and Willmott, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460317">Haslam et al., 2003</xref>). Arguably then it is more difficult for employees to sustain a separate sense of ‘self’ from that imposed by the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460317">Hughes, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been argued that unacceptable EL demands can lead to negative consequences for employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild, 1983</xref>), leading to an imbalance between felt and displayed emotion which can create ‘emotional dissonance’. This is an estrangement between the self and the display of feelings, which in turn can lead to stress, burnout and problems with personal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0950017012460317">Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460317">Noon and Blyton, 2007</xref>). Employers’ attempts to subsume employee identity within organizational goals can also exacerbate individual and collective resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460317">Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0950017012460317">Taylor and Bain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012460317">Peccei and Rosenthal, 2000</xref>), especially where emotion labour has been linked to changes in service provision, which result in work intensification of both the physical and emotional aspects of jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460317">Boyd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460317">Harris, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, attempts to control the identities of employees are at best precarious and contested as identities are pluralistic, complex, contradictory and fluid, both sustained and constrained by social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460317">Collinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012460317">Thomas, 2009</xref>). In other words, a significantly smaller proportion of ‘feelings rules’ may come under the sway of large organizations than some have suggested. Furthermore, EL itself does not always result in negative outcomes for workers – they are not always ‘hapless victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460317">2009</xref>). Workers may derive pleasure from serving customers and receiving a positive response from customers in return, positively identifying with work roles when the required emotional display rules are consistent with their self-identity and personal values. The fit between personal values and job roles may also be the reason that some workers decide to take up their jobs to begin with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2004</xref>). More recent studies have found a combination of both negative and positive consequences of emotional labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460317">Ashforth and Humphrey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460317">Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460317">Mann, 2005</xref>) suggesting that too much emphasis is placed on EL’s negative repercussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2004</xref>). However, a lot may depend on the extent of EL requirement and some studies have shown that workers are less likely to experience emotional exhaustion if they have greater autonomy over how they carry out their work, if the worker’s personal characteristics are similar to the job requirements and if workers have the ability to switch off at the end of the working day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012460317">Wharton, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460317">Lewis (2005)</xref> also suggests that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild (1983)</xref> focuses too much on management control processes while underestimating human agency, suggesting that the construction of identity involves an element of choice and intentionality in which individuals appropriate certain discourses and reject others. However, there remains a ‘black box’ surrounding how individuals might choose one identity rather than another and the motivation for doing so, but also how the question of ‘who we are’ dynamically interacts with the question of ‘who our organization wants us to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012460317">Thomas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017012460317">Thomas and Davies, 2011</xref>). We therefore need to understand what motivates employees to enact feelings rules in distinct ways in a context in which such motivations are embedded in social relationships, institutionalized practices, hierarchical power relationships and social positioning as well as individual conceptions of ‘self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460317">Erickson and Wharton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460317">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The commercial airline industry has traditionally demanded a high level of emotional display rules requiring cabin crew to become skilled ‘emotion managers’, able to manoeuvre between the complexities of deep acting, surface acting and various coping techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460317">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0950017012460317">Williams, 2003</xref>). It therefore provides an appropriate context to examine the implications of shifts in the forms and levels of EL required by management and its correlation with cabin crew identities. In this article we examine the changing nature of work organization and level of EL requirement for Aer Lingus cabin crew based in Ireland in the period from 1998 to 2008. The article attempts to answer a number of questions. To what extent is EL seen as an important aspect of overall management strategy and what level of EL performance is required? In what ways might management change the level of EL requirement in cabin crew jobs? Is EL perceived as a positive or negative by these workers and is it carried out for intrinsic or only extrinsic rewards? What are the implications of changes in EL requirement for the identities of cabin crew?</p>

<title>Research methods</title>
<p>The findings derive predominantly from one-to-one semi-structured interviews and an analysis of documentary materials. We suggest that such face-to-face interviews are an appropriate way to obtain accurate accounts that are based on personal experience and help us understand how individuals construct meaning and the significance of their situation and the beliefs and values they have developed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460317">Burgess, 1982</xref>). One of the authors also worked as cabin crew with Aer Lingus for seven years from 1997 to 2004, allowing for some ‘retrospective’ participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460317">Bulmer, 1982</xref>). Although this author did not develop a research interest in the original work setting, it allowed for an immersion in this setting which provided a fuller understanding of the present, even though such construction may vary depending on interpretive, retroductive or sense-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460317">Cox and Hassard, 2007</xref>). This prior employment experience therefore shaped our understanding of the issues, providing invaluable and rich insights into the changing nature of work, the relations between cabin crew, management and passengers and the way in which cabin crew identify with their jobs in this company. This previous experience also shaped the rationale for gaining access. Our existing knowledge of the airline suggested that gaining formal and adequate interview access to cabin crew would be very difficult. It was therefore decided not to try to seek formal access to the organization, but to use personal contacts of the ex-cabin crew author together with snowballing techniques to gain access to participants. We suggest that this approach was justified in that, even at an early stage, a number of potential interviewees made it clear that, although they were happy to take part in the research, they did not want senior management to know of their participation. We were open and honest about the purpose of the research and every participant gave fully informed consent prior to interviews taking place.</p>
<p>In total 38 face-to-face interviews were carried out between 2006 and October 2008; 27 of these we describe as ‘formal’ and 11 as ‘informal’. The 27 formal interviews were recorded and transcribed and varied in length between one and three hours. They included four male cabin crew and 14 female cabin crew, some of whom were interviewed more than once, and included two shop stewards. Eight of these had been employed for between four and 15 years, with the remainder being employed for between several months and three years. Interviews were also carried out with one line manager and three trade union officials, two from the <italic>Irish Municipal Public and Civil Trade Union (IMPACT)</italic> and one from the Services, Industrial and Professional Trade Union (SIPTU).</p>
<p>The 11 ‘informal’ interviews were with a completely different sample of cabin crew, based on a more opportunistic approach to access and having a much shorter duration of only around 20 minutes each. These took place between 2007 and 2008 while travelling on six transatlantic and European flights. During these flights the ex-cabin crew author talked to cabin crew while they were taking their breaks, asking similar questions to those in the formal interviews. Written notes were made immediately after each one of these shorter interviews. However, all the quotations in this article are taken from the 27 ‘formal’ interviews.</p>

<title>Changing strategy and shifting EL requirement</title>
<p>Aer Lingus is the national flag carrier of the Republic of Ireland. It was originally part-state-owned but was privatized in 2006. In the period under observation the airline has had a number of chief executive officers (CEOs) who we suggest have imposed varying approaches to work organization and emotional labour practices: first, Michael Foley and John Donovan up to 2001; second, Willie Walsh from 2001 to 2004; Dermot Mannion from 2005 to 2009; and Christoph Mueller from September 2009 onwards.</p>
<p>In the 1960s Aer Lingus cabin crew had to wear white underwear, have their nails and hair checked and drinks were served from trays not trolleys. They were young, female and single, poised, middle class and providing the ‘A-B of mothering and titivation’. The occupation would not have been thought of as a ‘job’ at all, but more like ‘a sky-high finishing school’ offering the height of sophisticated service and luxury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460317">McCarthy, 2001</xref>). Even up until the Willie Walsh era Aer Lingus continued to operate its full service carrier (FSC) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460317">ITWF, 2002</xref>) which was still referred to as ‘full frills’. It catered to travellers with a need for frequent scheduling, flight connections and primary airport slots. Service differentiation was created through free airport lounges, complimentary food, alcoholic drinks and highly trained deferential staff and a high level of EL performance, a service style Dermot Mannion later described as ‘impressive, sophisticated, pricey and smart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460317">Mannion, 2008</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>Long-serving cabin crew state that the pre-2001 approach to training reflected the airline’s strong focus on customer service and reinforced behavioural compliance. They were trained to use a repertoire of facial, bodily and verbal expressions, for example using a low voice and maintaining an amenable eye contact with passengers. ‘Scenario’ training taught cabin crew to placate ‘irrational’ passengers while maintaining display rules, for example consciously reconceptualizing an offensive customer as a person requiring sympathy. Long-serving cabin crew recalled a number of phrases which summed up the EL requirement before 2001: ‘let the uniform absorb it’; treat passengers ‘as guests in your home’. Crew were instructed to create a natural, effortless and positive impression with management and emphasized the importance of the first interaction with passengers. There were no sales of food or drink items to be concerned with. Crew were able to focus on providing a high quality of service to customers. They had some autonomy and control over food and drink which could be used to ‘reward’ or ‘punish’ customers and made it easier to express genuine and positive emotional labour displays.</p>
<p>Following the emergence and success of the low cost carriers (LCCs) such as Ryanair, most major airlines fell into financial difficulties by the end of the 1990s. Aer Lingus appointed Willie Walsh as CEO in 2001, who introduced a ‘survival plan’ to transform the airline into a LCC. This plan included the reduction of over 2,000 staff, extensive changes in work practices, a pay freeze, the sale of non-essential assets and a lower fare strategy. Within 12 months Aer Lingus achieved a remarkable turnaround in its financial performance and became one of the few profitable airlines in the industry at that time. In the 2003 annual report, the chairman thanked management for the ‘significant progress made in transforming the business into a low fares airline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460317">ALAR, 2003</xref>: 1). The result was a considerable shift away from FSC. Complimentary food and beverages were withdrawn from most flights to make way for in-flight sales. Long-serving cabin crew state that there was no longer any concern for EL performance in the new approach and that this was reflected in the new Aer Lingus slogan ‘low fares, way better’ (2001). However, Mr Walsh’s attempt to change Aer Lingus into another Ryanair caused considerable industrial unrest and his proposal for a management buy-out arguably pushed the government and the unions too far.</p>
<p>Despite its cost-reduction strategy it was clear that Aer Lingus could not compete with Ryanair, which in 2003 had over 10,000 passengers per flight crew compared with just over 1,500 at Aer Lingus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460317">Barrett, 2004</xref>). From 2005 under the new CEO Dermot Mannion the airline continued to pursue low fares, but with ‘superior’ service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460317">ALAR, 2006–10</xref>) and this was represented by the slogan ‘low fares with a smile’, which changed to ‘enjoy your flight’ in 2009. However, while cabin crew state that there was plenty of evidence for cost-cutting strategies, there appears to be scant indication of any serious attempt to reintroduce EL performance to its previous level, resulting in much scepticism among long-serving cabin crew. One male cabin crew put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>They might say there’s a new focus on customer service blah blah blah … at the end of the day its bums on seats as many as possible and hopefully we’ll cover the costs and make a profit that’s what it’s all about now and the emotions that go with it … out the door.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Cabin crew also point out that customer service training was reduced after 2001 from one week to just two days. Another long-serving male cabin crew stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>We were trained 10/11 years earlier how to react slowly to the passengers if they snap at you or give an answer you’re not happy with, whereas new people are giving their replies back willy-nilly saying ‘you stay quiet’ and walking away. Then there’s ruction on board … The difference is we were shown how to approach a customer, how to act.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012460317">
<title>Work intensification and rostering</title>
<p>In 2008 Aer Lingus management was still praising its staff and their quality as a key reason that customers chose the airline (ALAR, 2008: 4):
<disp-quote>
<p>… The tremendous loyalty and commitment shown by Aer Lingus staff, combined with their care for passengers, sets the airline apart from the rest.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, since 2001 cabin crew state that managements’ exclusive concern has been to increase cabin crew productivity and workloads while simultaneously diminishing their terms and conditions of employment and reducing staff numbers. Some 90 per cent of Aer Lingus cabin crew are unionized (mostly members of SIPTU or IMPACT) and management and unions had established collective agreements providing for rest periods and other working conditions that went well beyond the International Aviation Authority (IAA) minimum health and safety requirements. Nevertheless, since 2001 these better conditions have gradually been eroded down to the legal limits. Cabin crew state that most of them now regularly work the maximum permissible hours under the IAA, what is referred to as flight time limitation (FTL). One male cabin crew stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s fatigue – you’re working a harder roster. They throw in an Atlantic, late Europes, early Europes. I can say I haven’t been as tired in the last 15 years as I have been in the last six months that’s for sure. They’re tightening up the working hours, more productivity, they’re maximizing.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Despite suggestions that cabin crew productivity had already increased by 340 per cent in one decade, more job losses were announced in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460317"><italic>Infoireland</italic>, 2008</xref>) suggesting that management was still not satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012460317">Sheenan, 2009</xref>: 22):
<disp-quote>
<p>… more is required [Aer Lingus] … must deliver efficiencies, enhance productivity and eliminate outdated legacy work practices</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Pressure for more ‘flexible’ rostering has been continuous. In 2008 cabin crew were having to make bids to work certain shifts (referred to as bid lines) on either European, transatlantic, early or late shifts, with a range of combinations available. The bid system is based on cabin crew seniority, with long-serving cabin crew usually guaranteed preferred flights. However, the majority of cabin crew now work a general roster which means that they can be expected to work on any flight, but they are entitled to make a limited number of requests for certain days off or for specific flights. Management has continually pressed for all cabin crew to go on a general roster and have repeatedly raised the issue as part of their cost-cutting plans. Long-serving crew, most of whom have families, are worried that they will lose what little regularity and structure they have in their lives if they are forced onto the general roster, as one male cabin crew member stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not fair of the company to say we want everyone on general because nobody has any kind of regular life.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a result, both male and female cabin crew participants who were employed before 2001 state that relations with management have soured considerably since that time and the changes in working conditions have led to a number of serious industrial relations conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017012460317">Wallace et al., 2006</xref>). Most notably, it was the issue of cabin crew rosters that were at the centre of a dispute in January 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017012460317">Wall, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0950017012460317">
<title>Removing skilled emotion workers</title>
<p>The changes in working conditions are also reflected in the shift in recruitment policy and the increasing divide between those employed over 10 years ago and the ‘junior’ cabin crew who have been employed more recently. Newer workers sometimes referred to long-serving crew as ‘old school’. One female ‘junior’ stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a division between crew who are … junior and senior. The junior have come into a company that’s very different than the people who are here 10 or 15 years.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants suggest that the divide is particularly noticeable with regard to the attitude and aptitude to carry out emotional labour and, according to long-serving crew, these differences are largely attributable to changes in recruitment policy. In the 1980s most cabin crew held a diploma or degree, often in a nursing qualification. One participant recalled applying for her job along with 12 other successful applicants who held university degrees in various disciplines. However, Aer Lingus dropped the requirement for a diploma or degree in 2001. The line manager stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The company came to the conclusion that they didn’t need that calibre of person to do the specific job we do.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, while the change in policy arguably reduced the status of these jobs, it also has had other implications. A lower qualificational requirement arguably lowers applicants’ expectations about the job and its remuneration level and also reduces cabin crews’ ability to negotiate for higher remuneration as they become easier to replace.</p>
<p>The process of recruitment has also changed. Prior to 2004 a typical recruitment panel comprised of one person from human resource management and one or two cabin crew supervisors. After 2001 senior cabin crew were removed from the selection panel without consultation and in many cases cabin crew vacancies were filled with redeployed Aer Lingus staff from outsourced divisions such as catering, storage and cargo. Long-serving cabin crew were angered by these practices. One male cabin crew member stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>If they had similar job specifications … like they had for us 10 years ago then they obviously didn’t have the personable attributes we had when we went for our interview. So they were put in a job that didn’t have them in contact with the public for different reasons … they are rough, what they would say to passengers what they would do and how they act, it’s jaw dropping …</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Despite management rhetoric about the need for superior service there were continuing attempts to remove long-serving, less ‘flexible’ and better paid workers. For example, a leaked human resource department document in 2005 suggested that some workers be given ‘a tap on the shoulder’ and told that they have no future with the company. It also suggested that management impose tedious training schedules, provide less desirable uniforms and introduce ‘adverse changes in work/shift patterns’ to make the job less appealing to long-serving cabin crew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012460317">Sheenan, 2005</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by 2007 management appeared to have had some concerns about declining EL performance and services standards and the increase in cabin crew deviating from display rules. Cabin crew report the reintroduction of cabin crew supervisors in the recruitment and selection process, largely to ensure better job-personality congruence, which interviewees suggest resulted in a more robust screening and termination process.</p>

<title>The decline in EL performance and the shift to extrinsic rewards</title>
<p>Increasing work intensification, deteriorating conditions and reducing EL performance have been accompanied by the shift to in-flight sales which are now a key source of ancillary revenue at Aer Lingus, growing by 34 per cent in 2006, 37.7 per cent in 2008 and 11 per cent in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460317">ALAR, 2006–10</xref>). In-flight sales also augment cabin crew wages. Crew earn 11 per cent commission on in-flight sales, with such commission now becoming a significant proportion of their earnings.</p>
<p>On short European routes where everything is for sale, cabin crew state that almost the entire flight is spent trying to complete the food/drinks sales service and crew no longer have the time to attend to passengers unless there is an emergency such as illness. This is because sales transactions take time as money is exchanged and crew need to continually return to the galley to replenish trolleys. On longer European flights cabin crew interviewees state that it has now become the norm that crew disappear into the galleys when not carrying out food sales. In the past cabin crew state that they would have walked through the cabin, engaging in eye contact and offering additional water and juice. now most hurry through the cabin avoiding interaction with passengers. It could be argued that the intrinsic rewards associated with stronger EL performance, such as less intense working conditions and more autonomy, have been replaced by the extrinsic rewards associated with commission from sales, encouraging cabin crew to perform EL in a limited way and only in anticipation of and during a sales transaction. One female cabin crew states:
<disp-quote>
<p>You see cabin crew that take no interest until it comes to sales, its sell, sell, sell, and then they’re very nice because it’s in their heads ‘here’s where I make my money’, but the other part of the flight you wouldn’t have the same attention to detail or care.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Long-serving crew suggest that these changes have caused an attitudinal shift towards EL in both management and cabin crew. Selling has become many cabin crews’ exclusive reason for performing EL, as one experienced female cabin crew stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>You were told to walk around the cabin – see if anyone wants a glass of water, now it’s ‘ah why would I want to do that? What’s the point in going through the cabin, there’s nothing in it for us’ … whereas in our training the focus was on the customer not the pay and that’s nearly what they’re trying to do now.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly another long-serving female cabin crew stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>When we started there was nothing for sale on board, the only thing to sell was trying to get repeat business and the way you did that was by promoting this attitude that we take care of passengers and they come back with you. Now the bottom line is money.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Cabin crew state that working on more flights and quicker turnarounds between flights means that they have less time and energy to perform EL. Other studies have also found that increased workloads tend to lead to emotional exhaustion suggesting that EL becomes more difficult to perform under such conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460317">Cordes and Dougherty, 1993</xref>). Social support among colleagues has been identified as vital in coping with emotion management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460317">Korczynski, 2003</xref>), yet cabin crew state that time constraints imposed by tougher work schedules mean that colleagues have less time and inclination to deal with each other’s emotional challenges, a development which has also been seen in the health sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460317">Mann, 2005</xref>). Other research also suggests that high sales volumes and work intensification tend to lead to reduced displays of positive emotion by employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012460317">Sutton and Rafaeli, 1988</xref>). There is a contradiction in following a cost-cutting strategy while simultaneously advertising increased service quality and driving up customer expectations, which cabin crew state are increasingly difficult to meet, potentially leading to customer abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460317">Boyd, 2002</xref>) and negative consequences for workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460317">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although senior management talks up the Aer Lingus ‘tradition of superior service … [representing] … the best of Irish hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460317">ALAR, 2006–10</xref>: 3), in practice the current focus on cost cutting and sales, less training and lower qualifications undermines it. Before 2001 interviewees state that supervisors were present when cabin crew checked in for duty, making it much more likely that cabin crew would maintain company-sanctioned appearance and demeanour and customer and co-worker feedback would be properly monitored. Now cabin crew supervisors work full flight rosters and do not have the time to fulfil all supervisory duties. Before 2001 customer surveys regarding staff demeanour were treated in a serious manner. These were dropped altogether until the renewed focus on service in 2005. Although surveys have been reinstated, it appears that cabin crew are indifferent to the possibility of negative feedback as many state they have the impression management no longer cares so much about their behaviour. For instance one female crew member commented that she no longer smiles when it is expected of her: ‘whereas before [I] probably would have when [passengers] could fill out a comment card’. Cabin crew supervisors no longer follow up on negative customer feedback as they used to which greatly reduces the company’s ability to monitor and control cabin crew performance.</p>
<p>The fact that management is no longer focused on EL performance as a priority was also reflected in the comments of the line manager who stated that management wanted cabin crew to do their jobs, but to ‘disengage’ from the company, suggesting a considerable departure from the strong identification with the company and the high level of EL performance originally required. Other management initiatives have also been used to ‘revive’ EL performance. A ‘courtesy day’ was introduced in 2008, to highlight cabin crews’ attitude and behaviour towards customers. However, cabin crew are scornful of the endeavour – staff shortages mean that it is nearly impossible to implement the ‘courtesy day’ as cabin crew and supervisors often have to work flight duties on the day they were assigned to meet. One male cabin crew stated: ‘The irony of these courtesy days is out the window because the bottom line is how much money you’re making them and that’s it.’</p>

<sec id="section7-0950017012460317">
<title>The defence of identity and EL performance</title>
<p>Union officials estimate that 50 per cent of the present cabin crew workforce has been recruited since 2004. These changes represent a considerable transformation at Aer Lingus, a company once considered ‘a job for life’. Approximately half the cabin crew have five years or less service with the company and, according to the union officials, labour turnover has also been much higher among more recent recruits. The influx of new employees combined with the voluntary redundancy of many senior cabin crew can be seen as an attempt to bring about an attitudinal change in cabin crew. The line manager stated that Aer Lingus wanted cabin crew to be less involved with the company, to ‘do their work and go home’ and new recruits fit the low cost model ‘seamlessly’. A SIPTU official who has worked with cabin crew since the 1980s stated that the rigorous training, professional standards and cabin crew cohesion has seriously deteriorated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The level of service has gone. In one case a flight from London couldn’t take off because two of the cabin crew decided they weren’t leaving [because] they were out on the razz the night before. Standards don’t seem to be there to deal with the problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Overall interviewees suggest that EL is often ignored altogether or carried out less frequently and with little dedication by the majority of crew. However, many of the long-serving Aer Lingus crew reject the new regime, stating that management is not only instructing cabin crew to change their attitudes, but is implicitly demanding cabin crew change <italic>who</italic> they are, creating a loss of self-esteem and challenging their ‘self-identity’.</p>
<p>Long-serving cabin crew appeared to have a sophisticated understanding and awareness of the emotion work required in their jobs which they interpreted as acting in a ‘professional’ manner which primarily involved acting and speaking appropriately, treating passengers well and not showing anger or frustration in difficult situations. The word ‘professional’ was frequently used by these cabin crew to describe this aspect of their work.</p>
<p>Despite the constraints placed on them by the new forms of work organization some long-serving crew state they are still willing to produce a high standard of EL performance. More recent recruits also speak of the professionalism and decorum that senior cabin crew exemplify when dealing with passengers. However, according to long-serving crew the decision to share their skills and knowledge with younger workers and their desire to perform EL to a high standard is much more about personal choice than pressure from management or the company control system. On longer transatlantic flights in particular, where food items are free of charge and there is more time to interact with customers, cabin crew avail of the ‘space’ and some do perform EL. Nevertheless, company cost-cutting strategies have made it more difficult for cabin crew to display EL. Often, for example, there are not enough supplies of drinks to provide any ‘extra’ service.</p>
<p>To deal with these constraints, some long-serving crew state that they do not insist that passengers pay for food as they are too embarrassed to force the issue if passengers became angry. On long-haul flights long-serving crew often give their own meals to passengers when there is a shortfall, something that was rarely necessary in the past (as catering previously supplied surplus meals). Long-serving crew state that they make these gestures to hide what they see as management’s ‘cheapness’, which they see as an attack on their professionalism and self-image. In these situations the company benefits from this ‘professionalism’ while still cutting costs. At the same time other cabin crew have responded by becoming hostile to management and investing minimal effort physically and emotionally which is likely to have more negative implications for the company. Some have withdrawn from EL physically, by hiding in the galleys, and some no longer internalize their roles. A number of crew state that theft and absenteeism have increased since 2001, but management has to some extent neutralized these problems through stricter stock control and more convoluted and stricter sick leave policies.</p>
<p>Arguably long-serving cabin crew resist management changes because the focus on sales compounds the impression that cabin crew members have less value as a group and as individuals, which other studies have shown can cause considerable unease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012460317">Rafaeli and Sutton, 1987</xref>). Indeed, many participants report an incident in which a senior human resource manager insisted on referring to cabin crew as ‘unskilled labourers’ during discussions with trade union officials. ‘Old school’ cabin crew participants still see themselves as having valuable attributes essential for the performance of EL and have arguably internalized their cabin crew role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild, 1983</xref>). Newer cabin crew do not appear to experience the same internal conflict. Management shows some awareness of these issues and to some extent appears to accept that there is now a lack of incentive for cabin crew to perform EL. As one male manager stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that people that go the extra mile do so based on what they refer to as their own personal standards and not the company’s expectation of them fundamentally. It’s their expectation of themselves.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The decision to continue to perform EL in order to maintain their own sense of professionalism arguably contributes to a feeling of personal accomplishment, as suggested in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460317">Fisher and Ashkanasy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460317">Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460317">Diefendorff and Gosserand, 2003</xref>) with EL becoming a personal rather than organizational goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460317">Greenglass, 2001</xref>). This argument suggests that the significance of human agency, motivation and institutionalized practices should not be underestimated and that an overemphasis on management control can be misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460317">Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2009</xref>). Long-serving cabin crew state it is solely their choice to perform higher levels of emotional control than that required by management. For management the ‘commitment-based’ control of EL now plays a lesser role, while the direct, bureaucratic and technical control processes surrounding sales have become more dominant. The intrinsic rewards associated with better conditions, greater autonomy and the performance of EL have been replaced with tighter organizational controls and extrinsic rewards linked to in-flight sales targets. These match the experiences and expectations of new recruits, but do not ‘fit’ for long-serving crew. As one long-serving female cabin crew stated: ‘New girls do not have the same attitude towards the job. It’s just a means to earn money and that’s it. They don’t get anything else out of it.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0950017012460317" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There appears to be a general assumption in much of the literature that EL is likely to become an increasing feature of modern employment in customer-facing jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460317">Noon and Blyton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460317">Gabriel, 2009</xref>), with a larger swathe of feelings rules coming under the control of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460317">Alvesson and Willmott, 2002</xref>). It has also been suggested that the changing composition of the contemporary workforce requires higher levels of discretion and tacit skills, encouraging self-autonomy, flexibility of workplace controls and greater identification with the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017012460317">Thomas and Davies, 2011</xref>). However, while this may hold true in some cases, these findings question these assertions, suggesting that more attention needs to be focused on how changing business priorities may impact on the levels of autonomy and skills and EL demanded by employers in the face of a shifting competitive climate. The findings suggest that, in some cases, EL may not always be such an important aspect of service sector work, even in occupations traditionally associated with a high EL requirement.</p>
<p>Before 2001, Aer Lingus cabin crew were encouraged to develop expertise as skilled emotion managers, able to manoeuvre between the complexities of deep acting, surface acting and various coping techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460317">Hochschild, 1983</xref>) and to take pride in the professionalism with which they carried out emotional labour demands. At that time cabin crew had more autonomy, with higher staffing levels, a less intense work regime and better conditions of work. In such circumstances high levels of EL performance were seen as a source of intrinsic reward for many cabin crew and were associated with professionalism in the job. However, since 2001 management has tried to remove long-serving crew who strongly identified with the company, reduced EL training, recruited workers with lower qualifications, intensified workloads through the introduction of food and drink sales, more flexible rostering and the reduction of staff levels, leading to deteriorating terms and conditions of work. In effect moving towards a cheaper, more ‘flexible’ workforce and arguably shifting the focus of control away from responsible autonomy to a more direct and autocratic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012460317">Sosteric, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Publicly at least, management at Aer Lingus appears to be reluctant to admit that EL and service quality has been diminished in favour of labour cost reductions, giving rise to some glaring contradictions. There have been piecemeal attempts to ‘reprioritize’ EL since 2005, such as the restoration of cabin crew supervisors on recruitment and selection panels in 2007 and the courtesy day introduced in 2008. However, these initiatives have been subverted by work intensification, the reduction in qualification requirements and a reduction in EL supervision and training. Furthermore, attempts to remove long-serving cabin crew, the ‘custodians of emotional work’, has also undermined managerial espoused efforts to re-establish the high regard for emotional work once held by most crew. This paradoxical situation is arguably driven by the need to provide more competitive fares, but also the need to differentiate from other operators. The result is that most crew (especially newer recruits) now adopt merely instrumental displays of EL, do not engage in deep acting, or they hide in the galley to avoid contact with passengers, suggesting that EL is no longer seen in a positive way by many cabin crew. The reduction in the level of EL performance and standard of service more generally could partly be seen as a response to the lack of intrinsic rewards (once associated with a more relaxed and service-oriented system of work organization) and a shift towards the extrinsic rewards related to sales commissions. This outcome could also be interpreted as an attempt to change the culture of the organization, as ‘junior’ crew accept the new work regime and gradually become the majority of the workforce, while the long-serving crew are gradually removed from the organization.</p>
<p>These changes have created much dissatisfaction among long-serving cabin crew which has resulted in some individual and collective forms of resistance. Individually some long-serving crew no longer want to put in the extra effort required to produce high levels of EL performance. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460317">Cobble and Merrill (2009)</xref> suggest that weakening relations between cabin crew and customers could weaken workers’ attempts to mobilize broad support in times of industrial conflict, the fact that management no longer wants cabin crew to strongly identify with the employer suggests that traditional forms of collective resistance may become more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460317">Fleming and Sewell, 2002</xref>) and this has been borne out by a considerable number of industrial conflicts and collective action by Aer Lingus crew which are still evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017012460317">Wallace et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017012460317">Wall, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although most new crew are no longer concerned about high EL standards, many long-serving cabin crew still see this as important, occasionally undertaking aspects of emotion work which are no longer required by management, and from which management clearly benefits in terms of customer relations. Work identity has been shown to be a central part of the whole identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012460317">Simpson, 2004</xref>) and in this case self-identity can be seen as an important (although not exclusive) element in understanding the perspectives and actions of long-serving crew, who continue to hold strong notions about their own identities and their view of what their job should be about, deriving their identity from the original social domains and relationships at the airline before 2001 in what was then seen as a high status job. Their actions could be seen as an example of the ‘authenticity motive’; that is, a desire to affirm and express one’s real self to the extent that other considerations are outweighed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460317">Erickson and Wharton, 1997</xref>). The goals, values and beliefs that constitute self-conception may be seen as the ‘right way’ for one to be, where behaving authentically is ‘good’ and inauthentically is ‘bad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460317">Ashforth and Tomiuk, 2000</xref>). Management’s decision to reduce EL requirement could be seen as an attempt to <italic>re-manufacture</italic> this authenticity away from the notion of the skilled emotion manager to one that is lower skilled, more controlled and sales driven and requiring less identification with the organization. Long-serving workers face a crisis of identity, on the one hand wanting to retain their traditional identity anchor of the ‘skilled emotion manager’ yet on the other hand being faced by a management that is reconstructing cabin crew jobs to something closer to the notion of the unskilled ‘trolley-dolly’. In this case the EL requirement of cabin crew jobs has been ‘downgraded’ by management, yet despite this some long-serving cabin crew still try to maintain a high level of EL performance, suggesting that EL does not necessarily result in an inevitable damage to self-identity in which employees are seen as hapless ‘victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460317">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460317">Bolton, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460317">2009</xref>), but can in some situations be a source of satisfaction and be associated with the protection and assertion of self-identity.</p>
