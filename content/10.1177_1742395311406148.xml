<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> There is significant variation in symptom tolerance before seeking healthcare advice and it has recently been postulated that there may be a similar variation in the degree to which individuals tolerate deviations in physiological body sensations before considering them symptoms. This study looked to explore this transition from sensation to symptom more closely using the clinical entity of chronic catarrh – a frequently presenting problem which represents a putative alteration of a physiological process.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.</p>
<p><bold>Participants:</bold> 19 adult patients presenting with chronic catarrh, persistent throat clearing or post-nasal drip.</p>
<p><bold>Setting:</bold> Secondary care institute in North of England.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Subjects’ accounts revealed three changes in perception of nasopharyngeal mucus that triggered the transition from sensation to symptom: an apparent change in viscosity, quantity, or constancy. Such changes were invariably deemed to have a consequence (threat to wellbeing, social impact, or source of frustration) and invariably drew a response from the sufferer to limit these consequences.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Symptoms representing an aberration of normal body sensations likely develop over time in a series of recognizable phases. Discriminatory markers appear to exist which delineate those body sensations accepted and those considered symptoms. These are discussed with the use of a novel symptom evolution pathway diagram.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395311406148" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Catarrh is an intractable and unattractive symptom that frequently presents in primary care and in ENT outpatient clinics. Its prevalence extends from Northern Europe to the USA and even some sub-Saharan communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395311406148">1</xref></sup> It provides a useful vehicle for exploring a general clinical problem – how everyday physiological body sensations evolve into problematic symptoms. Although help-seeking behaviour and illness beliefs are the focus of a substantial literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395311406148">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395311406148">8</xref></sup> the antecedent transition from normal body sensation to improper body sensation is relatively under-explored outside of the realm of chronic musculoskeletal pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395311406148">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Locker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311406148">10</xref></sup> has previously alluded to, a deviation in a body function may on the one hand be considered to be within the limits of normal and thus dismissible, whilst on the other hand, the same perceived variation in body function may be considered improper and indicative of disorder, and thus, by definition, a symptom. For the purposes of this study, the term <italic>symptom</italic> will infer ‘a sensation or change in bodily function experienced by a patient that is associated with a disease’ in accordance with the definition held in Collins English Dictionary,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395311406148">11</xref></sup> with <italic>disease</italic> itself being taken to imply ‘any impairment of normal physiological function affecting all or part of an organism’ as also held by the same dictionary. Whilst Locker employs the term ‘problematic experiences’ to encompass both deviant sensations and symptoms, it is specifically these two experiences that we are looking to distinguish one from the other. Whether or not help is sought subsequently for these ‘problematic experiences’ lies in the domain of help-seeking behaviour and is out-with the remit of this study. The pathway of symptom evolution can be conceived as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395311406148">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1742395311406148" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Symptom evolution pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311406148-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is well known that there is significant variation in symptom tolerance before seeking healthcare advice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395311406148">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311406148">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395311406148">12</xref></sup> Barsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395311406148">13</xref></sup> has recently postulated that there is similar variation in the degree to which individuals tolerate deviations in their physiological body sensations. Some patients appear to exhibit ‘somatosensory amplification’ – ‘the tendency to experience somatic or visceral sensation as intense, noxious, and disturbing [which] includes an individual’s disposition to focus on unpleasant sensations and to consider them as pathological rather than normal’. Barsky suggests that a variety of body sensations can be amplified including ‘normal physiological sensations, benign dysfunctions and concomitants of sympathetic arousal’, and that such amplification appears to have both trait- and state-like properties. The concept of somatosensory amplification is useful in accounting for the discrepancy in inter-personal experiences of body sensations, but it falls short of explaining those processes which lead to a body sensation being considered an improper intrusion from the perspective of the individual.</p>
<p>This qualitative study describes the use ofillness narratives to better delineate the boundary between normal and problematic body sensations in the particular context of chronic catarrh patients. Chronic catarrh – a sensation of excess mucus in the nose or throat – is a useful vehicle for understanding this transition because mucus production is an everyday physiological body process which frequently varies in quantity and transit time depending on a number of factors, e.g. nasal cycle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395311406148">14</xref></sup> presence of infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395311406148">15</xref></sup> drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395311406148">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395311406148">17</xref></sup> nasal irritants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395311406148">18</xref></sup> and ambient temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395311406148">15</xref></sup> Consequently, many people will experience apparent transient, self-limiting alterations of mucus flow but not all will consider that dysfunction problematic or symptomatic of disorder. The aim of this study was to establish what changes must occur for nasopharyngeal mucus production to be deemed problematic, and to elicit the phenomena that mark this transition.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395311406148"><title>Setting</title>
<p>Ear, Nose and Throat out-patient department within a tertiary referral centre in the North of England.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395311406148" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We approached patients attending a dedicated nasal research clinic for patients referred with a primary complaint of chronic catarrh, post-nasal drip, or persistent throat clearing. Organic causes of participants’ symptoms had been excluded during the consultation and thus this cohort represented those patients who gave a characteristic account of experiencing excess mucus in their nose and throat in the absence of any demonstrable signs of the same. Such patients present a significant clinical quandary to clinicians because this lack of objective evidence defies diagnosis making and because there is a lack of effective treatment strategies available. Beyond this need for an absence of physical signs, there were no exclusion criteria and a cognisant attempt was made to select a study population representative of the range of age, sex, social class and ethnicity attending the nasal research clinic. Given that the patients attending this clinic had all been referred to secondary care by GPs at some point, then it can be assumed that these patients are presenting clinical quandaries in primary care.</p>
<p>Patients were approached at the end of their initial clinic consultation, either by the consulting physician (JAW) or the principal investigator (RAC), and were invited to re-attend for a semi-structured interview with the principal investigator at a later date, with the explicit understanding that such an interview would be for research purposes only and no further interventions or treatments would result from it. The principal investigator was not directly involved with clinical care of the participants and had not met them prior to their consultation. Patients who registered an interest took home an information pack outlining the purpose of the study and were asked to return a consent form if they agreed to be interviewed. Interviews were conducted at a time convenient to the patient and investigator and were all held in a non-consulting room within the outpatient department on separate days. Subjects were offered travel expenses and reimbursement of parking fees. Interviews were recorded on a high quality recording device and later transcribed to give a verbatim account of the discourse. The interview schedule looked to address patients’ perceptions and beliefs about their catarrh problem, their general perceptions of well-being, and their expectations of the medical consultation and of professional interventions - both for their catarrh problem and for any co-existing health problems they may have.</p>
<p>Demographic details and medical histories were retrieved from proformas completed during the initial clinic consultation. Approval for the study was granted from the Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Ethics and Research Committee and all patients gave written consent to participate in the study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395311406148"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the interview transcripts was in line with the principles described by Glaser and Strauss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311406148">19</xref></sup> with a view to the generation of grounded theory. A process of continuous sampling of data with contemporaneous analysis of that data was employed such that any emerging theory was not just discovered, but also had to ‘fit’ well, within its given context; that is, discovered themes had to be reflected (and thus reinforced) in subsequent interviews. Grounded theory was sought in this study because, as Pidgeon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395311406148">20</xref></sup> observes: ‘as one aspect of the close and detailed inspection of specific problem domains, grounded theory places great emphasis upon an attention to participants’ own accounts of social and psychological events and of their associated local phenomenal and social worlds’, and that is what was being sought from the catarrh patients. Other qualitative techniques could have been employed to achieve this end but grounded theory was considered adequate.</p>
<p>Each interview was transcribed soon after its completion meaning analysis could begin as soon as a few transcripts were prepared. In this way, consequent interviews run in parallel to the ongoing analysis could be orientated to explore more closely any themes that might begin to emerge from the analysis – a step which Glaser and Strauss saw as fundamental to generating grounded theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311406148">21</xref></sup> In addition, iterative ‘constant comparison’ was employed, whereby observations and emergent key ideas are constantly referred back to other elements within the corpus of raw data, with the aim of confirming ‘good fit’ of the ideas, and hence strengthening their validity. Analysis of the interview transcripts began with manual coding of the data whereby inherent concepts and ideas within each paragraph were given a descriptive label, or code, and this label was recorded on an electronic index card. The level of abstraction of these concepts and codes varied; some concepts were implied directly by the interviewees themselves and were taken directly from the text (otherwise referred to as ‘member categories’ or ‘<italic>in vivo</italic> codes’ by Strauss and Corbin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311406148">21</xref></sup>), and others were more interpretive and theoretical (‘researcher categories’). A balance was sought between the ratio of member categories to researcher categories, in order for the analysis to be ‘faithful’ enough to the underlying data to remain valid, but yet ‘creative’ enough to allow the generation of the new theories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311406148">21</xref></sup> Too many member categories risk the work being merely descriptive, whilst too many researcher categories risk the work being over-analytical. As such analysis progressed, certain themes recurred and cards relating to a common theme could then be ‘categorised’ (i.e. grouped), thus enabling tighter indexing. The emergent themes/categories could then be reflected back to the data corpus to check for ‘fit’, and to this end, a tabulated record was made of the number of times that each coding was manifest during each interview. Themes were also be used to steer subsequent patient interviews in an attempt to extract further relevant data surrounding that evolving theme. This forms the basis of constant comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395311406148">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the categories developed, they could be defined, refined and named. On the occasion where categories seemed to be generalizing excessively, to the detriment of practicality, they were split into theoretical sub-categories, each addressing a novel concept e.g. the category initially labelled ‘The Permanent Cold’ was subdivided into ‘Triggered by a cold’, ‘Feels like a cold’ and ‘Constant awareness’ each with its own connotation to be explored. It was through a culmination of these categorized themes and personal memos of the principal investigator that theoretical conclusions were drawn. The principal investigator performed the analysis and this was scrutinized by the co-authors.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395311406148" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 21 patients approached, 20 agreed to participate and one declined due to time constraints. One patient could not be contacted subsequently; so 19 interviews were undertaken. The mean age of those interviewed was 56.1 years (range 40–71 years) with a male to female ratio of 1:3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395311406148">Table 1</xref>). Patients were predominantly middle class and non-smokers. The data generated from the 19 interviews proved to be sufficient for the purposes of this study, as both codes and categories were evidently becoming saturated towards the latter period of analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742395311406148">Table 2</xref> shows the main analysis themes and categories.

<p>In an interesting preface to analysis, it was observed that a number of the catarrh patients explicitly stated that they did not consider themselves to have a disease or illness. This observation ratified the need to explore why catarrh patients find their body sensation troublesome.<disp-quote>
<p>P, patient; I, interviewer</p>
<p>I: Is it something you would list as a medical problem if someone asked you?</p>
<p>P: It wasn’t an illness to us, it was an inconvenience, like an annoying inconvenience.</p>
<p>I: What is an illness?</p>
<p>P: Having pneumonia or having something specifically wrong with some part of your body. Like a named kind of thing, you know?</p>
<p><bold>Female, 71 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A categorical theme emerging early in the analysis of participants’ accounts concerned the apparent changes in the perception of nasopharyngeal mucus which accounted for that physiological sensation being considered deviant, and heralded the onset of transition from order to disorder. There were three changes in evidence:
<list id="list1-1742395311406148" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>a putative change in the viscosity of the mucus;</italic>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘it feels thick - I’m sorry to have to put it into words - it’s like a sticky bolus’.</p>
<p><bold>Male, 60 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>a perceived change in the quantity of mucus;</italic>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I feel it in my throat – it seems to be gathering in my throat all the time and will not go away at all, it doesn’t matter what I try’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 67 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>a change in the constancy of the sensation;</italic>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘What is the real pain is the constancy of it. There is no let up. At the moment I am quite good. This is good. But it's constant, all the time and I can't imagine what it feels like not to have it now. Although I think it must be really nice [laughs]’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 49 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Constancy was important to participants and appeared to be the main reason why a seemingly innocuous sensation should become troublesome; although a significant proportion of patients accepted that the sensation itself would be trivial if otherwise sporadic, it was its pervasiveness that made it unacceptable to them. In a similar vein, the high-pitched whine of an out-of-condition television could be considered quite benign if heard in passing, but if heard in the ear constantly, day and night, would constitute potentially disabling tinnitus.<disp-quote>
<p>‘…at the back of my throat it feels as if I am swallowing but it’s not going anywhere. I mean I am talking to you now and it feels a bit thick and when I swallow it goes away for about a minute but it’s back again. See what I mean, it’s there constantly. I haven’t got a time when I can say yeah it’s gone…’</p>
<p><bold>Female, 43 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A deviation or change in character of a sensation does not, in itself, render that sensation problematic, however, for as Locker has observed, there will be individuals who perceive such changes and normalize them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311406148">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, looking more towards help seeking, Zola<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311406148">5</xref></sup> observes that ‘virtually every day of our lives we are subject to a vast array of bodily discomforts. Only an infinitesimal amount of these get to a physician’. Other phenomena must occur, then, in order for the sensation to move beyond simple deviance. A common feature of participants’ accounts was that the change had to have a <italic>consequence</italic> for it to be deemed problematic. These consequences fell into three main categories:
<list id="list2-1742395311406148" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a perceived threat to the body or well-being</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a social inconvenience</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a source of frustration</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The threat to the body could be direct at a local level i.e. within the throat;<disp-quote>
<p>‘The only thing that does worry me a bit is when it gathers in my throat and I think ‘I’m going to choke here'. That’s the only thing’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 62 years</bold></p>
<p>‘Hence when I got this problem with the post nasal drip it was making me snore and it caused a lot of problems at home’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 43 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>or at a regional/systemic level;<disp-quote>
<p>‘Well, what I found was that it quite often turned into a chest infection so then I had to go and have antibiotics, and when I had gone they would examine my chest and say yes you have an infection there. So it has sometimes turned to a chest infection’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 62 years</bold></p>
<p>‘Especially when it starts dripping down my throat at night, it was making me sick in the morning’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 71 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For some, the threat was more sinister, although this latter threat of malignancy was rare amongst interviewees probably reflecting the indolent nature of the problem in hand;<disp-quote>
<p>P: ‘I’m not worried about it. At first I was, before I had the scan and the camera I was expecting something worse, you know, because when they gave me the antibiotics and it couldn’t cure it I thought it was something worse than a virus’.</p>
<p>I: ‘So when the antibiotics weren’t working that’s maybe when you became more concerned? […]’</p>
<p>P: ‘Yeah, I thought it was something worse’.</p>

<p>P: ‘I thought cancer, straight away’.</p>

<p>Change in pharyngeal sensation also had a social impact for some participants. It either limited social functioning and effective communication because of the throat sensation, or because certain social situations amplified the nose/throat sensation intolerably. Occasionally, this mechanism would operate through a third party;<disp-quote>
<p>I: But it doesn’t affect your lifestyle?</p>
<p>P: Holiday-wise it has.</p>
<p>I: Holidays?</p>
<p>P: The wife will not go on holiday with me because if we go into a hotel, she’ll not sleep in the same room because I keep her awake all night and she says I don’t realise I’m doing it through the night because it doesn’t affect my sleep.</p>
<p><bold>Male, 57 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A recurring theme within this ‘social impact’ category was that of <italic>embarrassment</italic>. Catarrh is generally seen as being undesirable and repulsive – a socially constructed perception – and consequently many patients have become self-conscious in public and concerned about the way in which others perceive them;<disp-quote>
<p>‘…if you’re in a crowded place and you’ve got to bring it up, you’re conscious people can hear that and, yeah, it can be very embarrassing. It is for the kids and for my wife’.</p>
<p><bold>Male, 46 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>There is even evidence of this social embarrassment being conveyed to dependents;<disp-quote>
<p>P: So when my little boy was born, obviously I was aware of it, so I was trying to help him, but at the same time I didn’t want other people to think he was disgusting.</p>
<p>I: So you would play it down to a degree…</p>
<p>P: Yes, yes, I would say you have got a nasty time and don’t…you see people spitting in the street and sometimes you can’t not spit, but I would say to him, go somewhere quiet and lower your head so that it’s not being projected and just let it drop, but fortunately or unfortunately I don’t know, he’s grown up and he’s able to get a tissue and go to the toilet and do it and that’s the way he deals with it. But he can get it up, but neither of us want to be seen spitting. We don’t want to.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 48 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, aberrant mucus sensation can have the consequence of being a source of <italic>frustration</italic>. This was the most frequently mentioned concern when interviewees talked about their nose or throat sensation; two-thirds of patients described their problem as ‘annoying’, ‘an irritant’, or ‘a frustration’, either unprompted or when asked to sum up their problem with one word.<disp-quote>
<p>‘It's just annoying more than anything because you’re always trying to get rid of it and it never goes. So I've kind of learnt to live with that now’.</p>
<p><bold>Male, 40 years</bold></p>
<p>‘I don’t know if you might say ‘well if it’s not affecting him, what’s he doing taking up my time?’ but I think it’s something that affects me in the sense that it’s a pretty constant irritation and you’re just conscious of it. If you’re doing a job that requires concentration… it’s like having a headache - you don’t want that kind of thing’.</p>
<p><bold>Male, 60 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This ties in well with the earlier observation that, for many chronic catarrh patients, theirs is not a problem of ‘bringing up’ too much phlegm but rather of having an altered sensation of mucus and nothing to actually produce or clear. It is this absence of expectorant that seems to lead to their sense of frustration, in the same way that a dry tickly cough would be seen as frustrating to many, but a wet, productive cough may be seen more as disgusting. Catarrh is not a painful or uncomfortable sensation and so is one that can be tolerated well so long as it is ephemeral. When present day after day, however, realization of its longevity gives way to a sense of both psychosocial frustration at the intractable nature of the symptom and physical frustration because the perceived mucus cannot be cleared.</p>
<p>The final step in the transition of catarrh from a physiological sensation, through deviant sensation to a symptom of disorder, was indicated by the <italic>mounting of a response</italic> by the subjects to minimize or avoid the aberrant sensation. Such measures could be active or passive, positive, or negative. Initially, these were invariably avoidance techniques such as simple exclusion of provoking foodstuffs, or from certain social situations which they felt may trigger the sensation.</p>
<p>Although arbitrary, this delineation seems an important one as such measures act as an <italic>acknowledgement</italic> of that sensation; it no longer represents a background inconvenience or incidental observation, but rather something that has to be intervened against. This response indicates that the sensation has been promoted to an increased level of importance (and by inference enhanced awareness) and inaugurates it as an actual problem. The extent of this response indicated the size of effect that the experience had on that patient’s life. For example, self-instigated dietary measures such as avoiding certain dairy products are relatively easily employed by patients, and although still an acknowledgement of the presence of a problem, probably represent little more than the trial of lay-network advice. Insistence on the selection of more expensive options when eating out, however, involves a more committed approach and begins to indicate a more deep-seated belief about their perceived problem.<disp-quote>
<p>‘It is a lot more expensive to go out for a meal because you’ve got to be so careful about what you’re eating. It has to be the steak or something. You can’t just go for the cheaper options and have a burger or something because everything’s got wheat in it’.</p>
<p>Female, 49 years</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, measures which impact on others as well as the patients themselves indicated a more deep-rooted belief about the problem and suggest greater promotion of importance of that symptom.<disp-quote>
<p>‘It stops us really getting involved with the kids. Like my son really likes playing football and stuff like that. I wouldn’t be able to run around with him because I have to keep stopping to be sick’.</p>
<p>Male, 46 years</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If the problematic sensation persisted and further evolved, avoidance techniques gave way to further, more pro-active measures.<disp-quote>
<p>I: ‘Does it affect your lifestyle?’</p>
<p>P: ‘It does because it makes me so unhappy and I get so distressed and I don’t .... I mean I’ve started doing a voluntary job just to get my mind occupied’.</p>
<p><bold>Female, 63 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such responses can appear rather excessive to the external observer and in some ways incongruous when considering the initial sensation being intervened against. On occasion, the response was so strong so as to hint towards an underlying psychological influence. Two participants described feeling compelled to go to great lengths each morning in an apparently obsessive attempt to retch or vomit up what they felt to have gathered in their throat overnight, else they would have to make active attempts to suppress the sensation for the next few hours. Such exaggerated responses suggest deep-seated and ingrained beliefs about that problem.<disp-quote>
<p>P: ‘… it just feels as if my throat has got catarrh there, in the back of my throat and just by having a drink doesn’t shift it. It might loosen it but I actually have to cough into a tissue to bring it up. […] My daughter had asked me what was the matter because she said every morning I was going in the bathroom and coughing as if I was having morning sickness’.</p>
<p>I: ‘Always retching?’</p>
<p>P: ‘I either do it into the toilet or I’ll go to the sink to clean my teeth and I’ll do it again two or three times before I get it clear….’</p>
<p><bold>Female, 59 years</bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Eventually, after a variable period mounting a response and the symptom not settling, a proportion of patients took further steps yet, seeking external help to intervene against the problem. This marked the transition to health-seeking behaviour.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395311406148" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, participants’ experiences had led them to specialist service. Unlike patients presenting chronic pain or other ‘medically unexplained’ symptoms – who often work hard to convince clinicians and researchers of the legitimacy of their symptoms as evidence of underlying disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395311406148">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311406148">23</xref></sup> – a number of catarrh patients explicitly stated that they did not consider themselves to have a disease or illness. Whatever their beliefs, they are nonetheless <italic>ipso facto</italic> presenting to healthcare professionals with a disease according to our definition (an impairment of physiological functioning). Inherent in their self-actualization as non-diseased is the inference that a boundary other than concern about underlying pathology must have been crossed which delineates rationally deviant somatic sensations from those considered to be improper.</p>
<p>The themes arising from the analysis in this study have identified three stages of transition from natural physiological sensation to improper physiological sensation (i.e. symptom or symptomatic cue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311406148">10</xref></sup>) and this has enabled us to adapt our original illustration of symptom evolution to offer a more detailed symptom evolution pathway for physiological body sensations, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395311406148">Figure 2</xref>. This updated pathway takes into account an intermediate zone of altered sensation tolerance which precedes symptom tolerance and is delineated by the transition points alluded to from the analysis themes; first, the body sensation must change, or at least must be deemed to have changed (transition from zone 1 to zone 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395311406148">Figure 2</xref>). In the case of catarrh, this change can be qualitative (change in consistency of nasopharyngeal mucus), quantitative (change in flow-rate) or, most frequently, temporal (protraction of its presence). Essentially, what is being effected is an <italic>awareness</italic> of the sensation which had, up to that point, been present inconspicuously. For this perceived change in character to be deemed problematic, however, it must first have a consequence, and it should not be assumed that this is always the case. There are undoubtedly people who perceive such a change and dismiss it as having no great significance or rationalize it by explaining it away.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311406148">10</xref></sup> When a deeper negative meaning is attributed to an altered body sensation, it can be broadly categorized as (a) a perceived threat to their well-being, (b) a social inconvenience, or (c) a frustration (transition from zone 2 to zone 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395311406148">Figure 2</xref>). The ‘threat to well-being’ is often seen as a local or systemic effect, although such associations are usually poorly grounded and difficult to explain physically. The ‘social inconvenience’ consequence offers the largest window into the important social construct of catarrh; a major factor in catarrh patients considering their body sensation to be problematic is the way in which they see themselves being viewed by others. ‘Disgusting’ and ‘embarrassing’ are words that feature heavily in their accounts and this seems to be indicative of the connotations of uncleanliness that catarrh carries in today’s society. The paradox here is that the catarrh sufferers, by their own admission, are not productive of any great quantity of phlegm or mucus. None-the-less, they seem convinced that their daily ritual/habit of trying to clear their nose or throat is enough to influence how others view them. The consequence of ‘frustration’ is largely traceable to the constancy of the catarrh sensation and a realization about its longevity. The frustration lies both with the irritation of the sensation itself and with the situation that they find themselves in, having a simple problem that by all accounts ought to have a simple remedy, but does not.
<fig id="fig2-1742395311406148" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Symptom evolution pathway for physiological body functions zone 1: normal sensation, zone 2: altered sensation, zone 3: symptom tolerance, zone 4: health seeking.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395311406148-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Indicative of this emotional impact was the <italic>mounting of a response</italic> by patients. The patient’s response to that sensation, or its deemed consequence, represents the final transition to the problematic experience phase. This response can be passive or active, positive or negative and can be arbitrarily categorized into mild, moderate, or strong. The degree of this response is likely to give an insight into the strengths of their beliefs about their problem and, on retrospective analysis, does seem to bear some correlation with how accessible they seemed to be to simple reassurance about their problem. Either way, the implication is that they are acknowledging the sensation, knowingly or otherwise, as something that needs to be acted upon or against, and it is this that demarcates the sensation as being improper, representative of disorder and a symptom.</p>
<p>This study tells that some people at least were able to mount a response to symptoms in such a way that they were able to attract professional interest in them. The notion of ‘help-seeking’ has gone out of fashion in recent years, perhaps because across the developed world policy and practice have been aimed at controlling the demands that people with chronic but intractable symptoms make on health services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395311406148">24</xref></sup> and encouraging self-management through interventions aimed at increasing self-efficacy and improving expertise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395311406148">25</xref></sup> Nevertheless, classic studies of ‘help-seeking’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311406148">5</xref></sup> and ‘illness careers’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395311406148">26</xref></sup> remain highly relevant in understanding those factors that promote patients’ engagement with clinical services for catarrh. Results from this study suggest that Zola’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395311406148">5</xref></sup> analysis of ‘triggers’ assists the conceptualization of ‘pre-symptomatic’ transition in chronic catarrh. Especially, relevant ‘triggers’ are the disruption of social and physical activities that acted to prevent our interviewees from normalizing their altered body sensation, and the temporalization of these altered sensations appears to play an important part in the sensation becoming perceived as improper at the outset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395311406148">Figure 2</xref>). As a result of this study, it is now evident that such factors are in play long before the patient takes measures to seek health assistance, and that they may shape the processes by ‘normal illnesses’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395311406148">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395311406148">10</xref></sup> reinterpreted as worthy of professional consideration. We emphasize that it is not the intention of this article to address the health beliefs and illness behaviour of catarrh patients; this is addressed by the authors elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395311406148">27</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742395311406148"><title>Clinical implication of this study</title>
<p>We conclude that patients seeking help for a bodily symptom should not be considered tobe at the beginning of their symptom story but, rather, at the start of the fourth phase in its evolution. Although some symptoms such as pain can appear <italic>de novo</italic>, the present qualitative analysis has highlighted that symptoms representing an aberration of a normal body sensation have developed, often over a period of time, in a series of recognizable phases. This understanding better equips doctors to appreciate both patients’ prior experience and their expectations from the consultation process.</p>
<p>On a note more specific to catarrh, we now have scope to address catarrh patients’ concerns and issues beyond simple symptom control. Now that we have an understanding of the pre-symptomatic phase of their presenting problem, we are better placed to help them access coping strategies; whilst it is unlikely that we will ever alter the aberrant sensation that they are experiencing, we can at least reassure them that mucus, even if it were in excess, has no deleterious or consequential effect on the body, either at a local level or on any other neighbouring body system. Consequently, it should be pointed out, mucus does not need to be cleared or expectorated and it is, in fact, the perpetual act of trying to expectorate their catarrh that they find socially constraining and embarrassing rather than the physical sensation itself. For the present study subjects, it was not their aberrant sensation <italic>per se</italic> that prevented them from staying in hotels, playing with their children, or attending publisher meetings but rather their response to it and if we can help to curb this response, we will be providing benefit far more than we would if simply reassuring them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as mentioned under Discussion, the magnitude of the patient’s response aimed at minimizing the perceived consequence of their aberrant sensation seems to give an indication of their level of belief about the underlying problem. If a clinician can identify a patient’s response(s) this may guide them as to how accessible that patient will be to reassurance and symptom tolerance in the face of this reassurance.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395311406148"><title>Study strengths and weaknesses</title>
<p>As is the case in all studies based on semi-structured interviews, this study is subject to <italic>recall bias</italic> i.e. the account given by the participants will be significantly influenced by their own recollection of events, and how significant they deem those events to be. Furthermore, accounts of chronic conditions – and in particular medically unexplained symptoms – are often well-rehearsed and even embellished or exaggerated by the time the patient reaches the practitioner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395311406148">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395311406148">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interviews in this study were conducted by a practising clinician. Although a doctor is in a privileged position of trust and confidentiality which may reap relevant information that would not otherwise have been offered under interview to a non-medical researcher, there is equally the risk that the patients of a doctor researcher may offer – inadvertently or otherwise – replies which they feel the doctor wishes to hear. For this reason, it was made explicit to patients that their participation in the interview would not alter their clinical management in any way and that the researcher was not involved in any decision making regarding their care.</p>
<p>Anselm Strauss, one of the forefathers of grounded theory techniques, has previously listed the requisite skills that he considers to be essential for any qualitative researcher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395311406148">21</xref></sup> These are:
<list id="list3-1742395311406148" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To step back and critically analyse situations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To recognize and avoid bias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To obtain valid and reliable data</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To think abstractly</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Theoretical and social sensitivity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ability to maintain analytical distance whilst drawing on past experience</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Astute powers of observation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Good interactional skills</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In considering this list, one could effectively substitute ‘qualitative researcher’ with ‘clinician’ for these would also be the predominant skills required for the ideal patient consultation. Through years of training and clinical experience, doctors and surgeons expectantly become adept at holding interviews (consultations) aimed at extracting information from patients. In essence, clinical consultations are semi-structured interviews, whereby the clinician has an <italic>a priori</italic> idea of what information he needs to obtain from the patient but has to be guided throughout the consultation by the answers provided by the patient and the information gleaned from non-verbal cues. Employing a rigid structured interview approach to consultations would miss a great deal of valuable history. The clinician is also well practiced in active listening techniques such as re-enforcement, paraphrasing and summarizing – techniques widely adopted in research interviews to enhance the amount and depth of information gleaned.</p>
<p>‘Maintaining analytical distance’ is also a pre-requisite for a good quality and productive consultation. It is fundamental to good clinical practice that the surgeon or doctor does not restrict himself or herself to the presenting symptom or diagnosis but, rather, that he or she considers the patient as a ‘whole’. They should take into consideration the patient’s current situation – both medically and socially and the affect that the presenting problem may have on their other problems. Similarly, the clinician ought to have ‘astute powers of observation’, not only to pick up physical signs not declared by the patient but also to pick up non-verbal cues given during the consultation which may have some impact on management. For these reasons, doctors and surgeons are already trained in many of the skills required of a qualitative researcher and should not be deterred from undertaking such work simply because historically it was the jurisdiction of the social sciences.</p>
<p>For a study being carried out in a tertiary referral centre, it is arguable that subjects may find paradox in being asked about pre-symptomatic sensations and health beliefs if at the outset they had attended for definitive management of their catarrh. It is apparent from the transcripts, however, that the great majority of the subjects understood the interview to be a piece of research and hence an exploration exercise and were generally unfazed about apparent tangential questioning and questions not directly relating to their secondary or tertiary care. Most, when asked, stated their motivation for participating in the interview was to help someone else in the future. Indeed, some even found benefit in the deeper questioning:<disp-quote>
<p>I: Has today helped you in any way?</p>
<p>P: It makes me feel more comfortable that you’re taking me as a person and my symptoms as a person individually, yes, it’s helped there. As I say, with [the consultant] it’s helped that I’ve got an endoscopy, so to me these are positive steps. But normally you sit for 5 minutes, you can’t explain everything. I could say something to you today and you could think ‘he’s just mentioned that for the first time, right that could be that, or it could lead to another line of investigation. Things that I take for granted. You don’t think when you’re talking to someone – ‘what are my major symptoms? Right dit,dit,dit,dit, that’s my major symptoms, you‘ve got them all. You go away and you think about it and think oh I forgot to mention that and that. That happens all the time. So the more you talk about it, the more you remember things that you’re affected by.</p>
