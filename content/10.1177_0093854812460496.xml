<abstract>
<p>Data collected as part of the Projects on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) were used to examine (1) the underlying structure of adolescent problem behavior, (2) continuity and change in patterns of problem behaviors across mid to late adolescence and (3) the risk and protective factors related to observed patterns of behavior. The data used in this study were taken from Waves 2 and 3 of Cohorts 12 and 15 of PHDCN (n = 1,124). The results suggested that a 4-class categorical model (i.e., latent class analysis) best represents the pattern of responses to behavioral items used to measure delinquency, substance use, and risky sexual practices. The analyses revealed patterns of stability, escalation, and de-escalation, as well as differential risk across the four groups. Implications for understanding problem behaviors and prevention and intervention strategy are discussed.</p>

<p>It has long been recognized that engaging in problem behavior in adolescence has the potential to adversely affect adolescent health and wellbeing, including the possibility of sexually transmitted disease, substance abuse, incarceration, accidental injury, and poor educational and employment success. Prolonged antisocial behavior, which is frequently presaged by these problems in adolescence, exerts a number of societal costs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812460496">Cohen &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>). Consequently, the tendency to engage in multiple problem behaviors has been a topic of adolescent research for some time.</p>
<p>While there is a general consensus around the association among risky behaviors in adolescence and their potentially deleterious consequences, there is less certainty around how this recurring finding should be framed in considering empirical evidence and prevention options. In particular, the manner in which various risk behaviors fit together can be explained either through a dimensional view of the underlying latent variable or a categorical model that places cases into groups based on patterns of observed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812460496">Beauchaine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812460496">Bergman &amp; Magnusson, 1997</xref>). The dimensional perspective defines the co-occurrence of multiple problem behaviors as a single, continuous underlying trait representative of a disposition towards deviance with adolescents falling somewhere on a continuum. The categorical perspective accounts for differences in the patterns and levels of problem behaviors among adolescents and suggests that the co-occurrence of problem behavior may reflect higher and lower levels as well as qualitatively distinct patterns.</p>
<p>Understanding which perspective is most applicable to adolescent problem behaviors carries important prevention and intervention implications. A dimensional view suggests that a common underlying trait accounts for all forms of problem behavior, and therefore, a single strategy aimed at this underlying trait with varying dosages may be effective in preventing problem behavior. From this perspective, the type of prevention or intervention strategy would be the same, but the level or intensity of the intervention may differ based on where adolescents fall on the continuum of “deviance proneness.” A categorical perspective suggests that the risk factors for engaging in problem behavior may differ across subgroups of adolescents based on different patterns of observed behavior. Consequently, prevention and treatment programs could be directed towards a single behavior (e.g., alcohol abuse treatment) or a constellation of risky behaviors (e.g., Multisystemic Therapy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093854812460496">OJJDP, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0093854812460496">Romer, 2003</xref>). A detailed understanding of the nature of this disposition and its continuity across adolescence carries important programmatic and policy implications for agencies serving at-risk youth, particularly those that encounter juvenile justice populations.</p>
<p>This study seeks to expand the understanding of co-occurring problem behaviors in adolescence by employing indicators of delinquency, substance use, and sexual behavior. Whereas previous studies tend to take either a dimensional or categorical view towards the commonality of these behaviors, the analytic process in this study compares multiple model specifications. In addition, questions of stability and change are examined with a model that accounts for possible transitions.</p>

<title>Characterizing Adolescent Problem Behavior</title>
<p>Research has consistently documented that adolescents who engage in any one form of problem behavior are substantially more likely to engage in additional forms, including risky sexual practices, truancy, poor academic performance, delinquent behavior, aggression, poor physical health, and reckless driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812460496">Elliott, Huizinga, &amp; Menard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812460496">Farrington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812460496">Jessor &amp; Jessor, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093854812460496">Sullivan, Childs, &amp; O’Connell, 2010</xref>). Due to the strong and consistent correlation among such risk-taking behaviors, it has been suggested that engagement in multiple forms of problem behavior can be accounted for by a general proneness towards deviance, characterized by a tendency to violate social and cultural norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812460496">Jessor &amp; Jessor, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812460496">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>). That is, proponents of this dimensional perspective suggest that engagement in any one form of problem behavior is a manifestation of a disposition towards deviance which means that a single explanation is sufficient to account for engagement in all forms of problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812460496">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812460496">Jessor, Donovan, &amp; Costa, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, it is argued that this general disposition accounts for continuity in particular forms of problem behavior or heterotypic continuity where there is a shift in the type of behavior engaged in based on available opportunities over time. Research finds some support for a single factor, general deviance model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812460496">LeBlanc and Bouthillier (2003)</xref> reviewed more than twenty studies using various measures and factor analytic approaches. A latent construct reflecting an underlying disposition towards problem behavior was identified in all of the reviewed studies. Still, they, and others, stop short of definitively espousing a continuous view of this underlying general disposition. Low levels of explained variance observed in empirical studies appear to be at least partly responsible for this hesitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812460496">LeBlanc &amp; Girard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812460496">McGee &amp; Newcomb, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0093854812460496">White, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812460496">Osgood and colleagues (1988)</xref> found support for the generality of deviance, but also indicate that the ability of the construct to account for observed patterns of behavior falls well short of one hundred percent.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to consider conceptual frameworks, and associated models, that place general deviance in something other than a single factor, continuous structure. For example, some adolescents may exhibit forms of a broad “problem behavior syndrome,” some may engage in a specific form of deviant behavior (e.g., only delinquency or only substance use), and others may not engage in problem behavior at all. Furthermore, there may be different degrees of problem behavior within these categories that must be accounted for in fully describing behavioral patterns. This means that findings regarding variance explained in prior studies may stem in part from the omission of these embedded subgroups of adolescents.</p>
<p>Research on qualitatively distinct patterns of risky adolescent behavior has grown in recent years, with studies increasingly using mixture, or latent class, modeling. Subgroups have been identified using a wide array of behavioral items, including indicators of delinquency and substance use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812460496">Basen-Engquist, Edmundson, &amp; Parcel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812460496">Mun, Windle, &amp; Schainker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812460496">Bartlett, Holditch-Davis, &amp; Belyea, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093854812460496">Sullivan et al. (2010)</xref> utilized latent class analysis with a sample of high school students to study risk behavior in multiple domains. The four extracted problem behavior classes revealed some variation in “level” (e.g., low, moderate, high), but there were also qualitative distinctions. For example, one class had relatively high probabilities of risky behaviors in most domains, but tended not to engage in sexual activity while a second group engaged in a diverse array of all forms of risky behavior at a fairly high level. Similarly, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812460496">Hair, Park, Ling, and Moore (2009)</xref> identified four groups: low-risk group (16.3%), high-risk group (26.6%), "drinking and unsafe sex" group (20.8%), and a "smoking, unsafe sex, and lack of exercise" group (36.5%). These studies suggest that a categorical approach can be useful in describing and further investigating the association among problem behaviors.</p>
<p>In general, it appears that heterogeneity abounds in looking at these behaviors and the sole use of factor analysis or clustering approaches may only account for one of the possible sources of variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812460496">Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2005</xref>). More flexible tools aimed at understanding unobserved heterogeneity in individual responses by integrating dimensional and categorical approaches are now available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812460496">Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2005</xref>), providing an opportunity to further investigate the structure of problem behaviors in adolescence.</p>

<sec id="section2-0093854812460496">
<title>Explaining Adolescent Problem Behavior</title>
<p>A number of risk factors for specific problem behaviors have been identified in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812460496">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0093854812460496">Romer, 2003</xref>). These factors span a range of domains, including social-environment and individual constitutional factors. For example, parenting practices are believed to have an important influence on engagement in an array of problem behaviors in childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812460496">Richards, Miller, O’Donnell, Wasselman, &amp; Colder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0093854812460496">Robertson, Thomas, St. Lawrence, &amp; Pack, 2005</xref>). Adolescents who do not have a healthy emotional bond to a parent will be less concerned with the consequences of disobeying rules and letting the parent down. At the same time, low levels of monitoring and involvement provide greater opportunities to engage in risk-taking behavior. Perceived social support has also been shown to be predictive of a range of problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812460496">McCreary, Slavin, &amp; Berry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0093854812460496">Windle, 1992</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812460496">Michael and Ben-Zur (2007)</xref> point out, peer groups function as a source of social support and/or as an inducement towards risky behavior. Socialization into certain groups has the potential to encourage problem behaviors because they appear relevant to the group identity and will aid in the attainment of status within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812460496">Diblasio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812460496">Lightfoot, 1992</xref>). Thus, a positive social support system and appropriate parenting practices have the potential to reduce the likelihood of problem behavior in adolescence.</p>
<p>Risk-seeking and impulsivity are among the individual-level risk factors thought to predict engagement in adolescent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812460496">Greene, Krcmar, Walters, Rubin, &amp; Hale, 2000</xref>). In particular, some scholars have argued that a latent trait reflecting self-control, characterized by impulsivity and the need for immediate gratification, is sufficient for understanding engagement in all problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854812460496">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>). This argument is based on the large body of research supporting an association among low self-control and crime and analogous behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093854812460496">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding possible influences on adolescent problem behavior is essential for developing effective prevention and intervention programs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0093854812460496">Romer (2003)</xref> points out, “we will not be able to develop more comprehensive interventions until we develop better theory and measurement of potential causal pathways that underlie multiple risk behaviors (p. 1).” It is clear that not all youth are equally at-risk for engaging in problem behavior. Consequently, knowledge of the nature and structure of adolescent problem behaviors will facilitate an understanding of the circumstances associated with varying levels of risk. For example, a categorical perspective of adolescent problem behaviors suggests that individual and social-environmental differences may account for different problem behavior patterns. That is, the risk factors for engaging in such behaviors may differ across subgroups of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812460496">Bartlett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812460496">Hair et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093854812460496">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, this perspective suggests that the effectiveness of intervention strategies may also differ across groups. In some cases, the focus on a single behavior may be necessary, while in others, the focus on a constellation of risk behaviors may be needed. For example, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a problem-oriented approach that generally focuses on restructuring situational decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093854812460496">OJJDP, 2008</xref>), has been found to be effective in meta-analysis of programs for juvenile offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812460496">Landenberger &amp; Lipsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812460496">Lipsey, 2009</xref>). A basic feature of CBT strategies is a focus on the nature of how the individual thinks and acts in particular situations and subsequent use of cognitive restructuring and behavioral change strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812460496">Lochman, Powell, Whidby, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812460496">Milkman &amp; Wanberg, 2007</xref>); this requires knowledge of a youth’s specific pattern of behavior. A categorical approach allows for qualitative variation in behavioral patterns between adolescents, which suggests that the optimal strategies for restructuring situational decision-making and meeting associated needs like educational services or family counseling could differ across problem behavior subgroups.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a dimensional perspective suggests that a common underlying cause accounts for engagement in all forms of problem behaviors and assumes that the structure of general problem behavior is similar across all adolescents. This perspective supports the notion that the intervention needs and strategies used to target problem behaviors and the associated risk factors should be similar for all adolescents – it is the intensity of the intervention that differs. A dimensional perspective of problem behavior would support similar behavioral restructuring strategies and supplementary services for all adolescents, but differing levels of program intensity. An integrated categorical and dimensional perspective suggests that different types of intervention programs and varying levels of intensity within each intervention would be optimal.</p>

<title>Transitions in Adolescent Problem Behavior Patterns</title>
<p>Studies examining the stability of a general latent factor have highlighted the importance of considering the influence of age on deviance proneness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812460496">Childs, Dembo, Belenko, Sullivan, &amp; Cochran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812460496">Dembo, Belenko, Childs, &amp; Wareham, 2010</xref>). These studies consider patterns of general deviance across adolescence (or from mid-adolescence to early adulthood), confirming that there is some variation in the strength of a general problem behavior latent factor across time periods. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812460496">Chun &amp; Mobley (2010)</xref> examined the invariance of a second-order, problem behavior model across grade-level and found meaningful differences in the strength of the core associations over time. Furthermore, a number of studies have highlighted differences in the type or rate of deviant behavior as youth transition through different development stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812460496">Loeber &amp; LeBlanc, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812460496">Reboussin, Reboussin, Liang, &amp; Anthony, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0093854812460496">Steffensmeir, Allan, Harer, and Streifel (1989)</xref> examined the age distribution of official arrests for 27 different offenses. They found that vandalism, auto theft, and burglary were more common in adolescence, while drug-law violations and disorderly conduct were more common in the mid-twenties, and gambling was more common in later stages during adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812460496">Massoglia (2006)</xref> refers to this phenomenon as within-person displacement, which is characterized by the tendency for some individuals to engage in qualitatively different acts as they progress through developmental stages. Using data from the National Youth Survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812460496">Massoglia (2006)</xref> identified qualitative shifts that suggested both escalation and desistance in antisocial behaviors from adolescence to adulthood. He also identified a group (~40%) that showed a “displacement” pattern where individuals moved from one pattern of deviant behavior in adolescence to another in adulthood (e.g., predatory delinquency to illicit drug use).</p>
<p>Description of general problem behaviors at a particular point in time is important in understanding underlying patterns. Yet, developmental theory and research suggests that youth and adolescents will go through transitions characterized by pubertal maturation, mood fluctuations, emotional dysregulation, and conflict with parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812460496">Arnett, 1999</xref>). At the same time, individuals are experiencing greater levels of autonomy and perceived self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854812460496">Gecas, 1989</xref>). Significant brain development in the frontal lobe also occurs, which influences reasoning and judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812460496">Dahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093854812460496">Reyna &amp; Farley, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812460496">Cauffman &amp; Steinberg (2000)</xref> argue that judgment, or the decision to engage in problem behaviors, is based on three psychosocial factors: responsibility (e.g., self-reliance, independence), perspective (e.g., considering situations from different perspectives and placing them in broader social contexts), and temperance (e.g., impulsivity, ability to evaluate situations before acting). These authors also argue that, in addition to the cognitive and emotional stage of development, understanding the social context (i.e., family, peers) in which adolescents are exhibiting poor judgment is also critical to fully understanding adolescent problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0093854812460496">Steinberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0093854812460496">Steinberg &amp; Cauffman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of an array of changes, adolescence is characterized by experimentation in a number of risk-taking behaviors. That is, developmental researchers argue that engagement in low-level risk behavior is often part of a process that is intertwined with age-appropriate developmental tasks associated with increased independence and decision-making capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0093854812460496">Steinberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812460496">Mun et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, this will decline as they transition into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093854812460496">Moffitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093854812460496">Piquero, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0093854812460496">Weisner &amp; Windle, 2004</xref>). However, research also suggests that there is a small subsample of adolescents who engage in problem behaviors at a much higher rate than their peers. This pattern of behavior likely represents atypical processes and is a sign of more serious and chronic forms of problem behavior across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812460496">Moffitt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093854812460496">Patterson &amp; Yoerger, 1993</xref>). Thus, it is important to distinguish between adolescents whose behavior may be short-lived and those who exhibit potential for longer-term behavioral problems.</p>
<p>Despite this knowledge, to this point much of the research on the comorbidity of problem behaviors has been cross-sectional in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812460496">Duncan, Duncan, &amp; Strycker, 2001</xref>). Failing to account for changes in behavior across developmental stages can lead to an incomplete understanding of the nature of deviance proneness by generalizing findings from one developmental stage or age group to the entire period of adolescence. For instance, the failure to account for displacement from one problem behavior to another may lead to the faulty conclusion that curtailing certain problem behaviors represents desistance when it actually represents heterotypic continuity.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We draw on data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) to study the questions described above. The PHDCN is a large, interdisciplinary study aimed at advancing knowledge of children’s psychological, social, and behavioral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812460496">Earls &amp; Visher, 1997</xref>). The original study was based on a multi-stage design where a random sample of 343 neighborhood clusters was initially chosen. Eighty of these clusters were then selected for more intensive study through a stratified sampling design based on socioeconomic status and racial composition. The longitudinal cohort study participants were subsequently drawn from those neighborhood clusters. Households and then individual youth (and caregivers) were randomly selected from within that set of neighborhoods and in-home, face-to-face standardized interviews were conducted with the youth and primary caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812460496">Earls &amp; Visher, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We draw from two cohorts (Age 12 and Age 15) and use data across two measurement waves. One cohort is captured at approximately 14 and 16 and the other is measured at ages 17 and 19. Use of these two cohorts allows us to analyze data across a good portion of adolescence with consistency in measurement of individual problem behavior items. Wave 2 data was collected from 1997-1999 and Wave 3 data was collected from 2000-2001. Overall, the two cohorts comprise a total of 1,124 youth at Wave 2 (623 from Cohort 12, 501 from Cohort 15). The initial response rates were 74.3% and 71.6% for Cohort 12 and Cohort 15 respectively. The current sample was roughly 49% male and 51% female. The race/ethnicity breakdown was 39.8% Hispanic, 32.8% Black, 14.7% White, and 12.7% in other categories. Fifty-three percent of the sample had an annual household income under $30,000. Roughly 25% of families had an income between $30,000 and $49,999. The remaining 22% of the sample had annual incomes above $50,000.</p>

<sec id="section8-0093854812460496">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We analyzed several self-reported measures of adolescent risk behavior that tap different types of substance use, delinquency, and sexual behavior. The substance use measure reflects the number of self-reports of use for the previous year for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and other illicit drugs (e.g., psychedelics, amphetamines). A zero-inflated Poisson distribution was used in the models due to the fact that these measures capture the number of times these substances were used and have a high concentration of zeros (47-84%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812460496">Lambert, 1992</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093854812460496">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Self-reported delinquency was measured across four types of offenses including violent offenses (e.g., carried a hidden weapon, stole purse/pickpocket, used weapon to get money/things), property offenses (e.g., damage property, broke into building, stole from store, bought/sold stolen goods), drug related offenses (e.g., sold pot, sold cocaine), and public order/status offenses (e.g., skipped school, cause trouble in public place). The specific items were chosen to fit with previous work on self-reported offending using PHDCN data. As in prior studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812460496">Kirk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0093854812460496">Raudenbush, Johnson, &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>), Item Response Theory/Rasch procedures were used to develop the measures in the four areas described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812460496">Andrich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812460496">Bond &amp; Fox, 2001</xref>). These measures were then treated as continuous, but censored, in subsequent models due to the prevalence of values at the lower end of their distributions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812460496">Osgood, Finken, &amp; McMorris, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093854812460496">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Risky sexual behavior draws on two items: number of sexual partners in the previous year and whether or not the respondent used birth control/protection during their most recent sexual contact. The latter measure was treated as categorical with “0” indicating that the respondent had not engaged in any sexual activity, “1” indicating that they used protection in their previous sexual experience and “2” denoting that they had not used protection during their last sexual encounter.</p>
<p>Several frequently identified individual and social influences on adolescent problem behavior were included as covariates in the analyses. A self-control measure was developed based on the EASI temperament instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812460496">Buss &amp; Plomin, 1975</xref>). Subscales tapping impulsivity, inhibitory control, sensation seeking, and persistence were averaged to create a pooled measure (α = .64). The four subscales loaded on a single factor with explained variance of 48.3% and standardized loadings that ranged from .46 to .78.</p>
<p>Measures that tap into the youth’s family environment and parental management processes were also included in the analysis. Items were drawn from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812460496">Bradley &amp; Caldwell, 1984</xref>). This instrument is designed to assess the family environment as it contributes to youth development (e.g., provision of prosocial opportunities, parental supervision). Parental warmth is measured using nine items derived from interviewer’s observations of parents during the in-home interviews of primary caregivers and children at wave one (e.g., “Parent encourages child to contribute”, “Parent mentions skill of child”). Parental lack of hostility consists of several observational items that interviewers recorded during the in-home interviews with children/adolescents and primary caregivers. “Parent does not shout at child during visit” or “Parent does not express annoyance with child” were among the observational items that the interviewer was asked to consider. All items were coded “0” (no) or “1” (yes). Higher scores on these summed measures reflect more parental warmth and less hostility, respectively. Each of these scales exhibits good reliability (α = .75 – .89), first factor explained variance (34% – 75%), and individual factor loadings (.39 – .87). There was relatively little variation in terms of the results across the two cohorts.</p>
<p>Parental monitoring and supervision is a 13-item scale that asked caregivers to report on how they directly and indirectly monitor their children. This included items such as “subject has a set time (curfew) to be home on weekend nights,” and “[parent] establishes rules for behavior with peers and asks questions to determine whether they are being followed.” Higher scores on this scale reflect more supervision (α = .43 – .57). Variance explained for the first extracted component (~13 – 17%) and factor loading values (.08 – .72) are low across cohorts. Two dichotomous measures were included in the model to capture whether any member of the respondent’s family had a (a) drinking or drug problem or (b) criminal justice involvement or a legal problem.</p>
<p>The Provision of Social Relationships (PSR) instrument asks questions about the degree to which the youth feels respected and has family and friends whom they can count on if necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0093854812460496">Turner, Frankel, &amp; Levin, 1983</xref>). The three subscales of social support from family members, peers, and others (teachers, coaches) each load highly on a single factor that explains 51.7% of the shared variance among the measures (factor loadings ranged from .44 – .69, α = .50). Items relevant to family members included questions of whether the youth feels that his/her family “has confidence in them” or “helps them find solutions to problems.” They were also asked about their peers, such as whether their friends would take time to talk to them about a problem. The “other social support” questions asked whether they had nonfamily members that they could go to for help if needed.</p>
<p>Delinquent peer influence measures were drawn from a set of 15 items that ask about the degree to which a youth’s “friends or people [they] spend time with” engage in delinquency and substance use, (e.g., “number who purposely damaged property,” “number who attacked someone with weapon,” “number who used marijuana”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812460496">Huizinga, Esbensen, &amp; Weihar, 1991</xref>). All items use the previous year as a reference period. The scale was summed and averaged for each individual (α = .86). Factor analysis indicated that a single factor explained about 35% of the variance with individual item loadings ranging from .42 to .69. The results were similar across cohorts.</p>
<p>In addition to conditioning on study cohort (Age 12, Age 15), three key control variables are utilized in the full model. Gender was coded “0” for female and “1” for male. Race was coded “1” for White and “0” for Nonwhite. Socioeconomic status was constructed by PHDCN investigators and consisted of the principal component of parental caregiver’s (a) maximum education level (less than high school to bachelor’s degree or more), (b) salary (&lt;$5,000 to &gt;$50,000), and (c) maximum SEI occupational prestige of the caregiver and partner’s job.</p>

<sec id="section9-0093854812460496">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were conducted in MPlus Version 6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093854812460496">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2010</xref>) using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation to accommodate missing values (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093854812460496">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093854812460496">3</xref></sup> These maximum likelihood procedures also accounted for the distinct levels of measurement included in the key problem behavior items described above. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) reflects pre-specified assumptions regarding the interrelatedness of the observed variables. The analysis then determines how well the model, reflecting the particular factor structure, fits the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812460496">Long, 1983</xref>). CFA involves a set of regression equations that determine how well each observed variable is explained by the latent factor.</p>
<p>The Latent Class Analysis (LCA) estimates a model that extracts subgroups based on response patterns in the data that can be explained by an underlying categorical grouping of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812460496">Clogg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812460496">McCutcheon, 1987</xref>). Several measures of fit and classification quality were used in the LCA process. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is based on the log-likelihood value of the fitted model (adjusted for the number of estimated parameters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854812460496">Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>); lower values are preferred. The Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) and Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio (BLR) tests compare the specified “k” class model to a “k-1” class version (e.g., three classes vs. two). Lower observed probability values indicate that the more restricted model can be rejected in favor of the one with an added class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812460496">Lo, Mendell, &amp; Rubin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854812460496">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>). “Entropy” ranges from “0” to “1” with higher values reflecting more exact placement of subjects into classes based on their observed responses and the model estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0093854812460496">Vermunt &amp; Magidson, 2003</xref>). Also, the agreement between predicted and actual classification can be examined based on the average overlap of the two in each class (i.e., marginal values in classification table).</p>
<p>As discussed above, studies offer some degree of support for both dimensional (e.g., confirmatory factor analysis) and categorical (e.g., latent class analysis, cluster analysis) approaches to evaluating the structure of adolescent problem behaviors. Therefore, an integrated analysis of categorical and continuous representations of problem behavior may also prove useful for examining the structure of a common latent variable of general deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812460496">Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854812460496">Muthén, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854812460496">2008</xref>). One variant in particular, Factor Mixture Analysis (FMA), helps to define levels of problem behavior within a particular class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854812460496">Muthén, 2006</xref>). FMA draws on both categorical and dimensional orientations; consequently, it is useful in situations that assume a scored construct while also capturing unobserved heterogeneity in the form of distinct subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812460496">Lubke &amp; Muthén, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining shifts in the generality of deviance requires a longitudinal approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854812460496">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0093854812460496">Velicer, Martin, &amp; Collins, 1996</xref>). Latent transition analysis (LTA) is a form of autoregressive modeling that assesses change and stability in latent class “membership” over time. LTA provides estimates aimed at understanding the transition across groups; indicating whether individuals change in status and, if so, what form that shift takes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812460496">Collins &amp; Wugalter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812460496">Reboussin et al., 1998</xref>). The current study does not assume there is a fixed order in transitions among behavioral types; instead, we allow for the possibility that some will escalate, others may desist, and others may displace to additional forms of behavior. We also incorporate covariates into our analyses to assess whether they have any influence on class placement at Wave 2. In considering the hybrid modeling approach described above, we leave open the possibility of a transition model that builds on that measurement structure (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854812460496">Muthén, 2008</xref>). Whereas LTA assumes that there is no factor variance, a transition model that builds on the hybrid structure would allow for such variance.</p>
<p>The analytic process proceeds in multiple steps. First, we specify and test a series of latent class and factor models to consider the optimal measurement structure for problem behaviors in adolescence. This provides some general insight on the relative fit of dimensional, categorical, or mixed views of the generality of deviance. Subsequently, we consider the best model identified at the initial stage of analysis in a longitudinal framework. This involves assessing stability and change in problem behavior over time by estimating a latent transition model that incorporates the measurement structure defined in the earlier steps. We then assess the influence of covariates on initial group status. This amounts to using whichever latent variables emerge from the previous steps as outcomes in regression analysis.</p>

<title>Comparison of Measurement Models</title>
<p>The initial step in the analytic process involved the specification of latent class models that ranged from two to five classes for both Wave 2 and Wave 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0093854812460496">4</xref></sup> The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812460496">Table 1</xref>. At both time points, the five class models had the lowest BIC values but they also had convergence problems that limited the degree to which the solution could be trusted. As a result, additional fit indices, the consistency of the fit and nature of the results across waves, and the substantive meaning of the classes were considered in reaching a decision on whether the three or four class model is preferable. Although there is a great deal of parity between the two, the four class model has a lower BIC value, adequate entropy (.92, .90), and marginal values in the classification table (.92 - .99). The BLR test also suggests that the three class model can be rejected in favor of the one with an additional class for both waves. A final important determinant was the fact that the internal structure of the measurement models had greater consistency across waves in the four class model than in the three class version in terms of the individual conditional item estimates (e.g., drug sales is prominent in the moderate class for Wave 2 but not Wave 3 for the three class version).</p>

The specified structure of the first CFA model, which was based on previous research identifying a one-factor solution representative of general problem behavior, predicted that all of the problem behaviors would load onto that latent factor. Although traditional markers of model fit were unavailable due to the varied levels of measurement incorporated in the analysis, the CFA generally revealed moderate and low fit at Waves 2 and 3 (e.g., R<sup>2</sup> value for the risk behavior factor was .30 at Wave 2 and .10 at Wave 3).</p>

<p>The second CFA model hypothesized three first-order latent factors consisting of drug use, delinquency, and sexual behavior, and one second-order latent factor representing general deviance. The fit for this model was slightly better in terms of the association between the observed items, the within-domain latent variables, and the second-order problem behavior factor. Still, the overall R<sup>2</sup> values for the latent factors improved only marginally at each point (.33 and .12 for Wave 2 and 3, respectively). The hybrid model comprised of two categories with one general latent factor accounting for the within-class variation in each of the classes was then estimated. This model had similar fit to the pure CFA models, but did not fit as well as the latent class specifications.</p>
<p>The BIC is the only common indicator of fit that can be used across the three types of models. Thus, we relied on the BIC values of the various CFA, FMA, and LCA models to identify the most appropriate model across the two waves. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812460496">Table 2</xref>. Across both waves, the values of the BIC clearly support the four-class LCA as the best fitting model when compared alongside the others. The results for the best-fitting measurement model speak to the nature of patterns of deviance in this sample of adolescents. For those included in this study, the categorical approach seems to best capture responses to these problem behavior items.</p>

<p><italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> made up 51% of the sample in Wave 2 and 60% of the sample in Wave 3. These youth had the lowest level of involvement in all of the behaviors included in the models. For example, youth in this group reported an average of less than one lifetime sexual partner and 94% in Wave 2 and 55% in Wave 3 were not sexually active. Additionally, with the exception of alcohol at Wave 3, the conditional scores for this class are uniformly below zero for the substance use and delinquency items indicating none to very little engagement in those behaviors.</p>
<p><italic>Experimenters</italic> comprised 29% of the sample in Wave 2 and 23% of the sample in Wave 3. These youth exhibited average levels of marijuana (W2 = 1.01; W3 = 1.36) and alcohol use (W2 = 1.12; W3 = 1.51) comparable to the <italic>High Risk, Diverse Behavior</italic> and <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> groups, but very low levels of serious drug use (i.e., cocaine and other drugs). For this group, the mean number of partners reported was relatively high in both waves (W2 = 2.44; W3 = 5.59) and the probability of being in the sexually active, but did not use birth control category was relatively low. Adolescents in this group may engage in higher levels of sexual activity than the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainer</italic> and <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> groups, but they take precautions (W2 = .60; W3 = .79).</p>
<p><italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> made up 15% of the Wave 2 sample and 17% of the Wave 3 sample. Youth in this group reported relatively high levels of substance use (W2 = .64 to 1.39; W3 = .74 to 1.54). Compared to the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> and the <italic>Experimenters</italic>, this group also displayed substantially higher levels of violent (W2 = .57; W3 = .23) and property offenses (W2 = .85; W3 = 1.04). Engagement in these offenses was somewhat lower compared to the <italic>High Risk, Diverse Behavior</italic> group, however. This finding suggests that adolescents in this group are engaging in moderately high levels of delinquent activity. Compared to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> and <italic>High Risk, Diverse Behavior</italic> groups, youth in the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> class also had higher probabilities of being in the non-sexually active category and a lower mean number of lifetime partners.</p>
<p>The <italic>High Risk, Diverse Behaviors</italic> class were highest on substance use (W2 = .98 to 1.66; W3 = 4.53 - 1.71)), delinquency, and the average number of sex partners (W2 = 3.27; W3 = 9.00). In particular, the level of reported violent (W2 = 1.25, W3 = 0.97) and property offenses (W2 = 1.81; W3 = 1.79) was considerably higher than in the other three groups. This group made up 5% of the sample in Wave 2 and approximately 1% of the sample in Wave 3. In addition to important differences found across the four classes, there tended to be some consistency in class characteristics across the two waves as well. This offers a measure of support for stability in the makeup of problem behavior groups across late adolescence. As a result, the four-class model served as the basis for the subsequent latent transition analysis.</p>

<title>Latent Transition Analysis</title>
<p>The goal at this stage of the analytic process was to examine stability and change in group membership across the four classes. The parameters of the classes were constrained to be equal across waves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0093854812460496">6</xref></sup> The transition patterns revealed in the LTA model are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854812460496">Table 4</xref> (BIC = −38,246.32; χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.18, p = 0.08). As shown, group membership was generally stable. Just under two-thirds of the total sample remained in the same problem behavior group across the time window (i.e., from Wave 2 to Wave 3). The most notable changes in group membership were the transitions from the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainer</italic> group to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group (14.7%) and from the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> group to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group (6.4%). Also, over half of the youth in the <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behavior</italic> group in Wave 2 transitioned to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group in Wave 3 (36 youth of the original 60). Importantly, less than 3% of the entire sample transitioned into the <italic>High Risk, Diverse Behavior</italic> group across the three years.</p>

<title>Latent Transition Analysis with Covariates</title>
<p>The final step in the analysis involved the introduction of several risk and protective factors. The goal was to identify the individual and social-environmental factors that affect class membership at Wave 2. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854812460496">Table 5</xref>. The estimates represent the likelihood of membership in a given class, relative to the reference, for a one unit change (or categorical difference) in the independent variable. Many of the factors suspected of being related to class membership were not significant. Still, there were a few noteworthy trends that provide useful information regarding placement into these latent classes during mid-adolescence.</p>

Conversely, greater social support predicted a lower likelihood of placement in the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> class relative to the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> (b = −0.04, se = 0.02). The antisocial peer measures revealed a significant, positive effect on class membership. Compared to the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic>, increased levels of antisocial peers led to a greater likelihood of placement into all three groups (<italic>Experimenters</italic>: b = 2.81, se = 0.36; <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic>: b = 2.46, se = 0.37; <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behavior</italic>: b = 4.40, se = 0.56).</p>
<p>It can also be instructive to consider possible contrasts using other reference classes. Relative to <italic>Experimenters</italic> the number of delinquent friends has a positive effect on membership in the <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behaviors</italic> class (b = 1.59, se = 0.56). The cohort measure, which is something of a proxy for age, indicates that those in Cohort 15 had a significantly lower likelihood of membership in any of the other classes when contrasted with the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group. Finally, the third panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854812460496">Table 5</xref>, which shows estimates using the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> class as a contrast, indicates that there are small effects for increased social support in terms of predicting assignment to either the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> (b = 0.04, se = 0.02) or <italic>Experimenters</italic> (b = 0.05, se = 0.02) as opposed to the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> group, which is marked by more serious problem behavior.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide support for a categorical model of adolescent problem behavior. Compared to models reflecting different views of the underlying latent variable, a 4-class LCA model provided the best representation of the response patterns among the problem behavior items included in this study. The four classes were loosely identified as <italic>Low Risk Behavior/Abstainers, Experimenters, Drug Use and Delinquency</italic>, and <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behavior</italic>. These findings are generally similar to recent studies that have also found a 4-class categorical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0093854812460496">Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812460496">Hair et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812460496">Mun et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, support for qualitatively distinct patterns of risky adolescent behavior, as well as a degree of similarity in the nature of those patterns across different samples, is expanding.</p>
<p>Findings supportive of latent subgroups underscore the importance of intervention programs that can be tailored to adolescents with distinct patterns of behavioral problems. Evidence-based programs such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Multisystemic Therapy that can be tailored to the specific needs of each adolescent have shown great promise in reducing a number of problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812460496">Huey, Henggeler, Brondino, &amp; Pickrel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812460496">Landenberger &amp; Lipsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812460496">Lipsey, 2009</xref>). According to the results of this and other recent studies, one potential reason for their effectiveness is the ability to focus on the unique patterns of behavior and associated risk factors specific to each subgroup of adolescents.</p>
<p>The results for the LTA portion of the analysis illustrate the importance of incorporating measurement over time into an understanding of the latent structure of problem behaviors. Although the characteristics of the classes remained similar across the waves and nearly two-thirds of the sample remained in the same group, some important transitions, reflecting both escalation and de-escalation also emerged. The most prevalent transition was the move from the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> group to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group. This group accounted for 15% of the total sample. Almost 10% of the sample exhibited escalation into relatively serious forms of problem behaviors: most commonly from <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> or <italic>Experimenters</italic> to the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> group. This represents a shift in both the level and type of problem behaviors across mid to late adolescence. The findings also identified a small group of adolescents, 7% of the sample, who persisted in serious forms of problem behavior across mid to late adolescence (i.e., remained in the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> or <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behavior</italic> groups).</p>
<p>A great deal of research indicates that prevention programs that (1) begin in early childhood—before the onset of serious misbehavior, and (2) are comprehensive across multiple risk domains are most effective at preventing the development of serious and persistent antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812460496">Farrington &amp; Welsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812460496">Dishion &amp; Kavanagh, 2005</xref>). The stability, as well as the escalation, found in group membership across the waves reinforces the importance of these early prevention programs. Over 20% of the sample was already engaging in risky behaviors (i.e., <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> and <italic>High Risk/Diverse Behavior</italic> group) at Wave 2 (i.e., mid-adolescence) and almost 17% of the sample either transitioned or persisted in groups representing patterns of high-risk behavior at Wave 3. Furthermore, the largest proportion of youth in the <italic>Delinquency and Drug Use</italic> group remained there across the two periods. Research suggests that engagement in serious and persistent problem behaviors across mid to late adolescence is a strong indicator of continuity in problem behaviors across the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812460496">Massoglia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812460496">Moffitt, 1993</xref>), providing further evidence to support the use of early intervention targeted at problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812460496">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Important similarities and differences in the risk and protective factors that predicted group membership were also revealed at the final stage of the analysis. Having antisocial peers seems to be a universal risk factor for engaging in some type of problem behavior as opposed to abstaining. The mechanisms by which antisocial peers have an influence on behavior may differ across the groups, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0093854812460496">Warr, 2002</xref>). For example, the effect of having antisocial peers on the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group may represent a normative process intertwined with increased independence and faulty adolescent judgment. Several researchers have argued that mid to late adolescence is characterized by experimentation in a range of risk behaviors, which is part of “normal” adolescent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812460496">Mun et al., 2008</xref>). Adolescent judgment is less mature than adults, which leads them to take more risks because they are more susceptible to peer pressure and less able to inhibit their impulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0093854812460496">Steinberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812460496">Cauffman &amp; Steinberg, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The risk factors for placement into the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> group include low social support, antisocial peers, and family member criminal and legal problems. Lower levels of positive social support may lead some youth to seek out the approval of their parents and peers by engaging in negative behaviors modeled after significant others. This specific difference in the possible effects of a risk factor across groups underscores the importance of clearly demarcating the etiology underlying problem behavior and tailoring interventions based on an understanding of those processes. For example, for youth at-risk for placement into the <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> group, the findings would support the use of multi-system, multi-component intervention programs focusing on the youth and family’s problem behavior, building positive support systems, and cognitive-behavioral restructuring to alter maladaptive learning processes. For youth at risk for placement into the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group, prevention programs aimed at education and development of peer refusal skills may be more appropriate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0093854812460496">Wright, Nichols, Graber, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Botvin, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond early prevention, through understanding the antecedents of escalation into serious forms of problem behavior, timely interventions may be delivered to modify developing trajectories and to distinguish between adolescent “experimenters” and those moving toward more serious and chronic antisocial behavior. For instance, two common transitions found in this study were <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers to Experimenters</italic> and <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers to Drug Use and Delinquency</italic>. As noted above, mid to late adolescence is characterized by experimentation in a range of risk behaviors that are sometimes considered “normal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812460496">Mun et al., 2008</xref>). So, although the transition from the <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> group to the <italic>Experimenters</italic> group represents an escalation in behavior, it may not necessarily signal a cause for serious concern. Identifying the risk and protective factors that distinguish youth transitioning from <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> to <italic>Experimenters</italic> from youth moving from <italic>Low Risk/Abstainers</italic> to <italic>Drug Use and Delinquency</italic> is critical to prevent persistent problem behavior in adulthood and the associated negative outcomes and costs. This was not entirely possible here due to the low sample sizes inherent in some of the observed stability/transition patterns. Nonetheless, understanding the factors related to stability and change across mid to late adolescence is critical to fully understanding and intervening in problem behaviors. Accordingly, future research should attempt to further solidify the understanding of key influences on such transition patterns while also elucidating underlying processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812460496">Farrington, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study has a few additional limitations. First, the pool of items for deriving latent classes was somewhat limited—particularly in terms of risky sexual behavior. Future studies might incorporate a wider array of measures in that domain, including condom use, history of infectious disease, and sex while using drugs or alcohol. Further, limitations in the measures that were used, such as low reliability in measuring parental factors, may have contributed to some individual estimates that did not meet expectations. Secondly, the time frame within which common measures could be used was relatively short. While some of this reflects the fact that different behaviors will be more or less salient at particular points in time, future research might try to capitalize on a lengthier observation window within adolescence and/or across developmental stages. While the study did incorporate predictors of initial class membership, there were some limitations in terms of the available measures. Many of the covariates reflected family influences; further research could be done with individual characteristics and an expansion of measures of the youths’ social environment.</p>
<p>Building on this study and recent related findings, future research on adolescent problem behaviors should be flexible with respect to the possible latent structure of problem behaviors and continue to rely on multiple modeling approaches, accommodating the possibility of categorical and/or dimensional perspectives, to investigate their co-occurrence. Recent research also underscores the need to incorporate multiple time points in studying the structure of adolescent problem behaviors. At the same time, research should continue to disentangle the effect of antisocial peers, and other relevant individual and social environmental factors, on the continuity and change in problem behaviors.</p>
<p>In sum, this study provides some further evidence that adolescents who engage in problem behaviors are not a homogeneous population, but rather, a “heterogeneous mosaic of subgroups” of different behavioral patterns and risk and protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812460496">DiClemente et al., 2008</xref>, p. 600). This lends support for the use of prevention programs aimed at the behavioral patterns, as well as domains of risk, specific to different groups of adolescence. Intervention programs can be quite costly and the possible iatrogenic effects of intervention for adolescents engaging in low-risk behaviors cannot be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812460496">Dishion, McCord, &amp; Poulin, 1999</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0093854812460496">Weiss et al., 2005</xref> for a review). Ensuring that the right individuals are receiving the right type of services is essential to producing positive outcomes while ensuring cost-effectiveness.</p>
