<abstract>
<p>The article addresses the debates on transnational communities and the construction of global identities by reflecting upon personal narratives of frequent work-related mobility. It explores the process of “cosmopolitanization” through narratives of self-transformation during perpetual assignments of expatriation and repatriation. The discussion is based on autobiographical evidence, namely, personal diary vignettes, the analysis of which reveals the importance of emplacement and translocality in the reconstitution of identity during transient inhabitation of places. The article informs the studies on global or mobile careers exploring some aspects of a translocal identity in the context of practiced cosmopolitanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prior research has theorized migrants and members of transnational work communities as “cosmopolitans” describing cosmopolitanism as an ethico-political endeavor that underpins new institutional as well as political arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492611435509">Nowicka &amp; Rovisco, 2009</xref>). In a special issue of the <italic>British Journal of Sociology</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611435509">Beck and Sznaider (2006)</xref> talk about the “cosmopolitan condition” to describe a sociocultural project that deciphers “the complex entanglements of cosmopolitanism with the visual, with mobilities, and with changing forms of ‘being-in-the-world’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1056492611435509">Szerszynski &amp; Urry, 2006</xref>, p. 115). Their cosmopolitan turn calls for the reconceptualization of social relations, away from a dualist nation-state toward relational, deterritorialized “entangled modernities.” This cosmopolitan (a continuation of the postmodern) condition is not only a process of really existing relations of interdependencies but also a process “bound up with symbol and ritual . . . that turns philosophy into personal and social identity and consequently relevant for social analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611435509">Beck &amp; Sznaider, 2006</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Yet, despite a rather large breadth of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611435509">Calhoun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611435509">Delanty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492611435509">Harvey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492611435509">Mitchell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1056492611435509">Pogge, 1992</xref>), <italic>cosmopolitanism</italic> still remains largely a contested and heavily criticized term with different definitions. In this article, it will be discussed as an individual practice that signifies the “<italic>discovery of one’s own way</italic>” through other localities and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492611435509">Hazner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1056492611435509">Segura, 2010</xref>). This discovery has been linked, by bottom-up approaches to cosmopolitanism, with economic and environmental sustainability, civil society, activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1056492611435509">Heater, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1056492611435509">Santos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1056492611435509">Santos, 2006</xref>) and a skeptical and critical rather than utopian and idealized globalist vision of the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611435509">Beck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611435509">Beck, 2006</xref>). Following this, in this article, cosmopolitanism will describe the willingness to engage with the “other,” to emotionally and intellectually open up to divergent ways of being in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492611435509">Held, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492611435509">Mau, Mewes, &amp; Zimmermann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1056492611435509">Szerszynski &amp; Urry, 2006</xref>), a state which will be explored through the concepts of mobility and place identity. Thus, this article links what I call a practiced cosmopolitanism with research on global careers, examining how a “from within” (or bottom-up) cosmopolitan epistemology can inform and enrich our study of expatriation and expatriates’ identity transformation.</p>
<p>A great deal of literature in organization studies has examined identities as constructed, situated and fluid, constantly redefined and transformed through social interaction and self-reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611435509">Alvesson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611435509">Beech, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492611435509">Goffman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492611435509">Hall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492611435509">Hatch &amp; Schultz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492611435509">Sarup, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1056492611435509">Shotter &amp; Gergen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1056492611435509">Stone, 1962</xref>). I will build upon these views on personal identity and examine the impact of frequent international assignments on identity transformation. In particular, I will explore how some aspects of the “cosmopolitan condition” are enacted during a process of identity transformation employing autobiographical narratives. The analysis will be based upon my personal diaries as an expatriate/repatriate academic, a career outside my country of origin which, however, requires frequent (repeated) expatriation assignments to my country of origin. I consider the vignettes presented in this article to be stories that have framed and continue to frame my ways of relating to others in the context of my work: I envisage to contribute to autoethnographic approaches in organization studies as well as in the field of expatriate/repatriate narratives reflecting upon the concepts of emplacement and translocality and their impact on the construction of a cosmopolitan, translocal identity. I will suggest that future discussions about “global careers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1056492611435509">Stahl &amp; Chua, 2006</xref>) ought to reflect the multidimensionality and indeterminacy of <italic>being located yet mobile</italic>, an embodied transformative experience that gradually changes the frame of reference through which we relate to ourselves and others and to places and localities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the article’s contribution is twofold: First, it addresses the limited autoethnographic work in the organizational literature with an autobiographical approach demonstrating how a self-reflexive analysis of personal narratives can contribute to organization theory. Second, it proposes the concept of practiced cosmopolitanism as a platform for the exploration of a particular mode of identity transformation, which occurs when individuals embody the concepts of emplacement and translocality in the context of frequent international mobility. The first part of the article will present a brief account of prior autoethnographic and autobiographical work in management and organization studies highlighting the limited self-reflexive work in the field. The next section will refer to prior research on personal narratives of identity construction and how it has informed the study of my identity transformation as a mobile employee. After that, four diary vignettes will be presented and reflexively analyzed leading to the formation of the two emerging themes, emplacement and translocality. These will be discussed in the final section of the article as two of the key aspects of practiced cosmopolitanism. The final section of the article also considers the theoretical and practical implications of this work, explaining how my understanding of the cosmopolitan condition frames working relations, informs organization theory, and guides future studies on cross-cultural careers and management of mobile employees.</p>

<title>Autoethnography and Autobiography in Organization Studies</title>
<p><italic>Autoethnography</italic>, a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492611435509">Hayano (1979)</xref> and initially used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492611435509">Heider (1975)</xref> refers to the “personal narrative, where scientists view themselves as the phenomenon and write evocative stories specifically focused on their academic as well as their personal lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611435509">Ellis, 2004</xref>, p. 45). The term is used rather broadly to include writing traditions ranging from self-stories to reflexive or narrative ethnography and often employs engaging and evocative language. As an editor, Jean Boddewyn encouraged the submission of more autobiographical articles for the <italic>Journal of International Business Studies</italic>, and following this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611435509">Dunning (2002)</xref> and later on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1056492611435509">Starbuck (2006)</xref> wrote an autobiographical account of their professional experience as academics. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1056492611435509">Tenni, Smyth, and Boucher (2003)</xref> suggested collaborative analysis, forms of grounded theory and poetry, art, and drama as tools in the analysis of autobiographical work and more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1056492611435509">Wallace (2009)</xref> analyzed career stories of women using Simon de Beauvoir’s writings on an interesting account of feminist voices in organizational research. These aforementioned studies and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611435509">Cohen, Duberley, &amp; Musson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492611435509">Learmonth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492611435509">Muncey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611435509">Reed-Danahay, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1056492611435509">Reed-Danahay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1056492611435509">Spry, 2001</xref>) have used personal experiences in the study of organizations.</p>
<p>However, there is limited auto-reflexive analysis of autobiographical documents particularly when it comes to the following: first, the study of identity transformation at work and second, the study of identity transformation during expatriation or international assignments. The contributions of three studies are valuable exceptions: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611435509">Cotterill and Letherby (1993)</xref> explore academic reflexivity in relato feminist research; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611435509">Haynes (2006)</xref> reflects upon the co-construction of personal (motherhood) and professional (accountant) identities and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1056492611435509">Vickers (2007)</xref> discusses identity changes in targets of bullying. Building upon these studies, the autoethnographic method adopted in this article offers direct access to the lived experience of self-transformation, direct access to “the internal monologue that provides a narrative sense of personal, subjective continuity which we think of as ‘our self’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611435509">Land, 2005</xref>, p. 453):
<disp-quote>
<p>Being inside the whale is one aspect of the autobiographical connection with ethnographic research. Another is being part of one’s own research process. In this, the researcher explicitly sets out to investigate how particular processes (like decision making and creativity and making sense of experience) take place, and include himself/herself as a protagonist. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492611435509">Hannabuss, 2000</xref>, p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much of contemporary interest in autobiographical analysis lies in its mediational role, its capacity to intertwine theory and experience. By employing autobiographical methodologies, we can understand how our academic “characters” fit the plot of our personal life and how our experiences as practitioners in/transform the plot of our academic scenarios: the academic-practitioner will create meaning out of experiences taking into consideration historical and institutional discourses that render these experiences and meanings relevant to engaging audiences. The subject matter of autobiographic writing<disp-quote>
<p>is concretely <italic>experienced</italic> reality and not the realm of brute external fact. External reality is embedded in experience, but it is viewed from within the modification of inward life forming our experience; external fact attains a degree of symptomatic value derived from inward absorption and reflection . . . Autobiography [therefore] presupposes a writer’s intent upon reflection on this inward realm of experience, someone for whom this inner world of experience is important. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1056492611435509">Weintraub, 1975</xref>, pp. 822-823)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This inward and outward orientation of the discourse characterizing autobiographical texts demonstrates the intersection between life (experienced) and conceptual knowledge or the understanding of life through “formalised self-reflection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492611435509">Marcus, 1994</xref>, p. 137). Thus, by using autobiography as a methodological practice rather than a mere data source, “using both overt and reflexive autobiographical material, using an autobiographical lens through which the research is filtered, [we can access our] own ontology, and [make ourselves] an object for analytical discussion, in a way that links epistemology and methodology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492611435509">Haynes, 2006</xref>, p. 407). More importantly, autoethnographic approaches, including autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611435509">Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492611435509">Ketelle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492611435509">Reed-Danahay, 1997</xref>), constitute a “poetic science,” a critical narrative inquiry that lies at the “intersection of art and science”:<disp-quote>
<p>the social scientist, broadly conceived and imagined, can and should enter into the endeavor and, when the situation calls for it, do so as imaginatively and artfully as possible through creating work that not only purveys knowledge of this or that area but that uses writing, that uses form, in a way that truly serves the content, and the people, in question. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611435509">Freeman, 2006</xref>, p. 141)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taking on this poetic challenge, I will employ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492611435509">Gunn’s (1982)</xref> three interrelated and constituting elements of autobiographical writing to analyze and reflect upon my diary vignettes: The first element, <italic>impulse</italic>, describes the ways through which we try to create meaning of past experience and reconstruct the self based on these experiences. By reconstructing the self through auto-narrativization, we come to perform various discourses and realize alternative forms of action; a sense-making process. Through the second element, <italic>perspective</italic>, the authors/subjects position themselves within the wider sociocultural context and redefine action based on historical and institutional discourses within which action is embedded: a process of narrating myself-in-place or a self-placing activity. Finally, through the last one, <italic>response</italic>, the autobiographical vignettes presented here invite the readers to a shared interpretation of experience as a platform for reflection and action: a praxis. This autobiographical work is a form of radical introspection that transforms my practice as an academic (writer) who not only writes about narratives but also inhabits them. Thus, I propose autobiographical writing as a valuable tool in organizational research, a methodology as well as a reflexive framework that could potentially enrich our understanding of work and organizations.</p>

<title>Narratives of Expatriation: Accounts of an Emerging Cosmopolitan Identity</title>
<p>Recently, a special issue in <italic>Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal</italic> reestablished expatriation as a topic of contemporary and relevant research with articles on female expatriates, expatriates’ adjustment in emerging markets, roles of expatriates’ spouses, marital status, and its effect on self-initiated expatriates, a reward perspective on expatriates’ affective commitment and expatriates’ compensation packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1056492611435509">Selmer &amp; Suutari, 2011</xref>). Earlier research on expatriation also addressed issues of learning and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492611435509">Gertsen &amp; Søderberg, 2010</xref>), cross-cultural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1056492611435509">Siljanena &amp; Lämsä, 2009</xref>), and stress that expatriates and their families may face before, during, and after the expatriation/repatriation experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611435509">Adler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611435509">Black, Mendenhall, &amp; Oddou, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492611435509">Mendenhall &amp; Oddou, 1985</xref>). Escape from complexity, institutionalized marginality, illusion, and heightened visibility have all been seen as part of the expatriates’ subjective interpretation of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611435509">Ambuske, 1990</xref>). Expatriates’ dual loyalty to the home or host organization has also been explored as a transformation process, in some cases described as leading ideally to the identification halfway between the cultures involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611435509">Black &amp; Gregersen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492611435509">Richardson &amp; McKenna, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492611435509">Sanchez, Spector, &amp; Cooper, 2000</xref>). For “international itinerants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611435509">Banai &amp; Harry, 2004</xref>) like academics, who are moving between organizations as well as between several countries and cultures, this identification often becomes blurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492611435509">Katrinli &amp; Penbek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492611435509">Richardson &amp; McKenna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492611435509">Richardson &amp; McKenna, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The expatriation literature has also been informed by social constructionist views and, particularly, by narrative views on identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611435509">Bruner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611435509">Collinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611435509">Czarniawska-Joerges, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611435509">Holman, Gold, &amp; Thorpe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1056492611435509">Shotter &amp; Cunliff, 2003</xref>). “Indeed, identity without narrative would be superficial and lack meaning . . . It is because of the importance of narrative to identity that writers talk about ‘narrative identity’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1056492611435509">Ricoeur, 1990/1992</xref>, p. 56, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492611435509">Holman, Gold, &amp; Thorpe, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492611435509">Kohonen (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492611435509">2005)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611435509">Gardner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492611435509">Osland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492611435509">Schneider &amp; Asakawa, 1995</xref>) take these views into consideration in their expatriates’ narrative analysis and propose that international assignments are transformative experiences. It is not just a developmental identity process but “a change in the composition of selfhood, perhaps a minor rearrangement in what one is” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1056492611435509">Peltonen, 1998</xref>, p. 888). This reflexive construction and reconstruction of a narrative self is “a potentially effective way of dealing with the openness and uncertainties of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611435509">Alvesson, 2010</xref>, p. 212), aspects that a translocal career undoubtedly entails.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though the need for identity transformation and the reconstitution of self have been discussed extensively, all prior work in the field aspires to a coherent (though adjustable) identity necessary for the ontological security of mobile employees; hence, rational and linear narratives of self-identity have been rarely problematized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611435509">Land, 2005</xref>). Addressing this and consequently, trying not to impose linearity and order on my personal narratives, I present my personal stories as they were experienced, disjointed, fragmented, and rhizomic. I recognize the lack of a unique, complete story in favor of a compelling number of voices that celebrates the plurality and contradictions that characterize mobility, transformation, and cosmopolitanization. As a result, I construct a cosmopolitan translocal identity that entails the inhabitation of intermediate spaces of temporary displacement and perpetual dislocation.</p>
<p>The analysis of my autobiographical narratives, in other words, will demonstrate that the impact of expatriation/repatriation on self-identity is complex, undecided, and polyvocal and does not necessarily lead to a heroic representation of the global manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1056492611435509">Osland, 1995</xref>). The “cosmopolitan condition,” I will propose, requires constant change in the frame of reference and values, a realignment of social patterns and ontological positioning, which sometimes may not become complete, finite, but remain unbounded, multiple and incoherent. This article is a way of exteriorizing feelings, (re)-shaping experience, and (dis)connecting with an endless journey: from home (London), back home (Athens). In the section that follows, I reflect upon four narratives, part of a series of vignettes that my personal diary includes, which concurrently—yet not in finality—constructed an identity of what I call a non-Euclidean<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1056492611435509">1</xref></sup> cosmopolitan: someone who takes herself back and forth from place to place (both textually and physically/geographically), not seeking for the bridges, not adapting to the differences (cultural, spatial, or social) but simply embracing immanent encounters, multiplicity, and incompleteness.</p>

<title>Narratives of Emplacement and Translocality: The Diary Entries</title>
<p>Following a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1056492611435509">Thomas and Znaniecki (1958)</xref> historical tradition, life story researchers have recognized the value of a variety of personal documents that unveil aspects of people’s lives, based on the fact that these are means through which participants can freely express and construct meaningful aspects of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611435509">Harrison, 2009</xref>). These personal documents include letters, diaries, journals, auto/biographies, and memoirs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611435509">Cooper, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1056492611435509">Stanley, 1993</xref>). In this article, I have chosen to discuss four vignettes from my personal diary that I suggest demonstrate how the themes of emplacement and translocality emerged in relation to my identity reconstruction as a cosmopolitan. <italic>Translocality</italic>, a term also used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611435509">Appadurai (1998)</xref>, denotes the in-between places in which mobile people are locally grounded, connecting in a way the notion of mobility and emplacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611435509">Christou, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611435509">Conradson &amp; Latham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1056492611435509">Sinatti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1056492611435509">Smith, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1056492611435509">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1056492611435509">Wanning, 2010</xref>). That is, the “trans” describes not only the movement from place to place (mobility) but also the process of inhabiting a transitory place (emplacement).</p>
<p>The four vignettes, two from 2005, one from 2008, and another from 2009, portray how my personal and professional journeys evolved and merged in an attempt to release myself from a Western, modernist need to construct a cohesive identity and reflect upon my experience in relation to a concrete yet intermediate place. My narration starts below with two conference events in which the themes of emplacement and translocality start forming as dimensions in a process of self-transformation:<disp-quote>
<p>Suddenly, I was disorientated, a familiar feeling that had started haunting me occasionally after the beginning of my current job. It was three years ago when I started working as a Director of Overseas Collaborations for a British University and their Greek partner institution. This meant that every two months, I had to spend a week to a month working in Greece, my country of origin and place where I spent the first 20 years of my life. That day in the conference, momentarily, I felt Greek but . . . It is not the case for people to pause when they have to answer the question “where do you come from?” I did. In fact, being away from both London and Athens had somehow unsettled me; Of course, in London if the same question was posed to me I would have said “I come from Greece.” Similarly, if I was to be asked when in Athens, I would have answered “I live in London but I also live here, I come here regularly . . . .” Now, first time across the Atlantic, I seemed not to be able to find the “other” against who to define myself, we were all others in this room somehow, I thought. That day, across the Atlantic, I hesitated. Could working in my country of origin so regularly be responsible for my hesitation? “Where do I come from?” I was feeling out of place, no, not because I was in Philadelphia. Out of place being Here or There, where I was born and Here and There, where I live; Here and There, where I work and Here and There, where I have always to understand, to remember, to belong, to distance from, to connect, to arrive, to depart… Where did I come from? Dislocated, misplaced, yet with a surprising conviction, I answered: “It is complicated, where can I start from.” (Diary Entry, April 2005, Conference, Philadelphia, USA)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And then almost a year later, I wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>There I was again, a delegate in an international conference, this time in Germany, socialising with fellow academics from all over the world: “[my name], where are you from?” “Oh, well, I came from London, I work in London for a British University but I am Greek . . . I also work in Greece.” Again, a familiar hesitation, a feeling of having to . . . justify (?) myself for what I am and for what I also am, or I am not, an uneasiness. For almost three years now, I have been living through the stories I tell about being and not being there . . . We all live through our stories but mine? Somehow disconnected, actually some of them totally disconnected. Stories that always leave me with this sense of incompleteness; before I finish them, I have to fly back, go somewhere, leave behind, only to expect that I will find the same or other stories again soon, maybe not there but somewhere, somewhere else, not here. My life is as if it is lived only when I tell these stories about me not-here, not before. And I know that as I talk about my past, I try to bridge the gap between the two places, to eradicate the distance, to stand still. Or, at least, if I could take you all with me, here and there? People, events, conversations fade in a recurrent question: “when are you leaving again?” Standing still, trying to find my centre, me the decentred one, to find my balance with one foot on one boat and the other on another, like this, balancing, I feel I am sailing away, somewhere else, not here. Yes, I also work in Greece, yes, I have a home there, yes, and my home is in London. . . . Which part of the story do you want to hear? (July 2005, Diary Entry, Conference, Berlin)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Which part of the story do I want to tell? I was born in Athens, and now I am a permanent resident in the United Kingdom, a British academic for almost 12 years; yet part of my current role requires frequent—every 2 months—trips to Greece that last from 1 week to a month, sometimes more. I guess this is a form of repeat expatriation; however, as Greece is my country of origin, it is also a temporary repatriation. In the aforementioned conference experiences, I felt the need to clarify that, to justify my confusion when the question was posed, to claim back my “Greek identity” yet to construct a new one at the same time as an academic in the United Kingdom, who is Greek and also works in Greece periodically. Could going back to work in my country of origin potentially be the trigger for my “identity crisis?” There was something paradoxical in that. It must be traveling, other voices would tell me. But what is travel?
<disp-quote>
<p>Travel, like existence, is a nonfigurative art. Travel is in the head. It is the allegiance to a complicated spatial ritual and a radical simplification of existence. It is a moon-landing at the outlying point of all rest. Travel is an anamorphosis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611435509">Baudrillard, 1996</xref>, pp. 29-30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My desire (Western, modernist ontology) to understand things in a linear way, to organize events in a coherent and progressive manner had come in direct conflict with the fragmentation and cyclicality of the meaning-making process that I was experiencing. Narration contexts are not subject-centered but processes that occur within an established realm of discourse. Thus, communities’ embedded identities are continuously constructed within the groups to which they belong. I was reconstructing my identity—as a perpetual expatriate and repatriate to and from my country of origin—within discursive boundaryless spaces. What I also had to reconstruct, however, was my ontological position and my method of defining the self: from a practicing materialist–realist I had to become “realising” and “de-realising” deconstructionist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611435509">Boje, Rosile, &amp; Gardner, 2004</xref>). It is very easy to adopt postmodernism when you are writing your doctoral thesis; yet what happens when you have to embody Jameson’s “schizophrenia” (1998) while seeking to perform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611435509">Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987/2004b)</xref> “radical schizophrenic,” a revolutionary and nomadic wanderer? And your life when you think back, when you narrate, resembles <italic>Cool Memories II</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>The world has become a seminar. Everything now takes this wearisome academic form. Some existences are merely perpetual seminars, with the hope of a cool grave in Cultures’ shade at the end. The Last Judgment transformed into a giant symposium, with all travel and hotel expenses paid. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611435509">Baudrillard, 1996</xref>, p. 33)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My transient work experiences resulted in incomplete narrative performances that left me with various unlinked threads full of discrepancies, conflicts, and incoherence. The constant (re)telling of experience due to the frequent nature of my expatriation/repatriation became a form of self-reflection about past, present and future activities. Yet, at the same time, it highlighted the dynamic interrelationship that existed among narratives and ante-narratives (active and in flux on a constant basis) and left me with an “unfinished,” incomplete story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611435509">Boje, 2001</xref>), “a polyphony of competing narrative voices and stories told by many voices within different historical, cultural, and relational contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611435509">Cunliff, Luhman, &amp; Boje, 2004</xref>, p. 276). “When walking down the street, the internal monologue and experience itself, is realised as a series of interruptions and random juxtapositions . . . language produces a “false” appearance of subjective coherence and narrative continuity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611435509">Land, 2005</xref>, p. 459). Nevertheless, a seemingly coherent narrative identity is described in a recent study on international itinerants:
<disp-quote>
<p>Regardless of the experienced discontinuities the repeat expatriates maintain a sense of coherence which makes the transitions less difficult. In their narratives, the repeat expatriates integrate their experiences and as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611435509">Ezzy (1998)</xref>, it provides a subjective sense of self-continuity. Whereas for the international itinerants the temporality and transitions in themselves become important, they find a sense of coherence even though doing different things as they have established themselves in their global careers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492611435509">Nasholm, 2011</xref>, p. 182)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I had, therefore, to find coherence, to find self-continuity, and to construct my own heroic narrative of a truly global employee. Yet, the Deleuzian “radical schizophrenia” seemed closer, looking back to what I wrote a few years later:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sitting on the bus, my mind wanders off and then suddenly, I am surprised to realize where I am (in this double-decker bus?): “I am in London!” I say to myself, full of surprise, “of course you are,” I reply, equally surprised. I smile with my momentary confusion and then I wonder: awareness of the interior, lack of connection with the exterior, realization and distancing; processes that for a minute do not matter as “I” could be anywhere and, like waking up from a dream, I had to look around and reconnect, identify with. And then it strikes me how often I experience this, and often, I need to re-place myself, I find it difficult to identify and define the inside in relation to the outside (or is it the outside in relation to the inside?). The familiar does suddenly become unfamiliar. I notice the colours; I look around like I can see for the first time, trying to fit myself in the picture, to place myself in the map. I often do that; I imagine the world map and then from above mark my position on it. I am not sure what makes me do that but I compelled to do it. Zoom out and then zoom in, all the way to the point where I stand. To locate myself, I suppose, only for a moment however, before I zoom out again. Does it matter? I suppose it does . . . Snapshots of my life. Before I miss my stop, I push the red button. I am in the streets of London again; I am walking home. (Diary Entry, November 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The frequent changes (perpetual nature of expatriation/repatriation experience) in the sociocultural and topological environment (and consequently my relations, discourses, and representations) that I experience require shifts between the levels of self-categorization. This could reflect the opposing forces of assimilation and differentiation, which seem to be responsible for the fluctuations in the degrees of identification either with the collective or the individuated self. In “<italic>In Another Place, Not Here</italic>,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611435509">Brand (1996)</xref> portrays the diasporic experience for the women characters and indicates that their consequent feeling of not belonging “emerges symbolically from their spatial dislocation—a displacement that mirrors their inability to fit in or to become part of a world from which they are alienated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611435509">Almeida, 2008</xref>, p. 16). Fitting in requires reworking of relations to ensure singularization of broken experiences and a “fixed oedipal self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611435509">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1984/2004a</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>More fundamentally, the trap of linear narrative time produced by language has arrested the development of difference by constantly fixing it back upon identity. Human identity is straitjacket that reterritorializes inhuman forces, potentials and differences back onto oedipally legitimated identities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492611435509">Land, 2005</xref>, p. 457)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, cross-cultural contact produces less stable interaction systems that, as a result, lead to the formation of temporary identity structures visibly produced through social processes. Fragmentation and change of identities through role negotiation and conflict suggest therefore that any self-authoring attempt would be temporary and “in relation to others, a writing that takes place in social/historical contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611435509">Deetz, 2003</xref>, p. 125). My expatriation, which at the same time is a form of repatriation, is a transitory experience that brought about iterant narrations that re-create an open and heterogeneous place identity. This openness and heterogeneity are necessary for inhabiting a “home” in-between, inhabiting my <italic>Erewhon</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1056492611435509">2</xref></sup>: a place where “movement is not from one point to another, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, without departure or arrival” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611435509">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1987/2004b</xref>, p. 389). It is not order, self-continuity, and realization of the desire for the coherent self and stable homogeneous place reference<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1056492611435509">3</xref></sup> but disorder, fluidity, and impossibility that govern this mode of inhabitation: being mobile yet located. To put it differently, emplacement and translocality materialize <italic>because of</italic> the impossible desire, the eternal force in the process of becoming: “Everything stops dead for a moment, everything freezes in place—and then the whole process will begin over again” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611435509">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1984/2004a</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>I quote from my diary almost 1 year later:
<disp-quote>
<p>Getting off the plane, I cannot wait to pick up my red suitcase (this time is the small one) and walk through the airport gates. I am here, I am in Athens. Trying to remember when I was last here . . . So much has happened since then. No, it can’t be that long . . . surely! In the taxi, I look outside the window and a strange kind of familiarity makes me smile. As the taxi approaches the inner city, we drive down a street with tangerine trees. I go back in time. Their smell reminds me of my childhood . . . this for some inexplicable reason makes me reflect on what has happened since the last time I arrived at the airport, picked up my suitcase, got a taxi (which way around? For a moment in time I lose track, my thoughts follow a path, or is it a circle?); I arrive, pick up my suitcase, unpack, pack, go the airport, arrive, unpack . . . (which way around?); I am thinking of events that happened, news to share, things to do; I have already started telling stories, my mind already reconstructs the experiences since the last time I was there (here). “Which there” (here)? Does it matter? Maybe not anymore because I, during my plane or taxi rides away from home and towards home (which home?), always try to reconstruct the narrative, to identify . . . but the story never ends and I? I look back to all the accounts, the accounts of my life, my work, my-self and realize that it is all unfinished embeddings of old and new me, of here and there, fragments, fuzzy memories of my attempt to be. Momentarily, at times like this, I grasp it: the fluidity of being and the actuality of becoming, the smell of tangerines, me then and me now. I get off the taxi, I have arrived at work. (Diary Entry, from the Airport, December 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In an attempt to emplace myself, I began questioning singularity, linearity, and separateness, which not only played a big role in formulating my essentialist approach to identity work but also constructed my feelings of displacement. The “failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492611435509">Lacan, 1992</xref>) that mark our conscious discourse are not errors of speech but important aspects of our self-construction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492611435509">Driver, 2009</xref>, p. 59). These repeated failures to construct a linear identity-in-place resulted in a self-knowledge, a resource for the constitution of a new cosmopolitan understanding of my work role, an identity in-between places, a sanctuary that contextualizes solitude not as an isolated moment of singularity, but through a sense of becoming; a place where I could explore my translocation (here and there), the spiritual and the physical, discovering that meaning is created through intersection and transformation.</p>
<p>In Angela Carter’s <italic>The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman</italic>, an example of perpetual mobility is presented, in which the narrator becomes overwhelmed with the “constant movement of the infinite” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1056492611435509">Shaviro, 2009</xref>, p. 123) and only desires everything to stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611435509">Bell, 2010</xref>). The ontological desire to order things, to own my stories was initially responsible for my feelings of displacement: place could only be defined if I stopped moving (<italic>to stand still</italic>). It was not a “failure” of my conscious discourse to construct a unified or even heterogeneous and fluid sense of self; it was a response to a lived state of impermanence rather than finality, spatial, and chronological fluidity rather than ordered historical chronology. This response required a constant redefinition of my emplacement strategies, the telling of a story that starts from the middle and sometimes never ends.</p>
<p>Through the inhabitation of a smooth, “heterogeneous, in continuous variation . . . amorphous and not homogenous” space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611435509">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1987/2004b</xref>, p. 536), I am learning to relate to the world in a nebulous way. It is not <italic>still</italic>; it is still and mobile and because of that, it creates new possibilities for being in the world. An internalized, practiced cosmopolitanism presupposes a strategy to break away from this double-bind of still/mobile, smooth/striated. What is important here is the passages linking mentally and physically smooth and striated, homogenous and heterogeneous spaces. This is because passages are the becomings: they reveal a <italic>chora</italic> in-between that in order to inhabit it in its exile, “we leave the rational dwellings we construct and try to belong to, and deepen our consciously constructed image of the world by facing signs of our wilderness” (Brown, 1966, p. 261):
<disp-quote>
<p>I never saw this <italic>strange dwelling</italic> again. Indeed, as I see it now, the way it appeared to my child’s eyes, it is not a building, but is quite dissolved and distributed inside me: here one room, there another, and here a bit of corridor which, however, does not connect the two rooms, but is conserved in me in fragmentary form. Thus the whole thing is scattered about inside me, the rooms, the stairs that descended with such ceremonious slowness, others, narrow cages that mounted in a spiral movement, in the darkness of which we advanced like the blood in our veins. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1056492611435509">Rilke, 1910/1983</xref>, p. 33, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I inhabit this “strange dwelling” by going here and there, by embodying a pendulum movement from order to disorder. I can only achieve this through mobility, by a continuous process of placing myself in territories, by deterritorializing myself, by inventing new trajectories, new socialities, a grid of identities. This personal journey is my perpetual folding and unfolding, my nomadic voyage to a non-Euclidean cosmopolitanism. This was/is my story.</p>

<title>Conclusions, Implications, and Future Directions</title>
<p>Prior work in organization studies has recognized the authors’ interference in the construction of their subjects’ worlds as an inevitable part of qualitative research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611435509">Boje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492611435509">Czarniawska, 1997</xref>) and proposed that
<disp-quote>
<p>one way . . . to resolve this issue is for interpretive research to seek to offer options and possibilities rather than prescriptions . . . by representing research in a way that attempts to give direct voice to the organisational actors who tell their stories. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1056492611435509">Rhodes, 1997</xref>, p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this autoethnographic study, I became a researcher of my own organizational experience and a writer who does not translate but instead narrates and reflects. I consider autobiographical writing as a direct form of interaction of the reader with the subjects’ experience without the authorial interpretive framing of the events narrated. In autobiographical writing, the only interpretation or story that emerges is the one that the subject chooses to reconstruct for the purpose of sharing with an audience.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the personal narratives fully escape interpretative processes. I do not claim that autobiographical writing is representing a unique reality experienced and consecutively shared with audiences. Autobiographical writing is still an attempt of the subject/narrator to make sense of a previous experience, to make sense of interactive social contexts. Thus, the interpretation in this case is the constructing act of the author/subject herself anticipating interaction with the audience and the context/space and time of narration. Furthermore, I also recognize that autobiographical work has been criticized in social sciences as suffering from “excessive individualism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492611435509">Harrison, 2009</xref>), moving the frame of reference away from the social and embedded to the personal and the specific.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a narrative construction, even a personal one, is a social process, contingent on time, space, structures, and interactions. Clearly, the vignettes employed here demonstrate not only the relevance of the organizational and cultural context in the construction of the narratives but also the relationship between personal experience (self-transformation) and social and organizational dimensions of the study (emplacement and translocality as social practices). In other words, this autobiographical work suggests that a self-transformation process toward the construction of a cosmopolitan identity is affected by a number of factors, including cultural features of localities (in my case, Greek and British cultural contexts), social aspects (e.g., different academic communities and institutional arrangements), and organization-specific characteristics (university contexts). That is, the cosmopolitan condition emerging from this autobiographical account is not a global, unitary state of being that an organization, institution, or individual ought to aspire to but a process of identity transformation contingent on cultural, social, and organizational conditions. Consistent with prior readings, the analysis of my personal narratives suggests that indeed cosmopolitanism is not only a contingent and situated project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611435509">Beck, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611435509">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492611435509">Hazner, 1996</xref>) but also that its experience necessitates translocation and emplacement, two social practices that also guide transformation on both personal and professional levels. Other practices, besides these two, can also be explored in future autobiographical projects so as to link a practice-based, individual approach to cosmopolitanism with the processes through which transnational communities constitute new spaces of organizing.</p>
<p>Thus, the narrative construction of cosmopolitanism in this article is an embodied experience that requires emplacement strategies toward a new translocal identity. It is simultaneity and perpetuality (expatriation/repatriation) that characterize my personal experience and demonstrate lived situatedness, a “(self-)critical cosmopolitanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611435509">Beck, 2002</xref>) with increased interdependence and translocal interactions. That is, it is the simultaneous repatriation and expatriation on an occasional basisthat constituted this very particular space in which I reconstructed my translocal identity as a mobile employee and I embodied my situated cosmopolitan consciousness. For years to come, I will reflect upon the fact that a professional choice has so much affected my construction and reconstruction of self and vice versa.</p>
<p>Following this, an important implication of this work is that personal and professional journeys become coimplicated during cultural, spatial, and social encounters with work colleagues and others. A deeply psychological process of self-transformation, a change from within, defined my lived experience of cosmopolitanism and in turn, what it means and how to be a cosmopolitan employee. The passages from one social/geographical place to the other require a constant readjustment of personal and professional boundaries, and of the relationship between the two. That is why the management of a cosmopolitan labor force as well as the effective utilization of global managers ought to reflect and involve identity work; it is the effective management of relational, unbounded, and continuous shifting and rearrangement of personal and professional identities that will bring about organizational change and transformation: Creating such platforms at workplaces that would respond to a cosmopolitan arena of action and making the most of the experience of mobile employees as mentors and facilitators may lead to successful change initiatives, encourage creative ideas and professional development.</p>
<p>My constant readjustment of boundaries both in personal and professional levels and my academic transformation due to my identity reconstruction entailed disparate, discontinuous, fragmented, and unexpected associations across borders and between places. Building a workforce ready to respond to the cosmopolitan challenge requires sustaining transformative relationships such as inter- and intraorganizational networks among diverse communities or disciplines (such as artists and scientists), cross-functional work teams, disparate professional collaborations, and cross-cultural creative alliances. By creating this kind of multidimensional, multifaceted, and diverse work platforms, organizations can release employee potential for role exploration and negotiation, knowledge creation and sharing, and innovative practice. Future research could focus on the exploration of these platforms and the practical dimensions of constructing a work environment that allows (cosmopolitan) employees to reconstruct and more importantly, perform their shifting identities at work and “relocate” (transfer and adapt) their personal experience into their professional practice and vice versa.</p>
<p>On another level, this study can also inform work on territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492611435509">Sassen, 2006</xref>), with the concept of translocal identity explored as the site for studying micro- and macro-social transformations. Adaptation to more fluid, heterogeneous, and fragmented associations ought to guide the reconstruction of personal identities within organizational contexts, encouraging multiple embeddings and unbounded territories of interaction. Moreover, organizational discourses, strategies, national/institutional arrangements, change, and adoption of new technologies (such as social networking sites and other web-based technologies) in the context of cross-cultural collaborations have to account for and reflect the contingent and situated nature of the cosmopolitan condition. Following this, future research on cross-cultural relations and management can benefit from the exploration of how various actors, institutions, and networks contextualize and then embed the concepts of emplacement and translocality to transcend bounded territoriality and normative orders in favor of multiple “particularised segmentations” and new “embedded borderings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492611435509">Sassen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study also highlights that individuals and organizations ought not to expect only stability but embrace instability and flux, not to desire stillness but also to appreciate movement. These qualities have guided the way I relate to myself and others and highlighted the importance of placeness, narratives, and relational discourses in the (re)construction of work identities. Working with others is about negotiation and transformation; my cosmopolitan experience has clearly shown the significance of maintaining a fluid as well as a disciplined relational practice, identifying not only similarities that one may have with others and the homogeneous platforms for activity but also differences and heterogeneous frames and strategies for action. Only in-between them, knowledge is acquired, creativity is released, and personal and professional development occurs.</p>
<p>The article also informs the literature on expatriation and repatriation proposing that new terms have to be adopted, which more precisely describe the cosmopolitanization process as manifested in the context of international management and individual career choices. These new terms should reflect the dynamic processes of emplacement and translocality, which constitute an embodied experience of a mobile yet located self. Based on my individual expatriation/repatriation experience and the people management dimensions that it entails, less standardized, flexible practices have to be established to account for temporarity, fluidity, and change. For example, customized training programs that will build upon the notion of mobile yet located are seen as suitable, that is, programs that will encourage and support multiple emplacements and diverse trans-actions, capitalizing on prior experience of (new or global) employees and disruptive yet creative interventions, a break away from established patterns of activity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adopting a reflexive authorial position resulted in seeing working relations (transnational or not) as learning and self-transformation opportunities and change as an inevitable yet unfinished project in life. Embodying the fluidity and temporarity of being has changed the way I relate to time and space and influenced my academic epistemology and professional practice. I value transformation and diversity, heterogeneity and connectivity, themes which are becoming the guiding forces behind my personal/academic endeavors. Being mobile yet located: This practicing of translocation and emplacement has encouraged adaptability, inquisitive and intuitive thinking, imagination and creativity in my work, competencies that gradually developed as part of my transnational role. These competencies are the “harvest” of learning to live in-between, to inhabit my <italic>Erewhon</italic>. My non-Euclidean cosmopolitan understanding is defined by the coexistence of multiple sometimes incoherent realities, homogeneous and heterogeneous spaces, still and mobile communities and in-between, intermediate places. This is a cosmopolitanism that constitutes itself; it is not an abstract creation of a global elite but a radically indeterminate and situated project that affects upon personal identity as well as epistemological and ontological position.</p>
<p>To sum up, this article was an autobiographical account of self-transformation as affected by my professional role as an expatriate/repatriate academic. My recurrent transitory experience posed questions to taken-for-granted assumptions about place and continuity and exemplified the effects of mobile careers on the performance of identity. My personal and professional journeys merged in the transformative experience of a simultaneous and perpetual expatriation and repatriation, a state of mobility that entailed various modes of emplacement and translocality. It is through these modes that “my cosmopolitanism” folds and unfolds, embedded in the fragments of incomplete narratives and situated not only in the diverse communities I interact with but more importantly, in the passage to and from them. I continue to wander in this Cosmopolis, a derive toward an unimagined future.</p>

Arguably for Lacan, desire is not a relation to an object but a relation to a lack. He states that lack is what causes desire to arise. Yet, Deleuze and Guattari claim that desire does not arise from lack but rather is a productive force in itself. Although there are various interpretations of the Lacanian lack and desire, for the purpose of this article, I will use desire as a self-productive force, a source of energy that sustains mobility and transformation.</p></fn>
