<p>All five hearts were perfused for 219±64 minutes and regained normal cardiac function on the perfusion system.They displayed a significant upward and leftward shift of the end systolic pressure volume relationship, a significant increase in preload recruitable stroke work and minimal stiffness. These hearts could potentially be considered for transplantation. The circuit was effective during reperfusion and working modes whilst proving to be successful in maintaining cardiac function in excess of four hours.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As early as 1993, non-heart-beating organ donation (NHBD/DCDD) was discussed as a way to expand the number of potential donors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112449035">1</xref></sup> DCDD accounts for a large proportion of kidney and liver transplant activity and is an increasing mode of organ donation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112449035">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112449035">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interest in lung transplantation after DCDD is becoming an established technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112449035">4</xref></sup> showing similar results to lungs donated by brain stem dead (BSD) donors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112449035">5</xref></sup> as ex vivo lung perfusion enables the transplant team to assess the organ before transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112449035">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The possibility of ex vivo cardiac assessment from a non-heart-beating DCDD donor may be the logical next step in reducing the ever-growing gap between organ supply and demand on transplant waiting lists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112449035">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>We describe a cost-effective, reproducible circuit in a porcine, ex vivo, continuous, warm-blood, bi-ventricular working heart model. In addition, this method of assessment could also be extended to evaluate hearts from marginal BSD donors, thus, significantly increasing the number of hearts available for transplantation. For the purposes of demonstrating the feasibility of the approach, we have focused on DCDD hearts in the present study.</p>
<sec id="section2-0267659112449035">
<title>Method and Materials</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the National Research Council of Canada, Institute for Biodiagnostics in Winnipeg. The protocol was approved by the local Institutional Animal Care Committee, adhering to the guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>
<p>Five domestic swine weighing 40-45kg were obtained from a commercial source and acclimatized in the animal housing facility for one week prior to the study. On the study days, the animals were premedicated intramuscularly, using atropine 0.05 mg/kg, midazolam 0.4 mg/kg and ketamine 20 mg/kg. Immediately following sedation, general anesthesia was induced using 5% isoflurane in oxygen via a mask. Xylocaine endotracheal spray was applied to the larynx and the swine received endotracheal intubation with 7.5mm or 8mm Portex tubes (Smiths Medical International Ltd., Ashford, Kent, UK) and mechanically ventilated. An intravenous (IV) catheter was placed in an ear vein and supplemental fluid (0.9% saline) was administered. During surgery, the animals were maintained with 2.0-2.5% isoflurane. Continuous physiological parameters, including electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> were monitored (PM-9000 Veterinary Portable Monitor, Mindray Corp., Nanshan, China) and kept within acceptable limits.</p>
<p>The circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112449035">Figure 1</xref>) was constructed using standard hardware used for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), including a 5-pump Cobe heart–lung machine (Sorin/Cobe, Arvada, CO, USA), a Biomedicus centrifugal pump (Medtronic Inc., Anaheim, CA, USA) and a heat exchanger to keep the perfusate at a constant temperature of 34°C. Disposables included a Medtronic Affinity integrated hard-shell venous reservoir (HSVR) with oxygenator and an additional soft-shell venous bag primed with 1800 ml NaCl 0.9%.</p>

<p>The soft-shell bag was fitted with three outlets to provide:</p>
<list id="list1-0267659112449035" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Preload to the atria independently controlled by roller clamps,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A reservoir for the working LV to eject into,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Continuously re-circulated blood from the oxygenator.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each swine’s chest was entered through a midline sternotomy and the heart prepared for retrieval. Three hundred micrograms per kilogram of heparin were administered at the beginning of the procedure. Donation after circulatory arrest was simulated through the initiation of hypoxic cardiac arrest via cessation of mechanical ventilation. After cardiac arrest, a 15-minute stand-off period was observed. Initial myocardial protection was then achieved by infusing 250 ml Plegisol (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA), 4 ml of KCl (1M) and 250 ml of autologous blood into the isolated aortic root at 8 degrees Celsius. Fifty milligrams of lignocaine was added to the reservoir to prevent fibrillation once ex vivo perfusion was initiated. A long section of aorta, pulmonary artery (PA) and superior vena cava (SVC) were excised with the heart to ensure secure cannulation. After excision, the heart was weighed. The swine was exsanguinated via the thoracic aorta and 1600 ml of blood was sucked into the cardiotomy reservoir (HSVR) with a pump sucker and the saline prime displaced. With a haematocrit of 20–24%, sodium bicarbonate and glucose were added to bring the prime within normal physiological blood ranges.</p>
<p>A flexible cone cannula was sewn onto the left atrium and an arterial cannula (Xvivo®, Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden) was inserted into the ascending aorta. Cannulae with 3/8” connectors were secured to the SVC and PA and the inferior vena cava was oversewn. The heart was transferred onto the perfusion rig where all the cannulae were secured to 3/8” polyvinyl chlorine (PVC) tubing. The heart was retained suspended within a large funnel, with an attached upper splashguard. Securing clamps attached to the mast of the rig stabilized all the lines, leaving the heart unrestricted on all sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112449035">Figure 2</xref>). Flow probes (Medtronic Biomedicus DP38) were inserted in the LA and RA lines.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0267659112449035" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption><p>Isolated heart in circuit.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0267659112449035-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The heart was de-aired by atrial filling from the venous bag and an air-free connection was made to the circuit. Perfusion was started after an average 18±6 minutes from the time of cardioplegia delivery in the donor. Retrograde Langendorff perfusion was commenced at 300-500 ml/min with a pressure of 50-60 mmHg from the centrifugal pump to achieve the coronary blood flow. The venous blood from the coronary sinus was returned to the HSVR via the PA line. An air inlet line was inserted into the PA via a 3/8” Y-connector to prevent a siphon effect. Sweep gas flow was adjusted to a FiO<sub>2</sub> = 0.6, 100-200 ml/min O<sub>2</sub> and 10-15 ml/min CO<sub>2</sub> providing sufficient gas exchange. Left atrial (LA), right atrial (RA), aortic and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures were continuously monitored. In cases of ventricular fibrillation, the heart was defibrillated with 10 joules.</p>
<p>After 15min of stable Langendorff perfusion, bi-ventricular preload was instituted gradually. As the heart started to eject against the retrograde flow, the centrifugal pump speed was reduced to 100-200rpm, which provided afterload to the ejecting left ventricle. As preload was increased by releasing the roller clamps, bi-ventricular output increased and afterload was adjusted to provide diastolic pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659112449035">Figure 3</xref>). When measurements with the Biomedicus flow probes indicated that the heart was ejecting, a Ventri-Cath multisegment 8-electrode combined pressure/volume catheter (Millar Instruments Inc.) was inserted along the longitudinal axis of the left ventricle, with the proximal electrode at the level of the aortic valve. In a similar fashion, another catheter was inserted into the right ventricle (RV) via the PA. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 200 Hz with a Lab chart 7 (AD Instruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia), using a Powerlab AD module. A family of pressure/volume loops was obtained by manually compressing the LA or RA inflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659112449035">Figure 4</xref>). Subsequently, a dobutamine infusion was started at 2.5 μg/kg/min to 5 μg/kg/min to allow assessment of contractile reserve and a new set of pressure/volume loops was generated in the same way as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0267659112449035">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>During 5h of perfusion, the physiological variables of the perfusate were kept within normal limits. After 5h, the heart was removed from the rig, weighed, dissected and biopsies were taken. Standard PVAN analysis software (Millar Instruments Inc.) was used for data analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During working mode, the LV ESPVR was 23.1±11.1 and the LV PRSW was 67.8±7.2. Both measures increased significantly after the infusion of dobutamine (LV ESPVR: 45.1±12.2, p=0.01; LV PRSW 102.5±18.2, p=0.03). The RV ESPVR (pre 4.1±2.3 vs. post 11.9±4.1) and RV PRSW (pre: 6.7±2.4 vs. post. 8.7±4.6) were also measured in 2 animals and increased followed dobutamine infusion.</p>
<p>The resuscitated hearts displayed a significant upward and leftward shift of the end systolic pressure volume relationship, a significant increase in preload recruitable stroke work and minimal stiffness.</p>
<p>Two hearts regained sinus rhythm after reperfusion, whilst the remaining three required defibrillation. Small boluses of glucose were added to correct hypoglycaemia and sodium bicarbonate was added to adjust the pH, whilst the serum lactate was monitored closely.(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0267659112449035">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0267659112449035">7</xref>)</p>

<p>The circuit was effective during reperfusion and working modes, whilst proving to be successful in maintaining cardiac function in excess of four hours. The Biomedicus pump delivered Langendorff flow to provide coronary perfusion, whilst diastolic pressures could be effectively manipulated with instant cardiac response to increased coronary perfusion in the working phase. The venous bag provided preload to the LA and RA and this could be easily adjusted with roller clamps when either atrium started to stretch.</p>
<p>The conductance catheter was inserted via purse strings around the innominate artery and PA, but, on several occasions, became restricted by the ventricular trabeculae. Nevertheless, the shapes of the captured PV loops were outstanding in this model. There was no evidence of thrombi in the circuits at washout.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Langendorff’s early ex vivo heart experiments of over 100 years ago have led to a vast array of medical advances, whilst, in the sphere of heart retrieval techniques, Proctor and Parker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112449035">8</xref></sup> in 1968, studied the benefits of continuous perfusion versus cold crystalloid cardioplegic arrest and cold immersion in 4°C saline using ex vivo circuits. Wicomb’s early experiments using ex vivo perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112449035">9</xref></sup> led to several human orthotopic heart transplants.</p>
<p>The use of ex vivo machine perfusion techniques may predict post-transplant cardiac function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112449035">10</xref></sup> Transmedics Inc. (Andover, MA, USA) have recently led the field in ex vivo human warm continuous heart perfusion with the OCS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112449035">11</xref></sup> However, evaluation of ex vivo heart function has been a goal of our institution. Research at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge, UK into pressure volume loop conductance catheter technology and contractility studies of brain-dead donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112449035">12</xref></sup> has been a strong link in our interest into contractility studies of the ex vivo heart as a precursor for possible future pre-transplant cardiac function assessment.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that a perfused, vented heart is better preserved than an ischaemic, cold heart submerged in iced saline by preventing ischaemia, anaerobic metabolism and reperfusion injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112449035">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112449035">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>This circuit proved to function well as a system to evaluate the ex vivo heart. However, alternative designs are under evaluation at our institution, with an aim to minimize the circuit prime and provide a cost-effective resource for this type of research. Improvements can be made by using externally mounted ultrasonic flow probes. The 1600 ml prime in this model consisted of 80% autologous blood, creating an ideal perfusate for the heart, utilizing the buffering capacity of Hb and an optimal osmotic pressure. Many perfusion solutions have been used for ex vivo heart perfusion, including donor blood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112449035">15</xref></sup> whole blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112449035">16</xref></sup> and modified Krebs solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112449035">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>There have been numerous studies using an initial dose of cardioplegia followed by a period of cold or tepid perfusion. However, our recent experiments in human NHBD show that this may not be necessary and that speed of removal and connection to the Langendorff perfused circuit may be beneficial and reduce ischaemia. The optimization of haematocrit, Ca<sup>++</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup>, pO<sub>2, p</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> and glucose must be balanced before perfusion starts. In the case of using bank citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) donor blood, deranged K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>++</sup> concentrations may not allow for a homeostatic prime. This can be adjusted by haemofiltration using Ringer’s solution as the rinse. All these values should ideally start within normal physiological ranges and can be monitored by in-line continuous blood gas analysis, whilst arterio-venous lactate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112449035">1</xref></sup> gradients may be an important indicator of recovery from an ischaemic episode during the course of ex vivo perfusion.</p>
<p>The advantages of load-independent indices as opposed to their load-dependent counterparts (Systolic: dP/dt; Diastolic dP/dtmin, and the time constant of diastolic relaxation, Tau) is that they are not affected by changes in preload and afterload. Cardiac output assessment, which has been used routinely by transplant centres around the world, has been shown to be a poor indicator of myocardial function.</p>
<p>Our goal is to standardize a successful experimental protocol for evaluating the ex vivo heart. The next phase would be developing a simple, self-contained, novel transport system to allow continuous Langendorff perfusion to the prospective site of implantation, where it is envisaged a circuit would be incorporated into the recipient bypass circuit to perform the pre-transplant assessment, where surgeons, perfusionists and PV Loop software operators can perform a functional assessment of the heart before implantation. Evaluating the heart minutes prior to implantation seems safer than assessment at the donor site as it may take several hours from excision to implantation, with unknown ischaemic events during this time.</p>
<p>Machine perfusion of the donor heart provides us with an opportunity to explore the advantages of continuous perfusion with metabolite washout that may eventually lead to improved organ viability and a reduction in the heart transplant waiting lists.</p>
