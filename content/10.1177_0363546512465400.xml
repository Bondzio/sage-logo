<sec id="section4-0363546512465400">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery for FAI had a localized full-thickness acetabular chondral defect treated by microfracture and then underwent a later second-look hip arthroscopic procedure. The size of the full-thickness defect was measured at the primary arthroscopic procedure. A visual assessment of the extent and quality of repair tissue was performed at second-look arthroscopic surgery.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>At an average follow-up of 17 months, 19 of the 20 patients had a mean fill of 96% ± 7% with macroscopically good quality repair tissue. One patient had only a 25% fill with poor quality repair tissue. Histologically, the tissue was found to be primarily fibrocartilage with some staining for type II collagen in the region closest to the bone.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Microfracture in the hip appears to be an effective technique that produces excellent coverage of the defect with good quality repair tissue on visual inspection and microscopic examination at an average follow-up of 17 months.</p>

<p>Hip arthroscopic surgery is developing rapidly. Improvements in arthroscopic equipment and technique have allowed orthopaedic surgeons to diagnose and treat conditions that would previously have required an open procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512465400">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512465400">21</xref></sup> Articular cartilage abnormalities are the second most common lesion encountered during hip arthroscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512465400">7</xref></sup> They are usually associated with other abnormalities like labral tears,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512465400">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512465400">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512465400">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512465400">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512465400">25</xref></sup> femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512465400">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512465400">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512465400">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512465400">34</xref></sup> hip dysplasia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512465400">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512465400">20</xref></sup> or degenerative joint disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512465400">21</xref></sup> Beck et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512465400">4</xref></sup> proposed that cam-type FAI produces compressive and shear force, resulting in chondral delamination, and full-thickness chondral defects are a common finding in the treatment of cam-type FAI.</p>
<p>Most of these defects occur in the anterosuperior aspect of the acetabulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512465400">21</xref></sup> These chondral defects may cause pain, and it is likely that if left untreated, they will progress to more generalized degeneration. Irrespective of cause, chondral lesions rarely heal spontaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512465400">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microfracture is a proven technique to treat articular cartilage defects in the knee. In view of its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the technique of microfracture is increasingly applied to other joints. Applying the same principles, microfracture can be performed in the hip joint for articular cartilage defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512465400">26</xref></sup> However, unlike in the knee, there is very little evidence in the literature to confirm the ability of microfracture to produce repair tissue in the hip joint. The purpose of this study was to report the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of repair tissue after microfracture performed at hip arthroscopic surgery for isolated full-thickness acetabular cartilage defects in patients with FAI.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512465400">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>We report a case series of patients who had been treated with acetabular microfracture and who subsequently underwent a second hip arthroscopic procedure, which allowed an opportunistic assessment of the repair tissue after microfracture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512465400">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between 2005 and 2010, 879 patients underwent hip arthroscopic surgery for FAI. Of these, 285 patients had microfracture for the treatment of full-thickness acetabular chondral defects. Twenty of these microfracture patients (16 men and 4 women; mean age, 37 years; range, 17-54 years; all nonsmokers) had a subsequent hip arthroscopic procedure, which allowed examination of their repair tissue after microfracture. The indication for the second hip arthroscopic surgery was either persistent symptoms related to the hip or onset of further symptoms after a period of improvement. These 20 patients in whom we had an opportunity for a second look of the microfracture repair formed the study population.</p>
<p>The indications for microfracture of the hip are similar to those in the knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512465400">33</xref></sup> that is, full-thickness loss of articular cartilage in either a weightbearing area or in an area of contact between the femoral head and acetabulum. Unstable cartilage flaps with intact subchondral bone were also considered suitable for microfracture after debridement. Patient factors including age, activity level, and ability to adhere to the postoperative rehabilitation protocol were considered before deciding on the suitability of microfracture. Patients with partial-thickness chondral defects and those with underlying bony defects were not considered suitable for microfracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512465400">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512465400">
<title>Microfracture Technique</title>
<p>Hip arthroscopic surgery was performed with the patient in the lateral position. An image intensifier was used to confirm distraction and to guide initial portal placement. Further portals were made under direct vision as required. A complete diagnostic examination of the hip joint was performed. Articular cartilage was assessed for any unstable flaps or defects using a probe. Unstable cartilage was debrided with shavers, and a curette was then used to obtain well-defined, stable margins all around the defect. In 1 patient with a large flap of delaminated but intact cartilage, the flap was preserved, as resecting it would have left a large area of exposed bone.</p>
<p>The curette was then used to remove the calcified layer of the cartilage while carefully preserving the integrity of the subchondral bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512465400">1</xref></sup> The dimensions of the full-thickness chondral defect were measured using an arthroscopic probe marked at 5-mm intervals. Arthroscopic awls were used to make multiple holes in the exposed subchondral bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512465400">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512465400">Figure 1</xref>). Reducing the irrigation pressure inside the joint and observing fat droplets and bleeding from the microfracture holes confirmed adequate penetration of the subchondral bone. Associated lesions, including labral tears and FAI, were treated at the same time.</p>

</fig>
<p>All patients followed a uniform postoperative rehabilitation protocol based on the same principles as knee microfracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512465400">33</xref></sup> Cryotherapy and continuous passive motion were started immediately after surgery and continued until discharge (24-48 hours). Graduated physical therapy exercises were introduced immediately after surgery and continued for 3 months. In the early phase, emphasis was placed on achieving range of motion, followed by endurance exercises, and finally on improving muscle power and coordination. For the first 6 weeks, only foot-flat nonweightbearing was allowed. Full weightbearing was achieved over the following 2 weeks.</p>

<title>Arthroscopic Assessment</title>
<p>The extent and quality of repair tissue were assessed at a second arthroscopic procedure. Percentage of fill of the lesion was measured using a graduated arthroscopic probe. Quality of cartilage was assessed visually at the time of arthroscopic surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512465400">Figure 2</xref>) and expressed on a graded scale of 1 (normal) to 4 (maximum degradation) as described by Blevins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512465400">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512465400">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Biopsy</title>
<p>During arthroscopic surgery, a full-thickness biopsy specimen was taken from 2 patients using a 2.4-mm-diameter Jamshidi bone marrow biopsy needle (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio) as close to the center of the treated region and as perpendicular to the surface as possible. Biopsy was performed in only 2 patients for clinical reasons and at the request of the patients who wanted to know the type and quality of repair tissue to judge the appropriateness and timing of return to high-level sports. Informed consent was obtained from both patients for a biopsy preoperatively.</p>
<p>Cores were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax until studied histologically. The biopsy specimen was assessed using polarized and plain light microscopy for collagen organization and morphological characteristics on 5-μm-thick sections and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The presence of type I and II collagen was investigated via immunohistochemistry. For this, the wax sections were rehydrated through a series of alcohols before being enzymatically digested with 0.2% trypsin for 1 hour at 37°C to unmask the antigens. Sections were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with primary antibodies against type I collagen (monoclonal antihuman, clone no. 1-8H5, ICN, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) and against type II collagen (CIICI, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, Iowa). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol before sections were incubated with the biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The signal was amplified using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase reagent (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom), and labeling was visualized with diaminobenzidine as the substrate. Sections were then washed, dehydrated, and mounted in Pertex (Cell Path, Newtown, United Kingdom). Adjacent sections were incubated with mouse IgG in place of primary antibody as controls.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In our series of 20 patients, all acetabular chondral lesions were identified in the superior and anterosuperior zones of the acetabulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512465400">Figure 3</xref>, zones C and D) at the primary arthroscopic procedure. All patients had chondral lesions confined to the acetabulum. The average acetabular chondral defect after debridement measured 154 mm<sup>2</sup> (range, 50-300) at the primary arthroscopic procedure. One patient had a bony defect on the femoral head because of avascular necrosis but had intact articular cartilage. None of the patients had diffuse osteoarthritis. All patients had an associated labral tear, which was debrided with a shaver and stabilized with a thermal probe. In addition, 10 patients had osteoplasty of the femoral head/neck junction (for cam-type FAI), 2 patients had trimming of a prominent anterior acetabular rim (for pincer-type FAI), and 3 patients had both the procedures done. Two patients underwent resection of their ligamentum teres.</p>

</fig>
<p>The mean ± standard deviation time interval between the first and second arthroscopic procedure was 17 ± 11 months (range, 5-47). Indications for the second arthroscopic procedure were a new injury causing a labral tear in 6 patients, a residual cam lesion requiring revision osteoplasty in 8 patients, catching sensation in the hip caused by overgrowth of fibrocartilage in 7 patients, and persistent hip pain due to labrocapsular adhesion in 4 patients.</p>
<p>At second-look arthroscopic surgery, the area after microfracture had a mean fill rate of 93% ± 17% (range, 25%-100%). Excluding 1 patient who only had a 25% fill, 19 of the 20 patients had a mean fill of 96% ± 7% (range, 75%-100%) with macroscopically good quality (grade 1) repair tissue as per Blevins et al’s classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512465400">5</xref></sup> Seven patients had an overgrowth of repair tissue where the fibrocartilage extended beyond the labrochondral junction. The excess tissue was debrided with a shaver to create a smooth surface.

<p>The mean Nonarthritic Hip Score (NHS) at the time of the initial arthroscopic procedure was 55 (range, 26-83). Just before their second arthroscopic procedure, these patients had a mean NHS of 54 (range, 0-86). This improved to 78 (range, 43-99) after their second arthroscopic procedure at a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 5-48). This is similar to the mean NHS of 80 at a mean follow-up of 23 months in the larger group of all patients who had microfracture during the same period (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Histologically, the samples seemed to be primarily fibrocartilage in appearance, with obvious collagen fiber bundles randomly arranged throughout the extracellular matrix when viewed with polarized light. In 1 sample, there was a small area near to the bone where the matrix resembled hyaline cartilage with its typical glass-like appearance when viewed with polarized light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512465400">Figure 4</xref>). Immunostaining showed both type I and II collagen to be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512465400">Figure 4C</xref>) but no staining for the IgG normal control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Microfracture performed arthroscopically may be an effective treatment for acetabular chondral defects in carefully selected patients. In our series, at an average follow-up of 17 months after an initial arthroscopic procedure, we had a 93% average fill of lesions with good quality cartilage. Excluding 1 failure, the other 19 patients had an average fill of 96%. The only failure (with a fill of 25%) occurred in a patient with a large flap of delaminated cartilage, which had not been resected at the primary arthroscopic procedure. Instead, microfracture was performed under the flap in the hope of encouraging the cartilage to stick to the underlying bone. Unfortunately, the cartilage continued to remain delaminated and also hindered the formation of new repair tissue. These results are encouraging considering the fact that these patients had persistent ongoing symptoms that necessitated a further surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Our results are similar to the results from the only published series so far where the repair tissue was visualized arthroscopically in the hip. Philippon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512465400">26</xref></sup> reported 95% to 100% fill in 8 of the 9 patients who had second-look hip arthroscopic surgery after microfracture for acetabular cartilage lesions. They demonstrated an average fill of 91% at an average follow-up of 20 months. The only failure was in a patient with diffuse degenerative joint disease who had a fill rate of only 25%. Byrd and Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512465400">7</xref></sup> reported clinical results after microfracture for grade 4 lesions in the hip. In their series of 21 patients with a mean follow-up of 32 months, the mean improvement in the Harris Hip Score was 23.9 points (preoperative, 51.4 points; postoperative, 75.2 points). In their view, the results were encouraging, even though some of the patients did poorly. Recently, Haviv et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512465400">15</xref></sup> have reported that microfracture in limited chondral lesions at the time of arthroscopic femoral osteochondroplasty for cam impingement showed superior results. They have shown that the NHS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512465400">8</xref></sup> was significantly better in the group that underwent microfracture compared with the group that only had debridement of unstable cartilage flaps, which reflects improved function in high-demand activities. However, to our knowledge, a biopsy of the repair tissue in this location was not performed in any studies until now.</p>
<p>Extensive research has been conducted to find an effective treatment for articular cartilage defects in the knee. Various surgical techniques like osteochondral drilling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512465400">16</xref></sup> microfracture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512465400">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512465400">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512465400">33</xref></sup> osteoarticular autografting or allografting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512465400">18</xref></sup> autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512465400">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512465400">30</xref></sup> and articular cartilage tissue engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512465400">12</xref></sup> have been described to address this problem. Several studies have shown good long-term results after microfracture in the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512465400">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512465400">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512465400">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512465400">32</xref></sup> In addition, technical ease of this procedure and its cost-effectiveness have made many orthopaedic surgeons choose microfracture as the preferred method of treatment for cartilage abnormalities.</p>
<p>Microfracture is thought to have an effect by allowing multipotent mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors from the bone marrow to reach the chondral defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512465400">10</xref></sup> A mesenchymal clot forms in the treated chondral defect and is anchored through microfracture perforations to the underlying bone. The multipotent stem cells in the clot then differentiate into connective tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512465400">31</xref></sup> Histological study of these lesions has demonstrated that the area after microfracture is filled with fibrocartilaginous tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512465400">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results of microfracture in the knee have been extensively reported. Steadman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512465400">32</xref></sup> have reported functional outcomes after arthroscopic microfracture for isolated knee chondral defects at an average follow-up of 11 years. They report a significantly improved function in 95% of the patients. Riyami and Rolf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512465400">29</xref></sup> have published outcomes of microfracture for knee lesions in professional football and rugby players. The outcome was assessed clinically, radiologically using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in some patients with second-look arthroscopic surgery. More than 83% of players resumed full training between 5 and 7 months after microfracture. In their series, second-look arthroscopic surgery scores had a stronger correlation with functional scores than the MRI score. Younger nonsmokers seem to be more satisfied after microfracture in the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512465400">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Knutsen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512465400">19</xref></sup> compared outcomes after microfracture and ACI on a total of 80 patients. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups based on clinical evaluation and conventional radiographic techniques at either 2-year or 5-year follow-up. They have also shown that the repair tissue formed in the knee after either microfracture or ACI consists of a mixture of hyaline and fibrocartilage, and no significant differences were found regarding the macroscopic appearance or the histological quality of the repair tissue between the 2 techniques.</p>
<p>One previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512465400">26</xref></sup> and our study now confirm that arthroscopic microfracture can also be considered as an effective treatment for acetabular chondral lesions in carefully selected patients. This is true even in patients who have had to undergo a further arthroscopic procedure because of ongoing symptoms. Our study, of course, does have some limitations. Patient numbers were small, and there was no control group of untreated patients. The same surgeon who performed the initial microfracture also assessed the repair tissue visually. Our average follow-up was only 17 months, and the longer term outcome remains unknown. However, these results are encouraging. It may be that the vascularity and proximity of mesenchymal cell–rich bone marrow in the pelvis make the acetabulum a particularly appropriate site in which to use microfracture.</p>
<p>Recent advances in imaging promise a multimodal approach in the future, using clinical, magnetic resonance morphological, and magnetic resonance biochemical parameters in combination to follow up cartilage repair in a noninvasive way.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512465400">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512465400">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512465400">36</xref></sup> Using these techniques, we may be able to understand the repair process better by noninvasive monitoring of larger numbers of patients.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Microfracture is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of full-thickness, isolated chondral lesions of the acetabulum in selected patients. In our series, 19 of 20 patients had an average fill of 96% with grade 1 cartilage at an average follow-up of 17 months.</p>
