<title>Brief History</title>
<p>The National Latina/o Psychological Association is the current-day descendant of several organizations founded in the 1970s. The Association of Psychologists por la Raza was established in 1969, and the first meeting was held in 1970 at the annual American Psychological Association (APA) convention hosted in Miami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012450421">Padilla &amp; Olmedo, 2009</xref>). The Coalition of Spanish Speaking Mental Health Organizations was established in 1974 by Latino/a mental health professionals from various mental health professions and focused on the mental health needs of Latino/as; it is now known as the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations. These organizations led to the formation in 1979 of the National Hispanic Psychological Association (NHPA) at the National Conference of Hispanic Psychologists.</p>
<p>The 1979 conference, held at Lake Arrowhead, California, was jointly sponsored by the UCLA Spanish Speaking Mental Health Research Center and the National Institute of Mental Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012450421">Delgado-Romero &amp; Edwards, 2008</xref>). The purpose of this conference was to bring Latino/a psychologists together from across the country to share information on needed training, services, and research, and to determine whether there was a need to establish a national association of Latino/a psychologists. At this meeting the foundation for the National Hispanic Psychological Association (NHPA) was established and Carlos Albizu Miranda was elected the first president. NHPA was active for two decades (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012450421">Padilla &amp; Olmedo, 2009</xref>), but by the late 1990s, NHPA membership had waned, energy for Latino/a psychology was directed elsewhere (e.g., Division 45), and the NHPA was only nominally functional through the efforts of a few executive committee members (P. Arredondo, personal communication, November 21, 2009). In 1998, counseling psychologists Leticia Arellano, Kurt Organista, and Roberto Velásquez organized the Innovations in Chicana/o Psychology Conference under the auspices of the Julian Samora Research Institute at Michigan State University (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012450421">Velásquez, Arellano, &amp; Padilla, 1999</xref>). At this conference, the idea was discussed that future meetings needed to expand beyond both populations and the work of psychologists of Chicana/o or Mexican American descent, which resulted in the 2000 Latina/o Psychology Conference in San Antonio, Texas, spearheaded by Cynthia de las Fuentes, another counseling psychologist. The next Latina/o Psychology Conference in Rhode Island in 2002, organized by Maria Garrido, set the stage for the formation of the NLPA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011000012450421">1</xref></sup> These conferences were the work of dedicated individuals and institutions, and they served as a testament that there was still a critical mass of psychologists interested in Latino/a issues.</p>
<p>As the 1990s drew to a close, Hispanic/Latino/a became the fastest growing population in the United States. Latino/a issues came into sharp focus in psychology with the pioneering presidencies of Division 45 by Patricia Arredondo and Division 17 by Melba Vasquez in 2001. The need for a professional psychological association focused on Latino/a issues was clearly apparent. At the 2002 APA conference in Chicago, Arredondo gathered a small group of interested Latino/a psychologists and they created the infrastructure for the newly renamed National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA; P. Arredondo, personal communication, December 19, 2010). This new name was a statement that broke with sexist Spanish grammatical conventions of placing the male form first and replaced the term Hispanic with the more progressive term Latina/o. The mission of the NLPA was drafted to state that the new organization was charged with the mission “to generate and advance psychological knowledge as well as foster its effective application for the benefit of the Hispanic/Latino population.”</p>
<p>Arredondo proposed the revitalized NLPA at the 2002 Rhode Island Latino Psychology Conference, and an initial group of approximately 200 psychologists and students eagerly joined the new organization. Arredondo became the first president of the resurgent NLPA and the foundation for the future success of the group was established. NLPA has continued the work envisioned at the 1979 Lake Arrowhead Conference (P. Arredondo, personal communication, November 21, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012450421">Padilla &amp; Olmedo, 2009</xref>), although one unique characteristic of the NLPA is the pronounced influence of counseling psychology and counseling psychologists in the leadership and membership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012450421">
<title>Current Status and Resources</title>
<p>As of December 2010, there were approximately 600 members of the NLPA. The current NLPA membership consists of predominately counseling psychologists (whereas NHPA membership was predominately clinical psychologists), and approximately 50% of the NLPA membership is student members. The NLPA membership meets yearly at the APA annual convention, where Division 45 provides space in the hospitality suite for an NLPA general membership meeting and an NLPA student membership meeting. The NLPA membership meets formally for a biennial conference during the fall of even numbered years.</p>
<p>NLPA’s Executive Committee is composed of seven elected officers with voting privileges (i.e., president, president-elect, past-president, treasurer, secretary, early career professional, and student representative) and nonvoting appointed committee members (i.e., newsletter editor, historian, student/professional development coordinator, APA liaison, email list manager, and awards chair). There are two standing NLPA subcommittees, the Student Subcommittee and the Early Career Professionals Subcommittee, which report their activities, needs, and concerns to the Executive Committee via the Student and the Early Career Representatives. NLPA’s Executive Committee meets via teleconference once per month. A quorum for voting is made by a majority vote of Executive Committee Officers (NLPA By-laws, Article VII, Section 3-4). All of the elected Executive Committee officer positions carry 2-year terms (NLPA By-laws, Article V). Elections are coordinated by the Executive Committee via the NLPA electronic mailing list and website.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the NLPA president include (a) conducting the business of the NLPA between meetings of the Executive Committee; (b) being an ex-officio member of all committees and chair of the Executive Committee meetings; (c) representing the NLPA in business matters with other organizations, agencies, or governmental bodies; (d) acting on behalf of the NLPA in any particular business matter, provided that reports are furnished to the Executive Committee and that the action is not opposed by a majority of the Executive Committee; and (e) delegating responsibilities to other members at the president’s discretion (NLPA By-laws, Article V, Section 2). The president serves the additional role of representing the NLPA twice a year at the Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests (CNAAPEMI) meetings and is responsible for being a liaison with outside organizations (e.g., APA, Interamerican Society of Psychology Conference, National Hispanic Medical Association).</p>
<p>The president is also responsible for the biennial conference, which rotates around the United States to areas where significant Latino/a populations exist. The inaugural 2004 conference was held in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the conference theme was “Advancement in Latinos Psychology 2004: Strengthening Psychology Through Latina/o Family Values.” J. Manuel Casas, Israel Cuéllar, Olivia Espín, and Ena Vazquez-Nuttall were honored as distinguished professionals for their scholarship and contributions to Latina/o psychology. The keynote speaker was Patricia Arredondo.</p>
<p>The 2006 NLPA conference was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the conference theme was “Latina/o Psychology in the 21st Century: New Trends and Challenges in Research and Practice.” The keynote speaker in 2006 was Yasmin Davidds, a nationally renowned speaker and empowerment specialist. Melba Vasquez and Peter Guarnaccia were honored as distinguished scholars. Other special events included a reception at the United Community Center, a large Latino/a-serving community center in Milwaukee, which held a Latino/a arts exhibit and a Latin Jazz concert.</p>
<p>The 2008 conference was held in Costa Mesa, California, and the conference theme was “La Cultura Cura: Healing Traditions and Models of Care With Latina/o Families and Communities.” Olivia Espin and Thomas Parham were the keynote speakers. J. Manuel Casas and Marlene D. De Rios were honored as elders for their distinguished contributions to Latina/o psychology. Special events included an NLPA membership town hall meeting.</p>
<p>The 2010 NLPA conference was held in San Antonio, Texas, and the conference theme was “Latinas: Celebrating the Psychological Strength and Resilience of Latina Women and Girls.” Melba Vasquez and Patricia Arredondo were the keynote speakers. Lillian Comas-Díaz and Nadya Fouad were honored as pioneers in Latino/a psychology. Another special event at the 2010 conference was a reception hosted by Our Lady of the Lake University, which included a poster session and a reading by noted Chicana author Sandra Cisneros.</p>
<p>The NLPA conferences serve many important purposes: In a collegial manner, they bring together members, nonmembers, and students who are interested in Latino/a psychology; in a culturally congruent manner, they allow for the intimate gathering and personal (re)connection of Latino/a students and professionals in a way that celebrates and honors Latino/a cultural values of collectivism, personalismo (recognition of the individual within a larger social and familial context), and academic/professional familismo (family orientation and connectedness). The NLPA conference presentations consist of pre-conference continuing education workshops, poster sessions, roundtables, and symposiums. The types of presentations given at the NLPA conferences include scholarly work in regards to research, training, and practice in Latina/o psychology. Additionally, many of the roundtables serve as safe spaces for supporting one another, disseminating information, and sharing personal experiences in regards to numerous sociopolitical issues (e.g., experiences of undocumented students, microaggressions in higher education, difficult experiences in pursuing tenure, classism, Latina professionals and motherhood). NLPA conferences conclude with a celebration banquet that consists of an awards ceremony, dinner, and a dance. At the banquet there are several awards (dissertation, early career, lifetime, and service); the dissertation award is sponsored by Cynthia de las Fuentes, a counseling psychologist.</p>
<p>From 2002 onward, graduate students and early career professionals (ECPs) have played an important role in the revitalization of the NLPA. Accordingly, students and ECPs have been accorded a seat on the Executive Committee and have dedicated tracks of conference programming on training, research, and practice issues. In addition, NLPA members raise funds to provide student travel scholarships to attend the biennial conference. NLPA student members have established a Facebook page where students offer support to one another, share resources on student-specific issues (e.g., applying for internship, applying to graduate school), and network.</p>
<p>The NLPA maintains a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlpa.ws">www.nlpa.ws</ext-link>), where several resources can be found including the quarterly bilingual newsletter <italic>El Boletin</italic> and a database (created and maintained in conjunction with Los Niños Services of New York) of resources relating to Latina/o psychology. El Boletin has evolved from a general membership newsletter to theme-focused issues. For example, the most recent newsletters dealt with immigration and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues. Discussions are currently underway to establish an NLPA journal following the model established by the Asian American Psychological Association. NLPA members also participate in electronic mailing list, where resources, support, career opportunities, and discussions on pertinent social and political issues are shared. Additionally, NLPA members have actively contributed to the field with seminal publications such as <italic>Counseling Latinos and la Familia: A Practical Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012450421">Santiago-Rivera, Arredondo, &amp; Gallardo-Cooper, 2002</xref>) and <italic>Handbook of U.S. Latino Psychology: Developmental and Community-Based Perspectives</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012450421">Villarruel et al., 2009</xref>) with several NLPA members as contributing authors.</p>

<title>Connections to Counseling Psychology</title>
<p>The NLPA has been strongly influenced by counseling psychology both in terms of values and membership. The extensive presence of counseling psychologists in the NLPA is likely due to the emphasis counseling psychology places on multicultural issues and the dedication to working for social justice, which differs from other realms of psychology (P. Arredondo, personal communication, November 21, 2009). Similar to counseling psychology, the NLPA emphasizes a strength-based and culturally sensitive approach to psychology, centered on common Latino/a values. NLPA members are committed to addressing social justice issues such as immigration, ethical treatment of immigrants (regardless of documentation status), health disparities, and the reduction of prejudice/racism. Specific to psychology, a common concern among members of the NLPA is culturally and linguistically competent training of psychologists.</p>
<p>Like the Society of Counseling Psychology, the NLPA has been very active with international issues. In particular, many NLPA members are active participants in the Interamerican Society of Psychology, known by its Spanish acronym SIP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sippsych.org">www.sippsych.org</ext-link>). SIP is an organization of psychologists from North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean. SIP has held the biennial Interamerican Congress of Psychology since 1953. In 2009, the president of SIP was counseling psychologist Andres Consoli, and the 2009 Congress in Guatemala was well attended by NLPA members. Connections to Latin American psychologists and students are an important issue for many NLPA members.</p>
<p>The success of counseling psychology in creating diverse and empowering training programs has, in part, led to Latina/o counseling psychologists and graduate students being a driving force within the NLPA membership. This strong representation has also caused tension within the group, where psychologists from other disciplines complained that their interests were not being represented in the group due to overwhelming numbers of counseling psychologists. This feedback was consistent after both the 2008 and 2010 conferences. Like their counterparts in the SCP, NLPA counseling psychologists are seeking to create alliances across disciplines and work collaboratively with psychologists from other specialties, while at the same time holding on to common values and ideals.</p>
<p>The NLPA already works collaboratively with counseling psychology programs such as Our Lady of the Lake University (OLLU) to address needs in the Latino/a community (as evidenced during the 2010 NLPA conference, where OLLU was a sponsor) and the potential for increased collaboration exists. At the very least, counseling psychology programs can refer interested students and professionals to the NLPA. Membership in the NLPA for Latino/as and those interested in Latino/a psychology may help with retention, mentorship, practice issues, and research. The NLPA has tangible products (conference presentations, publications, service opportunities) and other benefits that are not as easy to quantify (e.g., mentorship, fellowship, encouragement).</p>
<p>NLPA can benefit from increased contact and closer ties with the SCP in two ways. First, the SCP has considerable political and organizational expertise. This expertise could be invaluable for a still-developing NLPA with regards to such issues as the APA proposal to offer the EMPAs council seats. In navigating political agendas, it would be useful to have a seasoned ally that shares a commitment to social justice. Second, it should be kept in mind that NLPA members are not exempt from the anti-immigrant sentiment that is rampant in parts of the United States. For example, when Arizona passed a series of immigration reform laws, coupled with laws aimed at dismantling ethnic studies, this is an area that is both professionally and personally hurtful for many NLPA members. It is import to the NLPA to know that there are those who stand with us, both individually and as a group, in the face of oppression.</p>

<title>Prominent Counseling Psychologists Within NLPA</title>
<p>There are many prominent counseling psychologists within NLPA who have made significant contributions to the field. The first president of the resurgent NLPA, Patricia Arredondo, is a distinguished counseling psychologist who is known for her seminal contributions focused on multicultural competence in counseling and psychology. Azara Santiago-Rivera and Edward Delgado-Romero are counseling psychologists well known for their contributions to Latino/a psychology, who also served as presidents of the NLPA. Melba Vasquez is the first Latina and the first woman of color elected to the presidency of the APA. Of the (re)founding members of the NLPA, many were counseling psychologists who are well recognized in the field: Lydia Buki, Andres Consoli, Lisa Edwards, Lisa Flores, Alberta Gloria, Marie Miville, Edil Torres Rivera, and Eduardo Morales. Numerous counseling psychology students have also been active in the NLPA and been recognized for their service and accomplishments.</p>

<sec id="section5-0011000012450421">
<title>Implications for Counseling Psychology</title>
<p>Currently in the United States, there are 47.8 million Latinos/as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012450421">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Latino/as are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and by the year 2050, it is estimated that approximately one out of every four people in the United States will be Latino/a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012450421">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). By sheer numbers alone, the Latino/a population should be a focus as both recipients and providers of psychological services. However, in addition to the numerical imperative, U.S. Latino/as disproportionately face issues such as poverty, mental and physical health challenges, high dropout rates from school, and persistent racism and discrimination.</p>
<p>Counseling psychology with an emphasis on multiculturalism and social justice seems a natural fit for Latino/as as students, practitioners, and academics. Research indicates that Latino/as are often directed to the applied subfields of psychology (school, clinical, and counseling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012450421">Leong, Kohout, Smith, &amp; Wicherski, 2003</xref>). In 2008, it was estimated that 2.3% of the members of the APA and only 1% of psychologists overall are Latino/a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012450421">Delgado-Romero, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012450421">Broussard and Delgado-Romero (2008)</xref> conducted a study to find the number and location of Latino/a faculty members in psychology programs. They found 32 self-identified Latino/a faculty and found that it was rare to find more than one Latino/a faculty member in a program and that Latino/a faculty tended to be found in a few key states (e.g., California, Wisconsin). The unique challenges faced by Latino/a counseling psychology faculty and administrators is an area that needs more examination (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012450421">Delgado-Romero, Flores, Gloria, Arredondo, &amp; Castellanos, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>If counseling psychology is going to be proactive in keeping pace with the growing Latina/o population in the United States, it needs to train greater numbers of graduate students, practitioners, and faculty who are dedicated to Latino/a psychology. In addition, there is a need for competent bilingual and bicultural psychologists (in research, practice, training, and supervision) who are multiculturally sensitive. The NLPA is an organization that has at its core the mission to further Latino/a psychology, and given the significant numbers of counseling psychologists in the organization, there are natural connections between the SCP and the NLPA with potential positive consequences for counseling psychology that have not yet been fully explored. If the Society of Counseling Psychology were better informed about the development and accomplishments of the NLPA, there would be many benefits for the SCP. The large number of students and ECPs involved in the NLPA represent a significant resource, including increasing the number of bilingual and bicultural psychologists. The leaders and members of the NLPA represent an incredible resource for the profession of counseling psychology. For example, the NLPA has a solid pipeline of graduate students and ECPs who have been active in the NLPA and thus have a proven track record as leaders in psychology professional organizations and are ideal candidates to take on leadership positions in the SCP. Likewise the NLPA has been enriched by the leadership opportunities provided by the SCP and affiliated organizations like the Section for Ethnic and Racial Diversity. In addition to leadership, given the demographic transformation of the United States, the need for specialists in Latino/a psychology is perhaps one of the most important growth areas for the next 40 years. The NLPA provides a connection and an informed critical voice in this time change. In closing, an explicit commitment by the SCP to work jointly with the NLPA has great potential for furthering the social justice and diversity agendas within counseling psychology.</p>
