<abstract>
<p>Despite its importance, very little is found in the literature on the visual tasks of pedestrians, particularly at night. This study was performed to identify and characterise the principal visual tasks of pedestrians at night and the key aspects of the visual environment that are important to pedestrians. In this study, an eye tracking method was employed. Wearing an eye tracker, subjects were asked to walk three different residential routes (5 subjects in day time and 15 subjects at night). In order to obtain further information about the experience of the subjects during the walk, a short interview was performed after completion of the task. The results show that whilst pedestrians may spend between 40% and 50% of their time looking at the footpath, not all of that time is spent on critical visual tasks. Looking at other people appears to be important to pedestrians but during this study the amount of time when subjects fixated on other people was limited. The apparent importance of the visual tasks away from the footpath compared to the tasks on it raises questions about how appropriate it is to specify the lighting on residential road using illuminance on the road and pavement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153512437157" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Lighting is an important element in providing a road which is not only safe for people to use but is also perceived to be safe. However, a search of the literature revealed that there have been no previous studies that analysed the visual tasks of pedestrians on a public road. The area of public lighting for pedestrians was investigated by Caminada and van Bommel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512437157">1</xref></sup> They classified the requirements for lighting in residential roads into four sections:
<list id="list1-1477153512437157" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Detection of obstacles</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visual orientation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identification of persons</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleasantness and comfort</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Caminada and van Bommel argue that whilst people need light to detect obstacles along their route and orientate themselves, it is facial recognition that is the task that requires the most light. However, the Caminada and van Bommel report was not based on a study of the actual visual needs of pedestrians; they simply assumed the tasks and then decided how much light each of the tasks needed. Whilst it can be argued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512437157">2</xref></sup> that facial recognition is important to promote a sense of security and social ease when encountering other pedestrians and that it is the task that requires the most light; without some analysis of the actual needs of pedestrians using the streets at night it is not possible to know their visual priorities and the actual extent of each of their visual requirements.</p>
<p>Eye tracking is a technique that has been used to try to understand what people are looking at a given time. Land and Lee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512437157">3</xref></sup> used the technique to study drivers in the early 1990s. Their study, though limited by the eye-tracking equipment available at the time, did provide interesting information about the way drivers looked at the road. Studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512437157">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153512437157">5</xref></sup> have also been carried out under laboratory conditions using pedestrians to find out what they look at and how they avoid obstacles; the lighting conditions were not stated in either of the referenced papers but it is assumed that the lighting was similar to normal indoor lighting levels. An investigation by Fujiyama <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512437157">6</xref></sup> studied the effects of lighting on the fixation behaviour of an elderly pedestrian as he navigated an obstacle course in the laboratory. They found that pedestrians pay attention to hazards according to the visual perception and regardless of the actual danger. Visually obscure objects do not attract the attention of pedestrians.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that subjects in the laboratory studies were given explicit visual tasks on the floor and so this may have impacted their visual behaviour. However, as stated above there has been no previous test of pedestrians on public roads at night, and no test of walking where there were no explicit visual tasks given to the subjects.</p>
<p>The whole area of eye tracking studies and what it can tell us about how the brain controls the visual system and the neurological strategies employed is a highly complex area. Hayhoe and Ballard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512437157">7</xref></sup> provide a good review of the subject and provide confirmation that visual fixations are very closely correlated with visual task.</p>
<p>Lighting design for residential roads in the UK is based on BS 5489-1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512437157">8</xref></sup> which in turn calls up the lighting classes defined in BS EN 13201-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512437157">9</xref></sup> In residential roads it is usually the case that S class lighting is used, the requirements of each of the S classes are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512437157">Table 1</xref>. The illuminance requirements of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512437157">Table 1</xref> need to be met at a number of points on a grid defined in BS EN 13201-3<sup>10</sup> that cover the area of the pavement as well as the road surface.

<fn id="table-fn1-1477153512437157"><label>a</label><p>To provide for uniformity, the actual value of the maintained average illuminance may not exceed 1.5 times the minimum <italic>E</italic> value indicated for the class, and ideally should not exceed four times <italic>E</italic><sub>min</sub> value.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>The average illuminances that may be used in the UK are higher than those for similar roads in Australia and New Zealand (0.5 to 7.0 lux) and Japan (3.0 to 5.0 lux). While these countries also specify vertical illuminances as may be necessary to characterise facial recognition, UK standards focus on the horizontal illumination in residential streets considering that avoiding trip hazards is the main visual task of pedestrians.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to identify and characterise the principal visual tasks of pedestrians at night and the key aspects of the visual environment that are important to pedestrians. For this reason, the study was carried out on real roads at night and only the bare minimum of explicit instructions were given to the subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1477153512437157" sec-type="methods"><title>2. Methodology</title>
<p>In this experiment, we asked members of the general public to walk along the residential routes chosen for this study. Tests were carried out by night and day. Subjects walking behaviour was then analysed.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1477153512437157"><title>2.1. Test setting</title>
<p>The experiment site was located in a residential area in Fulham, London. Three routes were chosen for the test to provide a variety of differing conditions each of the routes was lit using high pressure sodium light sources.</p>
<p>Route 1 is a residential street with a limited amount of through traffic that was lit to illuminance level S3. The route was 275 m long and the subjects walked once down one side of the road and then back on the opposite side. According to the UK police crime map the route had two incidents of anti-social behaviour and one other crime recorded in the past year. Obstacle level in pavements on this route could be classified as <italic>Moderate</italic> considering the width of the footpaths (1.5 m for most of the route but with sections of up to 4 m in width) and the presence of trees and uneven surfaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512437157">Figure 1</xref> shows Route 1. Note: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477153512437157">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512437157">3</xref> were taken using the same exposure setting on the camera so the differences in illumination on the routes are apparent.
<fig id="fig1-1477153512437157" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Images of Route 1 (available in colour in electronic version)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512437157-fig1.tif"/>

</fig></p>
<p>Route 2 is a purely residential street and the road users are either local residents or visitors. It is lit to illuminance level S4. The route was 125 m long and the subjects walked once down one side of the road and then back on the opposite side. According to the UK police crime map the route had had one burglary, one vehicle crime and one other crime recorded in the past year. Obstacle level in pavements in this route could be classified as <italic>High</italic> considering the width of the pavements (less than 1.5 m in most places and down to about 0.9 m where trees cut into the width) and the presence of trees and uneven surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153512437157">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1477153512437157" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Images of Route 2 (available in colour in electronic version)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512437157-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Route 3 (which will be called Accompanied Route later on in this paper) is a collector road of residential streets which nearly all residents have to pass along to get to their respective streets. This road is wider and the vehicle traffic volume is much greater than on either of the other two routes. It is lit to illuminance level S1 and is about 290 m long. The subjects walked on the same side of the road when walking up and down the road. The crime map showed one anti-social behaviour incident, one violent crime and two other crimes for the road in the past year. The obstacle level for the route is <italic>Low</italic> considering the width of the pavements (at least 3 m), the limited number of small trees and the even surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512437157">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1477153512437157"><title>2.2. Subjects</title>
<p>Two groups of people participated in the research. 15 subjects (8 male) participated in the night time experiments and 5 subjects (2 male) took part in the day time test. The age range was between 20 and 60 years and they all had self-reported normal or corrected vision. During the test subjects were allowed just to wear contact lenses. There were no people with spectacles on the test as they were excluded as wearing glasses makes it very difficult for the eye tracker to function properly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1477153512437157"><title>2.3. Eye tracker</title>
<p>An iViewX Head Mounted Eye Tracking device (HED) made by SMI was used for measuring eye movement. The light weight helmet HED contains an Eye Camera (which records the eye movement), an angled Mirror (which directs the eye image to the eye camera) and a Scene Camera (which records the field of view of the person). HED outputs the Scene Video with Gaze Position which is indicated by a Gaze Cursor in the field of view. The head mounting equipment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512437157">Figure 4</xref> and a single frame from the output video is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512437157">Figure 5</xref>.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1477153512437157"><title>2.4. Test procedure</title>
<p>The subjects were fitted with the eye tracker which was then calibrated. The calibration procedure involved the subject being instructed to fixate sequentially each of five points of a calibration pattern positioned at a distance of 3 m. Films of the eye on-scene were made for each subject. A gaze cursor was superimposed on each frame of the movie at the calculated eye position.</p>
<p>Subjects were required to walk along all three routes wearing the eye tracker and on Routes 1 and 2 they needed to follow a simple way-finding task to go from point A to B on a schematic map that they had been given. They were not accompanied by the researcher during these parts of the test and they were asked to meet the researcher at the end of the task. On Route 3 subjects had no task and were accompanied and lead by the researcher to the destination point. On this Route subjects were not aware that they were already on a test route and they were told they were being guided to the actual test routes.</p>
<p>After completing the test a short interview took place by reviewing the film taken by the eye tracker. In the interview subjects were asked to explain their experience during each part of the film. They generally addressed what they saw and their thoughts during the walk in different parts of the test routes.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1477153512437157"><title>3.1. Interview responses</title>
<p>The short interview after the experiment focused on how subjects felt about their environment and why they were looking at particular objects. Their responses can be summarised as follows:
<list id="list2-1477153512437157" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The majority of people described the neighbourhood as quiet. Just two people (male) who visited the test site at night described the neighbourhood as a rough area.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The majority of people (13 out of 15 night time subjects) felt particularly unsafe on Route 2. In the videos it can be seen that subjects tended to walk faster in Route 2, which can be explained by a sense of insecurity on the route.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Almost all female subjects said that they did not feel comfortable walking at night in an unfamiliar neighbourhood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subjects who participated in the day test found the neighbourhood to be a reasonably nice residential area. None of the subjects complained about feeling unsafe during the walk.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because of the late sunset time when the experiments were carried out (around 10 pm) not all the subjects encountered people approaching them on all routes. On three occasions subjects felt threatened by people in the street. In one instance a young female subject noticed a group of men approaching her while consuming alcohol in the street (Route 1). The other occasion a male subject noticed some sort of anti-social behaviour from another male passerby on Route 2. The third instance was when a female subject saw a man standing in the dark with two dogs (subject was afraid of dogs in general).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Three [female] subjects (not including the previously mentioned three subjects) mentioned that they get the first impression about the person approaching them from their posture and basically from the silhouette of the person when they cannot actually see the person’s face. If they were not sure about the intention of the person by their posture they try to be assured by having more information from his face as they come closer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subjects occasionally look at signs along the routes but rarely read them or remembered them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Signs were important where they need to change direction according to the provided map and they need to check the street names (task-related scrutiny).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1477153512437157"><title>3.2. Eye tracking results</title>
<p>The data was analysed using Observer XT 10. This software makes it possible to calculate the duration which each subject spent looking at different objects in the scene by programming a coding system.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1477153512437157"><title>3.2.1. General results from all routes</title>
<p>An initial analysis was to look at the amount of time looking at horizontal surfaces, mainly the footpath and vertical objects such as people and signs. It was done by taking the total time to cover the route and then adding up all the seconds spent looking at horizontal and vertical parts of the scene. It was found that on an average people spent about half their time looking at each class of surface and there was not much difference between day and night time values. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test shows that there were no significant differences between day time and night time values.</p>
<p>The same data video sequences were analysed in more detail. A preliminary study on observed objects by participants suggests the following categorisation of objects presented in the scenes:
<list id="list3-1477153512437157" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Objects of personal interest (e.g. bike riders pay more attention on the parked bikes in the route than others)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Objects which drive visual attention (e.g. bright windows, moving objects)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Walking path and obstacles on the road</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Task-related objects (e.g. road signs when looking for direction)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512437157">Figure 6</xref> the time looking at the pavement, people, signs and transient objects such as passing cars is presented. The ‘other’ category covers a number of object classes such as houses, roads and trees. The error bars on the chart indicate the standard deviations in the values. As the number of transient objects and people was different on each occasion, data for their occurrence is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477153512437157">Table 3</xref>.

<p>This data shows that the amount of time per instance spent looking at transient objects and people increased at night. There were on average about half as many people and transient objects at night compared to day. However, the amount of time spent looking at them hardly changed.</p>

<p>The results of this study show that people look at the pavement between 40% and 50% of the time. This is a similar percentage to that found by Patla and Vickers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512437157">4</xref></sup> However, they had given their subjects a task of walking on a series of irregular foot prints. Moreover, they observed that the subjects looked about two steps ahead and thus visually fixated on targets about 0.8 to 1.0 s ahead of placing their foot on it. The subjects in our experiment did not have any explicit visual task and there was no observed pattern of subjects regularly looking two steps ahead of them. In fact subjects spent considerable time looking at areas well away from where they were about to step. From this it may argued that part of the time when subjects were looking down they were not performing visual tasks that were important to them walking along the road.</p>
<p>There is a potential argument that the perception of people looking down is not necessarily targeted at the point of regard, and this is further complicated by our lack of knowledge of the role of peripheral vision in pedestrian tasks. However, it is still clear that the level of visual task demand in walking along the pavement is low.</p>
<p>Thus given the patterns of time spent looking at the pavement on different routes at different times it may be argued that the amount of time spent looking at the pavement is as much a function of time left over after scanning the environment for potential threats as it is of the complexity of the visual task on the pavement.</p>
<p>There was a significant increase between the observed times spent looking at the pavement between Route 1 and Route 2. This was expected due to the higher number of obstacles on Route 2. However, what was not expected was the fact that subjects spent less time looking at the footpath at night; whilst there was no significant difference between the times for day and night on Route 1, there was a significant difference on Route 2. This interesting finding may be explained by the fact subjects reported feeling insecure on Route 2 at night. This would tend to make people spend longer making sure of their environment thus leaving less time to look at the pavement. On the Accompanied Route 3, subjects tended to spend longer looking at the footpath than on either of the other routes. Given that the subjects were accompanied on this route and the lack of any hiding place for potential assailants it is reasonable to assume that subjects felt less insecure on this route. This notion is supported by the fact that no subjects reported feeling insecure on this route. This lack of insecurity supports the argument that people on this route felt they did not have to pay too much attention to threats in the environment and thus there was extra time to spend looking at the foot path. One could argue that there might be other reasons behind this behaviour, for example being accompanied means there is more competition for footpath space so it requires more attention about where you are walking. The pavement width in this route easily allows several people walking side by side and therefore there would be no question of competition for foothpath space. However, everyone agrees that there could be a wide range of explanation for human behaviour in certain conditions, in terms of fear of crime, but the accompanied route had the minimum sense of threat for the subjects compared to the other routes.</p>
<p>In this study it was found that the amount of time spent looking at other people was of the order of 3.5%. Whilst this is only a small fraction of the total time it is clear from comments received from subjects during debriefing that they place a high level of importance on recognising people, thus it can be assumed facial recognition is important. However, some of the subjects mentioned being able to read the emotional body language of other people on the street. Considering statements of subjects who felt threatened by passers-by and who mentioned the behaviour of other people rather than their facial features there is perhaps a need to pay more attention to the recognition of emotional body language. This distinction between the recognition of emotional body language and facial expression is perhaps not that clear cut as it has been shown by Meeren <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512437157">11</xref></sup> that emotional body language and facial recognition together can assist subjects in detecting mood. The improvement was found to be in the time to detection and the accuracy of detection.</p>
<p>Caminada and von Bommel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512437157">1</xref></sup> made the case that ideally there should be facial recognition at 10 m. However, for most people street lighting does not provide enough light to make this possible, but it may well be that the detection of emotional body language can provide significant cues to mood. Given that detection of body language is a much easier visual task than facial recognition this may mean it is the dominant mechanism that pedestrians use to judge other people at long distances.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that the major problem in visual perception is that what people see is not simply a translation of retinal stimuli and this can be generalised to eye tracking studies. In eye tracking studies the important problem, according to Duchowski,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512437157">12</xref></sup> is ‘the dissociation of visual attention from the point of regard’. That is most of the time we can assume that one’s visual attention is associated with the point of fixation. This usually referred to as overt attention, because it is the component of visual attention (when associated with foveal vision) that can be measured overtly with an eye tracker. However, it is certainly possible to fix one’s gaze at a specific point and yet move one’s attention to a nearby region; moreover, it is also possible for a subject to fixate on an object whilst they are not paying attention to any part of their visual field.</p>
<p>The findings of this study show the potential power of eye tracking in helping to understand what is important to pedestrians on the streets at night. It is clear that there is a great potential for future work in this area. For example, one might want to examine how long transient objects of different types such as other pedestrians and vehicles were present while the subject was covering the route, what percentage of these transient objects were fixated and what percentage of the time they were present they were fixated for. To a certain extent these questions could be answered by further analysis of the videos captured in this experiment; however, due the limited and fragmentary nature of the events it is likely that many more hours of video will be needed to capture enough so that analysis may be performed to any level of statistical reliability. There may also be areas where it is not possible to rely on eye tracking, one of these areas may be observation of other pedestrians. It was observed that when a subject is fearful of an approaching pedestrian they tend to avert their gaze and not make eye contact, whereas if the subject is relaxed in the presence of the other people then several seconds may be spent looking directly at their faces. This emotional context may make it more complex to use eye tracking to study the recognition of other pedestrians.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1477153512437157" sec-type="conclusions"><title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has revealed that whilst pedestrians may spend about 50% of their time looking at the footpath, not all of that time is spent on critical visual tasks. It appears that to some extent the time looking down is controlled by the amount of time left over after scanning the environment for potential threats.</p>
<p>Looking at other people appears to be important to pedestrians but during this study the amount of time when subjects fixated on other people was limited. There were comments from some of the subjects that indicate that the recognition of emotional body language may be important.</p>
<p>The apparent importance of the visual tasks away from the footpath compared to the tasks on it raises questions about how appropriate it is to specify the lighting on residential road using illuminance on the road and pavement.</p>
