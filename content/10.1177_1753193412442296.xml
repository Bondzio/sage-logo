<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A 58-year-old right-handed male engineer sustained an occupational injury when his right middle finger was pierced on the radial aspect by a metal object at an electric power station. A 1.5 cm laceration was irrigated and sutured in the Accident and Emergency Department and he was discharged on a 5-day course of oral cloxacillin; 500 mg, 6 hourly. The wound was satisfactorily healed at 2 weeks follow-up. A few months later, he developed a swelling in the same finger and after about 1 year, he sought surgical excision of the swelling at a private hospital. The results of histopathology were not available for our review.</p>
<p>Around 1 year later, he noticed a similar swelling in the same location and presented to our centre 6 months after its recurrence. The mass had progressively increased in size and was associated with dull pain. It occasionally ruptured spontaneously with the discharge of yellowish pus from the resultant wound. There were no systemic symptoms and hand function was preserved. He had no history of pulmonary tuberculosis, but had exposure to sea water. He was on oral levothyroxine, having had total thyroidectomy for goitre at a different hospital 4 months earlier. Apart from the plain chest radiograph, which showed prominent right hilum, the results of laboratory investigations were essentially unremarkable. CRP and white cell count were within the reference range; ESR was 16 mm/h (reference range, 0–10 mm/h). Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function test, serum proteins, random serum glucose and 2 h postprandial tests were all within normal limits. It was not possible to make a clear firm clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>At excision biopsy there was a 1 cm ulcerating, nodular mass just distal to the old scar with frank pus from which specimens were obtained. No foreign materials or sinus tracks were seen. No organism was seen on Gram staining nor was there any growth of aerobic or anaerobic organisms. Fungal smear and culture were both negative. Histopathology showed several small and well demarcated nodules that were composed of a mixture of mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells, suggestive of a giant cell tumour of the tendon sheath. There were no features of granuloma or malignancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412442296">Figure 1</xref>). Although a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was negative, AFB culture was positive with orange colonies. The identity was confirmed by a Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory to be <italic>Mycobacterium neoaurum</italic>, based on the result from the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the <italic>hsp65</italic> gene and the sequence of the 16s rDNA, which showed 100% identification. Based on the result of an antibiotic susceptibility test, oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg and doxycycline 100 mg were given twice daily for 12 weeks. This produced a good clinical outcome with no recurrence of any nodular swelling 7 months postoperatively and 3 months after stopping medications.</p>

<p><italic>M. neoaurum</italic> is a rapidly growing scotochromogenic atypical mycobacterium first reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412442296">Tsukamura and Mizuno (1972)</xref> who isolated it from both soil and sea water in Japan. Its status as a nonpathogenic organism changed after it was first reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412442296">Davison et al. (1988)</xref> as the cause of a catheter-related, blood-borne infection in an immunocompromised patient with cancer. Since then, infections involving other organ systems of the body have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412442296">Washer et al., 2007</xref>), most of which have manifested with clinical features of systemic infection, especially fever. The patient in this report was not immunocompromised, did not have any systemic manifestation and inflammatory markers were not markedly raised, causing difficulty in clinical diagnosis. Although excision of the lesion may be required for diagnosis, the clinical response to antibiotics is generally good as the organism shows a favourable susceptibility profile to a wide range of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412442296">Washer et al., 2007</xref>). We speculate that the penetrating injury sustained previously and possible exposures to sea water were the risk factors.</p>
