<abstract>
<p>In this article, we present the results of a study that was conducted among 15 family physicians who had incorporated complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into their clinical work in Israel. We aimed to explore the types of boundaries those physicians encountered, how these boundaries were contoured, and under what circumstances they were crossed. We conducted in-depth interviews with the physicians in 2008, and found that epistemological and cognitive boundaries did not pose a problem for them. However, with regard to the organizational boundary, the participants indicated that it was necessary to use a variety of strategies before they could utilize their CAM skills. Many of the participants indicated that the epistemological differences between the biomedical and CAM paradigms, such as the absence of evidence-based medicine in CAM practices, are not important. The ease with which boundaries were crossed in the complex social context described here is characteristic of postmodern societies. On the whole, the integrative physicians interviewed can be viewed as “postmodern” professionals who reject the impermeability of many long-established boundaries and hierarchies.</p>

<body>
<p>Integrative medicine, which combines biomedicine with selected elements of CAM (complementary and alternative medicine), is viewed by its proponents as providing optimal care to patients by drawing on a broader array of health care options than conventional medicine. In this spirit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312450326">Rees and Weil (2001)</xref> stated that integrative medicine “views patients as whole people with minds and spirits as well as bodies and includes these dimensions in diagnosis and treatment” (p. 119).</p>
<p>Integrative medicine takes a variety of forms and is practiced in a variety of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450326">Fadlon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450326">Mizrachi &amp; Shuval, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312450326">Mizrachi, Shuval, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312450326">Shuval, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312450326">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Averbuch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Gross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Mizrachi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312450326">Shuval, Mizrachi, &amp; Smetannikov, 2002</xref>). The setting we chose to explore in this article represents a new and intriguing form of integration in which individual physicians—that is, qualified biomedical doctors who provide primary care—have also been trained in one or more CAM areas, and have incorporated these skills into their practice. As such, these physicians work in a world of conflicting paradigms about health and health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450326">Bell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450326">Boon, Verhoef, O’Hara, &amp; Findlay, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450326">Cant &amp; Sharma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450326">Coulter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312450326">Kailin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450326">Launso, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The epistemological multiplicity of this context offers an opportunity to explore a wide variety of boundary issues relating to the dual practice of CAM and biomedicine. Specifically, in this study we examined how boundaries are set and under what circumstances they are crossed or dissolved. Against that background, we sought to provide additional insight into the sociological implications of integrative medicine in primary care, with emphasis on the role of boundaries. We also sought to shed further light on types of boundaries that physicians who practice integrative care encounter in the course of their daily clinical work, as well as on the physicians’ strategies for contouring and crossing boundaries, how they deal with epistemological inconsistencies and conflicts between biomedicine and CAM, and the boundary work they perform to reconcile those two approaches.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312450326">Weber (1921/1970a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312450326">1922/1970b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312450326">Simmel (1971)</xref> highlighted the importance of boundaries, which are found in all places and at all times. In that connection, they noted that all societies have a basic need to label, distinguish, and separate. As such, the overall function of boundaries is to create order and provide systems of classification for individuals and groups. These boundaries serve as the foundation for the construction of social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450326">Abbott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450326">Desrochers &amp; Sargent, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049732312450326">Zerubavel, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312450326">1999</xref>). In an overview of research on boundaries in the social sciences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450326">Lamont and Molnar (2002)</xref> proposed that “boundaries are markers of difference which make for separation and exclusion” (p. 17). Focusing on boundaries highlights the relationship of the findings to classic theories that seek to understand outcomes of multiple roles, such as role conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312450326">Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, &amp; Snoek, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312450326">Merton, 1957</xref>), role strain (Kahn et al.), and role accumulation and enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312450326">Rothbard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312450326">Sieber, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>At any given time, some boundaries are guarded zealously and viewed as impermeable and unchangeable, but others are subject to alteration or modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450326">Mizrachi &amp; Shuval, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312450326">Pfeffer &amp; Salanacik, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Mizrachi, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450326">Alba (2005)</xref> distinguished between “bright” and “blurred” boundaries. When they are distinct and visibly demarcated, boundaries are clear; when they are ambiguous and lack clarity, they are blurred. In a seminal study on the sociology of the professions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450326">Abbott (1988)</xref> examined the boundaries of jurisdiction, with emphasis on the efforts of professional groups to gain control over spheres of knowledge. According to Abbott, the major conflicts over boundaries of demarcation occur at the edges of the relevant areas of jurisdiction. Consistent with that approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312450326">Larson (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049732312450326">Witz (1990)</xref> argued that professional boundaries are a mechanism of social closure, which is used to maintain cohesion and power.</p>
<p>Several researchers have examined boundaries between collaborating or cooperating health professions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312450326">Theberge (2009)</xref> conducted research on the sociology of sport and investigated the demarcation of boundaries among professionals in three fields—physiotherapy, chiropractics, and sports medicine—all of which provide clinical care in the context of competitive sports. Another example is the research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312450326">Martin, Currie, and Finn (2009)</xref>, who examined the incorporation of clinical geneticists into family practice settings in Britain. This research also focused on the implications of boundaries for the division of power and responsibility among the relevant experts.</p>
<p>In the present study we were concerned with occupational boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450326">Pachucki, Pendergrass, &amp; Lamont, 2007</xref>), as perceived by doctors who integrate biomedicine and CAM in their practice: the boundaries’ salience, permeability, durability, and visibility. This empirical arena encompasses a wide variety of boundaries that, even though they are not always perceived as such by the doctors themselves, require ongoing strategies to negotiate their crossing or to accept their differential functions. We refer to these strategies as “boundary work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450326">Gieryn, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450326">1999</xref>)—a term that relates to the rhetorical devices that are used to attribute selected qualities to science and that serve as a basis for clarifying the boundary between authoritative science and nonscience. We have expanded this notion in the manner proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450326">Allen (2000)</xref>, who emphasized behavioral elements and practices that are used to cross boundaries in the work context.</p>
<p>Biomedicine and CAM do not constitute a symmetrical duality. The former refers to a high-prestige, powerful, cohesive social institution that has far-reaching political influence and vast resources at its disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450326">Bourdieu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312450326">Freidson, 1970</xref>), whereas CAM consists of a heterogeneous, marginal group of practitioners who lack political or social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450326">Coburn, 2001</xref>). Therefore, crossing the boundaries that separate conventional biomedicine and CAM is a process that involves a transition from a relatively secure, socially dominant world to an amorphous world of theory and practice that is based on a different set of professional and epistemological axioms. Boundary work is necessary because, taken as a whole, CAM is based on a set of axioms, presuppositions, and practices that differ considerably from those of biomedicine, which aims to be evidence based. As such, physicians need to reconcile epistemological dilemmas and potential conflicts that might arise when they utilize both biomedicine and CAM in the course of regular clinical encounters.</p>
<p>Biomedicine is based on the application of the principles of the natural sciences, especially biology and biochemistry, to diagnosis and treatment. The biomedical paradigm is founded on “the assumption that all disease is generated by specific etiological agents such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, genetic malformations, or internal chemical imbalances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450326">Berliner, 1984</xref>, p. 30). The perspective of biomedicine is characterized by rationality, objectivity, positivism, determinism, universalism, and linearity, whereas its methods emphasize logic, controls, measurement, and deduction (Berliner; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450326">Clavarino &amp; Yates, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450326">Coulter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312450326">Foucault, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312450326">Mizrachi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312450326">Rosenberg, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines CAM as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312450326">NCCAM, n.d.</xref>). Despite the differences among the diverse CAM practices, a number of common characteristics have been noted, two of which are a holistic perspective that recognizes that people are simultaneously biological and social creatures, and a view that biology and culture interact as equal partners in defining “who and what we are” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312450326">Moerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312450326">Montgomery, 1993</xref>). Illness is viewed as an imbalance between opposing forces of energy and a failure of the body’s restorative power. CAM emphasizes individuality, interpersonal interaction with patients, subjectivity of experience, feeling, energy balance, and preventive lifestyle behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450326">Berliner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450326">Clavarino &amp; Yates, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450326">Coulter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450326">Fulder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312450326">Micozzi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312450326">Northcott, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In considering these two diverse paradigms (biomedicine and CAM), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312450326">Kuhn’s (1962)</xref> concept of incommensurability appears to be applicable. In effect, there is no way that the paradigms can be compared to determine which one is more appropriate or useful. Because their vocabulary and problem-solving methods are based on different concepts, each of these methods reflects a different perspective of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450326">Keshet, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>CAM in the Israeli Context</title>
<p>The National Health Insurance Law of 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312450326">State of Israel, 1994</xref>) stipulates that universal health care shall be provided to all Israelis without charge or for a symbolic payment but does not include CAM in its service entitlements. As such, coverage for CAM services is included in the supplemental insurance plans of the major health maintenance organizations in Israel, known as “sick funds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312450326">Rosen &amp; Samuel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312450326">Shuval, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Health care is offered by four sick funds, which provide a mandatory package of benefits defined by the National Health Insurance Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312450326">State of Israel, 1994</xref>). Care is provided to all Israeli residents through facilities in urban and rural areas of the country. Three of the four sick funds (which insure 90% of the population) have addressed the widespread popular demand for CAM services on a formal, structural level by establishing their own network of CAM clinics that provide a distinct type of integrative care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312450326">Shuval, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Averbuch, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In each CAM clinic, a senior physician who is also a CAM practitioner performs the function of triage, that is, initial diagnosis of the patient’s condition and referral to a CAM practitioner in the clinic. The triage physician examines new patients and refers them to the most appropriate CAM specialist (e.g., an acupuncturist, a reflexologist, or a chiropractor), taking the patient’s preferences for CAM care into consideration. The patient can change to a different CAM modality only after consultation with the senior triage physician. This type of integration has been described as co-optation with structured control by the biomedical establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312450326">Shuval &amp; Mizrachi, 2004</xref>). Patients who seek treatment in these clinics pay on a fee-for-service basis, but those who have supplementary health insurance policies pay a reduced fee. In 1999, about half of the population in Israel had supplementary insurance, and by 2007 this figure had risen to 80% of the adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312450326">Shuval, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present article we explore another form of integration, in which a physician trained in both biomedicine and CAM uses both methods at his or her own discretion in the course of clinical encounters. Although this type of integration is established in other Western countries, it is new in Israel. The findings of surveys conducted among physicians have revealed that 85% of general physicians in Germany, 45% in the Netherlands, 30% in France and New Zealand, and 16% in England and Canada reported using CAM methods along with their biomedical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312450326">O’Brien, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312450326">Pirotta, Cohen, Kotsirilos, &amp; Farish, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 150 physicians (in various fields of specialization) in Israel who have joined the Israel Society for Complementary Medicine as part of the Israel Medical Association and practice biomedicine as well as one or more CAM specialties. Both types of integrative medicine have been endorsed by the Israel Medical Association, and are practiced by or under the full supervision of a biomedical physician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450326">Israel Medical Association, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312450326">Rosen &amp; Samuel, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In this study, we explored the perceptions of primary care physicians who integrate CAM practices with biomedicine with regard to boundaries encountered in the course of their daily clinical practice and how they dealt with epistemological dilemmas and potential conflicts that might arise. The nature of the research questions dictated the use of qualitative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312450326">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312450326">Pope &amp; Mays, 1999</xref>). We aimed to arrive at analytic generalizations, which relate to the theoretical issues raised, rather than statistical generalizations, which refer to the frequencies of phenomena in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732312450326">Yin, 1984</xref>). Therefore, our method of data collection was based on in-depth interviews with a small number of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450326">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on a purposive sampling method, we selected 15 primary care physicians (PCPs) who utilized CAM as an integral part of their regular practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450326">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1998</xref>). This number was reached after we ascertained that theoretical saturation regarding integration of CAM and biomedicine among PCPs in Israel had been attained. That is, we ascertained that most of the relevant issues had been discussed and that the additional interviews were repeating previous narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450326">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The first participants were selected with the help of Dr. Leora Schachter (a coauthor of this article), who was then the medical director of the Complementary Medicine Services of Maccabi Healthcare Services (the second largest sick fund in Israel). As the interviewing progressed, we used the snowball technique, that is, obtaining additional names of potential participants from those already interviewed. We attempted to maximize the heterogeneity of the participants in terms of gender, age, sick fund employer, and location in the country. Thus, the doctors selected for interviews included 9 men and 6 women who were employed by three of the four sick funds and ranged in age from 40 to 60 years; their clinics were distributed in different geographical areas—two in Jerusalem, seven in the central region, three in the north of the country, and three in the southern area. Interviews were conducted between December 2007 and October 2008.</p>
<p>The principal research instrument was a semistructured interview guide. All of the questions were open ended, and the participants were encouraged to speak freely about their training, experience, and impressions of integrative practice and the issues that this type of practice raised for them (for further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312450326">Gross, Ashkenazi, Elroy, Shachter, &amp; Shuval, 2010</xref>). Three experienced researchers who were trained in qualitative interviewing techniques conducted the interviews. Interviews took place in the physician’s clinic or home and lasted between 1 and 2 hours. They were recorded and then transcribed by a professional transcriber.</p>
<p>Data analysis began at an early stage to evaluate the need for additional interviews and/or to introduce any necessary changes in the interview protocol. Analysis of the interviews involved coding of the main themes and identification of the patterns that emerged in the theoretical issues regarding boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450326">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450326">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). The analysis was inductive in the sense that the themes defining the boundaries emerged from the physicians’ narratives rather than from a priori theoretical hypotheses. Three of the investigators read and reread the texts of the narratives and independently coded the principal emerging themes. In cases where differences among them occurred, we discussed the text until consensus was reached. We also discerned themes relating other content areas of integrative medicine, but we focus in the present article on themes relating to boundaries.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The most frequent forms of CAM practiced by the PCPs participating in the present study were homeopathy and acupuncture, although several of the physicians practiced more than one CAM modality, for example, acupuncture, healing, biofeedback, homeopathy, and Chinese, herbal, and anthroposophic medicine. Most of the participants were in their 40s and 50s, and most of them had studied CAM in Israel, although a few had studied abroad (e.g., in Germany, Switzerland, the United States, and Italy). Some had studied CAM in the Far East (India, Japan).</p>
<p>Our findings revealed that the participants’ decision to incorporate CAM into their daily practice was reached individually by the physicians themselves, and it did not require permission from the sick fund that employed them. Such a laissez-faire approach is legitimized by the law in Israel: Qualified biomedical physicians may choose clinical methods of practice at their own discretion. Medical liability insurance covers any kind of treatment that the physician chooses to provide, including CAM modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450326">Israel Medical Association, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312450326">Yishai, 1999</xref>). To date, to the best of our knowledge, there has never been a lawsuit against a doctor in Israel because of practicing CAM.</p>
<p>In the following section, we present the types of boundary issues that emerged from the thematic analysis of the interviews with the PCPs. We examine their perceptions of setting and crossing boundaries as well as their strategies for coping with inconsistencies and dilemmas that arise from integrating biomedicine and CAM. The following boundaries were discerned in the interview narratives: the boundary of practice that separates biomedicine from CAM, the boundary of identity, the epistemological boundary, the cognitive boundary, the organizational boundary, and the social boundary. For each of those boundaries, the narratives of the integrative PCPs serve as empirical data.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312450326">
<title>Boundaries of Practice</title>
<p>The boundary of practice separating biomedicine from CAM is the critical line that must be negotiated in an integrative practice. The data indicate that a clear temporal process occurred among almost all of the physicians participating in the study. Their initial choice was to focus on the appropriate biomedical tests, diagnosis, and treatment options. Only after those options had been exhausted did they consider the option of CAM. Priority was given to biomedical diagnostic procedures to avoid errors or misdiagnosis, especially in life-threatening conditions, and the introduction of CAM took place subsequently. One physician indicated, “I always begin with a conventional, biomedical approach. This is the top of the pyramid.” Another physician indicated, “[When] a patient arrives with a cold, back pain, and all sorts of other problems, first I give him a conventional (bio) examination, but at the very same time I consider his case from a holistic viewpoint.” CAM may be introduced casually at the physician’s initiative, through suggestions for dietary changes, or other revisions in the patient’s lifestyle. In those cases, the patient might not even be aware that CAM has been introduced:
<disp-quote>
<p>I often direct the conversation in a subtle manner, using Chinese diagnostic questions relating to diet, balance of hot and cold foods, the nature of the patient’s menstrual flow, personality traits, emotions, pulse and tongue examinations, without the patient realizing that I have introduced these diagnostic methods.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312450326">
<title>Boundaries of Identity</title>
<p>All of the PCPs participating in the study had more than one professional identity: as a family physician and as a CAM practitioner. In several cases, the physicians had more than one CAM specialty, and therefore had multiple CAM identities. Because all the physicians in this study worked as PCPs in one of the major sick funds in Israel, their formal public identity was predominantly biomedical. At the same time, at least one of the participants had a sign on her door identifying her as a family physician who also practiced acupuncture.</p>
<p>Most of the participants were proud of their biomedical identity because it gave them a sense of confidence and authority (“I don’t know what I would do if I were not a full-fledged doctor. I wouldn’t really feel confident dealing with patients without this basic knowledge.”). They also believed in CAM work and in its value for patients (“I see myself as a physician—not as a CAM practitioner. I use homeopathy along with conventional medicine as part of being a doctor.”). Another physician described his preference:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am often convinced that acupuncture will help the patient most. I would rather not use Western medicine when I know that CAM is more effective. It all depends on the specific situation. I try to convince the patient that CAM is better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the participants told us that their reputation as integrative physicians had spread informally through patient networks and among their patients’ families and friends. Many of them reported that their patients had sought them out precisely because of their CAM specialty. For example, one participant commented, “Some patients choose me because they know I integrate CAM in my practice, but some don’t know and view me as a family physician.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312450326">
<title>Epistemological Boundaries</title>
<p>The epistemological boundary refers to the normative axioms and theories that serve as the basis for practice, especially with regard to the limits and validity of practice. The integrative physicians were divided in their views about the extent to which biomedicine and CAM are divided by epistemological boundaries. The physicians who adopted the most extreme view argued that these are two different paradigms that cannot be reconciled. According to one physician, “We’re talking about two different closed systems; they speak different languages. Each system has its own beauty and fascination, and also its own weaknesses.” Another physician explained, “There are lots of conflicts—about food, attitudes, overall approach. Certain indicators are not meaningful in the context of conventional medicine but highly significant to a CAM practitioner.” Another physician expressed a similar view:
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that Western medicine and CAM involve quite different forms of thinking. To practice acupuncture or homeopathy, one does not need to be a physician. The type of ideas required in Western medicine are confining and prevent open-mindedness. If you want to practice good Chinese medicine, you need to think differently, to put another disk in your head. Western thinking is disturbing. You need to free yourself from all preconceived notions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other physicians adopted the extreme opposite view and argued that there is no separation between biomedicine and CAM. They believed in “one medicine,” which aims to achieve overall goals (e.g., maintaining the patient’s health) and uses a variety of methods that must be judiciously selected and utilized (“I see no conflict. There is only one medicine. It consists of many concepts [and] includes conventional approaches, but is expanded to include additional ideas and methods.”). Others perceived the two systems as different yet complementary. For that reason, they believed that physicians should use their discretion according to the case at hand:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no conflict because acupuncture and Western medicine deal with different subjects: Western medicine deals with immediate, urgent problems, and Chinese medicine deals with the sources of the problem. In other words, Western medicine provides a solution to an immediate problem, whereas Chinese medicine is concerned with the roots of the problem.</p>
<p>When you’re dealing with human beings, you need more than a strictly scientific approach. There is no reason why we shouldn’t use approaches based on other types of thought—which may be less scientific, strictly speaking, but are based on experience and insight and have gained validity over many years. CAM does not deny the importance of scientific medicine, but seeks to broaden it and to encompass a wider array of human problems.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312450326">
<title>Cognitive Boundaries</title>
<p>Cognitive boundaries define the types of practice and knowledge that are viewed as legitimate. In explaining their reasons for choosing to practice CAM, many of the participants expressed extensive criticism of the practice norms of biomedicine. The participants’ universal adherence to a holistic approach generated objections to many of the norms of contemporary conventional practice, which is seen as segmented, impersonal, noncaring, overly invasive, drug dependent, and mechanistic. One physician stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>They [conventional doctors] receive too many patients, often as many as twelve an hour, so that it’s impossible to fully address [the patients], to provide support, to talk to them. Therefore they depend too much on antibiotics.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another physician argued that “conventional doctors work mechanically. Especially in hospitals, they work according to formal procedures. There is little personal input of intuition or understanding of the body’s natural needs.” To cite an additional example,
<disp-quote>
<p>There is something irrational about medical school education. For three years you learn how the body functions, and after that [you learn] what happens when the body gets sick. Something is missing in-between: how to encourage the body to stay healthy—what helps the body maintain itself. [These doctors] only deal with pathologies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, some of the physicians argued that integrative medicine is, in fact, the way to practice the ideal type of biomedicine taught in medical school. It allows the doctor to take initiative, think independently, connect with patients better, and devote more time to them. Moreover, integrative medicine enables physicians to provide humane care and provides the basis for a holistic approach that keeps sight of the person rather than the illness. This is in line with the belief about the ideal type biomedicine, as described by one physician: “Doctors in conventional practice focus on the disease rather than on the patient. There is little awareness of the bio-social-psychological model. The medical system does not provide fair, egalitarian, caring medicine.” Another physician explained, “My training as a doctor in CAM methods enriched my practice particularly in terms of empathy and interest in patients. It provided a spiritual dimension to my medical treatment.” Yet another physician said,
<disp-quote>
<p>The medical system does not provide time for the doctor to listen to his patients . . . instead it pushes drugs. I hate the fact that the drug industry has taken over the medical profession. At one time doctors understood that the body could be helped to overcome its problems. But now, if a person is depressed—Prozac; if he has an itch—some drug will be offered.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence-based medicine (EBM) serves as a major cognitive boundary marker because it is upheld by biomedicine as the “gold standard” for providing care. Several physicians criticized the persistent and exclusive reliance of biomedical doctors on EBM. Some have rejected the notion that EBM is a sine qua non for knowledge-based practice insofar as much of conventional medicine is in fact experience based. For example, one physician stated, “In natural medicine, treatments are individual. I cannot prescribe homeopathic remedies in double blind trials. You give every patient the remedy that is appropriate for him or her.” Another physician criticized EBM: “The methods used by conventional doctors to measure the effectiveness of CAM are not appropriate, and are not the only way to determine effectiveness. They [conventional doctors] do not have a monopoly on truth.” Yet another physician said,
<disp-quote>
<p>There are things you see with your own eyes. You hear a child wheezing, and after reflexology treatment, you don’t hear the wheezing any more. It’s true that no one has invested money in testing it [the effect of reflexology], but the fact is that it works. Even if there is no EBM, that doesn’t mean it [the effect] does not exist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the doctors we interviewed claimed that biomedical research is inconsistent and heavily biased because of financial support from groups with vested interests, such as drug companies. One participant commented, “I know that many research projects are funded by pharmaceutical companies, and selected findings are reported which provide distorted conclusions.” Another doctor commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>At some stage, a study is published that shows that conventional knowledge is wrong. See how chaotic conventional medicine is? For example, once [conventional medicine thought that] all women needed HRT [hormone replacement therapy], and then they decided that no one should do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, several PCPs noted that CAM is now partially evidence based. This reflects an acceptance of the biomedical method for acquiring knowledge and supports the argument that CAM practices should be included under the auspices of EBM when an evidence base exists (i.e., CAM practices that have been confirmed in randomized clinical trials). This view is reflected in the following statement: “There is randomly controlled trial research in many areas of CAM practice: homeopathy, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, Ayervedic medicine, naturotherapy, touch and movement modalities and others.” However, the lack of clinical trials in CAM methods was also noted and lamented: “There are not enough random medical trials [for CAM methods]. There are many case reports but that’s not enough. I wish there were.”</p>

<title>Organizational Boundaries</title>
<p>All organizations have boundaries. These take the form of formal and informal regulations and determine who is in and who is out of the organization as well as the obligations of members and potential members. The sick funds that employed the physicians we interviewed maintained clearly defined boundaries that the integrative doctors must consider in the course of their daily practice. The results of our study shed light on the strategies used by these doctors to deal with these boundaries.</p>
<p>The first organizational boundary concerns the provision of CAM by employees of sick funds when CAM is not included in the National Health Insurance benefits package. Under these circumstances, physicians providing CAM cannot be compensated by the sick funds for including CAM in their practice. By providing CAM, the physicians make use of the time of the sick fund to provide a service that the organization is not obligated to provide; this comes at the expense of treating other patients. Furthermore, the sick funds have a financial interest in referring patients to the special CAM clinics run by them on a fee-for-service basis.</p>
<p>The participants’ responses in the interviews indicate that the initiative to incorporate CAM into their family practice was taken individually by each of the physicians without prior approval or consultation with the authorities of the sick fund. The physicians disregarded this boundary, and the sick funds made little effort to enforce it:
<disp-quote>
<p>In fact, they encouraged me to send patients to their own CAM clinics because they want the income. It’s a business, that’s why. On the other hand, they also turned a blind eye to my CAM work in the clinic here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to the normative procedure, physicians would refer patients to one of the CAM clinics run by the sick fund. Some of the participants indicated that in fact they did refer patients:
<disp-quote>
<p>My problem is that it is illegal for me to provide private care at my clinic [i.e., CAM for a fee] to members of the sick fund in my clinic. I explain this to my patients. What I can do is refer them to the CAM clinic network of the sick fund.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other doctors were reluctant to refer patients to the respective CAM clinics. Several of them expressed reservations about the quality of care provided at these clinics and stated that skilled CAM practitioners did not work in these settings:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wouldn’t work for the CAM clinics of the sick fund myself. They only opened them to make money, and they have no ideals or principles. They impose lots of technical limitations on the length and number of treatments—all to make sure they make a profit.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The doctors we interviewed chose to work within a sick fund, emphasizing the advantages for them despite the limitations it imposed on practicing integrative medicine: “It’s important for me to work in a respected, well-established medical organization. Its reliable and credible reputation make it easier for me to disseminate my ideas and change patients’ thinking.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the participants reported that they negotiated the boundaries of time (when to provide CAM) and place (where to provide CAM) in their effort to integrate CAM practices into patient care. Because of the timetable of biomedical practice, it was problematic for the doctors to allot specific time slots for CAM practices that required special equipment or extra time, for example, acupuncture. However, because they were motivated by a compelling desire to provide the benefits of CAM to their patients, elements of homeopathy and Chinese medicine were informally incorporated into ongoing clinical procedures. This was also true of major elements of naturotherapy, herbal medicine, and healing:
<disp-quote>
<p>I work half time for the sick fund as a family doctor. I can’t really provide full CAM care in that setting. All I can give is advice on diet and lifestyle. But I always incorporate CAM thinking and advice in my work. Sometimes I give acupuncture treatment—at the end of my day’s work. I don’t take any payment for it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others explained that they integrated aspects of CAM as part of their routine biomedical work and that it had become part of their professional worldview. One physician indicated, “I am integrative. I refer to the body and soul—to the spiritual part. I transferred this attitude from CAM to conventional medicine.” Another physician explained, “I am more sensitive. I spontaneously absorb information that a conventional doctor misses. For example, when a family arrives and I look at the dynamics. I think this has an effect [on the quality of care I give].” Yet another physician said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I always do both things at the same time. During the intake, when I speak with the patient, for me, they [conventional and anthroposophic medicine] are parallel. When I diagnose a particular illness, I assess conventional severity, and then I determine which anthroposophic medicines are appropriate. It’s totally parallel.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The boundaries of place were also negotiated because private practice is not permitted in the public clinics operating under the auspices of sick funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312450326">Rosen &amp; Samuel, 2009</xref>). Consequently, quite a few of the participants maintained private clinics in different geographic settings on a fee-for-service basis. However, several of them noted ethical dilemmas in negotiating the boundaries between biomedicine and CAM. They found this situation awkward because they felt it was inappropriate or unethical to refer patients to their own private clinics. One physician commented, “I observe ethical standards. I don’t see any of my [public] clinic patients in my private clinic.” A similar attitude was expressed by another physician: “I can’t function as a doctor at a sick fund and then tell a patient to come later, pay privately, and I’ll treat you with Chinese medicine.” Yet another physician explained, “I have a private clinic where I give CAM treatments, but I generally don’t suggest it to patients in my family practice clinic. It doesn’t come across right. I prefer to refer patients to other private clinics.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312450326">
<title>Social Boundaries</title>
<p>Social boundaries define relevant reference groups that provide instrumental help, identity, and social support. In the medical profession, exchange of information, consultation, and networking are sine qua nons for high-quality professional practice. The participants’ primary identity was in the field of biomedicine. On the whole, they felt part of the medical profession and made an effort to participate in mainstream medical events. The biomedical community served as a salient reference group for these physicians, and several of them expressed their determination to maintain ongoing contact with it. However they did not want to hide their CAM practice, and they found ways to introduce CAM practices in their biomedical professional network. As one participant noted, “First and foremost, I am a physician who engages in diagnosis, maintains medical ethics, and is committed to science. In that capacity, I maintain contact with other members of the medical profession.”</p>
<p>Another participant noted that he made a point of attending a journal club in which he had no hesitation about raising issues related to CAM. He continued to feel comfortable in that forum, even though his position was often criticized:
<disp-quote>
<p>Anyone who knows me realizes that I am a physician, and that my work is good. I am a member of a journal club, and I often talk about CAM. Some [of my colleagues] probably think I’m strange. Others call later to ask all kinds of questions. I don’t feel rejected by the medical community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another physician noted that more research on the efficacy of CAM is important because it will help convince the biomedical community to accept this type of practice: “[More research] will help convince the medical community—they [can] see that CAM treatments really are effective. I don’t feel rejected by other doctors.” However, a few of the physicians participating in the study were so self-confident that they did not care what the mainstream medical community thought of them:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are some doctors who think [CAM] is nonsense—although today this view is changing. It just shows what people’s opinions are worth. Today there are many professors who study [CAM] and use it for themselves and their patients. There are many forces of change that cannot be underestimated. There is more openness today.</p>

<title>Analysis and Discussion</title>
<p>The findings are consistent with the theoretical literature on boundaries and expand a number of seminal notions presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450326">Lamont and Molnar (2002)</xref>. We have seen that boundary work is an important organizing principle that demarcates the respective domains of biomedicine and CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450326">Gieryn, 1983</xref>). Furthermore, boundaries are not static. Rather, they change their contours in response to actors’ initiatives. Our approach was multidimensional on the assumption that there are many salient boundaries that interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450326">Panchucki et al., 2007</xref>). In the following section we discuss six boundaries that emerged from a critical reading of the physicians’ narratives: the boundary of practice that separates biomedicine from CAM, the boundary of identity, the epistemological boundary, the cognitive boundary, the organizational boundary, and the social boundary. Different patterns of boundary crossing were observed, indicating differential permeability, salience, and visibility in boundary crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450326">Alba, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The ease and frequency with which the cognitive and epistemological boundaries were negotiated through the use of rhetorical devices of boundary work to establish legitimacy, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450326">Gieryn (1999)</xref>, are noteworthy. In this connection, the participants indicated that there is only “one medicine” and that CAM is included within its umbrella. The notion of “one medicine” might be viewed as a denial of cognitive or epistemological boundaries because it incorporates CAM into one pluralistic, multifaceted field. However, there are boundaries that require more than rhetoric. For example, to cross social boundaries, the participants indicated that deliberate behavioral action is necessary to participate in groups and conferences that enable them to maintain social contact (e.g., “I am a member of a journal club, and lots of times I talk about CAM. I don’t feel rejected by the medical community.”).</p>
<p>Less permeability is seen in organizational boundaries, which imposed limits on the practice of CAM in primary care clinics. This is seen in the formal stance of the sick funds that relegated CAM to a separate network of CAM-dedicated services and proscribed taking fees for CAM provided in the context of its primary care clinics. The narratives of the PCPs in our study demonstrate that one way of circumventing this boundary was by informal boundary work. This took the form of discreet inclusion of CAM practices along with biomedical procedures in clinical encounters. In this manner, the integrative physicians sought to avoid overt identification of the “alternative” practice elements and attempted to minimize conflict or tension between the two systems.</p>
<p>These findings expand the notion of informal boundary work, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312450326">Mizrachi and Shuval (2004)</xref>, but informal boundary work can be effective only up to the point where it confronts powerful institutional interests that control certain boundaries. In the case of CAM and biomedicine, the sick funds had a primary interest in containing CAM within their dedicated CAM clinics, where a form of parallel integration was practiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450326">Boon et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike the integrative physicians in the present study, they did not practice full personal integration in those clinics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312450326">Pachucki et al. (2007)</xref> have noted the role of organizational and institutional structures in explaining the variation in the boundary work among individuals.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that not only are there a variety of boundaries in any one arena, but these boundaries vary in their levels of salience and permeability. Boundary work can take the form of discursive strategies as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450326">Gieryn (1999)</xref> but also in informal behavior, as evidenced in strategic practical action. Additional research in other fields and in a variety of cultural settings can lend theoretical generalizability to these findings.</p>
<p>The narratives show a striking consensus regarding the participants’ basic identity: all of doctors interviewed asserted their inherent and unequivocal presence on the biomedical side of the practice boundary. This is evident in their statements that biomedicine was always their first priority in every integrative medical encounter as well as in their perception that life-threatening conditions should in all cases be treated by biomedicine. All of the physicians identified themselves as medical doctors (MDs) who also practiced one CAM specialty or more. Several stated explicitly that the MD role gave them confidence, enabled them to maintain their status, and assured them of membership in the mainstream medical community. Although the integrative physicians maintained multiple identities on the occupational level, their biomedical identity was dominant. At the same time, boundary crossing among identities was routinized in their daily clinical practice.</p>
<p>Once the physicians gained experience in this form of integrated practice, they did not feel like strangers in the sense suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312450326">Simmel (1971)</xref>. Most of the physicians participating in this study believed that CAM enabled them to practice medicine at its best—essentially, it enabled them to implement the ideal biopsychosocial approach. This, in turn, might serve to strengthen the dominance of their identity as MDs. At first glance, one might conclude that the form of integrative practice considered here represents an effort to medicalize CAM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450326">Fadlon (2005)</xref> coined the term <italic>domestication</italic> to describe the process by which the tenets of CAM are transformed and rendered more culturally acceptable as well as less exotic and culturally challenging to biomedicine. Given the high level of self-confidence and elitism of biomedicine, a measure of medicalization is probably inevitable when MDs practice CAM.</p>
<p>However, this pattern is not a one-way street. The findings revealed that a converse process, <italic>“</italic>CAMification<italic>”</italic> of biomedicine, might occur simultaneously. In that process, CAM provides biomedical physicians with a more holistic approach to treating the patient, even if they do not choose to use the specific tools of CAM. When they opt to use those tools, the lack of evidence-based findings does not pose a barrier. The widespread criticism of the practice and structure of the biomedical system represents an overt declaration that the adoption of CAM in conventional practice can yield more effective clinical results and can enable physicians to avoid many of the weaknesses and errors of biomedicine. Several of the participants spoke with considerable passion about their hope to change biomedicine by integrating the orientation of CAM. In our view, the physicians who practiced this form of integrative medicine were more committed to CAMification than to the reverse process. Most of the integrative physicians were zealous about the integration of CAM with biomedicine. For them, CAM was not a purely professional preference but an integral part of their overall worldview that determined their personal values and behavior. Thus, after they made their biomedical identity clear, they tended to seek strategies for integrating CAM into the medical encounter.</p>
<p>The absence of “evidence-based medicine” in CAM, which is considered a major cognitive boundary marker that distinguishes many CAM practices from biomedicine, was disregarded by the participants on the grounds that evidence-based practice is not always applied in biomedicine. Rather, the pragmatic criterion—that is, what works—is the determining factor for acceptable and desirable procedures of clinical practice. Consistent with that approach, the integrative physicians participating in this study learned to reach intuitive decisions based on extensive knowledge and understanding of the patient without the constant support of quantitative data.</p>
<p>Our findings are in line with the results of a previous study conducted in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450326">Averbuch-Smetannikov, 2010</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450326">Gieryn (1999)</xref>, Averbuch-Smetannikov noted a number of strategies that MD CAM practitioners used to dissolve epistemological and cognitive boundaries. She referred to the translation of CAM concepts into relevant biomedical terminology and the highlighting of the congruent elements of CAM and biomedicine. Her findings also showed the pragmatic aspect of therapeutic success, that is, what works.</p>
<p>As long as CAM is not included in the set of entitlements provided by the Israel National Health Insurance Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312450326">State of Israel, 1994</xref>), it appears that the organizational boundary of the major sick funds in Israel will remain the most salient, visible, and durable boundary observed by integrative physicians. Most respondents emphasized that they refrained from private practice in the context of a public sick fund clinic. For them, the organizational boundary imposed by the sick funds was largely impermeable. In that context, it appears that physicians who wished to practice integrative medicine in sick fund clinics had no choice but to seek ways to negotiate this boundary.</p>
<p>The simplest solution, which was not always satisfactory to the physicians, was the referral of patients to the CAM clinics of the sick fund. Although this solution was not complicated, it was problematic for those who questioned the quality of CAM practice in these clinics as well as for those who sought to practice a model of integrative medicine that could be applied in routine primary care visits. Similarly, the physicians who maintained a private CAM practice felt uncomfortable referring patients for CAM care in their own private clinics. As a result, because of ethical considerations, they generally referred the patients to other private CAM practitioners. Although this compromised these physicians’ perceptions of ideal integrative practice, the provision of CAM for a fee in a public sick fund clinic was perceived as an almost impenetrable ethical barrier that they were opposed to crossing.</p>
<p>The data showed a number of other strategies that the physicians utilized to negotiate the organizational boundary. Two of these strategies sought to solve the dilemma of private practice through temporal or spatial differentiation. Setting aside an hour at the end of the working session for patients to receive CAM free of charge might be seen as the introduction of a new temporal boundary that makes the practice of CAM acceptable in a sick fund clinic. Another strategy involved the creation of a new geographical and organizational boundary by establishing a private practice in another location where CAM could be practiced legitimately. On the whole, the latter was found to be the preferred solution, although it was not ideal. Notably, it did not enable the provision of integrative medical care in the public primary care clinics and limited such care to those who could pay for it.</p>
<p>A widespread mode of negotiating this boundary was to introduce CAM into the ongoing clinical encounter in a discreet, low-profile mode. In these cases, some patients might not even have been aware that CAM was being utilized. The most amenable arenas for this unobtrusive approach to boundary crossing were the branches of CAM that relate to diet, lifestyle, relaxation techniques, and use of herbal or homeopathic products that can be obtained over the counter. The least amenable arenas for implementation of this approach were needle techniques of acupuncture as well as techniques that require special equipment and extra time with the patient. It is interesting that the physicians chose to continue working in sick fund clinics despite these difficulties and despite the need to struggle with organizational boundaries. Thus, they sought to continue practicing family medicine in the way they believed it should be practiced, as one doctor said, “to see the patient, and not only the illness.”</p>
<p>With regard to the social boundary between biomedicine and CAM, physicians who had shifted to a predominantly CAM practice frequently found themselves professionally and socially separated from or even stigmatized by conventional doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450326">Averbuch-Smetannikov, 2010</xref>). The physicians in the present study sought to practice in both worlds, maintaining biomedicine as their dominant identity. Although practicing integrative medicine, physicians in our study were careful to make it clear that they were physicians and not CAM practitioners.</p>
<p>Many of the physicians participating in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450326">Averbuch-Smetannikov’s (2010)</xref> study, who made a deliberate choice to maximize the CAM components of their identity, were isolated from the mainstream biomedical community. As such, their attempt to cross the boundary back into the mainstream professional community was rejected because of their open CAM identity. Most of the integrative doctors participating in the present study made a point of maintaining their social and professional ties with mainstream physicians, precisely because they wanted to prevent the social boundary between them from being closed.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings of this study provide insight into the boundary work of integrative physicians who have chosen to work in the primary care clinics of conventional health organizations. These physicians expanded the boundaries of their identity to include both CAM and biomedicine. In so doing, they disregarded the cognitive and epistemological boundaries that separate the two paradigms and they ignored or minimized the social boundaries that separate them from physicians who have been trained only in biomedicine. They encountered their main challenge in the attempt to recontour the organizational boundaries so that they could provide integrative care without compromising ethical values governing private practice in public settings.</p>
<p>The ease with which boundaries were crossed in the complex social context described here reflects the situation in postmodern societies. Indeed, the integrative physicians described in this study can be viewed as “postmodern” professionals who rejected the impermeability of many long-established boundaries and hierarchies. These doctors did not hesitate to cross boundaries frequently, with little discomfort or self-consciousness. It has been noted that postmodern professionals frequently cross boundaries for various reasons, such as making occupational changes, getting married, getting divorced, traveling, migrating, seeking a better job, improving their standard of living, and changing styles and tastes. Such change is ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450326">Bauman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450326">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312450326">Best &amp; Kellner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312450326">Lyotard, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312450326">Smith, 2000</xref>). Indeed, it is common for individuals to maintain multiple identities that, in some cases, are incompatible.</p>
<p>With regard to this fluid social context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450326">Giddens (1991)</xref> argued that informal social networks play a special role in providing security, predictability, and meaning to individuals who face situations of uncertainty and ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312450326">Simmel, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312450326">Snow, 2001</xref>). Our findings show how strongly and publicly the integrative physicians adhered to biomedicine as their “parent identity.” Apparently, they were aware of the dangers faced by professionals who cross boundaries, which include isolation, stigmatization, and exclusion from the mainstream community (Simmel). Their identity as physicians was the most powerful and prestigious of several identities available to them; thus, they actively sought to embrace it despite their explicit views of its many shortcomings. At the same time, many of them were imbued with remarkable zeal to promote the use of CAM alongside biomedicine within the conventional boundaries, in an effort to improve the overall quality of health care for the benefit of their patients.</p>
