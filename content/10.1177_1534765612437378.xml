<abstract>
<p>Research consistently shows that incarcerated juveniles and adults experience high levels of prior traumatic experiences and stressful life events. Yet there is a gap in the literature addressing incarcerated older adults’ life-course experiences of traumatic and stressful life events and their initial and current subjective interpretations of these events. Given that untreated trauma has been linked to decreased health and mental well-being, and recidivism, the current study attempts to address this gap. A secondary data analysis was conducted of the Risk and Resilience Study on older adults in prison. It used a cross-sectional correlation design from an anonymous self-report, self-administered survey of a sample of 667 incarcerated older adults with a mean age of 56.5 years. Cumulative trauma (objective and subjective) was measured using the Life Stressors Checklist-Revised (LSC-R). Up to 70% of participants reported at least one of 31 types of lifetime traumatic or stressful events occurring in childhood and/or adulthood. On average, they also reported higher degrees of current subjective distress about being a victim as opposed to a witness of violence or other stressful experiences. This study helps to break the cycle of silence of trauma and stress among older adults in prison. The complex trauma histories and resulting needs of older adults in prison are a significant public health challenge that must be addressed. Specialized trauma-informed assessment and intervention strategies that may work more effectively with this sensitive population, especially in the challenging prison environment, are discussed.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1534765612437378">
<title>Scope of the Problem</title>
<p>In 2007, of the approximately 1.6 million incarcerated adults, about 1 out of 10 (12%, <italic>n</italic> = 186,700) was aged 50 and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437378">Sabol &amp; Couture, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612437378">West &amp; Sabol, 2008</xref>). Adults aged 50 and older comprise the fastest-growing sector of the inmate population. In fact, this population is 5 times larger than it was in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612437378">Sabol &amp; Couture, 2008</xref>). Warehousing older adults in prison comes at an extremely high price. For instance, housing an adult older than 60 in prison costs the taxpayer approximately US$70,000 per year, which is 3 times more expensive than housing younger adults in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612437378">Kinsella, 2004</xref>). The correctional system, which was not designed to be a long-term care nursing facility, is unprepared to address the age-related physical and mental health needs of the aging prison population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612437378">Falter, 2006</xref>). Despite this exponential growth there is a dearth of information on the specialized needs of incarcerated older adults, particularly related to their trauma histories.</p>

<title>Trauma Among Offenders</title>
<p>Research has shown a high prevalence of trauma, such as being a victim of and/or witness to physical or sexual assault, in upwards of 93% of criminal offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612437378">Abram et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612437378">Harlow, 1999</xref>). In a nationally representative sample of approximately 984,000 state prisoners of all age groups, about 1 out of 5 reported being a victim of violence (i.e., physical and/or sexual assault) multiple times throughout the life course. Male prisoners reported being maltreated during childhood or adolescence at higher rates (i.e., aged 17 or younger) than during adulthood (14.4%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612437378">Harlow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612437378">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). Traumatic experiences such as these are significant because after experiencing a trauma, such as sexual assault, victims may have psychological reactions. This includes internal messages to continually prepare the self for defensive action, which creates the basis of developing disturbing physical and psychological (or subjective) symptoms associated with the traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612437378">Rothschild, 1998</xref>). This initial subjective response may have a lingering effect and can help explain why trauma that occurs in childhood may have later life psychological ramifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612437378">Shmotkin &amp; Litwin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Across all ages, offenders’ traumatic experiences can negatively affect their mental and physical health. However, the long-term psychological and emotional consequences may unfold differently across childhood, adulthood, and older adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612437378">Elder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612437378">Pearlin, Schieman, Fazio, &amp; Meersman, 2005</xref>). Upwards of 65% of offenders have documented mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612437378">Burton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612437378">Cauffman, Feldman, Waterman, &amp; Stiener, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612437378">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>), many of which could be a consequence of previous life-course traumas. In specific regard to older adult offenders, the findings that earlier traumatic experiences may have ongoing and cumulative mental health consequences into older adulthood, including psychiatric disorders, maladaptive stress responses, and revictimization, suggest that older adults in prison may be at increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612437378">Acierno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612437378">Gagnon &amp; Hersen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612437378">Stessman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of this prior research that has examined the correlation between traumatic experiences and criminal justice outcomes has been conducted on juveniles or adults under the age of 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612437378">Abram et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612437378">Widom, 1989</xref>), leaving out the growing incarcerated older adult population. Furthermore, there is not a significant amount of literature on the differences between younger and older cohorts in the prison population. However, one recent study suggests that although approximately 40% of both young and older adult prisoners reported exposure to violent victimization, the types of traumas that the different age groups reported differed. More particularly, young prisoners were significantly more likely to report witnessing physical assault, whereas older prisoners were significantly more likely to report witnessing a natural disaster, life-threatening illness, or the death of the loved one. These differences in the types of trauma experienced can influence how they are processed and the cumulative subjective distress that develops as a result. For instance, older prisoners may have a unique process as related to their younger counterparts, resulting in different subjective effects or levels of current distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612437378">Hiskey, Luckie, Davies, &amp; Brewin, 2008</xref>), an issue that needs further exploration. Furthermore, there are also no studies that compare incarcerated older adults to a community population, in regard to prevalence of trauma, subjective distress, or symptomology.</p>
<p>In summary, research consistently shows that incarcerated juveniles and adults experience high levels of prior traumatic experiences and stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612437378">Abram et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612437378">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>). However, there is a gap in the literature addressing incarcerated older adults’ life-course experiences of traumatic and stressful life events and their initial and current subjective interpretations of these events. The research community not only lacks information on the number and type of objective traumatic events incarcerated older adults have experienced but also lacks knowledge on how these past events continue to cause subjective distress for them in the present (within the past year). Based on this review, the following research questions were examined:</p>
<list id="list1-1534765612437378" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What do older adults in prisoner report about: (a) the types of lifetime traumatic and stressful life events experienced, (b) the age at which these events first occurred, (c) their subjective responses about these event at the time of these events, and (d) their current subjective impressions?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Research that describes the types of traumatic and stressful experiences and the lingering subjective impact is critical because untreated trauma has been linked to decreased health and mental well-being, along with higher recidivism rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612437378">Leach, Burgess, &amp; Holmwood, 2008</xref>). If left undetected and untreated, trauma survivors may continue to cycle through the criminal justice system with unmet mental health needs into older adulthood.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This study, which used a cross-sectional correlation design, was conducted in September 2010 in a Northeast state’s Department of Corrections (DOC) and consisted of 667 English-speaking prisoners (aged 50 and older). Of approximately 25,000 prisoners housed in the DOC in January 2010, approximately 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 000) were aged 50 and older. Information to create the sampling frame included the DOC administrative records data for State Bureau of Identification (SBI) number and age. The DOC generated the sampling frame for the study with a list of names so that invitations and anonymous surveys could be mailed to potential participants and return correspondence could be received.</p>
<p>A response rate of 45% was achieved. This estimate falls within the higher range of expected mail response rates, which are 20% to 40% for prison populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612437378">Hochstetler, Murphy, &amp; Simons, 2004</xref>). The project was part of the Hartford Geriatric Social Work Faculty Scholars program award, which is funded by the Gerontological Society of America and the John A. Hartford Foundation. The study was approved by the Fordham University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and met the standards for conducting research with a special population of older prisoners and on sensitive topics.</p>

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612437378">Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009</xref>) method for mailed surveys was used to maximize response rates for the anonymous self-administered survey. Specifically, potential participants received (a) a letter of invitation; (b) a packet with a cover letter, consent form, survey, and a self-addressed electronically stamped envelope (SASE) 7 days later; and (c) two thank you cards and reminders sent 7 days apart that included an enclosed self-addressed envelope for participants to request a survey replacement.</p>

<title>Constructs and Study Measures</title>
<p><italic>Traumatic and stressful life events</italic> were measured using the 31-item Life Stressors Checklist-Revised (LSC-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437378">McHugo et al., 2005</xref>). The LSC-R, which is a revised version of the Life Stressor Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612437378">Wolfe &amp; Kimerling, 1997</xref>), was used because it was developed for criminal justice populations. It estimates the frequency of lifetime and current traumatic events (being a victim of and/or witness to violence), which is consistent with <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders’</italic> (text rev.) Criterion A for posttrauma stress symptoms (<italic>DSM IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612437378">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). It also accounts for stressful life events, such as losing a loved one, physical health problems, divorce, and financial problems, among others. Although the LSC-R was revised for incarcerated women, for the purposes for this study it was slightly revised further for use with incarcerated older men. In particular, the question, “Have you ever had an abortion?,” was dropped from the survey. Furthermore, an item was added asking participants whether they experienced stress while in prison. Overall, the LSC-R has good psychometric properties, specifically for use with diverse age groups in the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437378">McHugo et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The LSC-R enables the measurement of “objective” cumulative trauma and stressful life events, which is defined in this study as whether or not one or more traumatic or stressful life events have occurred. Traumatic experiences are defined as those objective events that are consistent with <italic>DSM IV-TR</italic> Criterion A for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612437378">APA, 2000</xref>). Objective measures for stressful life events refer to life-course experiences, such as losing a loved one or a job, that tax the adaptive capacities of persons experiencing them but are generally not considered traumatic events. Participants had the option to endorse any of the 31 items as to whether or not each of these events occurred (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). A summative score was created for objective trauma and stressful life events by adding the 31 items.</p>
<p>The LSC-R also includes three items for participants’ “subjective” impressions of traumatic and stressful life events at the time of the event as well as current (or past year) subjective impressions. Participants were asked the following: “At the time of the event did you believe that you or someone else could be killed or seriously harmed?,” and “At the time of the event did you experience feelings of intense helplessness, fear, or horror?” Participants had the options to respond <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic> to both questions. Participants then were asked about their current subjective impression with the following question: “How much has this affected your life in the past year?” Each item was measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>extremely</italic>. A total score was calculated that added participants’ past year subjective ratings related to each of the 31 possible objective traumatic and stressful life events that were experienced during the life course.</p>
<p>Researchers have reported that the LSC-R has demonstrated good criterion-related validity for detecting traumatic and stressful life events among prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612437378">McHugo et al., 2005</xref>). For example, McHugo et al. collected data on 2,729 women, in which a test–retest sample was completed on a subset of 186 women who completed the measure approximately 7 days later. Kappa’s range averaged .70 for different items on the scale.</p>

<p>About 28% of participants reported having a mental health diagnosis, and close to three quarters reported a drug (43%) or alcohol problem (25%). Along the same lines, many reported being under the influence of drugs (43%) and alcohol (33%) at the time of their current offense. The majority had serious offenses, including violent (64%) and sex offenses (26%). Across the sample, the average time served was 132 months (or 11 years), with time served ranging from 3 months to 44 years. More than half of the participants are expecting to be released from prison within 1 year (37%) or 2 to 5 years (26%), and approximately 10% are expecting to be released within 6 to 10 years and 17% after 11 or more years.</p>
<p>As for family, about 24% of participants reported currently being married or partnered. Furthermore, most participants reported having children (80%), and more than half reported having grandchildren (62%). Of those who have children, 22% have children under the age of 18. Almost half of all participants reported having at least one other incarcerated family member (47%).</p>

<p>The mean total score on the LSC-R for the sample was 10.96 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.67). This indicates that a large majority of the participants (approximately 70%) have experienced a traumatic or stressful life experience. Moreover, many endorsed multiple traumatic experiences, highlighting that most of the prisoners did not experience a single traumatic or stressful life experience but rather many throughout their life course. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612437378">Table 2</xref> illustrates the multitude of traumatic and stressful life events that participants reported experiencing in their lives. About 62% reported witnessing a serious accident, and 52% reported witnessing a robbery, mugging, or attack. Following suit, the next most common traumatic experiences involved being in a serious accident (52%) or being a victim of a robbery, mugging, or attack (50%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534765612437378">Table 3</xref> also reveals that the most common stressful life events were the death of a loved one that was expected (70%), having a prior prison term (68%), and the unexpected death of someone close (60%).</p>

<title>Childhood beginnings</title>
<p>About half of the participants reported intimate violence first occurring in childhood. In particular, 48% of participants witnessed family violence before the age of 16, with a mean age onset of 9.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.9). The evidence also shows other significant childhood victimization experiences before the age of 16, including being physically attacked (34%), being inappropriately sexually touched (22%), being sexually assaulted (19%), and neglected (18%). The approximate mean age of when each of these experiences began for participants was between 9 and 10 years of age, except for neglect, which had an average onset age of 13.2.</p>

<title>Subjective Impact (Then and Now)</title>
<sec id="section14-1534765612437378">
<title>Subjective impact at time of event</title>
<p>Participants provided retrospective reports of their subjective impressions regarding whether they believed someone could get hurt or whether they felt horror at the time of the event (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612437378">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534765612437378">3</xref>). Depending on the type of traumatic event, between 50% and 95% of participants reported believing someone could get hurt at the time of the event. The experience of being in combat or war had the most frequent association with this belief (95%), followed by seeing a serious accident (85%), being in a serious accident, and being robbed, attacked, or mugged (80%). Furthermore, between 70% and 89% of participants also reported feeling horror at the time of the event. The experience that most frequently resulted in horror at the time was being a victim of kidnap, hostage, or torture (94%). However, the next most horrific experiences at the time for people were those childhood traumatic events that were discussed earlier, including being touched sexually or being physically attacked before the age of 16 (89%), witnessing violence before the age of 16 (88%), or being emotionally abused or neglected (85%).</p>
<p>For stressful life events, initial subjective impressions of horror or the belief that someone could get hurt at the time were less frequent with several exceptions. For example, the majority (88%) who reported living in a violent neighborhood believed that someone could get hurt. The majority also reported feeling horror about stressful experiences in prison (94%), learning about having a serious mental illness (85%) or physical illness (82%), and having a forced separation from their child (85%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534765612437378">
<title>Past year subjective impact</title>
<p>Despite the fact that events occurred on average more than 40 years prior, participants commonly reported some level of lingering subjective distress related to these traumatic or stressful events. The participants’ past year subjective impressions of “being affected” by each traumatic or stressful event are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612437378">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534765612437378">3</xref>.</p>
<p>Direct victimization appeared to have the strongest lingering subjective affect among the participants. In other words, participants on average reported higher subjective affect scores with experiences of direct victimization compared to indirect witnessing of events. For example, the majority (between 60% and 75%) reported being moderately to extremely affected within the past year by any one of the following direct victimization experiences: sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, being in war or combat, and being tortured or kidnapped. These data suggest that individuals who have traumatic experiences continue to carry a subjective interpretation of these events, including psychological distress about being affected by these events upwards of 40 years later.</p>
<p>In addition to traumatic events, participants reported numerous past and current stressful life events, which are generally considered “less severe” events, with a moderate to high degree of subjective distress associated with them. About 9 out of 10 participants (86%) reported moderate to extreme levels of being affected within the past year related to stress from prison. Along the same lines, 78% reported this distress related to forced separation from their child that occurred on average when participants were 34.9 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.1), which could have been due to a number of factors such as going to prison or child protection involvement. A discussion of these findings follows.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought to uncover the histories of traumatic and stressful life experiences among the incarcerated older adult population. It was found that a significant percentage, approximately 70% of incarcerated older adults in the sample, have a history of traumatic and stressful life experiences, with many of the events, such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect, beginning in their childhood. This study uses both objective and subjective measures of trauma to ascertain not only whether an event occurred but also the extent to which participants report its past and current subjective impact. The majority of participants reported that they believed someone could get hurt or that they felt horror at the time for one or more of the traumatic events. Interestingly, many participants also reported that many of the traumatic and stressful experiences that have occurred on average more than 40 years ago continue to negatively affect them, as high percentages of them reported being moderately to extremely affected by these childhood events within the past year. On average, they also reported higher degrees of current subjective distress about being a victim as opposed to being a witness of violence or other stressful experiences. Given the earlier discussion of the literature regarding the negative impact trauma has on mental and physical health, the finding that 85% felt horror at the time of learning about a mental illness and 82% felt horror at the time of learning about a physical illness was very interesting.</p>
<p>The theoretical frame proposed by trauma specialists such as van der kolk, McFarlane, and Weisaeth can help us better understand these findings. For instance, they explain that trauma in childhood can disrupt “normal” development, resulting in difficulties across the biopsychosocial spectrum, including psychical health, mental health, and social interactions. As a result, mental health disorders are not solely biological or captured by the diagnostic category assigned but are often the manifestation of one’s difficulty in processing and coping with adverse life experiences. Some of the maladaptive patterns that are seen after traumatic experiences are aggressive and self-destructive behaviors, resulting from difficulty with regulating affect and controlling impulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612437378">van der Kolk, McFarlane, &amp; Weisaeth, 1996</xref>). These patterns of behavior are imperative to consider in the discussion of offenders because affect regulation and impulse control are two major components that can lead to many illegal behaviors.</p>
<p>With regard to the older adult population, the theorists explain that traumatic experiences have long-term impact. As people age, they may experience diminished external and internal resources, which may intensify the impact of the earlier traumatic experiences, causing memories of the traumatic experiences to negatively take hold of their lives again in older adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612437378">van der Kolk et al., 1996</xref>). This can help us understand the significant current subjective distress among the participants related to earlier stressful and traumatic life experiences. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612437378">Lapp et al. (2011)</xref> provide a review of the literature on the interaction between trauma and aging, uncovering some major issues that must be considered when studying this population. More specifically, the trajectory of PTSD in the older adults is complicated by factors such as normal aging processes of cognitive decline, physical and chronic pain, increased stress levels potentially due to financial concerns and loss of loved ones. This unique trajectory in older adults, as opposed to their younger counterparts, must be considered when examining levels of distress and treatment options.</p>
<p>The current study extends the prior research by breaking the silence about the significant traumatic experiences of prisoners aged 50 and older, along with the past subjective impact and the lingering distressful impact such experiences have on them.</p>
<sec id="section17-1534765612437378">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>These findings have significance for assessment and intervention strategies with older adults in prison. More particularly, they highlight that a necessary shift must occur where this population begins to be viewed and understood from a multidisciplinary lens, in order for trauma-informed assessments and interventions to be developed. Although there is a push within juvenile agencies to adopt trauma services, energy is not being focused on comprehensive approaches in the adult correctional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612437378">Ko et al., 2008</xref>). A purely criminal justice research focus will not capture the biopsychosocial needs of incarcerated older adults given their significant trauma histories and resulting distress. The necessary change must involve social sciences, such as social work, gerontology, and psychology, along with government and community perspectives and involvement. The move toward this cross-disciplinary approach is hopeful given that Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) recently created a new initiative with a focus on trauma and justice for the years 2011 to 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612437378">SAMSHA, 2011</xref>). This initiative has the potential to bring government, criminal justice, and social sciences together when examining issues such as the effects of trauma on incarcerated older adults.</p>
<p>Since the findings reveal the high percentage of traumatic and stressful life experiences among older adult offenders, they support the need for trauma-informed assessment tools to be utilized during the intake process, which will allow for assignment to appropriate trauma-informed treatments. Eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) is an innovative treatment that is beginning to show promising results within the criminal justice system. EMDR allows for a reprocessing of stressful and traumatic experiences, resulting in significant reduction of subjective distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612437378">Shapiro, 2001</xref>). Moreover, previous research shows that EMDR works in reducing reactivity to traumatic memories, resulting in less violent behavior and conduct problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612437378">Kitchiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612437378">Soberman, Greenwald, &amp; Rule, 2002</xref>). If prisoners were provided access to this treatment while incarcerated, it is likely that they would have much less reactive responses when reentered into the community, which could potentially reduce recidivism rates. Moreover, those who receive treatment may also report the following: less subjective distress related to their traumatic experiences, feeling less triggered in the present, and a greater ability to shift their affect state to a more neutral or positive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612437378">Shapiro, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of other treatment options that also show promise in reducing subjective distress and symptomology based in trauma. Trauma-informed, cognitive-behavioral approaches are being used widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612437378">Zlotnick, Najavits, Rohsenow, &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>) with good results. In addition to standard approaches such as these, more holistic, innovative approaches should also be considered. For instance, there is recent evidence supporting a trauma treatment model that incorporates Western neuroscience and non-Western healing practices with international refugees and torture survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612437378">Mollica, 2006</xref>). This model focuses on a comprehensive view of the individual, including resilience, strengths, cultural sensitivity, fundamental needs, as well as fostering self-healing skills. Since this model has been effective in working with this difficult population, it might also show promise in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>In regard to the aging population, Lapp, and Cook and O’Donnell (2005) highlight that there are particular concerns that need to be taken into account when treating trauma, including cognitive impairment and other medical and cognitive issues. Although these are issues are relevant to the whole aging population, it may be likely that a history of trauma induces accelerated aging, resulting in even more attention needed to be given to these factors when considering treating this population (Lapp, 2011). Furthermore, as Owens et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612437378">Owens, Baker, Kasckow, Ciesla, &amp; Mohamed, 2005</xref>) explain, in an older adult veteran population, more somatic symptoms of PTSD are endorsed. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of treatment options, including exposure therapies, pharmacological approaches, and supportive talk therapies, with the older adult population experiencing PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612437378">Owens et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for a multidisciplinary approach is also necessary with regard to training of prison administration and staff. More specifically, it would greatly benefit the prison system, and prisoners themselves, if those in charge were aware of issues such as organizational trauma. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612437378">Bloom and Farragher (2010)</xref> explain, not only are the individuals traumatized but the institutions such as prisons are traumatized on an institutional and organizational level as well, making it difficult for productive change to occur. As a result, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to begin the work to reform the institutions, consequently allowing for the healing and progress of those receiving services within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612437378">Bloom &amp; Yanosy-Sreedhar, 2008</xref>). Bloom and Farragher outline the necessary steps for this change to occur. This knowledge, along with the five main principles of trauma-informed care, including safety, trustworthiness, collaboration, empowerment, and choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612437378">Fallot &amp; Harris, 2006</xref>), should help shape policy development within the criminal justice system, given the high prevalence of trauma in their population.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. First, since the participants were all English speakers, the findings are limited to English-speaking offenders. Using a mailed self-administered survey may be another limitation because of possible low response rates and possible limited literacy levels. However, prior research has used this technique with offenders and/or with sensitive topics. In regard to generalizability, the Northeastern DOC sample may not be representative of and generalizable to prisoners in other geographic locations. Furthermore, the study uses a cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to make causal inferences. Furthermore, the measurement tools utilized did not measure specific individual and clustered symptoms of PTSD and the relative severity. For example, the use of the item, “How much has this affected your life in the past year?,” may have questionable reliability due to the use of an anonymous self-administered survey method. It is not clear to what extent the participants clearly understood its meaning. These factors are a consideration for future research, which could potentially provide further objective knowledge about levels of distress. Despite limitations, this study has important implications and supports the use of a multidisciplinary approach to work with the specialized needs of older adults in the criminal justice system, especially those with trauma histories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534765612437378">
<title>Future Research Directions</title>
<p>Future studies should address some of these methodological limitations by gathering longitudinal data and using more diverse samples. Larger samples from different geographic regions would help obtain more representative and generalizable results. The use of multiple longitudinal data sources, rather than a cross-sectional design, will allow for more causal inferences to be made. Beyond these methodological changes, future studies also should examine age differences across the life span to examine for age and cohort differences, along with age differences among the criminal justice population and community populations. Furthermore, evaluation studies focusing on the effectiveness of different trauma measures with older adult offenders, in order to help identify reliable and valid measures for assessment use with this population, are necessary. Intervention and follow-up studies on the trauma-informed approaches noted above are also imperative. More specifically, the findings suggest theoretical implications, such that there appears to be an intersection between childhood traumatic and stressful life experiences and current distress among older adult offenders. Theoretically, it is possible that the cycle of trauma and resulting mental health ramifications intersect with the cycle of offending and recidivism. It can be argued that given the intensification of subjective distress in older adulthood related to earlier traumatic experiences, the cycle of recidivism into older age cannot be stopped unless the traumatic responses are treated. Uncovering the traumatic and stressful life experiences of these offenders is a necessary step in that change process. This theoretical implication should be addressed in future research studies. Finally, as Lapp (2011) suggests, longitudinal studies should address both the biological and cognitive changes that occur over time to more clearly understand how PTSD and age interact.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that the older adult prisoner population experiences substantial objective traumatic and stressful events during their lives. Moreover, many of these people are continually suffering with current distress resulting from old experiences. Since there is an obvious link between trauma and offending behavior, it is imperative that prison time be used wisely, involving trauma-informed assessment and treatment. Effectively treating the traumatic responses with a cross-disciplinary approach is necessary to ease the suffering of these individuals and slow the cycle of recidivism.</p>
