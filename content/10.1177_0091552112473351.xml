<p>We are not alone. This is the message of Kezar and Lester’s rich study of grassroots leaders in higher education. Although the isolated environment of many academics may lead to a sense that progressive leaders are few in number, Kezar and Lester reveal that grassroots activists can be found in many departments and institutions. These individuals, who often do not have formal authority, work from the bottom up, and pursue organizational changes that challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>Grassroots leaders are critical to the future of higher education, especially in public institutions, since the commitment of faculty and staff is one of the few resources institutions can potentially expand in this era of increasing financial austerity. But at the same time, the need for progressive leadership, at all levels of the organization, is undermined by the increasing tendency of administrations to move away from shared governance models. Because of this development, Kezar and Lester believe that increasing confrontations between faculty and administrations lie ahead. They suggest that cooperation between faculty and institutional administrations may be waning and that we may be entering a time of further unionization.</p>
<p>Kezar and Lester themselves are longtime activists on their campuses who have a lengthy history of grassroots leadership as well as publications that highlight what can be accomplished in the higher education framework. In this study they have collected and analyzed the experiences of dozens of progressive leaders in the faculty and staff ranks. They have also synthesized the wide-ranging literature on leading change without the benefit of formal authority in the organization. Yet for all the optimism that can be generated by success stories, they paint a grim picture of the overall dynamics of campus politics in the age of academic capitalism and new managerialism.</p>
<p>This book is rich because it starts from the perspective that leadership is about change, not maintaining the status quo. This perspective is supported in Part 1 of the book by a review of the literature on leadership in organizations without official position or authority, on community-based grassroots leadership in social movements, and on the obstacles faced by grassroots leaders and the motivations that drive them. These literatures serve as the foundation for examining several case studies. These case studies focus on and concern a range of higher education institutions. These institutions range from a major research university to a regional public university to a polytechnic college, a small liberal arts college, and a community college.</p>
<p>The book is also strengthened by the authors’ application of the tempered radicals framework developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112473351">Meyerson (2003)</xref>. Tempered radicals are activists who essentially “work within the system” to achieve change, as compared to those who use more confrontational strategy and tactics. Of course, any institutional context will probably include a mix of ideas about how to achieve change. But, Kezar and Lester argue that the tempered radical approach, focusing on educational strategy and tactics, is most appropriate to the world of higher education. Their case studies highlight issues such as the need to advance family-friendly policies, the development of sustainability curriculum, and the strengthening of programs that assist students and faculty of color.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of the book, the authors introduce us to several grassroots leaders and the reader is provided with a personal and almost intimate account of how these leaders worked to advance their objectives. Some of these leaders were faculty; some were staff in student affairs or elsewhere. While most of the leaders achieved at least some measure of success, each had to navigate a variety of obstacles, resistance, and personal turmoil in the process. We see how in different ways, each adopted his or her approach and struggled to stay resilient.</p>
<p>In Part 3, Kezar and Lester discuss the lessons we should take away from these cases. They identify strategies and tactics that seem more successful and those that seem less so. Every instance holds lessons for current and future grassroots leaders. They highlight the mixed impact on grassroots efforts of the increasing corporatization of higher education. In some cases grassroots leaders are stymied by the focus on the financial bottom line, and in other cases they are able to take advantage of it. They address the issue of power inside institutions and how grassroots leaders address it. They also note the mixed record of bottom-up change efforts which attempt to converge with top leadership. Often, the agenda of convergence is controlled from the top, and the grassroots agenda gets dissipated.</p>
<p>One aspect of creating change within higher education that needs more attention than it gets here, though, is the complexity of the relationship between larger social movements and on-campus change efforts. There is a larger forest in which the trees discussed in the book exist. In general, it has been broader social movements that have had the greatest impact on higher education—from the outside in. The last major instance of how social movements dramatically changed higher education was the San Francisco State Student Strike of 1968, which led to the widespread creation of ethnic studies programs all over the country. In that case, as with the DREAM Act movement today—change was driven by students of color. An important next step in this type of research would be to extend the analysis of power conditions by integrating social movement theory and practice with the analysis of institutional dynamics in higher education.</p>
<p>Having studied a variety of higher educational institutions (including one community college), the authors contend there were no significant differences among institutional types concerning the kinds of issues that developed, the types of strategies and tactics adopted by the grassroots leaders, or the obstacles they encountered. Indeed, as a community college activist myself, I could identify with many of the scenarios in other institutions discussed by the authors as well as the setting discussed in the community college case study. But, to fully appreciate how the lenses and themes illuminated in this book manifest themselves in community colleges, a more focused study would be needed.</p>
<p>These are some of the issues that could be examined in such a focused study of community colleges:</p>
<list id="list1-0091552112473351" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Community colleges have a different history of governance, drawn more from the strong-principal high school system than the classic faculty-driven governance mode of universities. Are community colleges still that traditional bureaucracy in the higher education literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112473351">Birnbaum, 1988</xref>), or more like a network organization with many centers and the potential for bottom-up leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112473351">Levin, Kater, &amp; Wagoner 2006</xref>). Or does the contemporary community college have features of both models? What are the implications of that for grassroots activism?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Community college faculty focus mainly on students and teaching and learning, not research and publishing. How does this affect their outlook on grassroots change efforts? At the same time, many faculty in community colleges are tasked with providing training for future or current employees along the lines desired by businesses and state accrediting agencies. What are the implications of this particular form of academic capitalism for grassroots activists?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the impact of distance learning and other instructional technologies on the learning environment and faculty work? How do these factors affect grassroots leadership at the community college? You can’t study community colleges and not study this.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the large and growing proportion of contingent community college faculty affect and respond to grassroots efforts?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does a belief in the community college commitment to open access and the comprehensive mission motivate community college staff and faculty in ways that are significantly different from how university professors are motivated by a mission of research, teaching, and service?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Community colleges serve a large portion of students from communities of color. What impact does this have on activism in community colleges, especially because in analyzing struggles around issues of diversity and multiculturalism it becomes difficult to separate larger social movements from on-campus movements, both in regards to the impetus toward change and the forces of resistance?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The authors suggest a time of increasing unionization among faculty and staff may be ahead. Community colleges are already more unionized than the rest of higher education, so they would be a critical place to study this assertion. Is unionization increasing, and what role does unionization play in grassroots activism?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For this reader, the book’s greatest strength is its unambiguous and well-justified assertion that grassroots leadership in higher education is worthy of serious study. The stakes are high and the issues are complex. This form of leadership is not the same as bottom-up leadership in other kinds of organizations, but on the other hand not totally different. Higher education institutions are different than other organizations, but subject to the same powerful external social, political, and economic forces. In higher education, the efforts and collaboration of both faculty and staff are needed for lasting change, which brings up complicated issues of professionalism and unequal power among potential allies.</p>
<p>Kezar and Lester put a bright light on the motivations of grassroots leaders and on the considerable obstacles they face. Grassroots activists in every college and university can find themselves and their struggles in this book. Accordingly, the book serves as a sharing mechanism and will assure even the most beleaguered grassroots leaders that we are not alone.</p>
