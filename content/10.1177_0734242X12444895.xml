<abstract>
<p>Even in developing countries, the amount of containers and packaging waste are increasing in line with population concentration and lifestyle changes in urban areas. This can cause serious problems for the disposal of municipal solid waste. Through a physical composition analysis of household waste in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, this study aimed to identify the contribution made by junk buyers to recycling. Interviews on the handling of recyclable waste by households were conducted. About 232 kg of recyclable waste was sampled from a total of 115 households, and about 230 kg of municipal solid waste was sampled from a total of 101 households and sorted into 69 categories for measurement by volume and weight. The interview survey revealed that a high proportion of households tended to routinely store recyclable waste for sale or donation to junk buyers. Junk buyers accounted for 8.8% of recycling by weight or 26.0% by volume according to the results of the physical composition analysis. In addition, the results suggested that containers and packaging waste accounted for the largest proportion of household waste by volume. Junk buyers recycled 25.5% by weight of containers and packaging waste. In the formulation of new plans for municipal solid waste management to improve the current situation and handle future challenges, the role of the informal sector should be monitored carefully and reliable data on recyclable waste should be collected continuously.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Containers and packaging waste are of major concern in developed countries. In Japan, containers and packaging waste account for about 60% of municipal solid waste (MSW). The Containers and Packaging Law was enacted in Japan in 1995 to deal with the problem and to promote efficient use of recycled containers and packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12444895">Ministry of the Environment of Japan, 2008</xref>). Even in developing countries, the amount of containers and packaging waste is increasing in line with population concentration and lifestyle; this could cause serious problems for disposal of MSW. Most municipalities in developing countries depend on landfilling or open dumping in areas poorly equipped for MSW management and because of financial constraints and objections from residents it is difficult to secure new sites for waste disposal. Because containers and packaging wastes are bulky and often barely decompose, their disposal can shorten the lifetimes of landfills and open dumping sites. In developing countries, the informal sector currently collects recyclable waste (RW), including containers and packaging waste, as a means of income; fortunately, this reduces the amounts of MSW disposed of in landfills and open dumps.</p>
<p>The informal sector, which is not subject to municipal control, has greatly contributed to the recovery of RW in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12444895">Narayana 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12444895">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, junk buyers, also known as an ‘itinerant waste buyers’ or ‘waste buyers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12444895">Ojeda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12444895">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), have made an outstanding contribution to the recovery of RW from sources such as households in Hanoi, Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12444895">Mitchell, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12444895">Wilson et al. (2009)</xref> summarized the contributions of different groups in several cities in developing countries to recycling, but they pointed out that quantitative data on recycling rates were scarce or unreliable.</p>
<p>An analysis of the physical composition of household waste (HW) to clarify the proportion that is recovered as RW and the proportion that is disposed of as MSW would help in quantifying the contribution of junk buyers to recycling. To date, several studies have revealed the physical composition of MSW disposed of and collected by urban environment companies (URENCOs) in urban areas of Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12444895">Byer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12444895">Ishigaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12444895">JICA, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12444895">World Bank et al., 2004</xref>, ) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12444895">Table 1</xref>). The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in particular, with its vast experience in analysing the physical composition of MSW in developing countries all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12444895">JICA, 2004</xref>), has helped to enhance the accuracy of data on the physical composition of MSW generated in urban areas of Vietnam. However, none of the studies have focused on the physical composition of RW recovered by junk buyers in urban areas of Vietnam as it has been difficult to collect data related to RW or the informal sector, as is the case in other developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12444895">UN-HABITAT, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to identify, through a physical composition analysis of HW in an urban district of Hanoi, the contributions made by junk buyers to recycling. First, an interview survey was conducted to clarify household behavioural trends in the handling (sale, donation, reuse or disposal) of RW. Then the rates of recycling by junk buyers by weight and volume were identified from the results of a physical composition analysis of HW, in which RW and MSW from households were sampled separately, and sorted and weighed. In addition, the characteristics of RW and MSW in detailed categories are discussed, focusing on paper, plastic, glass and metal wastes.</p>

<title>Definition of RW and MSW in this study</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12444895">Wilson et al. (2006)</xref> identified at least four main sources of informal waste recycling that can be applied to the recovery of RW in Hanoi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12444895">Figure 1</xref>). Firstly, junk buyers visit RW sources (mainly households) and recover the RW. Secondly, waste pickers pick up RW from pavements or from temporary dump sites that has been disposed of mixed with MSW from various sources (such as households, restaurants, shops and hotels). Thirdly, MSW collection workers from Hanoi URENCO recover RW that has been disposed of at sources where it is mixed with MSW; the waste is placed onto handcarts belonging to Hanoi URENCO. Fourthly, waste pickers at landfill sites and workers at composting sites recover RW that has been disposed of at sources where it is mixed with MSW and is transported to landfills and composting sites. Hereafter, RW in this study is defined as materials that are recovered at households by junk buyers and MSW is defined as materials that are discharged from households and disposed of on handcarts or pavements. HW is defined as the total of RW and MSW.</p>

<title>Survey of RW handling behaviour among households</title>
<p>To clarify the behavioural trends of households in handling RW, members of 115 selected households composed of a total of 479 residents in Hanoi were interviewed. On the basis of discussions with Hanoi URENCO and community leaders, the households were selected on a random basis from three wards containing typical Vietnamese households in the Cau Giay district of Hanoi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12444895">Figure 2</xref>). Householders were asked whether they usually ‘sell’, ‘donate’, ‘reuse’ or ‘dispose of’ RW (paper, plastic, glass and metal waste). Because it was conceivable for households to dispose of a small amount of RW but also sometimes to sell it when they had accumulated a sufficient amount, multiple answers were allowed in this interview in order to reflect actual conditions.</p>

<title>Methods of sampling RW and MSW</title>
<p>For the physical composition analysis of HW, efforts were made to sample HW from at least 100 households to obtain reliable data. About 230 kg of MSW was sampled in March 2006 from a total of 101 households containing a total of 418 residents. Moreover, about 232 kg of RW was sampled in June 2006 from a total of 115 households; these were the same households of 479 residents used in the interview survey of RW handling behaviour. Most of the households in this second group were the same ones as those used for the MSW sampling. The sampled RW accounted for 0.27% of the population of Cau Giay district (175,800) or 0.02% of the urban population of Hanoi (2,022,700) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12444895">Hanoi Statistical Office 2005</xref>). The physical composition of waste (especially food waste) was expected to change with the seasons, but our comparison between MSW and RW sampled in different seasons was, nevertheless, assumed to be valid. When RW and MSW were sampled to quantify the waste generated per person per day, information on the latest date on which the waste had been disposed of was obtained.</p>
<p>To collect RW samples, a 30-litre plastic bag coded with a number identifying the household was distributed to each household for their RW. Households were asked not to sell or donate their RW during this study. Each household’s RW, which would normally have been donated or sold, was stored in the designated plastic bags at the household for seven consecutive days, after which the stored RW was collected. Generally, the citizens of Hanoi are well aware, through communication with junk buyers, of what types of waste collectors will buy. Although most of the RW sampled in this study was, indeed, saleable in Hanoi in 2006, some was not. These unsalable samples were regarded as MSW for the purposes of data calculation. Examples included paper beverage cartons, plastic expandable polystyrene (EPS) trays and broken ceramics.</p>
<p>For the collection of MSW samples, five 30-litre plastic bags coded with numbers identifying the household were distributed to each household. Households disposed of their MSW every day for five consecutive days by placing it in the designated plastic bags. MSW samples were collected on one of the five days. To avoid any deliberate changes in quantity and quality and to ensure that the sample was representative of the MSW normally disposed of, households were not told which of the five days would be the sample collection day. The MSW was collected by MSW collection workers from Hanoi URENCO, as normal, on the other four days.</p>

<sec id="section6-0734242X12444895">
<title>Sorting and measuring RW and MSW</title>
<p>To minimise error resulting from the effects of rain or sunlight on the net weight of the waste, collected RW and MSW samples were immediately transported to the roofed area at the Cau Dien Composting Site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12444895">Figure 2</xref>) for sorting in cooperation with Hanoi URENCO. A two-step method was used to sort the samples. ly, the samples were sorted into 12 primary categories: paper, plastic, glass, metal, rubber, leather, food, textiles, plants/garden, wood, ceramics and other waste. Secondly, the samples were sorted further into 69 secondary categories with a focus on application just before recovery or disposal (i.e. containers and packaging, products and other waste), according to the 89 categories shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12444895">Table 2</xref> (20 of the categories were not found in this study).</p>

<p>To sort compound samples the sample was sorted in accordance with the label, if a label was attached indicating the content of the material (paper, plastic, metal, etc.). If a label was not attached, the sample was sorted in accordance with the weights of the components by proportion. For example, a pill packet composed of plastic and metal was sorted as a metal material, because the metal proportion was heavier. In order to input the data and calculate weight and volume quickly and easily, each secondary category had a code number. After all samples of RW and MSW had been sorted into secondary categories, they were weighed with a waterproof digital scale (HV-15KGL, A&amp;D Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with a minimum reading of 1 g. In addition to weight, the volume (an important indicator used for estimating rates of consumption at landfills and open dumping sites) was measured with the addition of 5 kg m<sup>–2</sup> of pressure to the sorted samples. Waste in plastic bags is normally under a pressure of approximately 5 kg m<sup>-2</sup> when discharged from households (personal communication). Adding pressure to the sorted samples therefore restored the status quo.</p>

<title>RW handling behaviour among households</title>
<p>The results of the interview survey of household RW-handling behaviour suggested that a high proportion of households tended to store RW routinely for sale or donation to junk buyers. The interviews of 115 households revealed that the following approximate proportions were sold or donated: 78% of paper waste, 76% of plastic waste, 63% of glass waste and 87% of metal waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12444895">Figure 3</xref>). The much higher transaction prices for metal waste than for the other types of waste presumably drove up the proportion of households that usually stored metal waste for sale or donation. About 7% of households reused paper waste (e.g. use of newspaper for wrapping food scraps or placing underneath deep-fried food) and 6% reused glass waste. Glass waste was the RW that was most commonly disposed of.</p>

<title>Rates of recycling by junk buyers</title>
<p>The results of the physical composition analysis of HW in the Cau Giay district showed that 58 g or 1.3 L of RW was recovered per person per day and 594 g or 3.6 L of MSW was disposed of per person per day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12444895">Table 3</xref>). In other words, 8.8% by weight or 26.0% by volume of recycling was achieved by junk buyers. Moreover, junk buyers recycled 28.7% by weight or 39.3% by volume of paper, plastic, glass and metal wastes combined. The higher rates by volume than by weight suggest that junk buyers recovered relatively bulky waste (i.e. containers and packaging waste). Food, textile, plant/garden, wood and ceramic wastes were not recovered as RW. Although food waste was, in general, disposed of as MSW in this study, if a substantial amount was to be collected at the same place (e.g. at restaurants, hotels and housing complexes) it could be sold for foodstuff. It should be remembered that potential RW mixed in with MSW could be picked up by waste pickers on the pavements and from temporary dump sites or by MSW collection workers from Hanoi URENCO. In other words, it is possible that the value of 594 g of MSW per person per day does not correspond exactly to the actual amount of material transported to Hanoi’s landfill site.</p>

<title>Proportions of RW and MSW by application before recovery or disposal</title>
<p>The results of the physical composition analysis of HW revealed that junk buyers recycled 25.5% by weight of containers and packaging waste (30 g of a total of 119 g of HW) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12444895">Table 4</xref>). Junk buyers actively recovered containers and packaging waste, which accounted for 52.6% of RW by weight or 78.4% by volume. Although containers and packaging waste that were mixed in with MSW accounted for only 14.9% by weight—much lower than the proportion of product waste—they accounted for 44.0% by volume, higher than the volumetric proportion of product waste (41.8%). The results of the physical composition analysis suggest that containers and packaging waste account for the largest portion of HW by volume. This means that the formal sector is already having to deal with large amounts of containers and packaging waste, despite the energetic recycling activities of junk buyers.</p>

<title>Characteristics of RW and MSW in detailed categories</title>
<p>Although junk buyers contribute greatly to the recovery of containers and packaging waste, the information revealed here on the characteristics of RW and MSW in detailed categories indicates, undoubtedly, that, to some degree, junk buyers are constrained in regard to the recovery of recyclable waste. Some households reuse some items but then have to eventually dispose of them because they become dirty and are no longer saleable; however, overall this activity of reusing waste can help to minimise overconsumption of products. For some potential RW, there is little demand for recycling because no recycling infrastructure has been established.</p>
<p>All books were recovered as RW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12444895">Figure 4</xref>). A large proportion of corrugated cardboard that was clean (but bulky) was recovered as RW, but corrugated cardboard that was dirty and shredded into small pieces was disposed of as MSW. Most newspapers that had been shredded into small pieces were also disposed of as MSW. About 53% of paper bags were not recovered because of the difficulty in separating the attached plastic film from the paper materials. If sufficient amounts of tubes, such as toilet paper cores, were accumulated by households, then they could be sold to the informal sector, but most households simply disposed of them. As the largest detailed category of paper waste, nappies and sanitary napkins, at 22 g of per person per day, were all disposed of as MSW (although there was some doubt as to whether the entire content was paper). Similarly, other unsanitary paper consumables such as paper tissues were not recovered but instead disposed of as MSW. Paper beverage cartons with aluminium linings could not be sold for recycling.</p>

<p>Beverages in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are broadly distributed in shops and supermarkets in Vietnam, and large numbers of PET bottles are generated as waste. Regardless of whether they were PET or non-PET, most plastic bottles were recovered as RW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12444895">Figure 5</xref>). Food packages, which often have aluminium evaporation coatings, could not be collected for recycling. Plastic bags comprised the largest amount of plastic in HW (27.1 g per person per day). Although they can be saleable, the informal sector in Hanoi tend not to buy them in small amounts. Because of their very light weight it would take a long time to accumulate sufficient amounts to sell. Most households therefore simply discarded them as MSW. Generally, EPS trays and buffer materials were not collected as RW because of their light weight; only clean, large amounts of EPS would be saleable.</p>

<p>Evaluation of glass waste revealed that only 14.0% of beverage bottles were recovered as RW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12444895">Figure 6</xref>). In Vietnam, new, locally-produced bottles (e.g. beer bottles) can be collected for washing, refilling and redistribution, but once bottles are cracked or damaged they need to be disposed of as MSW, because no system for recycling cracked or damaged glass has yet been established—at least in northern Vietnam. Because there are no systems for reusing imported bottles (e.g. wine bottles), unlike the reuse of beer bottles distributed in Vietnam, imported bottles are not recovered owing to a lack of a glass recycling system.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the interview survey revealed that a high proportion of households tended to routinely store RW for sale or donation to junk buyers. Junk buyers were responsible for the recycling of 8.8% of HW by weight or 26.0% by volume; without the junk buyers, these materials would likely have been disposed of in landfills. The results of the physical composition analysis suggested that containers and packaging waste accounted for the largest portion of HW by volume. Junk buyers recycled 25.5% by weight of containers and packaging waste.</p>
<p>The sample size in our physical composition analysis was fairly small. To ensure the reliability of our data, the sample size will need to be increased in future analyses. Moreover, in light of the rapid lifestyle changes occurring because of economic growth in Vietnam, the current quality and quantity of HW may now be different from those at the time of this study in 2006.</p>
<p>The amount of used containers and packaging waste is expected to increase in the near future in association with the country’s economic growth and lifestyle changes. If the informal sector ceases its collection activity, Hanoi URENCO will have to deal with the consequent increase in MSW. As part of the formulation of new plans for MSW management to improve the current situation and handle future challenges, the role of the informal sector should be monitored carefully and reliable data on RW in Hanoi should be collected continuously. This recommendation is just as valid for other municipalities in developing countries.</p>
