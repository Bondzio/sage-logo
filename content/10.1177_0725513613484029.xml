<p>At the close of his ‘Parting Words’ on the occasion of the 2004 suspension of the journal <italic>La Rivista del Manifesto </italic>(translated in <italic>New Left Review</italic> 31, Jan–Feb 2005, p. 105), Lucio Magri announced the need for ‘a differentiated analysis, a counterfactual history of the communist tradition and its overcoming’. Doubtful at the time that he had the ability or strength for such a task, Magri nevertheless suggested that he ‘would not want to free [himself] … from that burden’ and that, at the least, it would promise ‘excellent mental gymnastics’.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Tailor of Ulm</italic> sees Magri taking up this task, and while the subtitle might be somewhat misleading – it is more a history of post-War Italian PCI communism than of communism more widely in the Twentieth Century – it’s a compelling read, even, I think, for those not inclined towards Magri’s particular variety of Marxist commitment. It may be that the scope of the work is more circumscribed than its title suggests, but there <italic>are</italic> sparkling, condensed but nuanced segments that consider socialism more broadly, and, in any case, the Italian socialist scene is so very fascinating and peculiar that the book is of significant interest.</p>
<p>The title is drawn from a Brecht poem, referred to at a meeting in 1989 to consider a name change for the PCI. In making the reference, Pietro Ingrao attempted to link the apparent failure of communism with the tailor’s failed attempt to fly – human beings did, in the end, manage to fly. As Magri glosses it, if capitalist modernity’s path was far from a story of linear, smooth progress, why should communism’s path be otherwise? Magri’s determination to boldly and clear-headedly face both the good and the bad, as well as the many unrealized possibilities, though, are clear in two further questions he, in turn, responded with at the meeting in question: if the tailor had not been killed would he have got up and tried again, and would/should his friends have attempted to stop him?; and what contribution did the tailor, in fact, make to the finally successful efforts to fly?</p>
<p>Magri, as I have indicated, is unwavering on the need to confront all questions, no matter how difficult – as he says what has been left out and ignored is just important, in a person’s life and more widely, as what is faced and accomplished (p. 188). And the book is full of probing analyses, frequently operating by way of counterfactual thinking – his constant refrain, could it have been otherwise? – developing a smooth and uncluttered narrative, often apparently reliant on his own recollections (I am ‘a living private archive’ (p. 17), he says), older and newer documents, and the memories of those involved, all woven together by a careful and somewhat sombre voice. This austerity, a still vibrant but pessimistic intellect, is at work throughout – a dedication to writing in a ‘spirit of truth’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>Setting out in Chapter 1 with a sweep over the early phase of the consolidation of capitalism and the socialist movement, we arrive at a first major question, the meaning of the Russian Revolution. Hostile to the contemporary consignment of communism to the category of ‘calamity’, a mere ‘heap of ashes’ (p. 382), Magri’s accounting for the weakening of the soviets, restrictions on liberty, etc. in the time of Lenin has a familiar ring to it – civil war and foreign intervention, the failure of revolution in the West – though he does note three fundamental errors made by Lenin: the obsession with the ‘correct line’ within the Third International (a particularly relevant issue for the PCI); the decision to go for rapid industrialization, and for collectivization in the countryside; and the decision to portray centrism as the major enemy within the workers’ movement.</p>
<p>Trenchantly noting the role of communism in the spread of democracy, the appeasement of the Nazis in the hope of turning Germany eastwards, and underscoring the central role of the communists in the defeat of fascism (‘Communists did not create a river of blood, they shed their own’; p. 36), the terror of the 1930s is, to my mind, very lightly treated (a voluntarist and subjectivist distortion). There is more than a glimpse, here, of a defensive and less than brutally self-critical cast of mind, apparent at various points in the book – for instance, in Magri’s refusal to ‘demonize’ Stalin’s ‘whole record’, finding the last five years the worst (p. 79). This is a thorny issue. Magri, born in 1932, entered the party after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, was expelled in 1970 for attempting to respond creatively to the contestations of the ’60s, rejoining as part of the PCI leadership in 1984, and fighting to the last against the decision to disband ‘an army that had not yet dispersed’ (p. 16). This remaining attachment to the Soviet Union limits certain reflections. A good part of this seems an effect of the ‘Gramsci genome’, the desire to be with the masses in a significant party rather than a small sect, the determination that Italy would make its own particular road to socialism, between Leninism and classical social democracy. Here, despite the ups and downs, Magri’s narrative reinforces throughout his early insistence that the PCI was something else than either a merely social democratic force or an unoriginal, simple echo or puppet of the USSR.</p>
<p>It is certainly not the case that there is any lack of rewards for readers from Magri’s stance here. We get a close, intelligent insider’s view on the various important periods in the life of the PCI: from the central moment of Togliatti’s return to Italy in 1944, to the brink of World War III (driven exclusively by the West, in Magri’s firm estimation), to the response to the secret speech, Poland and Hungary, and the China–USSR split. Here, Magri’s counterfactual approach is often fascinating, deeply informed, and remarkably concrete: for example, what room may Togliatti have had to move in a more positively socialist direction in the delicate period 1945–8? How else might the PCI have ‘manned the barricades’ in the wake of the Hungarian events, so as not to simply support the Soviet invasion? What was lost in Khrushchev’s insistence on capitalism versus socialism as a question of economic results rather than on socialism as another sort of society?</p>
<p>This intelligence is bolstered by Magri’s fluency with and attention to the transformations taking place in Italy and more widely, and this is perhaps most evident in his commentary on the 1960s and ’70s – real turning points for a party that was by then mature and equipped with impressive electoral support, a very large, active membership, and a genuine cultural presence, but whose decline can be traced from that point, too. First, Magri is very interesting on Italy’s ‘economic miracle’ – based upon an idiosyncratic mixed economy, a quick Fordist burst and its extension to new sectors and forms of production and consumption, issuing in a comeback for the large industrial and financial capitalist class, and, very importantly and temporarily, predicated early-on upon a labour surplus and very low wages.</p>
<p>That miracle was soon followed by an impressive labour revival and a robust student revolt. It is here that Magri finds the PCI particularly disappointing, showing itself to be bereft of ‘ideas, inspiration and energy’ (p. 223), unable, in the face of both trade union combativeness and the emergence of new struggles, to take up a leading role parallel to the one it had played in the Resistance. One of the issues here is that a situation of relative, and perhaps surprising, openness and toleration of dissent within the PCI gives way, under the weight of the urgent new questions – the party’s ‘protected democracy’ (p. 185) not up to the task of responding to these necessary rethinkings. The purge of the <italic>Il Manifesto</italic> group, of which Magri was a member, is one instance of this, when such questioning could have genuinely contributed to PCI reinvigoration and perhaps answered, in part, the problem of its growing inability to attract young people into its ranks. Importantly, Magri also finds Togliatti’s death in 1964 particularly untimely, at a point at which the latter was attempting some important rethinking (the need for an accommodation between China and the Soviet Union, a deeper reading of Gramsci, a nuanced response to the Catholic question).</p>
<p>These opportunities slipping away, the 1970s see obstacles to capitalist restructuring cleared, a new international political climate created, and a new neo-liberal capitalist phase becoming visible (globalization, technological changes, alterations in class composition), alongside Berlinguer’s disastrous ‘historic compromise’, where the PCI ended up ‘legitimating the quasi-monarchical right of the DC to govern the country’ (p. 272). Italy’s resulting ‘downward miracle’ is followed by the ’80s, designated ‘fateful’ – although Magri insists the PCI were not, at this point, a spent force.</p>
<p>The final chapter deals with the end of the PCI. Here, one expects more detailed reflection on the possibility of a different road, a new communist-inspired movement that might have emerged, or that might still appear, as a response to the many contemporary challenges underscored with such skill and sceptical foreboding in the introduction (‘The outlook [ahead] is not auspicious’; p. 8). This was not to be. As Magri notes briefly but movingly, the period between the completion of the previous chapter and the return to this one was marked by the death of his wife, Mara Caltagirone, which ‘feels like an amputation that will never heal, making my mind opaque and my will sluggish’ (p. 368). Promising her he would complete the book, Magri draws things fairly abruptly to a close, appending a text he had written in 1987 as some indication of an answer to the problem of communist futures. In November 2011, his promise to his wife fulfilled, Lucio Magri chose an assisted suicide in Switzerland. Despite this sad finale, which leaves those questions of other roads into the future unanswered, the book as a whole delivers a searching, intelligent reminder of the best of that disappearing communist generation and, I think, indeed shows the importance and fertility of re-opening the critical debate about communism.</p>
