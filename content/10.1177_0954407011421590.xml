<abstract>
<p>Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) engines are considered to be a clean energy source. The fuel supply strategy for this type of engine is moving away from a mixer-type fuel supply and towards an LPLI (liquid phase LPG injection) system, which injects liquid phase LPG directly into the manifold, enhancing volumetric efficiency, giving a faster response, and providing more precise fuel control. The LPLI system requires a new development to meet more stringent emissions regulations than previous regulations. This new development is motivated by the tendency of LPG in an LPLI system to leak out of the injector after the engine is shut off. Installing a shut-off valve directly after the injector is one possible strategy for preventing this leakage. To install the shut-off valve in the injector, it is necessary to change its structure. In a prototype of the shut-off valve type injector, the fuel path inside the adapter becomes longer and more complicated than in a conventional LPLI injector, which may cause icing at the injector tip. Because LPG absorbs heat for evaporation when it is injected into the manifold, the temperature of the injector tips is decreased to a temperature even below freezing. Water vapour in the intake air passing the cold injector can form ice that sticks on the surface of the injector. This phenomenon is called icing and can become disruptive to precise air/fuel control as ice particles fall off and enter the cylinder. Using injection visualization, emissions analysis, and data on engine running conditions, these icing phenomena are classified into two types: one at the cold adapter surface and the other at the LPG transfer tube (a Teflon tube) tip, which is placed in the centre of the injector adapters. The icing phenomena in shut-off valve type LPLI injectors are significantly reduced by enhancing heat transfer between the cold injector tip and the hot intake manifold, and by surrounding the injecting tip with a shroud.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>In the light of increasing environmental issues, many countries are strictly enforcing regulation laws regarding the disposal of harmful contents from vehicles, and regulation standards are expected to increase over time. To cope with regulation enforcement, technologies using clean fuel to reduce harmful gas emissions are being widely applied in the automotive field because clean fuel has a high adaptability with conventional vehicles. Studies of alternative fuels for spark-ignited combustion engines have been published in a number of papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011421590">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011421590">4</xref>]. In particular, the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is gradually increasing because of its low cost and low emissions of harmful contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011421590">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), the main component of LPG, has a higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio than gasoline, which is the reason for its low emissions. The first LPG supply system utilized a vaporizer-type mixer. However, due to negative properties, such as irregular mixing of air and fuel, backflow, and decreased volumetric efficiency caused by the use of a gaseous fuel and mixer, liquid phase LPG injection (LPLI) is increasingly replacing the conventional system. The LPLI technology is essential to obtain lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while maintaining a higher engine performance because the LPG fuel in this system does not occupy a significant amount of volume in the intake system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011421590">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011421590">8</xref>]. The LPLI system is easily controlled because liquid LPG is injected into each cylinder port, as is done in a gasoline engine. In addition, a faster response, a high power output, and an improvement of cold start can all be achieved.</p>
<p>The primary issue in the current LPLI system is solving the fuel leakage problem at the injector tip. The area of focus is the excessive emission of HC due to gas leakage at the injector tip when the vehicle has stopped. The ideal solution to this problem would be to reduce the leakage in the injector itself, but there is a limitation in controlling gas leakage in the metal injector tip due to the characteristics of LPG. Considering these limitations, a method to control the amount of leakage is needed.</p>
<p>One way to control gas fuel leakage at the injector is to install an additional shut-off valve at the injector tip. In the case of LPG leaking at the injector, the valve stops the leakage before the LPG is exhausted at the manifold. However, the installation of the shut-off valve on a conventional LPLI injector carries the disadvantage that the adaptor structure must be modified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011421590">Figure 1</xref> shows the schematic of the change in the LPG path modified from the prototype of a shut-off valve injector. The installation of the valve caused the complication of the fuel path. These changes result in a higher possibility of the liquid LPG from the injector evaporating inside the fuel path tube (Teflon pipe) instead of the manifold.</p>

</fig>
<p>The evaporation of LPG at room temperature occurs easily because LPG has a high saturated vapour pressure of approximately 0.23 MPa. When liquid LPG in the LPLI system is injected from the injector into the intake manifold, rapid decompression evaporation takes place and heat is absorbed from the surroundings. Since the evaporation occurs in the intake air, the volumetric efficiency can be increased and therefore contribute to increasing the engine power. On the other hand, a countereffect can occur if too much heat absorption happens at a specific point. Excessive heat absorption may cause the temperature to drop below the freezing point. The injector tip, where the fuel is evaporated, is the point where heat absorption is most active and where the cooling effect may be severe, particularly shortly after the engine is started and when the temperature of the intake air is low. When the injector is cooled below the freezing point, icing of the moisture in the air on the injector surface occurs. The ice formed on the surface grows larger and blocks the injector hole, interfering with proper fuel injection. The ice particles also fall off and get inside the cylinder, causing a large amount of unburned HC to be produced.</p>
<p>For the case of LPLI, where LPG is injected in the liquid state, many schemes from various studies have been suggested to prevent icing. For the current LPLI injector, a metal adaptor with a Teflon tube inside is used to reduce the decompression evaporation in the fuel path at the injector tip. Reducing the temperature helps to prevent icing during the engine warm-up and under high load conditions.</p>
<p>After the modification of the shut-off valve injector from the conventional LPLI type, the possibility of the liquid LPG evaporating in the fuel tube instead of the manifold increased. This makes the temperature decrease at the injector, causing ice to form. In practice, icing occurred at the shut-off type injector tip, which did not happen in the conventional injector.</p>
<p>In this research, the icing phenomenon of an LPLI system with a shut-off valve is analysed in an attempt to understand and find the ideal solution to the icing problem.</p>

<title>2.1 Experimental device configuration</title>
<p>The observation of the injector and its surroundings under the driving condition of the engine is needed to analyse the icing phenomenon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011421590">Figure 2</xref> is a schematic of the device set-up for the engine test. The engine used in the experiment is a 2656 cm<sup>2</sup> V6 DOHC engine that uses LPG fuel with a compression ratio of 10.0. The engine speed is controlled using a water-cooled EC type dynamometer and the MEXA 8120 emission analysis device from Horiba is used for emission analysis.</p>

</fig>
<p>To observe the injector tip where the icing phenomenon is most severe, two types of visualization systems are applied. The first system, placed in the intake manifold, uses a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to closely capture images of the injector surface and icing inflow. The second system is an endoscope device that is used for the injector tip visualization. This device monitors the injection hole using a rigid-body borescope from Olympus and a digital camera from IMI Tech. At the end of the borescope is a reflecting mirror that can change the angle from 45° to 110°. The angle can be changed for different types of injectors and a bundle of optical fibre is used to supply the light created from the outside source to the target object. Compared to the first visualization device, which uses a fixed CCD camera, the borescope device is separable from the surge tank through a tube fitting from Uni-lok. Using the tube fitting, the fixation and dispatch of the borescope is possible, with the advantage of preventing the outside air from entering the surge tank.</p>
<p>The combustion becomes unstable if the ice formed from the injector enters into the cylinder when the engine is running, resulting in a high peak of the hydrocarbon (HC) density of the exhaust gas. Therefore, by observing a sudden change in HC concentration, the introduction of ice particles can be detected. The data obtained from the emissions analysis device are used to verify the change in emissions.</p>
<p>To understand the operating condition of the injector, a T-type thermocouple was used to measure the temperature. The temperature of the external air entering the engine was measured using a thermocouple installed inside the surge tank and another thermocouple was installed in the brass adaptor for measuring the temperature of the injector tip where icing occurs. A small hole was drilled before the insertion of the thermocouple to avoid interference from the air surrounding the injector when measuring the temperature. A lead ball was formed and filled in the adaptor hole for fixation around the junction. Another thermocouple was installed at the injector holder for measuring the temperature of the manifold, which supplies heat to the injector.</p>

<title>2.2 Experimental methodology</title>
<p>The adaptor configuration of the LPLI with a shut-off valve is more vulnerable to icing than the conventional injector, due to a longer shape and a complicated structure. Thus, an experiment to compare the conventional injector with the shut-off valve type injector was conducted to identify the effects of the adapter modification on the injector’s operation. The test was carried out at no-load and part-load conditions, and focused on engine start-up, where the cooling effect is particularly severe.</p>
<p>At the no-load condition, the preheating time of the engine and its surrounding devices is the longest because the amount of fuel injected is the smallest. This provides an ideal condition for injector observation in a low-temperature environment before preheat. Additionally, the short injection time at this condition reduces the chance of ice particles being ejected into the cylinder due to the injection pressure, making observation of the icing around the fuel tube easier. In contrast, for the part-load condition, where the amount of injected fuel increases, the cooling effect of the injector and the adapter can be increased by decompression evaporation. The humidity of the intake air was controlled at 90% RH (relative humidity) during the experiment.</p>
<p>The cause of icing and its effects can be analysed through the visualization images, emissions, and temperature changes, which are recorded during the experiment.</p>

The coolant temperature shows an increase regardless of the injector type, whereas the injector tip temperature is different for each. The adapter tip of the conventional injector marked a 6 °C temperature decrease to 11 °C, compared to that of the shut-off valve injector, which showed a 27 °C temperature decrease to −15.2 °C. The temperature characteristics of the shut-off valve injector thus favour the occurrence of icing and it could be observed through the visualization shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011421590">Fig. 4</xref>. A similar icing phenomenon could not be observed from the conventional injector.</p>

<p>In the CCD images, ice similar to frost starts to form on the surface of the injector tip as the temperature decreases to below 0 °C. This is a phenomenon in which the moisture in the intake air freezes on to the cold injector surface. At approximately 277 seconds, the temperature of the adaptor changes to above 0 °C, and all of the ice formed disappears in approximately 300 seconds. The icing liquified by the increased adaptor temperature stays on the injector surface for some time. However, it could be noted from the image at 300 seconds that ice particles still remain in the centre of the adaptor. The ice particles enter the cylinder and cause incomplete combustion of fuel, which changes the emission distribution.</p>

<title>3.1.2 Ice formation under the part-load condition</title>
<p>The experiment was conducted after a cold start of the engine with an increased speed and higher load at 2000 r/min and a brake mean effective pressure (b.m.e.p.) of 2.3 bar. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011421590">Figure 5</xref> shows the temperature distribution and an image of the icing phenomenon. The cooling effect becomes greater as the load increases because the amount of fuel injected increases and the evaporation heat absorption is larger. As a result, the temperature of the adaptor tip, which decreased to −15.2 °C under a no-load condition decreased to a minimum of −22.6 °C. It is noted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011421590">Fig. 6</xref> that the amount of ice formed also increased compared to the no-load condition.</p>

<p>Shortly after the engine start, the temperature drop of the adaptor tip was greater due to the low temperature of the adaptor and manifold. After preheating the engine to a sufficient temperature, the cooling effect of the adaptor decreased due to the heat supplied, and the icing phenomenon disappeared.</p>

<sec id="section9-0954407011421590">
<title>3.2 Analysis of the icing phenomenon</title>
<p>To examine the icing phenomenon of the shut-off valve type injector, an experiment under different engine operating conditions was conducted. It was identified through this experiment that two main types of icing phenomena exist in the shut-off valve injector, depending on the location of occurrence. The icing phenomena can be categorized as either one that forms on the surface of the adaptor when the temperature drops below 0 °C or one that forms in the Teflon pipe in the middle.</p>
<sec id="section10-0954407011421590">
<title>3.2.1 Icing phenomenon on the adapter surface</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, there is a close relationship between the icing phenomenon on the adaptor surface and the temperature of the adaptor. Since icing occurs from the moisture of the intake air freezing on to the cold adaptor surface, this type of icing can be prevented if the temperature of the adaptor is kept above 0 °C.</p>
<p>The long and complicated configuration of the adaptor used for installing the shut-off valve raises the amount of evaporation heat absorption from the injector, increasing the cooling effect of the adaptor. However, because the current technology level does not allow the installation of the shut-off valve without modifying the injector tip, the experiment focused on preventing icing by increasing the heat transfer from the heated manifold to the adapter of the injector during engine operation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011421590">Figure 7</xref> shows the comparison of the contact area between the holder and the injectors. The adaptor of the shut-off valve type injector has a smaller contact area than the adaptor for the conventional injector, which expands the contact area through expansion of the outer diameter of the holder and its contact surface. Because the heat from the manifold transfers through this contact area, the increase in the amount of heat transfer can be achieved by increasing the contact area. Both adaptors are made of brass, so the heat transfer through the entire adaptor is rapid. The two adaptors have the same outer diameter. However, the cross-sectional areas of the adaptors are different because the adaptor for the conventional injector only requires Teflon pipe inside that carries fuel, as opposed to the shut-off valve type, which has a shut-off plunger that takes up significant space, which makes a difference in the amount of heat transfer. Therefore, to transfer heat from the manifold to the adaptor tip efficiently, the cross-sectional area of the adaptor needs to be increased. Since the modification of the inner shape of the adaptor is difficult, the increase in the outer diameter is needed to increase the heat transfer area.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the analysis, to solve the icing problem of the shut-off valve injector, an increase in the heat transfer between the manifold and the injector adaptor is needed, and methods such as (1) increasing the contact area between the holder and the manifold and (2) increasing the injector adaptor’s outer diameter, can be used.</p>

After warming up the engine, the adaptor shows droplets of water on the surface from liquified ice. Ice continues to form on the fuel transport tube in the centre of the adaptor, after 300 seconds. This type of icing is independent of the surface temperature of the adaptor and is constantly forming, even when heat from the manifold is being transferred. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011421590">Figure 8</xref> also shows the change in the HC density in the emissions after all the ice drops off.</p>

<p>The possibility of improving the icing problem by increasing the amount of heat transfer was verified through analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011421590">Fig. 9</xref>, the images of the injectors with increased heat transfer between the adaptor and the manifold by applying the two previously suggested methods are shown. The amount of heat transfer is increased with the increase in the outer diameter and contact area. The increase in the lowest temperature helps prevent the formation of the ice due to the cooling effect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407011421590">Figure 10</xref> shows the temperature and emission characteristics of the adaptor with improved heat transfer, under the no-load condition.

<title>4.2 Effect of moisture contact prevention</title>
<p>To prevent the icing phenomenon in the fuel transport tube, a shroud was applied to the injector. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407011421590">Figure 11</xref> suggests the isolation of contact between the fuel injection hole and the outside air to prevent icing in the fuel tube. This method stops the humid air (90% RH), passing through the manifold, from approaching the injection hole. When designing the shroud, the injection angle needs to be taken into account so that the fuel does not come into contact with the shroud. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407011421590">Fig. 12</xref>, icing does not occur in the shrouded type injector, in contrast to the behavior in the shut-off valve injector, in which icing starts to form over time in the Teflon pipe. As opposed to the shut-off valve injector, no HC peak is found with the shrouded type injector either. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407011421590">Figure 13</xref> shows the result of temperature and emissions measurements with the shrouded type injector.</p>

<p>The following conclusions are drawn from the visualization and emission analysis of an LPLI fuel transport system with a shut-off valve in the injector to prevent leakage.</p>
<list id="list1-0954407011421590" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Icing occurred in the LPLI injector with a shut-off valve, whereas there was no icing on the conventional injector currently in use. It is concluded that icing is caused by the temperature drop due to evaporation in the lengthened and complicated fuel transport track, which is a result of installing the shut-off valve.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The two main types of icing phenomena in the shut-off valve type LPLI injector are the icing that forms on the metal part of the adaptor tip and the icing that forms on the fuel transport tube (Teflon pipe). Each type of icing can be prevented by increasing the amount of heat transfer via an increased contact area between the adaptor and the manifold and by isolating the tip from the outside air using a shroud.</p></list-item>
