<abstract>
<p>This study evaluates the diagnostic value of ultrasound as a first-line exam in carpal tunnel syndrome. In 16 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 32 matched controls, evaluation of the median nerve was performed by the cross-sectional area at wrist level and wrist–forearm ratio. This study found statistically significant differences between patients and controls by both methods, and both showed high specificity and positive predictive values. Optimal cut-off values were identified at a 14 mm<sup>2</sup> cross-sectional area and a 1.6 wrist–forearm ratio. This study implies that ultrasound evaluation of the median nerve is a valuable tool as a first-line diagnostic test used by the surgeon for examination of patients with presumed carpal tunnel syndrome. Owing to the high positive predictive value of ultrasound, the need for referral to nerve conduction study may be limited.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is diagnosed primarily based on anamnestic information combined with clinical exam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469581">Bickel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412469581">Durkan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469581">Prime et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469581">Zyluk and Szlosser, 2012</xref>). In unclear cases or concerning medicolegal issues, a nerve conduction study is sometimes preferred before surgical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469581">Bickel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469581">Wright, 2008</xref>). However, ultrasound is increasingly used in examination for CTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469581">Beekman and Visser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412469581">Klauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469581">Nakamichi and Tachibana, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). If ultrasound can be deployed as a first-line examination by the surgeon, there may be less need for referral to nerve conduction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). Ultrasound examination is without risk, and images made at the ultrasound exam are easy to archive and can later be used for post-hoc evaluation of the treatment if needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469581">Abicalaf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469581">Beekman and Visser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469581">Colak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469581">Manente et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412469581">Naranjo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469581">Smidt and Visser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469581">Vogelin et al., 2010</xref>). Ultrasound examination may also reveal unusual causes of CTS, such as space occupying lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412469581">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Different ultrasound methods that evaluate the median nerve have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469581">Nakamichi and Tachibana, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412469581">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The most easily applicable of these methods is a “single-shot” measurement at the distal flexor crease at the wrist. This method evaluates the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at its proximal entrance into the carpal tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469581">Nakamichi and Tachibana, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). Building on this “single-shot” measurement, the wrist–forearm ratio (WFR) has been proposed as a strategy to minimize observer and patient variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469581">Fowler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb and Padua, 2009</xref>). The primary aim of this study was to assess whether a WFR cut-off value of 1.5, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al. (2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469581">2009)</xref>, is diagnostic of CTS in a Danish population. Furthermore, this study evaluates the value of ultrasound as a first-line diagnostic modality for CTS in the surgeon’s office. This study also investigates methodological aspects of measuring the CSA.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study design was cross-sectional and included both patients and healthy controls. Invited to participate in the study were patients with anamnestic and clinical signs of CTS seen by the author in an outpatient orthopaedic clinic (cases). All cases had a nerve conduction study performed as an outpatient procedure at one of two associated departments of clinical neurophysiology on request from either the patient’s family physician before referral to or after an initial examination at the outpatient clinic (standard practice). The cases had no prior history of treatment for CTS, nor were any of the women pregnant. Only cases with a positive nerve conduction study were included for analysis. Two controls per case were arbitrarily chosen amongst the staff at the outpatient clinic. The controls had no prior or current history of CTS. The controls were included if Durkan’s compression test and Tinel’s sign were negative. No controls had a nerve conduction study performed. The controls were matched by gender, age (+/– 10 years), and side of affected hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469581">Roll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412469581">Werner et al., 1997</xref>). The severity of CTS was estimated as a categorical value based on the nerve conduction study: 1) absence of sensory and motor response; 2) absence of sensory and abnormal motor response; 3) abnormal sensory and motor response; 4) abnormal sensory and normal motor response; 5) normal sensory and motor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412469581">Giannini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412469581">Padua et al., 1997</xref>). All cases and controls gave verbal, informed consent to the author. This study was a quality assurance project and, as such, accepted by the local regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics without formal application. Approval was obtained from the Danish Data Protection Agency. The study was performed independently of and did not influence the patients’ treatment.</p>
<p>Sample size calculation for a two-sample comparison assuming an alpha (two-sided) of 0.05, power of 0.90, mean WFR for CTS patients of 1.87 (SD 0.88), and mean WFR for controls of 1.00 (SD 0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb and Padua, 2009</xref>) indicated required sample sizes of 11 hands in each group.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193412469581">
<title>Ultrasound procedure</title>
<p>Ultrasound was performed by the author, an orthopaedic specialist trainee with 2 years of clinical experience in musculoskeletal ultrasound using a Mindray M7 (Mindray Medical Intl. Ltd., Shenzhen, China) with a linear array transducer at 12 MHz. The distal flexor crease was chosen as the point of wrist exam. A position 10 cm proximal to the distal flexor crease (measured by ruler) was chosen as the point of forearm level because the appearance and location of the median nerve showed relevant consistency at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>). In the ultrasound exam, only these two single-shots were performed. No evaluation as to possible causes for the development of CTS was made (e.g., lumbrical incursion or other space-occupying lesions). The transducer was kept at a transverse plane, and caution was taken to evaluate the CSA with the transducer perpendicular to the nerve (assessed by exogeneity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469581">Beekman and Visser, 2003</xref>). The patient’s wrists were kept slightly extended (approximately 10°) during ultrasound as the forearm was located on a flat table with the hand just over the edge of the table, palm facing up with fingers naturally relaxed in a semi-flexed position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). Measuring of CSA was performed with M7 inboard software at the nerve circumference as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). Inboard M7 software enables the examiner to use an ellipsoid method of measurement by independent adjustment of two perpendicular axes and a “free hand” direct tracing method of measurement, both with automatic inboard software calculation of the encircled area (the CSA). All CSA estimations were performed at a later point than the actual ultrasound exam. The investigator was not aware of the result of the nerve conduction study when performing the ultrasound.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193412469581">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were evaluated at patient level — one hand per patient. In bilateral cases, the more severe hand was chosen based on the CTS score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412469581">Padua et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469581">Sauerland et al., 2003</xref>). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of an a priori defined dichotomized WFR (above or below 1.5) were calculated for the study population and estimated for notional populations with alternating a priori risks of disease. The non-parametric receiver operator characteristic method was used to evaluate the “single-shot” CSA at wrist level and the WFR. Bland–Altman plots were evaluated to compare the two methods of measurement. A non-parametric rank test was used to test for statistical significance between groups. A <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412469581" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Eighteen patients with presumed CTS were invited to participate in the study. None declined participation. Thirty-six staff members were included as controls. Two cases, one male and one female, subsequently had a normal nerve conduction study (CTS score 5; affected wrist CSA 18 mm<sup>2</sup> and 10 mm<sup>2</sup>; WFR 2.8 and 1.7). These two cases and their four matched controls were included in an evaluation of the method of measurement, but excluded in remaining data analysis. Visual evaluation of Bland–Altman plots and coherent data analysis showed a systematic difference between the trace and ellipse method of measurement. The trace method gave a consistently higher CSA at both wrist and forearm level (mean difference in mm<sup>2</sup> with 95% CI: left wrist 0.005, 0.003–0.008; right wrist 0.007, 0.004–0.010; left forearm 0.006, 0.004–0.009; right forearm 0.004, 0.001–0.006). Although statistically significant, these skewnesses were consistent and considered below the level of clinical measurement accuracy. Furthermore, post-hoc analysis showed that this skewness would have no effect on the subsequent internal analysis of the WFR data. The methods of measurement were thus considered sufficiently in agreement in the present study, and the choice of method had no effect on the internal validity of the data analysis. Comparable studies have only used the trace method in the reporting of their results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412469581">Hunderfund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>). Hence, subsequent analysis of the data in this study was performed by trace measurements only. Clinical and sonographic characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469581">Table 1</xref>. The accuracy of the WFR using a cut-off value of 1.5 gave a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 70–100%), specificity of 63% (95% CI 44–79%), NPV of 95% (95% CI 76–100%), and PPV of 56% (95% CI 35–75%). The prevalence of CTS in the study population was 33%. If the prevalence was arbitrarily set at 90%, the PPV increased to 96% and NPV decreased to 53%. No WFR or CSA were able to classify all cases and controls correctly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469581">Table 2</xref>). To identify optimal cut-off values, a CSA of 14 mm<sup>2</sup> and WFR of 1.6 appear relevant thresholds (prevalence 33%: PPV 91%/88%, NPV 84%/92%, respectively; prevalence 90%: PPV 99%/99%, NPV 22%/46%, respectively). The ability to differentiate between cases and controls was high for WFR with an estimated area under the curve (AUC) of 93% and lower for CSA with an AUC of 81%; however, this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412469581">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that ultrasound evaluation of the median nerve has potential as a first-line diagnostic test for CTS, and that the use of ultrasound can potentially limit the need for referral to nerve conduction studies. In general, excellent PPV may be achieved by the use of a diagnostic test with a high specificity in a clinical setting where disease prevalence is high, such as the hand surgeon’s clinic. This enables the surgeon to confirm the presence of disease in unclear cases, which is important because it may halt referral of the patient to a potentially painful and costly nerve conduction study. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469581">Table 2</xref>, this is so for both CSA and WFR. However, in the case of a normal CSA or WFR, the surgeon cannot rule out CTS due to the low NPVs. These patients may then be referred to a nerve conduction examination. As far as the two methods for evaluating the median nerve are concerned, the WFR has a high ability to differentiate cases and controls (AUC 93%). But WFR did not appear superior to CSA in terms of diagnostic accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412469581">Figure 1</xref>) and predictive values in the present study. Three studies have previously reported WFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469581">Hobson-Webb et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412469581">Hunderfund et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">2008b</xref>). In summary, all studies report a significantly increased CSA at wrist level among cases compared with controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1753193412469581">Table 3</xref>), and as such, the WFR has yet to be confirmed superior to a “single-shot” wrist CSA.

(2008a)</xref>, suggest a practice that involves the “single-shot” CSA measurement primarily, and then in borderline cases supplemented with WFR. Whether this algorithm is useful remains to be investigated. There appeared to be a systematic difference between the methods used for measuring CSA; a difference that has not been reported before and should be further explored in future studies. Measurements performed by “free-hand” tracing of the nerve circumference consistently yielded a larger CSA in the present study. This skewness could influence the external comparability of results and must be taken into account when comparing the results from independent studies.</p>

<p>There are some apparent weaknesses in the present study. The study size is smaller than comparable studies, but the present study is based on an a priori sample size calculations. Intra- and inter-observer variability were not evaluated; however, a high reproducibility has previously been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469581">Impink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469581">Nakamichi and Tachibana, 2000</xref>). Height, weight, and body mass index were not adjusted in the matching of controls. However, these parameters do not appear to correlate with the size of the median nerve in unaffected controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469581">Roll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412469581">Werner et al., 1997</xref>). The controls in the present study did not have a nerve conduction study performed, whereas all cases had positive nerve conduction studies making it impossible to perform statistical inference on CTS severity. As patients with early or less typical CTS may not have been represented in the study sample, overestimation of the accuracy may have occurred (spectrum bias). In addition, to be able to identify an enlargement of the median nerve by ultrasound, such an enlargement, evidently, must be present. This may not always be so in cases of short symptom duration in which the swelling may not yet have reached a level that allows it to be diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469581">Visser et al., 2008b</xref>), or in cases of longstanding compression with nerve atrophy. This study only evaluates a “single-shot” assessment of the median nerve at the distal flexor crease at wrist level. This may not represent the maximal CSA of the affected median nerve. Nonetheless, this superficial landmark consistently transcends an area, in which an enlargement of the nerve is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469581">Nakamichi and Tachibana, 2000</xref>). Moreover, to use one defined location make comparison across studies less prone to observer bias. This “single-shot” represents an easily applicable method to be adopted by the surgeon after minimal introduction to ultrasound. In patients with suspected CTS, but unclear anamnestic or clinical presentation, ultrasound potentially adds important information for the surgeon.</p>
