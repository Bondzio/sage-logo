<abstract>
<p>The ubiquity of the Internet has led to the widespread availability of health-related information to the public, and the subsequent empowerment of patients has fundamentally altered the patient-physician relationship. Among several concerns of physicians is the possibility that patients may be misinformed by information obtained from the Internet. One opportunity for health care providers to address this problem exists within Internet-based patient education materials (IPEMs). According to recent research in <italic>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery</italic>, IPEMs found within professional otolaryngology websites are written at the 8th- to 18th-grade reading comprehension level, essentially unchanged over the past 3 years. This greatly exceeds the fourth- to sixth-grade reading level recommended by the National Institutes of Health. Benefits, strategies, and challenges to improving the readability of IPEMs are discussed.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of the Internet has transformed how medical information is disseminated and accessed. Between 40% and 80% of Internet users in the United States have searched online for medical information,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812456153">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812456153">2</xref></sup> and globally an estimated 6.75 million Internet queries on health-related topics are conducted every <italic>day</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812456153">3</xref></sup> The 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey found that nearly half of 6369 surveyed adults searched online first for information on cancer, whereas only 11% reported seeking out a physician’s counsel first.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812456153">4</xref></sup> The vast sea of information available on the Internet has helped inform and empower patients, shifting the patient-physician dynamic in the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812456153">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the literature on specifically targeted medical websites for patients is sparse, Schwartz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812456153">6</xref></sup> found that up to 34% of family medicine patients searched general health-related websites for information, whereas 12.5% accessed specific health information websites. Although not a majority, this is still a substantial proportion of patients who may encounter the Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery or other organizational websites in the course of an online search. As Eloy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812456153">7</xref></sup> have shown in this issue of <italic>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery</italic>, within these professional websites, there are hundreds of pages of easily accessible Internet-based patient education material (IPEM). Search engines have vastly improved the ability of patients to access these data. However, reading and understanding what is available poses a far greater challenge. The 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) found that nearly all doctoral-level clinicians demonstrated NALS level 5 literacy—that is, the highest possible skill level. Fewer than 5% of all adult Americans share this same level of reading comprehension, and in fact, nearly half of the US population scored in the level 1 or 2 strata—functional illiteracy or marginal literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812456153">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends a fourth- to sixth-grade reading level for any written health-related information for patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812456153">9</xref></sup> Despite these recommendations, the investigators found that using 10 different scales, professionally written IPEMs in otolaryngology were equivalent to the 8th- to 18th-grade reading level, consistent with findings in other medical specialty websites for common conditions such as heart disease and cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812456153">10</xref></sup> Internet-based patient education materials at the doctorate readability level simply will not be fully understood by the typical American.</p>
<p>Faced with this scenario, only 32% of patients would opt to contact their physician if they were unable to interpret information they encountered online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812456153">5</xref></sup> The remainder may continue searching through the Internet for additional data, increasing their chances of encountering inaccuracies and feeling overwhelmed from “information overload.” Patients subsequently appearing at medical appointments armed with a stack of IPEMs gathered from various websites have proven to be a new and sometimes frustrating challenge for clinicians. Many physicians believe that the Internet is gradually usurping the traditional role of the physician as a medical authority,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812456153">11</xref></sup> whereas others assume that patients who have done Internet health-related searches have been misinformed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812456153">12</xref></sup> There is also concern that there is not enough time in a routine office visit to answer patients’ questions about IPEMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812456153">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, simplifying IPEMs provides its own unique challenges. First, as Eloy and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812456153">7</xref></sup> have stated, there has been essentially no research on the writing and educational credentials of the authors of organizational websites supplying IPEMs, let alone the writers behind the many informal, nonvetted websites permeating the Internet. The training needed to write for the lay public is substantially different from that needed to write for other health care providers, where the audience’s grasp of core medical principles and at least some familiarity with advanced medical terminology, eponyms, and drug nomenclature can be assumed. US medical curricula are directed toward writing for a scientific audience, whereas specialized training in writing for patient education purposes has generally been neglected. Health care providers might be able to address this deficit by collaborating with individuals with communications or journalism experience, although this hypothesis has yet to be formally studied. Another option would be for health care providers, educators, and journalists to undergo specialized coursework in medical writing for public consumption, a skill set currently taught at programs such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholars and the Knight-Wallace Fellowship.</p>
<p>Physicians tend to overestimate the health literacy of their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812456153">13</xref></sup> Still, is it possible to make IPEM “too simple” for patients? It is unknown how modifying IPEMs to the fourth- to sixth-grade reading level will affect accuracy. Many medical terms and concepts have no simple analogies, whereas others cannot be reduced into basic components without significant data and contextual loss. Oversimplification of ideas embodied in IPEMs consequently may misinform or frustrate patients in unexpected ways. An international survey conducted by the Health on the Net Foundation in 2002 found that 45% of nonmedical professionals complained that information they accessed was actually too simplistic, guiding some patients toward their physicians but more often toward complex online medical resources meant for health care providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812456153">14</xref></sup> Another potential concern is whether simple messages can be delivered to patients with lower health literacy rates without inadvertently demeaning them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812456153">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>One proposal for enriching IPEMs without sacrificing accuracy is the introduction of multimedia supplements, such as photographs, video and animation, and audio. A review by Houts et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812456153">15</xref></sup> found that pictures accompanying written material appeared to be effective in improving attention, comprehension, recall, and adherence to patient instructions. The authors suggested employing simple language and imagery, sensitivity to the cultures of target populations, and direct involvement of health care providers in creating images to supplement patient education material. Since readability formulas only account for 50% to 84% of variance in text difficulty and do not fully account for reading comprehension, pictures can be an important adjunct for improving the readability of IPEMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812456153">16</xref></sup> A 2001 review of oncology patient education studies also suggested that patient compliance and knowledge improved with the use of audio- and video-based patient education tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812456153">17</xref></sup> Here, IPEMs have an advantage over traditional written patient education materials in that information presented online can be easily supplemented with innovative multimedia programming.</p>
<p>The readability of IPEMs found on professional otolaryngology websites has changed little in the past 3 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812456153">18</xref></sup> As the Internet becomes further integrated into our society and the health care field, it is likely that patients will increasingly rely on IPEMs for guidance and reassurance before and after the office visit, and it is evident that our approach to IPEMs would benefit from reexamination. Will making IPEMs simpler improve patient outcomes? Intuitively, yes—health literacy is a stronger predictor of an individual’s health status than age, income, employment status, education level, and race/ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812456153">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, poor health literacy is associated with less healthy behaviors and decreased awareness of preventative health measures, self-care instructions, and patients’ own medical conditions, as well as increased health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812456153">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812456153">19</xref></sup> The study by Eloy and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812456153">7</xref></sup> now affords us the chance to revisit how patient education is delivered online, as well as an opportunity to reaffirm the patient-physician relationship.</p>
