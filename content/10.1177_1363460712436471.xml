<abstract>
<p>William Yang’s performance <italic>Sadness</italic> challenges essentialised categories of identification by juxtaposing tales of his Chinese-Australian family with the journey of friends from his community dying of AIDS-related complications and infection. In doing so, Yang foregrounds the threat of mortality that attempts to stabilise identity politics for the ‘nation’. In the age of global media Yang resists multi-modal approaches to his medium to reclaim the theatrical space of narration. As a consequence, Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> affords an opportunity to rethink the imperatives intrinsic to the classification of social subjects in terms of racial, sexual and reproductive practices, and the relationship of the citizen-body to modes of cultural representation.</p>

<p>Photographer and solo performer William Yang spoke these lines in an impartial manner as part of his performance <italic>Sadness</italic> that premiered at Belvoir Street Theatre in Sydney in 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712436471">1</xref></sup> Yang presented to the audience a series of slides and a monologue that recounted stories of his Chinese-Australian family and the journey of friends from the Sydney gay community dying of AIDS-related complication and infection. Death dominates Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic>: the death of friends, relatives and his mother. What emerges in this ‘portrait of mortality’ is a history of racism and homophobia in Australia. Yang’s ‘life stories’ are haunted by the experience of exclusion. <italic>Sadness</italic>, subsequently, raises the issue of constructions of membership of a community or communities and the ‘autobiographical’ lens of the narrator explores death through the triangular frame of kinship, racial heritage and sexual orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712436471">2</xref></sup> If citizenship, as a mechanism regulating the concept of inclusion and the perpetuation of the identity of a community, can be thought of as a domain of ‘recognition, representation, and the construction of symbolic meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436471">Staiger, 2009</xref>: 1), as opposed to simply rights and obligations, what can Yang’s scenic reflections tell us about the citizen-body and its function as a ‘bloodline’ of continuity for the nation? And how does Yang, as an ostensibly neutral narrator, call into question the normalising politics that render ‘queer’ social subjects a ‘threat’ to hegemonic regimes of cultural intelligibility in Australia?</p>
<p>All of Yang’s ‘theatre pieces begin with photos’, as he explains in the preface to <italic>Sadness</italic> published in 1996. As a social photographer in Sydney Yang composed <italic>Sadness</italic> as a result of the number of wakes he had attended, as opposed to parties over a four-year period. Initially, he deliberated on whether death constituted ‘good box office’, but proceeded on the basis that it captured ‘the mood of the times’ amongst his circle in Sydney (1996). Yang’s ‘AIDS case histories’, as he refers to them, visually capture the bodies of his friends succumbing to disease and death (1996). ‘Some of the images have the power to wound us’, Helena Grehan notes, ‘yet Yang does not frame these with a display of emotion’ (2002: 151). Dressed in a suit, Yang opens <italic>Sadness</italic> in what is referred to as Act One in the published text with images of his friend Allan and a narrative that details Allan’s physical deterioration from AIDS. Allan’s face, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang (and the spectator) observes ‘seemed to have caved in’ (1996: 4)</xref>, and the Allan in the photograph taken at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney in 1988 is not recognisable in the slide of Allan in the Sacred Heart Hospital just two years later. This short flashback concludes with a reference to Allan’s cremation. Jeffrey, Allan’s friend had arranged the funeral. In Yang’s experience, ‘[o]ften when a gay man dies there’s some conflict between what the family wants and what the friends perceived that he wanted. But in Allan’s case everything was harmonious’ (1996: 7). Yang closes this ‘scene’ by briefly mentioning his friend Nicolaas, who died approximately six months after Allan.</p>
<p>In <italic>Sadness</italic> Yang tempers these deeply disturbing images through portraits of his friends as healthy men, and shots of his family and the landscape as he journeys to Queensland and into his family’s history. Images of Bridal Veil Falls in the Blue Mountains, the site where Nicholaas requested his friends scatter his ashes, are projected just prior to a shift to slides and narratives of Yang’s family in the second ‘scene’ of the production. In the published version of the performance Yang parallels the six ‘scenes’ dedicated to friends in <italic>Sadness</italic> with six ‘scenes’ devoted to his family, and the constant shift between family and friends structures the two ‘acts’ of the text; the second commencing with the story of Yang’s paternal grandfather in Cooktown, a port for the goldfields of the 1880s in the far north of Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712436471">3</xref></sup> After introducing the fate of his friends in the opening narrative Yang switches to his family and Wilma’s funeral. Wilma was the wife of Les Fang Yuen, his only living blood relative in Sydney. He recalls the fact that a Chinese member of the family did not speak at the service and tells the audience that he found himself ‘muttering that this inferiority is just another example of the effects of colonialism on minority groups’ (1996: 11). The audience (or reader in the case of the published text) learns that Yang did not speak out at the funeral as he has ‘enough of a reputation as a troublemaker as it is’ (1996: 11).</p>
<p>The ‘different worlds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang, 1996</xref>) that Yang merges of his Chinese family and the gay community in Sydney impart ‘outcast positions’, to use Rosemary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436471">Hennessy’s description of ‘queer’, sexual and racial (1994–1995: 34)</xref>. In the first ‘scene’ of Yang’s performance, familial and intimate practices emerge as a primary site of belonging subject to unspoken norms: Allan’s funeral is linked to the assertion of the heterosexual rights of the family and Wilma’s to the racial boundaries of kinship. Here, the question of generational identity, as a familial and racial expression, plays a key role in the narrator’s recollections of the two ceremonies for the deceased. Yang’s references to highly confronting personal occasions of mourning and commemoration seemingly constitute a sketch of ‘private’ experience for the spectator. His unhurried pace and composed style of delivery, however, opens up a space for the spectator to consider kindred obligations and allegiances and in doing so, the personal–political ramifications of his images and passages of narration. As a consequence, Yang arguably implicates the audience in a public discussion of intimacy and domesticity. He provides a lens through which to observe not only death, but the complex social agendas that structure and impinge on the subjects of his narration. In this respect, his theatre depends upon what Hans-Thies Lehmann describes as ‘indirectness and deceleration, on a reflecting immersion in political topics’ (2006: 184) that raises the question of the politics of forms of perception in the theatre medium.</p>
<p>While Yang’s entirely ‘untheatrical’ performance style is ‘deliberately simple and low-key’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712436471">Lo, 1998</xref>: 67), the issue of the nexus of intelligibility intrinsic to the exploration of sexual and racial epistemes suggests a potent questioning to the spectator that is heightened by the form of autobiographical, yet objective monological narration. ‘I’m travelling north, into the past’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang narrates, ‘to look into my uncle’s murder’ (1996: 21)</xref>. Yang’s history leads him into an era of anti-Chinese sentiment based on a conception of settlers from this region as an ‘alien race’; a conception that accompanied an increase in Chinese immigration as a result of gold rushes in the 19th century in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712436471">4</xref></sup> For Yang it is a journey that culminates in the production in slides of his mother and her living room as Yang reads the letter she had written to him the day before her death. The penultimate ‘scene’ of <italic>Sadness</italic> then returns to the story of Nicholaas and a slide of the deceased man in Prince Henry Hospital in 1992. Death subsequently brings Yang’s worlds together in the final ‘scene’ entitled ‘Family and Friends’ punctuated by a photograph of a candlelight vigil for the victims of AIDS and an image of a Taoist shrine; Yang citing the sage Lao Tze when he states ‘[t]here’s no difference between the living and the dead, they are the same channel of vitality’ (1996: 79).</p>
<p>Prior to <italic>Sadness</italic>, Yang had performed <italic>The Face of Buddha</italic>, his first full-length slide-show, and then <italic>China Diary</italic>. <italic>Sadness</italic>, like all his work, responds to his previous material. Born in 1943 in Dimbulah, north Queensland, Yang is third-generation Chinese and as he points out in <italic>Sadness</italic> he has had to work hard to reclaim his heritage (1996: 22). As the spectator contemplates each slide of his family, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang tells the audience he had a ‘completely assimilated upbringing’ (1996: 21)</xref>. In the process of growing up in ‘mainstream culture’ in Queensland ‘the Chinese side was lost and denied’ and for most of his adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang has ‘felt uncomfortable about being Chinese’ (1996: 21)</xref>. It was not until Yang was six years old that he ‘discovered’ he was Chinese as a result of a taunt by another pupil: ‘Ching Chong Chinaman, Born in a jar, Christened in a teapot, Ha ha ha’ (1996: 64). Against photographs of Yang’s childhood home in Dimbulah the audience learns that Yang subsequently asked his mother to confirm his racial identity. As a consequence, from an early age Yang experienced the social cost of non-conformity; firstly, as a loss of his Chinese heritage, and secondly, as an ‘aberration’ of mainstream Australia, ‘queered’ on the basis of his ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712436471">5</xref></sup> While Yang now identifies as ‘bi-cultural’, blood is clearly not his only base for identification.</p>
<p>Yang’s sexual identity is linked to the ‘bright lights’ of Sydney, and his family to Queensland, another state in Australia. In addition to his racial identity, Yang experienced further isolation as a result of his ‘non-conformity’ during his childhood and adolescence in the north of Australia:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember one day reading the afternoon paper and finding an article about homosexuality. It described the condition and named some famous homosexuals in history: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Oscar Wilde. I thought, Oh god, that’s me. There’s a name for it. The shock of recognition hit me like a thunderbolt. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang, 1996</xref>: 44)</p></disp-quote>
Despite the high profile presence of ‘queer’ identities throughout history, ‘queer’ sexuality has been rendered invisible by manifold ‘publics’; from the local sphere of the ‘home’ as a privileged realm of familial normalcy to what the Queer Nation lobby identifies as the ‘naturalising stereotypes of official nationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436471">Berlant and Freeman, 1992</xref>: 154). When Yang introduces his nephew, Andrew, through a slide in the production he points out that he has been ‘[u]nintentionally … outing [him] to the rest of the family’ (1996: 13). Yang tells the audience that his family learned of his own sexuality through a ‘gay interview with Anne Summers on television’ and that when his nephew is questioned about whether he has seen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang ‘there is a subtext of guilt by association’ (1996: 13)</xref>. It is not in Cairns that Yang ‘came out’, the town where he spent his teenage years, but in Sydney many years later. For Yang ‘the north [of Australia] is still a lonely place’ (1996: 44).</p>
<p>What emerges from this paradigm of experience is the question of not only negotiating the right <italic>to be public</italic> in a domestic sphere, but the right to be public in a culture that is heteronormative insofar as the heterosexual couple functions as a privileged referent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436471">Berlant and Warner, 2000</xref>). Heteronormativity, as Berlant and Warner argue, pervades all aspects of social experience – nationality, the state, the legal system, trade, education and so forth – and subsequently, cannot be reduced to an ideology (2000: 318–319). As a consequence social, cultural and political domains are difficult to detect as heteronormative on the basis that heterosexuality is ‘marked as a natural state’ and concurrently and incongruously operates as the ‘unmarked … basic idiom of the personal and the social’, as well as being envisaged as a site of morality in structures of understanding and institutional formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436471">Berlant and Warner 2000</xref>: 312, n.2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712436471">6</xref></sup> If citizenship, as an instrument of the state that regulates membership of, and participation in, a national community, is thought of as a cultural paradigm and not simply as a legal status, the question of recognition and representation for ‘queer’ social subjects emerges as an issue in an Australia that propagates the myth of an egalitarian ethos against the backdrop of its racist ‘past’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712436471">7</xref></sup> For Yang the right to express a civic identity based on a non-heteronormative collective affinity largely hinges upon the annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney.</p>
<p>‘Scene’ 4 of ‘Friends’ is dedicated to stories of Mardi Gras and opens with a slide of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and the head of the Reverend Fred Nile float. The photographs predominantly reflect Mardi Gras as a celebration of life and the images of healthy men and women contrast to Yang’s narrative as he gradually turns to the impact of AIDS on the community in Sydney. ‘Now Death is just the next thing after DISCO’ Yang states, before considering whether ‘Queens sit around in heaven comparing the length of their obituaries’ (1996: 49). In 1981, as Yang points out, ‘it was considered political just to be there, you didn’t have to dress up’ for Mardi Gras (1996: 46), and it continues to present the opportunity to promote visibility on the basis that it is ‘beamed into people’s living rooms’ (1996: 47) around the country. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436471">Berlant and Warner (2000)</xref> this is essential to advancing ‘the radical aspirations of queer culture building’, and it is an objective that necessarily liberates intimacy from the organisation of domestic space, kinship, property and the nation. While intimacy might appear the realm of private life it is publicly mediated and subject to territorial insularity: the ‘micro’ boundaries demarcating the couple and the monogamous family are replicated in the macro formation of the nation and state legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712436471">8</xref></sup> In <italic>Sadness</italic> this plays out as a tension of ‘belonging’, racial and sexual, that foregrounds the foreclosures specific to the normative ties of the family.</p>
<p>In his account of the group, Asian Lesbian and Gay Pride, Yang reflects on the relationship of sexuality to cultural conventions and family. ‘It’s harder for an Asian to come out’, Yang explains, ‘partly because of the traditional tight family constructions and partly because of the repressive attitudes of the various Asian cultures’ (1996: 15). Van is the subject of this story. A member of Asian Lesbian and Gay Pride, Van is Vietnamese and HIV positive and ‘prepared to be public about it’ (1996: 14). It is particularly complicated to identify as a homosexual in Vietnamese culture, according to Yang, on the basis that the Vietnamese vocabulary does not include a word for ‘homosexual’. As a consequence, ‘it’s hard to come out about something you can’t even describe’ (1996: 15). Later in <italic>Sadness</italic> Yang talks about the artist Peter Tully and his partner, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang’s words, the ‘post-Stonewall’ David McDiarmid (1996: 24)</xref>. McDiarmid’s obituary for Tully read ‘Moody Bitch Dies of AIDS’ (1996: 51). Tully’s family ‘took a very dim view of the obituary’ (1996: 51) and conflict emerged over Tully’s estate as a result of the fact that Tully died without a will. Legally, Tully’s asserts became the property of the family. However, Tully had ‘asked that his ashes be divided in two — half going to the biological family and the other half going to the gay and lesbian family’ (1996: 52). For Yang’s Italian friend Orazio, lies about the cause of his death from AIDS circulated among relatives until his funeral, where his partner Richard ‘spoke freely … and told the truth for the first time’ (1996: 61).</p>
<p>Yang’s passages of narration suggest that the blood politics of obligation dominate cultural articulation not only in life, but in death; and the rights of the family over Peter Tully’s estate confirms Carol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436471">Johnson’s (2003)</xref> research into heteronormative citizenship. For Johnson citizen identities and subsequently entitlements, rights and responsibilities continue to operate on the basis of heterosexual relationships that privilege familial ‘norms’ in Australia. It is a social order that reflects the relation of the ‘nation’ to its Latin source, ‘nasci’. ‘Nasci’ signifies ‘to be born’ and the etymological source of the word accounts for the primordial association of nation to kinship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712436471">Somerville, 2005</xref>: 660). In her discussion of Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> Joanne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436471">Tompkins (2001)</xref>, similarly, links the blood relations of the family to the nation through the concept of home by noting that these reference points constitute the traditional basis of identity formation. According to Tompkins, home has emerged as a preoccupation with the family, the ‘old’ country and Australia in multicultural drama since the 1970s in Australia. In making this point, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436471">Tompkins refers to the ‘unsettled (and unsettling) constructions of home’ (2001: 48)</xref> that distinguish contemporary performance in Australia and her term ‘homescape’ suggests ‘a sense of home beyond merely geographically determined locations’ (2001: 49). At issue in performances like Yang’s that disrupt the ‘stable’ set of relations signifying ‘home’ is the logic of continuity that binds kinship, race and sexuality to the nation.</p>
<p>‘Natural ties’ such as parentage, skin-colour and gender underpin the idea of ‘historical destinies’, according to Benedict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436471">Anderson (1991: 143)</xref>. As a consequence, Anderson reasons that nationalism can be distinguished from the way in which racism ‘dreams of eternal contaminations, transmitted from the origins of time through an endless sequence of loathsome copulations: outside history’ (1991: 149). Anderson discusses the cultural roots of nationalism as a response to mortality that parallels in many respects the imaginings of religion insofar as both are concerned with the ‘links between the dead and the yet unborn’; that is, ‘the mystery of re-generation’ (1991: 11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712436471">9</xref></sup> Yang offers a series of kindred allegiances that contest sexualised and racialised representations of Anglo-Celtic heteronormative identity. His ‘natural ties’, for example, culminate in slides of his family’s grandchildren that he describes as Austasian, as opposed to a Eurasian (1996: 12). If, as Anderson reasons, nationalism is a reaction to human finitude, the generational lineage Yang presents as part of his ‘portrait of mortality’ raises the question of the reproductive ‘logic’ critical to the formation of national identity and its normative citizen-body. A central narrative of Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> opens up the question of the ‘logic’ behind racial identity in Australia, or what Alys Eve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712436471">Weinbaum (2004)</xref> identifies as the ‘race/reproduction’ bind key to the historical immortality of the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712436471">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yang journeys north to Queensland from Sydney in 1990 to look into his uncle’s murder in the 1920s in Mourilyan. William Fang Yuen had been killed by a Russian, Peter Danelchenko, a manager of one of Fang Yuen’s cane farms in the north. Yang returns to different strands of the story throughout <italic>Sadness</italic> to relay the incongruent recollections of the murder and the reason for his uncle’s death through his encounters with members of his extended family. ‘In those days killing a Chinaman was not considered a serious crime’ (1996: 68), Yang tells his audience, and it is clear from the depositions covering the case that the police attempted to protect Danelchenko, ‘the white man’ (1996: 68). Yang does not direct the audience’s response to his material. What is striking, however, from a historical perspective is the consciousness of racial mortality that defined the era leading up to Fang Yuen’s murder. In a speech in support of the White Australia policy, Australia’s first Prime Minister Edmund Barton alerted the first federal parliament in 1901 to transnational fears concerning unprecedented migration and settlement:
<disp-quote>
<p>The day will come, and perhaps is not far distant, when the European observer will look round to see the globe girdled with a continuous zone of the black and yellow races. (Barton in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436471">Lake, 2004</xref>: 43)</p></disp-quote>
Barton’s colonial conception of the encroachment of the ‘Black and Yellow Belt’ is reiterated in the following letter printed in the <italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic> in 1905:
<disp-quote>
<p>If we cannot people our Commonwealth … our race will wane, and eventually be extinguished even as the Aborigines have disappeared before the might and numbers of their white foes. (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436471">Baringhorst, 2004</xref>: 151)</p></disp-quote>
Prior to the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948 the Australian Attorney-General, Alfred Deakin, commended the drafting of Australia’s Constitution in 1901 on the basis that it dealt with ‘the admixture of other races’ and qualified his approval by pointing out that:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not merely a question of invasion from the exterior. It may be a question of difficulties within our borders, already created, or a question of contamination of another kind. (Deakin in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436471">Lake, 2004</xref>: 56)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What the Attorney-General is intent on defending is racialised reproduction. That is, the ‘purity’ of the British race in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1363460712436471">11</xref></sup> Australia’s Citizenship Act of 1948 developed in response to a period of mass migration, and ‘it was about who should belong, and not what their entitlements should be’, according to J Walter and M McLeod (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436471">Dyrenfurth, 2005</xref>: 91). Curiously, Deakin elaborates on his notion of potential ‘difficulties’ by pointing to the possibility of other sources of ‘pollution’, and this opens up the axis of disease linked to sexual practices in Yang’s production. It is not only the indifference of the authorities to Fang Yuen’s murder in <italic>Sadness</italic> that raises the question of the relation between mortality and reproductive narratives of the nation. Yang’s personal history ‘embodies’ two major ‘epidemics’, the fear of the ‘Yellow Peril’ dating from the gold rush era in Australia and more recently, the anxiety of infection as a result of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).</p>
<p>‘Queer’ desire, echoing both Anderson’s conception of racism and the language of the Australian Attorney-General, has been understood in terms of contamination, and in the early days of the AIDS epidemic the incidence of the disease in marginalised groups heralded a perception of the disease ‘not as accidental’, to use Simon Watney’s words, ‘but as a symbolic extension of some imagined inner essence of being’ (1987: 8) that constitutes responsibility for the predicament of infection. In 2004 the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> in Australia confirmed this notion by stating in its brief report on world AIDS day that the disease ‘was at first dismissed by many as being confined to drug users, homosexuals and prostitutes’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1363460712436471">12</xref></sup> and by inference did not merit attention. Yang’s only reference to the engagement of the broader community in <italic>Sadness</italic> refers to the bus that transported Allan to and from the hospital for treatment and he comments that ‘in some ways’ this constituted help from the community (1996: 3). AIDS, as Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712436471">Yingling states, is constituted by a set of signifiers that point unequivocally to death (1991: 306)</xref>, and for those ‘citizens’ excluded from mainstream society the state demonstrated its indifference until the disease threatened the heterosexual community and subsequently, ‘national interest’. It is a point that affirms an understanding of the body as a ‘public space’ subject to policing – not safeguarding – in the interests of dominant ideologies, as opposed to epidemiology.</p>
<p>In his article ‘Extinction anxieties: Same-sex marriage and modes of citizenship’, Mario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436471">Feit (2005)</xref> details the relationship between homosexuality and mortality. In doing so, Feit demonstrates that it is an association that precedes the advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in America. It is ‘queer’ sexuality and not disease that prefigures a threat to reproduction. Or in the words of Jonathan Rodney’s 1961 <italic>Handbook of Sex Knowledge</italic> it is ‘obvious that sexual love among persons of the same sex is a perversion because, quite apart from any other arguments based upon ethics and morality, such a practice cannot result in procreation’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712436471">Watney, 1987</xref>: 55). What is at stake, however, is not simply the reproductive function of the citizen. Australia is marked by a history of legislation that sanctioned the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families in order to ‘breed out’ and thereby engender a ‘dying race’ through extinction and assimilation. In a contemporary context these policies resonate in what Yingling describes as the ‘passive-aggressive act on the part of rational society’ that through indifference ‘inflicted dying’ at the outset of the AIDS epidemic on members of the gay community (1991: 306). The AIDS crisis, like the Australian government’s treatment of its Indigenous population and the historical apprehension concerning the Chinese in Australia, renders explicit the hegemonic logic that binds race and sexual practices to the ‘ideal’ of reproducing a particular type of citizen-subject.</p>
<p>If the series of personal stories constituting Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> open up the broader question of the political character of mortality by pointing to the plight of social subjects perceived as ‘threats’ to the ‘homescape’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1363460712436471">13</xref></sup> of the (European) heteronormative citizen-body in Australia, how, then, does <italic>Sadness</italic> render these issues aesthetically tangible for the spectator?</p>
<sec id="sec1-1363460712436471"><title>Staging ‘mortality’: Theatre as a public forum and the aesthetic ‘logic’ of <italic>Sadness</italic></title>
<p>Yang, as both the subject and object of narration, or in his words ‘the glue’ that holds a number of diverse stories together (1996), foregrounds the myriad complex interfaces refracting non-normative identity. By maintaining the stance of the indifferent narrator, Yang subtly challenges the spectator to respond to his stories of exclusion. On the basis of ‘scenographic’ passages of narration, outside mainstream accounts of history, he crafts a theatre of public reflection. Here, members of the audience are invited into the associative spaces that emerge from accounts of ‘real’ people and are subsequently encouraged to feel their own presence in the medium. As a consequence, Yang challenges the fictive cosmos of theatre and the conventions that have inculcated the spectator into time-honoured forms of perception in the medium, as well as the normalising politics that have shaped his ‘autobiographical’ experience in Australia. If, as Erika <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436471">Fischer-Lichte (2004)</xref> demonstrates, changes to dramatic and theatre form correspond to a critique of identity, as opposed to the popular idea of theatre as a mirror of ‘social reality’, it is perhaps not surprising that Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> rearticulates the self-referential intensity of personal experience into a narrative act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436471">Lehmann, 2006</xref>: 109–110) to fashion a performance that dispenses with the normative conditions of the theatre medium. Yang’s speech corresponds to the speech of a real speaking person, as opposed to an actor, and he abandons the tradition of dramatic action to directly address the spectator.</p>
<p>While Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> has been explicated in terms of the paradigm of multicultural theatre and drama (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436471">Tompkins, 2001</xref>), Yang’s performance is more thoroughly explicated aesthetically as an example of postdramatic theatre;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1363460712436471">14</xref></sup> that is, as a form of composition ‘no longer dramatic’ insofar as text operates as one of a number of elements and the stage is not dedicated to representing action. In <italic>Sadness</italic> the text does not dominate the form, photography shares an equal relation. Like the long history of the presence of puppets and marionettes in the theatre, the lifeless apparitions of Yang’s slides ‘speak’ to the spectator. Despite the painful images of mortality, the performer’s mode of narration, a technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436471">Grehan (2002)</xref> describes as stillness, implicates the spectator in the production. It is a ‘stillness’, however, marked by death. Death, it could be argued, paralyses action into a static dramaturgy. Dialogue and actions are no longer possible and ‘photographic monologues’ emerge to ironically replicate the passivity attributed to the ‘definition of the citizen as spectator’ in media society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436471">Lehmann, 2006</xref>: 183). Unlike the logic intrinsic to television and more precisely, to cite Samuel Weber, that ‘catastrophes will always stay outside, will always be “objects” for a “subject”’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436471">Lehmann, 2006</xref>, 184), Yang foregrounds the ‘closeness within distance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436471">Lehmann, 2006: 110</xref>), as opposed to the detached proximity implicit in new forms of broadcast. As a consequence, in contrast to the distortion and panic in the media that accompanied AIDS and HIV (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712436471">Watney, 1987</xref>) and elided the act of communication, Yang reclaims the art of moderating a story: slide after slide of the life of the dead and dying in <italic>Sadness</italic> reinstates the function of theatre as a public forum.</p>
<p>From this perspective Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> arguably references the history and tradition of ancient Greek drama and more precisely, the significance of tragedy as a form of public exchange for the citizens of Athens to debate the ideological problems confronting the city-state in the fifth century, and most notably the emergence of democracy. In his theorisation of postdramatic theatre Lehmann applies the Greek word specifying the space of the spectators, ‘theatron’, to argue, that new forms of theatre focus on this axis of communication, as opposed to intra-scenic dialogue and action (2006: 127). What Lehmann conceptualises as a shift from dialogue on stage to a dialogue between the performer/s and audience hinges on the production of what he refers to as the ‘<italic>self-interrogation, self-exploration</italic>, <italic>self-awareness</italic>’ (2006: 105, original emphasis) of all the constituents in the medium. Here, theatre is emphasised as a situation, as opposed to fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436471">Lehmann, 2006</xref>: 128). <italic>Sadness</italic> exemplifies this approach to theatre and Yang’s direct mode of address intensifies the line of communication between the performer and spectator. Implicit in his refusal to direct the audience’s response to his ‘life stories’, however, is an acknowledgment of the complexity of audience participation in the production of meaning that constitutes the theatre situation. As a consequence, Yang’s style of performance as a form of personal encounter begs a consideration of the politics framing representational discourses for the spectator.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363460712436471"><title>Queering the Australian citizen-body</title>
<p><italic>Sadness</italic> contests the imaginary of the Australian citizen-body tied to the ANZACs by offering the audience stories of ‘queer’ social subjects and in doing so, resists the normalising project of Anglo-Celtic Australian drama.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1363460712436471">15</xref></sup> From the national self-image and iconography of the bushman of the 1890s, the ANZAC digger and battler emerged to epitomise anti-authoritarian and egalitarian ideals and a national type exclusively masculine, white and heterosexual; a rough, rural identity that practised the highly idiosyncratic form of belonging expressed as ‘mateship’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1363460712436471">16</xref></sup> High profile Australian playwright David Williamson, while critical of the ideal of mateship, like a number of other New Wave playwrights in the 1960s and 1970s, perpetuated this image of the national type, as well as emphasised the significance of mateship to the social infrastructure in Australia through personifications of the middle-class ‘ocker’ in plays such as <italic>Don’s Party</italic> (1973, first performed in 1971).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1363460712436471">17</xref></sup> In doing so, the New Wave crafted an iconic Australian repertoire that built on Ray Lawler’s <italic>Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436471">1978</xref>, first performed in 1955) and the precedent of the quintessential Australian story of Roo and Barney, canecutters from Queensland transplanted in the 1950s to working-class Carlton.</p>
<p>In contrast to this image of Australia, Yang’s odyssey presents a portrait of the gay community in Sydney, and, more broadly than his family, the Chinese in Australia, through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang refers to as ‘Chinese artefacts’ (1996: 40)</xref>. These include a photograph of a joss house in Atherton, a Chinatown in Broome, a burning tower in Beechworth and a Chinese mining shaft in Pine Creek. Each ‘artefact’ graphically illustrates a narrative erased by the foundational myths of the nation that contemporary examples of performance commonly designated multicultural drama have attempted to recuperate in Australia. Yang notes that the last shop run by Chinese in Cooktown closed in 1954 and that there are no longer any Chinese in the town, but that a shrine remains in the Chinese section of the cemetery. Similarly, he points out that that the Chinatown in Broome exits intact today on the basis that it was bought as a tourist attraction. Yang subsequently projects images of traces of ordinary daily life, historical and contemporary, that dispute dominant systems of cultural representation; the enduring legends of the bushman and its manifestation in the Anglo-Celtic, heterosexual, urban masculine citizen-subject. While Yang’s journey into his family history and the story of his paternal grandfather, Ah Young, for example, following the goldfields in the north of Australia contests early formative ideas of national self-image, his portraits of the gay community challenge more recent discursive constructions of the citizen-body.</p>
<p>Citizen-building has operated as a precondition of nation-building in Australia (J Uhr in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436471">Dyrenfurth, 2005</xref>: 90). It functions to shore up the myth of solidarity for the polity. Citizenship is subsequently ‘at the heart of Australian politics’ (J Chesterman and B Galligan in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436471">Dyrenfurth, 2005</xref>: 88) and reflects a particular iconography; from the home-centred, industrious masculine subject of the Menzies era (1939–1941; 1949–1966) to the ‘cosmopolitan Australia’ of Whitlam’s term (1972–1975) and the moral images of the family distinguishing John Howard’s (1996–2007) recent 11-year leadership of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1363460712436471">18</xref></sup> Difficult to define categorically, citizenship (<italic>politeia</italic>) traditionally refers to the nature and conditions of social and political membership and subsequently, functions as a source of inclusion and exclusion at the level of the individual in democratic society. It is a complex appellation broadly marked by distinction: firstly, as a formal-legal-status bound to the existence of the state, and secondly, as an elaboration of the citizen as a political actor; state citizenship and democratic citizenship respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712436471">Stewart, 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1363460712436471">19</xref></sup> As a consequence, citizenship is not simply constituted by rights and responsibilities, but political identity; and for the seminal British sociologist in the field, TH Marshall, shared identity inferred national unity (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436471">Kymlicka and Norman, 1994</xref>: 369). From this perspective ‘imaginings’ of the citizen are integral to the ‘imagined political community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436471">Anderson, 1991</xref>: 6) of the nation. A citizen ‘imagines’ him/herself as part of a community on the basis of a sense of shared language and connections to social and political institutions and so forth; that is, as a member of a culturally intelligible paradigm.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising, then, that definitions of citizenship have been contested throughout history and subject to transformation. Inherent in the concept of citizenship is not simply the delimitation of the human subject to an inclusive model of ‘common’ rights, duties, values, but also identity. Citizenship, as the booklet <italic>Becoming an Australian Citizen</italic>, released by the Howard government explains, is ‘at the heart of Australia’s national identity in the 21st century’ and cultural diversity is a ‘strength which makes for a dynamic society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712436471">Commonwealth of Australia, 2007</xref>: 7). Despite the rhetoric, citizenship fails to negotiate the unequal forces and interests in operation in the nation. Not all citizens are recognised and treated equally, as Yang demonstrates in a performance that contributes to the project of redefining Australian identity. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436471">Tompkins (2001)</xref>, it is an uneasy process of reconfiguration on the basis of the disparate communities that constitute Yang’s Chinese homescape and that of the gay community. In this respect Tompkins points to the issues confronting theoretical approaches to citizen identity. For cultural pluralists the question of citizens excluded from ‘common culture’ because of socio-cultural identity, such as Aboriginal people and gays and lesbians, presents the challenge of ‘differentiated citizenship’ based on group membership, a radical development for citizenship theory in Will <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436471">Kymlicka and Wayne Norman’s survey of the field (1994: 370)</xref>. Not only does this approach raise the problem of the relationship of the individual to the legal system key to existing modes of citizenship, but it also points to the <italic>raison d’être</italic> of queer theory.</p>
<p>Queer theory emerged in the 1990s to critique feminist, gender, and gay and lesbian studies on the basis that that these categories of analysis excluded a range of constituents, including, transsexual and transgender people, to propose the term ‘queer’, to cite Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436471">Butler, ‘a site of collective contestation’ (1993: 228)</xref>. Yang exemplifies the complexities of identity positions in <italic>Sadness</italic> by referring to the group, Asian Lesbian and Gay Pride, dedicated to developing self esteem for the ‘Asian in a predominantly Anglo gay community, a minority of a minority’ (1996: 14). ‘Queer’, subsequently, acknowledges the exclusionary operations of identity categories and for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436471">Butler this is imperative to the on-going democratisation of queer politics (1993: 227)</xref>; an imperative that attains significance in relation to any approach to citizenship based on group affiliation. In one of the founding texts of queer theory, <italic>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</italic>, originally published in 1990, Butler’s critique of the totalisation of gender norms in feminist literary theory demonstrated the regulatory practices that produce and limit the fiction of the coherent subject according to a heterosexual matrix of intelligibility. For Butler identity is an <italic>effect</italic> of discursive practices and a normative ideal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712436471">Butler, 1999 [1990]</xref>: 23–24, 187) dependent upon performativity. That is, ‘a reiteration of a norm or set of norms’ that ‘conceals or dissimulates the conventions of which it is a repetition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436471">Butler, 1993</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>From this theoretical perspective the status and legitimacy of the subject is determined by the rules governing socio-cultural, and by extension political, intelligibility. As a consequence, the reading strategy deployed by Butler and more broadly, queer theory opens up the question of citizenship as a site critical to the production and configuration of national identity in Australia. Full membership of a political community as a juridical and democratic citizen points to the extent and quality of participation in society and subsequently raises the exclusionary politics of identity. If on the national stage identity is dependent upon the ‘imagined’ Australian citizen, as is suggested by the significance of citizen-building to the nation, the citizen-body is framed according to a taxonomy that naturalises and integrates the concepts identity, citizen and nation. It is a taxonomy that regulates the perpetuation of the polity ‘in the face of mortality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436471">Feit, 2005</xref>): the nation-state, historically steeped in notions of race and gender, is dependent upon the performativity of the sexed body. That is, the literal reproduction of its populace according to hegemonic norms and modes of social identity. At issue here is the ‘matrix of intelligibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712436471">Butler, 1999 [1990]</xref>: 24) that renders natural, and arguably imperceptible, the production of knowledge that institutes the logic of coherence and continuity for the citizen-body.</p>
<p>Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> denaturalises, if not dismantles, hegemonic subject positions to critique the normalising apparatus of the body-politic in Australia. Each of his ‘portraits’ refutes stable identity formation and effectively ‘queers’ the imaginary of the Australian citizen-body. Yang reinscribes the Chinese diaspora in Australia, but in doing so, foregrounds forms of intimacy that challenge racialised codes of heterosexuality. He introduces members of his extended family in the production and the breadth of identities that emerge ‘trouble’ essentialised racial categories based on national heredity. Kristine, for example, is the daughter of his late cousin Dora Wing. Dora married a Latvian cane-cutter, Martin Zarins, who settled in Innisfail in North Queensland after the Second World War. Their five children all married Australians and as he displays a slide of his grand nieces and nephews he points outs that the children are fifth-generation Australian in addition to a quarter Chinese and ‘[i]t takes a hundred years to get a blend like that’ (1996: 29). Yang’s fifth-generation ‘blend’ appears to correspond to the 1993 <italic>Time</italic> edition called ‘The New Face in America’ dedicated to the miscegenation of the American nation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436471">Berlant and Warner discuss in their article ‘Sex in Public’ (2000: 312–314)</xref>. Here, Berlant and Warner point out that racism is elapsed in the ‘transfiguration of the immigrant into a nostalgic image to shore up core national culture and allay white fears of minoritization’. What is not spoken in this projection, as Berlant and Warner emphasise, is ‘national heterosexuality’ as the normalising apparatus behind the notion of a core national culture or what is articulated locally as the ‘social essence’ that distinguishes mainstream Australia (G Hage in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436471">Dyrenfurth, 2005</xref>: 102).</p>
<p>A familial model of society dominates <italic>Time</italic>’s portrait of the nation. In contrast <italic>Sadness</italic> offers scenes of intimacy, coupling and kinship that challenge the function of the family as the privileged agent of social existence and in doing so, the iconography of the citizen that has shaped Australia’s cultural history. As a consequence, Yang’s production is not simply an exploration of kindred allegiances, familial and sexual, but an expression of ‘queer’ identity. In <italic>Sadness</italic> the ‘personal life’ of the performer raises for the spectator the question of the exclusionary logic of heterosexuality and its manifestation as a ‘blood’ strategy of kinship, or bloodline of continuity and belonging, co-opted by the modern nation to counter the eternal ‘threat’ of mortality. From the unjust ‘fate’ of his uncle and the legacy that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436471">Yang feels he inherited in so far as his ‘ethnicity was suppressed’ (1996: 69)</xref>, Yang presents the ‘fate’ of family and friends in <italic>Sadness</italic>, and it is a ‘fate’ that signifies death in the sense that ‘queer identity’ is already outside the economy of continuity that links the identity of the reproductive citizen to the nation. While the ancient stage actualised the anxieties intrinsic to the emerging citizen-body of democratic culture and the subsequent abjuration of mortality through myths, spirits and archetypes, Yang’s <italic>Sadness</italic> defies the norms of the Australian stage, its dominant scenes of representation and reproduction, to present a ‘portrait of mortality’ that exposes a long standing fear of ‘queer desire’ and death.</p>
