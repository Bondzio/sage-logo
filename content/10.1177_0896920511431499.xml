<abstract>
<p>Taking the contemporary political activism of ‘the Global Justice Movement’ as an illustrative case, this article scrutinizes some influential theoretical ideas about the consequences of ‘individualization’ for collective political action. Quite often, this process is seen as implying a new politics of individual life style – ‘life politics’ – which is associated with new social movements and claimed to have gained importance since the 1960s, on the expense of the collective ‘emancipatory politics’ being associated with ‘old social movements’ such as the Labor Movement. In the light of the article’s empirical findings, this alleged division between life politics and emancipatory politics is questioned, and it is argued that these two kinds of politics should be understood as intertwined practices. The article’s theoretically grounded analysis is based on quantitative data from a survey of participants at the fifth European Social Forum. These data are interpreted and further explored using qualitative interviews with activists.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades, the emergence of ‘new social movements’, as well as the general crisis of the party system (indicated by declining membership within political parties), has been thought to express a radical individualization in society. Within the primarily Western debates about these developments, a more extensive focus on self-expression, individual autonomy, identity, struggles for cultural recognition in society, and a more critical stance towards the functioning of parliamentary democracy are often pointed to as central examples of this broader development (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511431499">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511431499">Fraser, 2005</xref>). Frequently, such claims rely on an implicit or explicit idea that individuals have been increasingly ‘disembedded’ from the different types of collectivities and organizations that had structured social and political life during an earlier period of modernity, and for this reason, social movements tend to be understood as expressions of a radicalized ‘individualization’ of contemporary society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511431499">Beck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511431499">Castells, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">1991</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511431499">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding political action, a supposed unwillingness on the part of individuals to subject themselves to collective structures, norms, or identities, has either been interpreted as the cause behind the turn toward ‘life-political forms of action’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511431499">Thörn, 2002</xref>), or as the result of ‘artistic critique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski, 2002</xref>). These two concepts imply a transformed understanding of the relationship between the individual and the collective within social movements, as well as within society at large. In some influential accounts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1991</xref>), this characterization of contemporary political action ends up positing a sharp distinction between, on the one hand, a new politics of individual life style, which is claimed to have gained importance since the 1960s and is associated with new social movements, and, on the other, an older collective emancipatory politics, which is often portrayed as having lost its primacy and is associated with the ‘old social movements’ (and the Labor Movement in particular).</p>
<p>This article seeks to scrutinize this polarized account of an ever-increasing individualization happening on the expense of collective emancipation, and takes the contemporary political activism of ‘the global justice movement’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511431499">2</xref></sup> as an illustrative case. In light of our empirical findings, we question the alleged division between life politics and emancipatory politics. To grasp the complexities of contemporary social movement activism, we argue that these two kinds of politics should be understood as intertwined practices. Moreover, we will argue that in order to speak about individualization, one must also situate that concept historically. In contrast to the notion of individualization as a process that has become radicalized during contemporary modernity, we propose instead that this supposed change – of the individual’s relationship to collective political action and collective belonging – is better thought of as a transformation grounded in epochal shifts within modernity. As such, it expresses a qualitatively different interpretation of individual autonomy than those proposed during earlier epochs of modernity. This argumentation will be supported by some central ideas in Peter Wagner’s theory of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511431499">Wagner, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511431499">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To elaborate these questions concerning the relationship between life politics and emancipatory politics, we offer a theoretically grounded analysis of quantitative data gathered from a survey of Global Justice Movement activists participating in the fifth European Social Forum (held in Sweden 2008). These data are interpreted and further explored using qualitative interviews with Swedish activists from the movement. This movement context is of particular interest since it consists of different contemporary political actors belonging to both ‘old social movements’ (the Labor Movement) and ‘new social movements’ (environmentalists, feminists, peace activists, etc.), making it possible to analyze whether there are differences between these groups. Given the fact that the Global Justice Movement encompasses a wide range of contemporary political activism, we believe that an analysis of this diverse movement context will enable us to spot more general developments among movement activism at large.</p>
<p>In the present analysis, we focus on the activists’ norms and attitudes, as well as their actual political action repertoires, and we look at how these factors differ between activists from the new versus the old social movements. These norms and actions are understood to be either ‘life-political’ or ‘organizational belonging’ oriented. By ‘life-political’ oriented, we designate political actions that are possible to perform on one’s own, as well as those political values that promote diversity, self-fulfillment, and independence from political parties and institutions. In contrast, we designate ‘organizational belonging’ oriented as those actions that presuppose organizational membership, and those values that give priority to loyalty towards the collective or prioritize collective political efforts directed at political institutions. These latter kinds of actions and values are thus understood as being structured by the individual’s belonging to a group, or by an idea of the centrality of ‘belongingness’. It should be emphasized, however, that such a distinction, between ‘life-political’ and ‘organizational belonging’ oriented action, does not distinguish between individual and collective action, since <italic>all forms of political action are more or less collectively oriented</italic>. Thus, life-political forms of actions are also considered as instances of collective political action (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511431499">Micheletti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511431499">Sörbom, 2010</xref>: 16 f.). What makes the latter different is that they do not presuppose formal organizational belonging, but are enacted on the basis of values emphasizing independence from formal political organizations.</p>
<p>The article has three sections. In the first section we will discuss how our core concepts – individualization, life politics, emancipatory politics, artistic critique, social critique, and belongingness – might be conceived of in relation to a wider discussion regarding the transformations of modernity, and more specifically, in relation to our understanding of political activism and social movements. In the second section, we will introduce our methods and the basis of our empirical analysis. Here, we will focus on the activists’ attitudes towards their own political engagement, as well as their actual political action repertoires. Which political actors and institutions are given prominence according to the notion of politics embraced by these activists? Do they primarily prefer acting politically through organizations, or do they prioritize political actions carried out on an individual basis and independently of organizations? Our focus in this section is on the activists’ ideas about party politics, representative democracy, and the perceived role of activism vis-à-vis political institutions. To this end, and given its relevance for our interpretations, we will also discuss the role of ‘social critique’ and the critical stance towards neo-liberal capitalism that these activists express. In the third and final section, we move to a broader discussion of our findings in relation to this article’s main theories and concepts. Based on our findings, we offer a critique of the notion of individualization understood as a process that reduces the terms of the debate to an increased polarity between the individual and the collective.</p>

<title>The Transformations of Modernity: Individualization and the New Social Movements</title>
<p>Within social theory, social movements have often been characterized as actors contributing to social transformations through the creation of new forms of identities, norms, and institutions (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511431499">Eyerman and Jamison, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511431499">Melucci, 1996</xref>). The foremost historical example of this kind of political creativity would be the Labor Movement, and along with it the emergence of ‘the social question’, which in different ways came to contribute to several fundamental transformations within modern society. The creation of the welfare state, of democratic citizenship, and of institutions for managing conflicts of interest between labor and capital, were all responses to ‘the social question’ and took, as one of their main sources of criticism, utopian proposals and alternative modes of life that had been initiated within social movements. Since the 1970s, these ‘old social movements’ have commonly been contrasted with the ‘new social movements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511431499">Melucci, 1989</xref>) that developed from the 1960s and onwards. These latter movements appeared, for instance, with student protests, the demonstrations against the Vietnam War, the ‘new left’, environmentalist, feminist, and civil rights activism. In many senses, these new movements responded to both the latent and open conflicts that characterized post-war liberal-democratic welfare society – that is, the type of society that had resulted from the different ways in which ‘the social question’ had been solved. The new social movements therefore aimed much of their criticism at the hierarchies, privileges, and exclusions of that order. Furthermore, in contrast to the Labor Movement, these new movements have often been portrayed as being more occupied with questions of self- fulfillment, cultural identity, and decentralized autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1991</xref>). Instead of wanting to conquer and transform the institutions of the state, they have been seen as primarily seeking new spaces for political action outside of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511431499">Melucci, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One fruitful way of grasping these transformations from the 1960s and onwards is to see them as expressions of that shift designated in Peter Wagner’s theory of modernity as the decline of ‘organized modernity’, that is, the decline of the type of society that emerged during the first part of the 20th century and was consolidated in the post-war years (particularly if one focuses on the European and North American experiences). In contrast to both the ‘modernization theory’ of the mid-20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511431499">Nolte, 2001</xref>), and various influential contemporary theories of modernity (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">1991</xref>), the notion of ‘successive modernities’ attributed to Wagner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511431499">Arnason, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511431499">Carleheden, 2006</xref>) implies a conception of modernity which conceives of it as neither a linear evolution nor a refinement of a predefined set of institutions, but rather as a cultural condition that periodically undergoes crises regarding how its fundamental characteristics are interpreted and realized in institutions, norms, and conducts of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511431499">Wennerhag, 2010</xref>). Such a contextualization takes into account both historical change and the complexities of modern society and can thus contribute to a better understanding of the transformations of social movements and politics.</p>
<p>In Wagner’s periodization of modernity, two crises within Western societies are identified. The first spans the mid-19th century to the years around the turn of the 20th century and culminates in a large-scale transformation of the organization of society, mainly during the first decades of the 20th century. This first crisis marks the transition from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511431499">Wagner (1994</xref>: 16 f.) calls ‘restricted liberal modernity’ to ‘organized modernity’. Generally speaking, this process was concerned with managing the demands of the masses, who were increasingly to be included within the social and political order, and how autonomy, or self-government, could be broadened without threatening its depth – that is, how more people could be granted real liberties and rights without limiting liberty at large.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511431499">3</xref></sup> During ‘organized modernity’, autonomy was mainly realized in collective forms. Within the framework of what can be seen as an ‘ethic of belongingness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511431499">Carleheden, 2006</xref>: 66), autonomy during this epoch of modernity was interpreted as something that was best realized through the individual’s loyalty to those organizations to which she or he belonged; thus, it was not only through indirect mechanisms of representation, but also through this ‘belongingness’ that newly formed mass institutions of society gained their legitimacy. Within this interpretation of autonomy, an individual entered institutionalized politics mainly through membership in organizations. In the case of the Labor Movement, for instance, autonomy would have meant membership in class-based political parties, trade unions, and other organizations. These not only made possible the participation in large-scale political processes, but also produced forms of identification and predictability that structured and reproduced the conduct of life of the individual.</p>
<p>What Wagner labels the second crisis of modernity began in the 1960s, and can be thought of as a departure from the concrete realizations of autonomy achieved during organized modernity. For Wagner, this second crisis gave rise to a subsequent transition from ‘organized modernity’ to ‘extended liberal modernity’ (an epoch considered as not yet fully realized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511431499">Carleheden, 2001</xref>: 103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511431499">Wagner, 2001b</xref>: 9951). Based on a desire to both broaden and deepen autonomy, the essential institutions and forms of legitimacy that had characterized organized modernity were now called into question. Often, social movements were important for raising this critique, which was aimed at the hierarchical and static functioning of both the welfare state and its political institutions, as well as at the uniformity of everyday life created by mass consumption and industrial society. These essential parts of organized modernity were considered incompatible with a notion of autonomy that prioritized diversity, self-fulfillment, and decentralized self-government. The new social movements of this period questioned the idea that the representative party structure, including its associated institutions, was the only means for acting politically. And thus, people began to think of politics as something that concerned not only power in the parliament, but also as something that involved power relations at home, at work, or in the neighborhood. Within the new social movements, political forms thought to increase diversity, creativity, and individual expression were given priority. Political parties, trade unions, and other more traditional forms of political organizations were increasingly considered as too hierarchical, narrow, and homogenous. In general, the representative political system was thought of as delimiting the autonomy of the individual. As a consequence, the new social movements often searched for political spaces and forms of expression <italic>outside of</italic> parliamentary democracy and party politics. Moreover, these new social movements often expressed social belongings and identities other than class, such as gender, generation, sexuality, race, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>A similar description of these transformations within modernity, but one that leads to rather different conclusions, can be found in the more influential theories of Anthony Giddens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511431499">4</xref></sup> In this account, the changes in forms of political action associated with new social movements are thought to simultaneously announce and express a radicalized individualization of contemporary society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1991</xref>). This individualization is seen as reflecting a more extensive will among people in general to shape their lives and express their political attitudes through individual choices thought to be independent of collective identities. Giddens describes the shift as a transformation from ‘emancipatory politics’ to ‘life politics’, and accounts for their difference along the following lines:<disp-quote>
<p>Life politics does not primarily concern the conditions which liberate us in order to make choices: it is a politics of choice. While emancipatory politics is a politics of life chances, life politics is a politics of life style. Life politics is a politics of a reflexively mobilized order – the system of late modernity…. It is a politics of self-actualization in a reflexively ordered environment, where that reflexivity links self and body to systems of global scope. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1991</xref>: 214)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, in contrast to emancipatory politics, which had aimed at universalizing a high standard of living and the possibilities of having a good life, Giddens claims that life politics is a politics about life style, identity, and one’s own well being. According to Giddens, this politics is expressed foremost through everyday choices.</p>
<p>In Giddens’s characterization of contemporary politics one can thus find a sharp distinction between a politics of individual life style, where the new social movements are seen as a typical example, and a collective emancipatory politics, which takes older social movements like the Labor Movement as its model. At the same time, life politics is portrayed as having gained a greater importance, with emancipatory politics becoming less relevant over time. As will be more fully developed in the final section of this article, such a polarization between these two forms of politics, as well as Giddens’s characterization of historical transformations of the social in terms of an emancipatory politics being gradually succeeded by life politics, leads to a quite problematic account, particularly if one wishes to understand the dynamics of contemporary politics.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the problematic polarizing qualities of Giddens’s theory, we find that the works of Luc Boltanski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511431499">Boltanski and Chiapello, 2005</xref>) provide a firmer basis for understanding the relationship between individual and collectively oriented notions of political action. In these works, the protests of 1968 are taken as a point of departure, and the criticisms put forward during that era are analyzed with respect to the social transformations that have occurred in subsequent years. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski (2002</xref>: 8 f.), these protests were based on two forms of critique, which he labels ‘social critique’ and ‘artistic critique’, and reflect two different conceptualizations of autonomy. For Boltanski, these two attitudes towards autonomy were by no means new; throughout modernity, they have been essential to social movements, especially in shaping how these actors justified their knowledge interests in and struggles against the shortcomings of capitalism. Through social critique, issues of inequality, poverty, and exploitation have been raised, while at the same time mistrust for the kind of individualism that undermines equality and social solidarity has been expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski, 2002</xref>: 6). The typical exponent of social critique was, according to Boltanski, also the Labor Movement.</p>
<p>While organized modernity can undoubtedly be thought of as a response to precisely the kind of critique articulated by ‘the social question’, artistic critique is understood by Boltanski to have had its social basis among intellectuals and artists who believed that capitalism and industrialization reduced individuals to one-dimensional beings. The broad ideals of artistic critique were therefore, according to Boltanski, liberation and individual autonomy based on notions of uniqueness and authenticity. But more precisely, this type of critique was based on resistance to oppression (for instance, the discipline of the factory or the dominance of the market), the uniformity of mass society, and the tendency of social relations to be transformed into commodities. It is in this respect that it differed from the issues of unequal distribution that were held to be of primary concern within social critique.</p>
<p>According to Boltanski, <italic>both</italic> of these critical stances were central to the protests of the 1960s, even as the social changes that ensued were more in line with the goals of artistic critique and often implemented at the expense of the demands and objectives of social critique. For example, the restructuring of labor organization through the introduction of autonomous ‘teams’, flexible working hours, and efficiency salaries were responses to artistic critique and led to a transformation of working life, while at the same time, those institutions that had been created in response to earlier social critique-type demands were weakened (such as labor unions, the welfare state, etc.). Income inequality increased, but was accepted largely because of a widespread perception that the old hierarchies had been transformed into the new and supposedly more just forms of working life that were emerging. Within the social movements, political demands grounded in artistic critique were elevated, such as the emphasis on individual autonomy, authenticity, and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski, 2002</xref>: 9; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511431499">Fraser, 2005</xref>). As noted earlier, this emphasis is understood as an essential political feature of the new social movements, not only with respect to their priorities, but also regarding their attitudes towards how politics should be pursued. Boltanski’s study thus sheds light on how social movements contributed to the restructuring of society from ‘organized modernity’ to what Wagner has called the ‘extended liberal modernity’ of our time. Moreover, his work describes how the interplay between these movements’ various types of critique, and the social transformations that came to pass as a result, have also shaped the contemporary critique of those movements.</p>
<p>Importantly, Boltanski’s account of this development does not suffer from the same types of problems that Giddens’s does. Even though Boltanski analyzes a historical transformation of norms and practices, he does not portray this change as a one-directional development in which one type of critique, being the opposite of another, is unavoidably gaining importance at the expense of the other. Rather, social and artistic critique are seen as two historically significant forms of critique, indeed drawing on the tensions inherent in modernity, but still being based on different ways of assessing social developments as well as prescribing desired political changes. In the analysis of concrete historical situations, these forms of critique are nevertheless seen as intertwined and influencing each other, and their internal relationship is conceived as an object for renegotiation, especially during times of crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511431499">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question thus becomes: how can the emergence of the Global Justice Movement and the protests raised around neoliberal globalization be conceived in relation to Boltanski’s line of argumentation? In the article referred to above, Boltanski cites both the wave of strikes that occurred in France in 1995 and the many globalization protests around the turn of the century as examples of a rebirth of social critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511431499">Boltanski, 2002</xref>: 11). These protests are understood by Boltanski as attempts to renegotiate the balance between social security and individual autonomy stemming from the upheavals of 1968. At the same time, we have seen that political parties and class-based associations such as trade unions (whose mode of organization was often considered to be in opposition to those of the new social movements) have been vital within the Global Justice Movement. Do these alterations imply the return of ‘emancipatory politics’ to the detriment of ‘life politics’ (to invoke Giddens’s concepts once again)? Or do they rather – following Boltanski’s line of thinking – imply that social critique and issues about social equality have been incorporated within a social movement context characterized by life-political ideals and forms of action that came into prominence due to the impact of artistic critique?</p>
<p>Taking the Global Justice Movement as an actor expressing emerging social and political forms within society at large (as once was the case of both the Labor Movement and the new social movements), in what follows, we analyze how the tension between ‘life politics’ and ‘emancipatory politics’ – or between ‘artistic critique’ and ‘social critique’ – is being negotiated within this movement context. To what extent is the Global Justice Movement organized in such a way that struggles for social equality and common projects are combined with the values of self-fulfillment, creativity, and diversity, as well as an unwillingness to be represented or have these values made subordinate to collective objectives? As noted above, some of the most influential accounts of social movements – new as well as old – tend to picture the relationship between individual and collective political action in a polarized manner. Yet, in light of our analysis of the specific case of activists of the Global Justice Movement, we question whether it is still possible to maintain such a division when interpreting the ideas and actions of contemporary social movements.</p>

<title>Methods of Inquiry</title>
<p>In order to analyze whether the norms and actions of the Global Justice Movement activists are foremost ‘life-political’ or ‘organizational belonging’ oriented, we use two types of data in this article. First, we use quantitative data from a survey of participants at the fifth European Social Forum (ESF), which was held in 2008 from September 17th to the 21st in Malmö, Sweden. Secondly, we use qualitative data and analyze 12 semi-structured interviews with activists who were involved in arranging Swedish local social forums, most of whom also took part in organizing the ESF in Malmö. The survey is used both to provide a general overview of a larger sample of activists, indicating the norms and practices that are central to the Global Justice Movement, and to make statistical analyses in order to test whether one can find differences between different groups of activists. The analysis of the interviews, by contrast, is introduced to better interpret the meaning of these differences and understand the general tendencies that the quantitative analysis indicates.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the ‘population’ of a movement is often quite hard to pinpoint (compared to, for instance, formal organizations, which often have lists of their members), a common method in social movement studies is to survey participants of specific movement events, and to choose events that are seen as being of particular significance for a movement context at a certain time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511431499">Wennerhag, 2008</xref>). Our quantitative data should thus not be taken as directly mirroring the Global Justice Movement at large. Nevertheless our sample is based on activists who participated in an event that was both large and seen as decisive within the movement itself. Furthermore, as distinct from, for instance, demonstrations, the participants of the event that we surveyed were obliged to register themselves, which enables a comparison of all participants of the event with our sample.</p>
<p>Questionnaires for the survey were distributed during every day of the Malmö ESF, primarily at the main registration table, and at the two ‘central spots’ of the forum. The filled-in questionnaires could be returned at these places, but the participants were also given the option to send them in by mail (with pre-paid postal envelopes). In total, 792 replies to the questionnaire were compiled, which can be compared with the approximately 12,500 people that participated at the Malmö ESF, according to the organizers. The overall response rate of the survey was 25.4%. Despite this quite low response rate, the sample proved to be relatively representative in relation to the nationality of the forum participants. In comparison with the organizers’ figures of the participants’ nationality, the difference between our sample and the registered participants was 18.8% (the difference for individual national groups only being a between 0.7% and 2.3% in four cases).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511431499">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interviews were done with activists working in the ‘co-ordination group’ at one local social forum in Sweden. Among those interviewed, many different experiences of party politics and social movement organizations were represented. One person was active at the time of the interview within a political party, two were passive members, and one had (for a shorter period) been a member of a political party several decades ago. One person was currently active within the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist trade union, while yet another had previously been very active within a trade union traditionally associated with the Social Democratic party. All interviewed persons were also to some extent active within the organization Attac, environmental organizations, and international solidarity organizations. During these semi-structured interviews, an interview guide was used that centered on the activists’ own experiences of and attitudes towards local and transnational social forums, summit meeting mobilizations, political parties, institutional politics, and social movement activism in general.</p>

<title>The Forum Participants’ Political Experience and Attitudes Toward Political Action</title>
<p>The survey conducted at the European Social Forum in Malmö 2008 asked activists about participation in a range of political activities during the last year. The replies make it evident that forum participants do politics in many different ways. Their activism ranges from life-political oriented forms of activity (such as participation in consumer boycotts) to organizational-belonging oriented forms of action (such as work within political parties). During the last year, 30% of the activists reported being active within a political party, 78% attended a demonstration, 16% took part in a ‘sit-in’, and 13% were involved in a strike at work. With respect to political forms of action that can be performed individually, 78% signed a petition, 66% participated in a consumer boycott, and 76% deliberately bought certain products for political, ethical, or environmental reasons. Fewer numbers had participated in more ‘confrontational’ forms of political action: for instance, 29% had practiced civil disobedience and seven percent had used violent forms of actions against property during the previous year.</p>
<p>To gain a broader perspective on these figures, they were compared with the population at large. Since the survey was carried out among activists of different nationalities, we limited this comparison to the largest subpopulation of our survey, namely the Swedish participants. When compared with a Swedish national survey, the survey from the social forum shows – maybe not unsurprisingly – that the Swedish activists have a much higher degree of political participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511431499">7</xref></sup> Among the Swedish population at large, 8% had participated in a demonstration during the last year (compared with 78% of Swedish activists) and 7% had been active within a political party (whereas among Swedish activists, the figure was 31%). Among the national population, 29% had boycotted products and 41% had bought products for political reasons (the corresponding figures for the Swedish activists being 72% and 84%, respectively).</p>
<sec id="section5-0896920511431499">
<title>Members of Old and New Social Movement Organizations, and Other Activists Within the Movement</title>
<p>Among participants at the European Social Forum one finds those who are active in both the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ social movements. As discussed earlier, the division between the ‘old’ social movements (mostly referring to the organizations of the Labor Movement) and the new social movements (mostly referring to movements addressing new types of issues from the 1960s onwards) has been a central theme within theories of social movements. In most cases, the claimed differences between these two groups have emphasized the embrace of ‘life-political’ values and forms of political action of the latter, as opposed to ‘organizational belonging’ oriented values and forms of action of the former. The mobilizations of the Global Justice Movement have often been seen to bring both the old and the new social movements together. Under the slogan ‘Another world is possible’, the social forums and the movement in general have been bringing together a diverse blend of political groups: trade unions and other organizations of the Labor Movement, the environmental, peace, international solidarity, and feminist groups that emerged out of the protests of the new social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and organizations recently formed around issues of global justice, such as Attac.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511431499">8</xref></sup> This was also the case at the European Social Forum. The questionnaire distributed at the forum asked activists the extent to which they had been members of different types of organizations during the previous year. Using the data from the forum survey, it has thus been possible to categorize and make a comparison between activists from old and new movements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511431499">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A further group surveyed declared that they did not belong to any of the organizations taking part at the forum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920511431499">10</xref></sup> While participants from this group may be active within other organizations, their entry to the forum was made on an individual basis, and they did not consider themselves to be connected to any of the participating organizations. One may well imagine this group as consisting of people that had visited the forum for some reason (for instance, out of curiosity or in company with a friend), but that did not consider themselves part of the Global Justice Movement. Yet, against this interpretation, the survey found that 69% of the group non-members do in fact identify themselves ‘quite a lot’ or ‘very much’ with the movement as a whole (among members of old and new social movement organizations, the corresponding figures were 69% and 86%, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920511431499">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, within the Global Justice Movement we find those whose participation is associated with traditional activism within old social movement organizations, those whose participation is associated with activism within new social movement organizations, and those who do not have any (declared) affiliation to any organization taking part in the forum.</p>
<p>In order to first give a sense of how these groups vary regarding their socio-demographic composition, the differences between age, gender, ethnicity, subjective class, and educational degree are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0896920511431499">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0896920511431499">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>As can be seen, there are some differences between these groups, primarily regarding age, education, subjective social class, and gender. While such data are indeed interesting and would certainly deserve a more profound analysis, these aspects of social movement activism are not this article’s main focus – thus, we will only discuss them briefly. In short, these figures are well in line with the emphasis of earlier research that the new social movements have – as have many other types of political organizations – attracted better-educated middle-class, as opposed to working-class, people (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511431499">Kriesi, 1989</xref>). We will return to these variables of social background later, to see whether they provide a better explanatory value than the categories of organizational belonging when discussing attitudes towards political activism.</p>
<p>Prior research has shown individuals to be motivated by different forms of political action on different grounds. For instance, those who use political forms of action associated with the new social movements often emphasize a preference to ‘specify the political message’ by themselves, while activists within political parties rarely express the same demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511431499">Bäck et al., 2006</xref>: 65). The question remains, however, whether a similar set of differences can be seen among those that have chosen to become active within the same movement, that is, the Global Justice Movement (their different entries notwithstanding). Such a question can be analyzed through a comparison of the three groups mentioned above: those affiliated with old social movement organizations, those associated with new social movement organizations, and those who identify as non-affiliated. At the same time, a criterion of identification has been added so that only those who consider themselves to be a part of the Global Justice Movement have been included in the analysis. Consequently, those answering ‘not at all’ to the question asking how much they identify with the movement as a whole have not been included in the analysis of this article. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0896920511431499">Table 2</xref>, the differences and similarities regarding the use of more or less life-political forms of action between these groups are shown, as well as their attitudes towards movement activism more generally, a question we will return to later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920511431499">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the group of Old Social Movement activists are involved in political parties to a much higher degree than the other two groups. Nevertheless, with respect to other forms of traditional political action – such as putting pressure on politicians or government officials (i.e. ‘use the political system’), or attending demonstrations – there are smaller differences between the activists of the Old and New Social Movement organizations than one might expect. For instance, both groups use life-political forms of action to a large extent – for instance, through boycotting or choosing certain products for political reasons. Thus, individuals within these two groups have a higher degree of political participation in general, and their political action is both collectively oriented and individualized. With respect to the third, non-affiliated, group, their political experience mostly consists of life-political forms of action and taking part in demonstrations. Despite these differences, however, when it comes to degrees of activism at the local level, the overall disparity between the three groups is quite small.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0896920511431499">14</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0896920511431499">
<title>Attitudes Towards Political Activism Among the Forum Participants</title>
<p>The questionnaire also asked the forum participants to indicate their level of agreement with some statements about political activism. These statements were constructed to force a choice between two opposed priorities, which, in general, could be said to express different orientations among activists regarding the relationship between the collective and the individual in a political context. The different statements contrasted values of belonging, loyalty, homogeneity, and system-oriented political action with (life-political) values of individual expression, self-fulfillment, diversity, and alternative forms of politics. Four binary oppositions were thus created to shed light upon the importance given by forum participants to (a) diversity versus political unity, (b) individual expression versus belonging to a group, (c) self-fulfillment versus group loyalty, and (d) creating alternative politics versus using the political system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920511431499">15</xref></sup> Given the earlier discussion of the historical shifts in the conception of politics, it seems reasonable to expect that the ideas an activist holds about how he or she wants to participate politically are affected by their affiliation with either an Old or New Social Movement organization, or if she or he elects to participate in the movement on an individual basis. This difference was therefore also analyzed, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0896920511431499">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>A statement aimed to highlight attitudes towards diversity versus unity, for instance, reads: ‘It is more important to allow for diversity than to be united around a common political strategy.’ The difference indicated by responses to this question among the three groups was mainly seen between Old Social Movement activists and the other two groups, though a majority of the former group still value diversity more than unity. In total, 66% of all activists prefer diversity. Thus, the diversity of the Global Justice Movement appears not only as an empirical fact, but also as something that is conceived of as an important value among many who are politically active within this context.</p>
<p>The attitudes towards the statements, ‘It is more important to be committed and take a stand as an individual than to be part of an organization or group’ (individual expression vs. belonging to a group) and ‘It’s more important to be loyal to one’s group, than to focus on one’s own priorities and interests’ (group loyalty vs. self-fulfillment), however, displayed less variation across the three groups. In the case of group loyalty vs. self-fulfillment, the difference among groups is not statistically significant. While a slight majority of the non-affiliated valued individual expression more than belonging to a group, the case for the New Social Movement activists was the opposite, and the Old Social Movements activists valued individual expression even less. In total, 56% of all of the activists surveyed valued belonging to a group higher than individual expression.</p>
<p>Regarding attitudes towards the statement, ‘To influence society, it is more important to use the possibilities of the political system than to create alternative ways of doing politics’ (using the political system vs. creating alternative politics), the variation between the groups is not statistically significant. Since more than two-thirds of the activists embrace the value of creating alternative politics, this value appears to be a general characteristic of their attitudes towards political action. Such is also the case for the activists of the Old Social Movements, despite the fact that 49% of them reported working in a political party during the last year.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether the small or non-existent differences among these groups regarding their attitudes towards political activism could be better explained by other factors, our results were controlled for by a regression model that also included the socio-demographic variables mentioned earlier. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0896920511431499">Table 3</xref>, these regressions show that organizational belonging explains even less when socio-demographical variables are included in this statistical analysis, and that the socio-demographic variables do not generate statistically significant differences of any greater magnitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0896920511431499">16</xref></sup></p>

<p>Standardized regression coefficients.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>For two of the statements (‘self-fulfillment’ and ‘creating alternative politics’), the age of the activists seems to have had a significant negative effect. With respect to class-related variables, educational level affects the statement ‘individual expression’ negatively and the statement ‘creating alternative politics’ positively, whereas those stating that they do not belong to any social class differed significantly in a positive direction regarding the statement on ‘self-fulfillment’. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0896920511431499">Table 3</xref>, however, the regression models as such do not provide much explanatory value for the variation in the answers to the questions about attitudes towards activism.</p>
<p>But this finding should not be taken as a non-result. Rather, it shows that these values are embraced in a similar way among the activists of the Global Justice Movement, and the small variations that do exist are not systematically dependent on either organizational belonging or socio-demographic variables. A further point follows from this finding. Even though the three groups studied often display significant differences in the kinds of political action they take part in, they nevertheless tend to show a large degree of similarity in how they value their political activism. Thus, the movement is held together by what can be seen as common attitudes towards politics, rather than a common repertoire of political action.</p>
<p>In general, these results show that while activists of the Global Justice Movement engage in life-political oriented forms of action and value diversity and alternative forms of politics, they still continue to see loyalty and solidarity with one’s group as more important than one’s individual priorities. In order to get a deeper understanding of the figures of the survey, it is useful to turn now to the ideas on party politics and movement activism expressed in the interviews made with activists in the Global Justice Movement.</p>

<title>Instead of Inert Hierarchies and Narrow Agendas</title>
<p>Despite differences in political background and organizational experience, the interviewees considered their present activism within the Global Justice Movement in quite similar ways. They also displayed similar attitudes towards activism within political parties. Often, the interviewees expressed disappointment about increasing ‘elitism’ in political parties, which they characterized by politicians’ loss of connections with their constituencies. Furthermore, the activists considered the agendas of established political parties to be far too narrow, lacking relevance for the political issues to which they felt most committed. At the same time, the organizational form of the party is often experienced as too restricted. Emma, who lacks experience working within a political party, expressed this concern as follows:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0896920511431499">17</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>I believe what one says and does is quite important. I don’t want to carry something out just because somebody else decided that it is good; I prefer to have some sort of control over what I am active in. As soon as one enters an organization, one loses a bit of that freedom…. I’ve heard many people say that they find it nice and relieving to be part of, for instance, Attac, where there are not the same types of inert hierarchies, and where everybody listens to each other in a very open manner. There is not the same sort of rigidity, which I believe is one reason young people do not want to be active in political parties.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, the unwillingness of an activist working outside of the political party form to subject herself to a homogenous and hierarchical organizational structure is well in line with what was previously shown in the analysis of the survey. In that analysis, it was also shown that this skepticism towards influencing society through the political system was strong among those working in political parties as well. In the interviews, party members, who point to the ‘rigidity’ within the political parties, raised criticism against the functioning of the established political system. For instance, Kristina, who is herself a member of a political party, stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I am still a member, but nowadays I’m not that active. It has become all too much strategies and documents … I think it has become an election-machine and I don’t want to be part of that…. I have become so restless. I want things to happen. To sit and nag in a local party association is so…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kristina describes her experience working with a local social forum as, among other things, ‘a relief’, because she felt that ‘we really made things happen’. Stig, who had been very active within a trade union, describes his experiences in a similar way. Recounting his impression of the work with the forum, he said that it was ‘wonderful to do something concrete and not only to talk about politics and the problems of the world’. In this way, the ‘rigidity’ within political parties, their hierarchies and narrow agendas, is contrasted by the activists with the sorts of political action made possible by the forum or similar movement contexts. They believe that within the movement it is possible to decide for oneself how to work politically and to choose which political issues one wants to work on. At the same time, this context is believed to enable common action (‘to make things happen’) and common discussions in open and inclusive forms (that are ‘very tolerant’, and in which ‘everybody listens to each other’). For instance, Marina contrasts this common and inclusive action with political parties’ ‘compromises and power games’. Emma discusses the same phenomenon, but points out that the lack of hierarchy, and struggle for positions within that hierarchy, is dependent on other circumstances as well: ‘There is really no need to have power over Attac in the same way as in a political party, where individuals are selected for the ballot box and then have the power to make decisions in the town hall.’</p>
<p>Despite their criticism of existing political parties, some of the interviewees, who hitherto have not been members of political parties, see it as a possibility that they will some day become members (if, for instance, existing parties were to broaden their agendas or change their mode of organizing political activities). Thus, the criticism of the role of parties and their political priorities does not necessarily imply a repudiation of political parties as such. In fact, the interviewees often stressed that social movements have an important function in relation to political parties and their politicians. For instance, Emma remarked, ‘it is quite important for a society that the politicians know that regarding almost any issues there are interested organizations that also know a lot about those issues and continue to ask: why are you doing this?’ This remark indicates a conception of self in relation to the sphere of party politics: activists understand themselves as political actors introducing formerly unnoticed issues, making it necessary for the politicians to deal with those issues, or demanding that politicians to fulfill their promises. Presently, when political parties are increasing considered ‘elite parties’ without any bonds to the people, some activists are trying to become the legitimizing, or mediating, link between people and politics that had traditionally existed <italic>within</italic> the political parties. Furthermore, such a desire is related to a specific idea of democracy, which is highlighted in the following quote by Kristina:<disp-quote>
<p>Social movements nevertheless do have a huge importance, because you can’t expect somebody to come and just give us democracy. It is something that you have to take, to conquer, and to hold on to all the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such a notion of democracy does not conceive of politics as something that only happens within rigid institutional systems, but rather emphasizes the importance of ongoing, and sometimes conflictual, tensions between institutions and non-institutionalized political actors such as social movements.</p>
<p>The overall image that emerged from the interviews with Swedish activists was similar to the one pictured by prior research on the Global Justice Movement. In her analysis of surveys made at the 2001 Genoa Social Forum and the 2002 European Social Forum in Florence, Donatella della Porta (who also bases her conclusions on focus group interviews made with participants of the Florence ESF) claims that a critical attitude towards party politics is an essential feature of activism within the Global Justice Movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511431499">della Porta, 2005</xref>: 191 ff.; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511431499">Pleyers, 2010</xref>). She further argues that this critical attitude should not be understood simply as a general dissatisfaction with traditional forms of politics. It is also a criticism of the professionalization of party politics and an expression of the sense that democracy has weakened in recent years. In addition, della Porta points out that the greater importance given to other ways of making politics, and the will to create new democratic publics, are distinct signs of a desire to redefine and broaden the concept of politics.</p>
<p>The emphasis on creating alternative forms of politics, however, does not simply imply that the activists of the Global Justice Movement view parliamentary democracy and state governed politics as useless institutions for dealing with the social problems they identify in today’s society. The answers to a question in the survey regarding attitudes toward local, national, and global institutions show that 72% of the activists think that local political institutions should be strengthened, 50% that the national parliament should be strengthened, 61% that the UN should be strengthened, and as many as 84% think that new institutions that involve citizens and movements should be built on the international level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0896920511431499">18</xref></sup> The critical position toward existing political parties, sometimes combined with an unwillingness to become a party member oneself, does not result in a general refusal to try to influence political parties; but rather, a desire to see such influence achieved in ways that are more grass roots oriented. The distrust of political parties is mostly about an unwillingness to work <italic>within</italic> them as they are organized at the moment. Accordingly, there exists an ambition to work collectively at both changing existing institutions and creating new ones.</p>
<p>It is important to remark that this ambition is well grounded in ‘social critique’, and more precisely, a critique of capitalism. In the survey, 72% of the activists agreed with the statement that capitalism should be abolished in order to tame neo-liberal globalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0896920511431499">19</xref></sup> Another survey question asked the activists to indicate the three political issues they felt most committed to among 23 alternatives. Among the most frequently chosen alternatives, one can find issues regarding the distribution of global resources (‘poverty and famine’, 35%), threats towards the welfare state (‘privatizations’, 21%, and ‘cutbacks in the welfare services’, 18%), the environment (‘climate change’, 26%, and ‘environmental pollution’, 22%), peace (‘war and rearmament’, 23%), democracy (‘threatened freedom of expression and democratic rights’, 23%), feminism (‘women’s rights’, 21%), and anti-racism (‘challenges facing refugees/immigrants and racism’, 23%). These answers do not only display a multiplicity of different political concerns within the movement, but also show how demands for economic redistribution, at both the national and the global levels, are combined with both struggles of cultural recognition and issues regarding the survival of mankind (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511431499">Pleyers, 2010</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>According to the data gained from the survey and the interviews, the indifference towards political institutions that has often been ascribed to new social movements by prior studies becomes difficult to maintain when analyzing an important contemporary social movement. Giddens’s concept ‘life politics,’ for instance, highlights aspects of political action that lack any direct connection to the institutionalized political system. A movement like the Global Justice Movement, however, hardly fits such diagnoses. The questions that are essential for the movement – such as the interest in increased economic and social justice on a global level – are not exactly reducible to concerns with one’s own everyday life, or to isolated struggles of cultural recognition. Many activists in our study expressed an ambition to reform or create new institutions in order to increase social and political equality, and, furthermore, their demands are often directed towards institutions within or connected to the parliamentary system. The many protests during summit meetings all over the globe, which have all been aimed at international institutions, indicate that existing institutions are often conceived of as opponents that one is trying to influence to change their policies.</p>
<p>What does this will to reform and create new institutions imply for the activists’ ideas on democracy in general? Here, it becomes a question of analyzing the activists’ attitudes toward parliamentary democracy through a look at their general attitudes toward the institutions traditionally associated with politics, such as the government or the parliament, and toward other political actors, such as trade unions and social movements. What is the connection between life-political forms of action and the general distrust of the political system as it is organized today?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0896920511431499">
<title>Democracy under Construction</title>
<p>In the questionnaire, participants were asked about trust in political institutions and other political actors, which can serve as indicators of the activists’ attitudes towards institutionalized politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0896920511431499">20</xref></sup> In general, the percentage of respondents expressing high trust in the institutions of parliamentary democracy was quite low. For instance, only 14% of those surveyed expressed high trust in the national government, and the corresponding figures for the national parliament and political parties were 32% and 30%. On the other hand, the activists expressed high trust in political actors associated with civil society and grass roots activism. For instance, 63% of the activists said they had high trust in trade unions, while 88% trusted social movements and associations to a high extent. It thus seems hard to claim that the low trust in existing political institutions among the forum participants was an expression of a lack of confidence in democracy as an idea. A more plausible interpretation is that their levels of trust indicate that they believe that democracy should be organized differently than it is today within the dominant institutional framework of parliamentary democracy. For example, activists’ low sense of trust towards the government, the parliament, and political parties <italic>could</italic> be interpreted as a general rejection of the idea of political representation, in favor of a view of democracy that stresses the importance of direct participation and self-government.</p>
<p>Yet, such an interpretation becomes harder to maintain in light of the fact that the forum participants had, to a large extent, taken part in general elections. Of those having the right to vote (i.e. being old enough to vote, or being a citizen), 92% voted in the last general elections. Moreover, only 2.4% of the activists stated that they abstained from voting because of a disbelief in parliamentary democracy. Thus, the rather low sense of trust expressed in relation to institutions of parliamentary democracy is most likely not due to a rejection of parliamentary democracy as an idea, or even as practice. A more plausible interpretation would rather be that parliamentary democracy is thought of as insufficient, and perhaps even misused, but still as something necessary in combination with a strong emphasis on participatory democracy. This interpretation is also backed up by other findings of the survey, in which the activists were asked explicitly whether they thought decisions in society in general should be made on the basis of delegation or participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0896920511431499">21</xref></sup> As many as 81% saw decisions being based on participation as preferable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0896920511431499">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier, in the discussion of the attitudes expressed by the interviewed activists about democracy, we saw that it was important to them to influence institutionalized political actors, while at the same time they themselves hesitated to become actively involved in a political party. One of the interviewees spoke of the importance of constantly ‘conquering’ democracy from below through activism within social movement organizations at a grass-root level, even as this work should also be undertaken in a dynamic interplay with more institutionalized actors. Similar views were raised when the interviewees were asked about parliamentary democracy. Kristina says that:<disp-quote>
<p>It is not enough voting every fourth year. It’s like I said before regarding these activities, they should be continuously ongoing; there should be discussions, at work and in the neighborhood, and it should be a question of having real influence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Involvement in party politics as such is thus not rejected, nor is participation in general elections. Rather, it is understood that democracy must be a continuous process, a part of everyday life, and not just something that occurs on Election Day. The activists describe today’s society as lacking a more profound use of participative democratic procedures, as well as giving people too few opportunities to take part in discussions about important common matters. In this sense, democracy is depicted as something unfinished and not yet realized in practice. To be sure, representative democracy is seen as an important part of a more general societal democratization. But, according to the activists, this is not enough.</p>
<p>The fact that participatory democracy is thought to be important at a basic and general level should also be understood as an expression of the ways the activists themselves would like to work politically. They do not consider it sufficient to simply vote for a political party, which is then supposed to represent them, nor is it enough for them to be active in a political party themselves, as these are often thought of as having a restrictive attitude towards alternative modes of working politically. Furthermore, the activists expressed an interest in organizing more spheres of society democratically, on the local, national, and supranational levels. At the same time, the activists favor increased opportunities for everyday democratic activism as necessary <italic>complements</italic> to already existing political organizations and institutions. Hence, on a general societal level, the activists are not interested in enforcing a model based solely on direct democracy. On the contrary, some of the interviewees were even quite skeptical about replacing representative democracy with an alternative system. This is how Marina expresses her doubts:<disp-quote>
<p>In practice, I believe that it’s really difficult to substitute representative democracy. You can dream of a more level system of democracy – direct democracy and things like that – but I think it’s a utopian idea to force everybody else to introduce direct democracy, I don’t think you could do that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Prior research on the Global Justice Movement has more or less unanimously argued that the views on democracy expressed by activists in the movement combines an interest in direct democracy with a disbelief in representative structures (and the delegation of power through representation) in favor of more consensus-based modes of decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0896920511431499">22</xref></sup> These conclusions are partly confirmed by our data (the views expressed by the activists were largely focused on a search for more democratic forms of action). Yet, at the same time, they did not wish to totally abandon already existing forms and institutions, nor did they advocate a radically different model of democracy for society at large. Instead, it was primarily in relation to civil society (and not to organizations related to parliamentary democracy) that activists asserted ideas about participatory democracy. It is in this context that alternative and more participatory forms of political action were advocated, as a complement to and as a necessary mediating link with parliamentary-based democracy.</p>
<p>In discussing activism and political participation in civil society, it was also apparent that a more ‘life-political’ conception of political activism held sway among activists. Such views were primarily connected to the idea that politics is something one should engage in at the level of everyday life. Certainly, some activists asserted that democracy should ultimately be deepened and spread to more spheres of society, but for most this was not a question considered to be on the agenda today. Instead, representative democracy is still considered to play an important role in today’s society, even if many are displeased by the way it is currently organized and managed. In spite of a lack of confidence in these institutions, many activists underscored the importance of voting as a confirmation and reinforcement of the popular rule that is ensured by parliamentary democracy. If one wishes to connect this view to analytical models of democracy, one may well say that the activists affirm a participatory democratic view concerning their own activism, as well as social movement activism in general (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511431499">Held, 1996</xref>). But in addition to this view, they also express a more pluralistic outlook on democracy in general, one that gives an important role to representative political structures at different levels even as these structures must always be actively connected to, and possibly influenced by, actors within civil society.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study took as its point of departure what has been described as a radicalized individualization of political action and the emergence of ‘life-political’ forms of action. Often, these developments have been thought to explain the declining interest in traditional and collectively oriented political activities (such as voting and membership in political parties). It has repeatedly been claimed that people are searching for new forms of political expressions and, for this reason, collective and emancipatory dimensions of politics have often been set against more individual-based and life-oriented approaches. The purpose of this article has been to examine the contradiction that is often presumed to exist between these two approaches by taking the Global Justice Movement as an example and point of departure for a theoretical discussion of this issue. Our survey, as well as interview data, has enabled us to study attitudes towards political participation, democracy, and political institutions among activists within the movement. We have attempted both to picture their general political activism and to put this collective action in relation to the idea of life politics. In so doing, we have compared groups within the movement based primarily on their organizational belonging, but we have also taken into consideration other background variables such as age, gender, and class.</p>
<p>To the extent that we would still wish to use Giddens’s concepts, our study indicates that activists within the Global Justice Movement are in fact <italic>combining</italic> life politics with emancipatory politics, thereby overriding the assumed contradiction between these two concepts. On one hand, activists of this movement are maintaining membership in political parties to a much larger extent than the population in general and they remain committed to reducing economic inequalities at a systemic level. Moreover, the reformation of existing international institutions in order to ameliorate social problems is one of their main interests and concerns. In order to grant social and economic equality, for instance, many activists believe that economic redistribution and market regulation must be accomplished through the use of state intervention at both the national and global levels. In these ways, the movement focuses on those very questions Giddens labels ‘emancipatory’, and, in this respect, can be understood to devote itself to what Boltanski would call ‘social critique’. In emphasizing the value of horizontal, inclusive, and participatory forms of organization, these activists express values that reflect an ‘emancipatory-political’ interest in the <italic>social preconditions</italic> of politics and political activism – that is, they are focusing on the social and economic structures and patterns of action that facilitate (or hinder) political action. On the other hand, with respect to the question of ‘life politics’, there are certainly many activists participating within the movement who do not have a particular bond to any kind of organization. A majority of them claim that it is more important to create alternative ways of doing politics than it is to use the existing political system. And along these lines, they often value political diversity more than the need to be united around a common political strategy. In addition, many of these activists remain skeptical about how those institutions associated with parliamentary democracy are operating today, and for this reason, they underscore the importance of politics being a part of everyday life. Here one can see how ‘artistic critique’, with its questioning of conformism and hierarchies, has also become important for how these activists understand their own actions and society at large.</p>
<p>The Global Justice Movement – seen as an example of contemporary political activism – joins life politics with emancipatory politics and intermingles social critique with artistic critique. While it remains pertinent to take note of a life-political understanding of political activism within the movement, there are other aspects to consider as well. The issues at stake for activists within this movement, including their forms of action and organization, go far beyond their own private concerns.</p>
<p>Politics is always undertaken in relation to an imagined collective or on the basis of collective values. The person boycotting products from Israel or Cuba does so according to collective ideas about how society should be organized. Furthermore, such actions are connected to other people – generally, people whom one does not know or even see – with the purpose of collectively changing the organization of society. Even as some of these activists insist on the importance of self-expression (while at the same time expressing a critical attitude towards established collective structures for political participation), they are nevertheless acting with other people to achieve aims that cannot simply be reduced to life-political interests or to their private situations. From this perspective, a focus on the self-expression of the individual does not contradict an emphasis on the need for collective action and belonging. Rather, the example of the Global Justice Movement shows how the very meanings of ‘individual’ and ‘collective’ are being interpreted in far more complex ways in a contemporary social movement than influential social theories previously have thought. And further, it demonstrates that the analytical difference between ‘life politics’ and ‘emancipatory politics’ need not be reduced to a description of political action simply becoming less ‘emancipatory’ and more ‘life-political’ during our epoch of modernity. Consequently, these forms of politics should not be conceived of as contradictory <italic>per se</italic>. This conclusion has theoretical consequences for the analysis of both political action and the forms of political organization.</p>
<p>In much of contemporary sociological theory, the transformations within modernity brought about in recent decades have been understood to express an increasing individualization and globalization of society. These processes have often been seen as two sides of the same coin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511431499">Manuel Castells (2000</xref>: 3) claims, for instance, that the two central poles in the emerging ‘network society’ are ‘the Net and the self’. At the centre of such an analysis we encounter increasingly detached individuals, whose roles and participation in territorially disembedded network structures override national borders. And along similar lines, Ulrich Beck also claims that the dissolution of the ways of life of industrial society, in favor of a global ‘risk’ society, imply that the individual can no longer rely (at least not without reflection) on the stability and certainty once granted by such collective identities as class, nation, and the nuclear family. Thus, he argues that today to a large extent it is up to the individuals themselves to ‘produce, stage and cobble together their biographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511431499">Beck, 1997</xref>: 95). Similar thoughts can be found in Giddens’s analyses as well – for example, the argument that as a consequence of the ‘disembedding’ of individuals from traditional belongings, people are increasingly left to cope and manage with ‘abstract systems’ by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511431499">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 83 ff., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511431499">1991</xref>: 17 ff.).</p>
<p>Such analyses undoubtedly describe important overall societal developments, but at the same time they tend to be somewhat polarized and rough-hewn. In these examples, the concept of individualization, with its emphasis on the importance of the individual, has a tendency to obscure the fact that people in general remain part of, and still relate to, collective phenomena. As Peter Wagner points out:<disp-quote>
<p>Much of current sociological observation converges on this weakening of the institutional grip on human beings, a process called ‘individualization’, and a simultaneous weakening of the coherence of nation- and state-bound institutions, called ‘globalization’…. Taken together, they tend to suggest that social phenomena ‘in between’ the human beings and the world are disappearing. This, however, is a claim that can hardly be empirically supported. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511431499">Wagner, 2001a</xref>: 165)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our empirical analysis confirms the picture drawn above by Wagner. Individualization does not so much entail the end of the collective dimension, but rather points to a change in the notion of the collective, as well as of its organizational forms. Such a view recalls the early Chicago school theories that saw social movements as expressions of ‘collective behavior’. Although Robert Ezra Park and Herbert Blumer used this concept primarily in order to describe one type of social action – i.e. the varieties of ‘collective behavior’ identified as the crowd, the mass, the public, social movements, etc. – they also underscored the idea that <italic>all forms of social action are to be conceived as collective</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511431499">Blumer, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511431499">Park and Burgess, 1921</xref>).</p>
<p>The same could just as well be said about life-political forms of action and political forms of action on the whole. In order to make sense of the concept ‘life politics’, it has to be understood as a kind of collective behavior that is based on different frames of cultural interpretation than those that dominated earlier epochs of modernity, and in particular the interpretative frames of organized modernity, which underscored the importance of membership and ‘belongingness’ as organizational principles of politics. Life politics does not mean a ‘dis-organization’ of political action, but rather a <italic>re-organization</italic> of it. Without such an understanding of the relationship between the individual and the collective, these new forms of action that are vital to the Global Justice Movement are misrecognized as a dissolution of earlier social bonds. Instead, these forms of action would be better thought of as examples of the creation of new social bonds.</p>
<p>In this article, we have scrutinized the theoretical perspective that claims modernity is characterized by a radicalized individualization (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511431499">Carleheden, 2006</xref>: 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511431499">Sörbom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511431499">Wennerhag, 2008</xref>: 313 f., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511431499">2010</xref>). In contrast to such an approach, which conceives of autonomy as a linear development over time, we have sought through our analysis – and with the help of Peter Wagner’s concepts – to demonstrate that the meanings of those political actions that aim to create new forms of autonomy must be interpreted in relation to the predominant cultural codes that characterize different epochs of modernity. A perspective picturing autonomy as a linear development obscures the historical fact that the norms, institutions, and cultural understandings that characterized ‘organized modernity’ were also forms of individualization, but ones based on a <italic>different interpretation</italic> of autonomy. During organized modernity, the ways in which both collective and individual autonomy were realized – foremost through the belonging to organizations and post-traditional collectivities such as class, nation, and the nuclear family – found legitimacy in a specific idea of freedom, one based on the notion that autonomy was better realized through corporatist arrangements and belonging to different collectivities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511431499">Carleheden, 2006</xref>: 65 f.). Such an interpretation of autonomy has to be seen as a qualitatively different way to understand the condition of liberty during modernity, rather than as a less developed form of this condition. In other words, rather than depicting individualization as increasing (or decreasing), we ought to describe it as changing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511431499">Sörbom, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our discussion it seems worth pondering, in conclusion, whether the fear so often expressed (by politicians, political analysts, and researchers) that people are abandoning collective political struggles (for instance, the ‘old’ social movements) in favor of more individualized forms of political action, is in fact overrated. According to the empirical evidence we have analyzed here, it is at least clear that the kind of individualization entailed by life politics or ‘artistic critique’ cannot so easily be equated with social atomization, selfishness, and sheer individual<italic>ism</italic>. Our data from the Global Justice Movement in Europe illustrates that in the space between the individual and abstract institutions, new kinds of political communities and struggles for collective political projects beyond capitalism are still being formed. Such spaces provide room for both new and older forms of collective action. Within these, it is possible to work politically, and thus collectively, on the basis on one’s own interests and values – even for those who are not interested in joining organizations related to the parliamentary system.</p>

<p>The ‘Global Justice Movement’ refers to the movement associated with the 1999 mass demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, the summit meeting demonstration during the following years, and the large alternative conferences that have been labeled social forums (in particular the World Social Forum), and that, since 2001, have been organized on global, continental, national, and local levels (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511431499">della Porta, 2007</xref>). Other scholars have also labeled this movement ‘the alter-globalization movement’ (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511431499">Pleyers, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The fundamental premise of Peter Wagner’s theory of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511431499">1994</xref>) is that the cultural self-understanding characterizing modern societies rests on the condition that, during this period, human beings begin to consider themselves as agents of their own destiny, and as beings equipped with capacities to rationally cope with such a condition. During modernity, the foremost principle characterizing society is that of the right of collectivities and individuals to govern themselves, that is, to freely and together with others establish and elaborate different forms of autonomy, or self-government. If autonomy means the freedom to create new rules for society, however, it also often carries restrictions to freedom (since rule-making in itself implies the creation of new boundaries and new forms of mastery). Consequently, Wagner considers the unsolvable tension between liberty and discipline – or between autonomy and rational mastery – as the foundation for the cultural self-understanding of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511431499">Wagner, 2001c</xref>: 4 ff.). It is out of this tension that new institutions and new forms of knowledge are created and new forms of political decision-making are instituted. As such, modern forms of self-government may be perpetually elaborated and criticized for not sufficiently furthering individual or collective autonomy. If one were to expand Wagner’s conceptual apparatus, it seems reasonable to place social movements among those type of agents that throughout modernity have been active in elaborating forms of autonomy, that is, the self-government of society. When the structural premises for the tension between autonomy and rational mastery have been challenged and renegotiated, resulting in a renewed configuration of modernity, it has often been social movements that played a prominent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511431499">Wennerhag, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Other influential social theorists have described these transformations in a way reminiscent of Giddens’s account (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511431499">Beck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511431499">Castells, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511431499">Fraser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511431499">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, we have chosen to mainly focus on Giddens, not only because he is widely referred to in these discussions, but also because his description of the changed relation between individual and collective brings forward the logics of the argument in a very concise manner.</p></fn>

<p>In short, Boltanski and his co-researchers (in particular, Laurent Thévenot) take as their starting point the idea that a plurality of different modes of justification always exist in society. These are understood to be based upon various moral models that mirror different basic normative orientations, but that nevertheless co-exist in the everyday decisions of individuals or social groupings. Normally, these modes of justifications guide everyday actions in a more inarticulate way, and frequently, their differences are neither actively reflected upon nor articulated, except in situations of crisis when disputes occur. In such situations of crisis, the actors have recourse to arguments and reasons concerning why one moral order is preferable to another, particularly when social actions of a set of actors – or in society at large – have to be coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511431499">Boltanski and Thévenot, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511431499">Honneth, 2010</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Especially in Western Europe, the organization Attac has played an important role in mobilizing the Global Justice Movement. Attac was founded in France in 1998, primarily focusing on the introduction of a tax on global financial transactions (the so-called Tobin tax), but later having a broader agenda raising issues about fair trade, third world debt, social welfare, privatizations, and the general regulation of the economy.</p>

<p>In the analysis, those reporting activism during the last 12 months in Social Democrat, Trade Union, Socialist, and Communist organizations or groups have been seen as members of Old Social Movement organizations; those reporting involvement in Environmentalist, Peace, and International Solidarity organizations were considered members of New Social Movement organizations. Those who reported involvement in both types of organizations were treated as a further ‘mixed’ category. This ‘mixed’ category, however, was manually reduced for some cases (for instance, when respondents had indicated in another question that their most important association at the time of the survey was either an Old or New Social Movement organization). In the tables of the article, this ‘mixed’ group is also included, though not commented upon. These organizational belongings were derived from the question ‘Are you, or have you ever been involved in any of the following kinds of voluntary organizations/campaigning groups?’, to which the respondents could choose between 27 different types of organizations (and give multiple answers).</p>
