<p>This book immediately attracted my attention with its two foci, second language acquisition (SLA) and conversation analysis (CA). A lot of research on SLA has been done from perspectives such as CALL (computer assisted language learning) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">Kenning and Kenning, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612446268">Warschauer and Healey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612446268">Warschauer and Kern, 2000</xref>), but this book chooses a CA methodology to study how foreign languages are used and learned in naturalistic text chat. As an interface work between SLA and CA, this study will be of interest and value to both language teachers and language researchers.</p>
<p>The book consists of nine chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the research data, drawn principally from new online relationships out of class within unfamiliar dyads of a native speaker and an intermediate learner of Italian. Such online relationships provide insights into form-focused and meaning-oriented interactions. Group discussions were excluded as they provide fewer opportunities for individual interaction and relationship building, and language learners may find it difficult to manage the interaction.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 explores the pedagogical benefits of online chat. Unlike group interactions where some learners will not have sufficient practice opportunities due to anxiety or shyness to compete with others, dyadic interactions provide learners with private and exclusive access to an expert in the target language. The learning environment is not only authentic but also optimal and relaxing, so learners will not suffer from anxiety as they might in a classroom. Compared with voice chat, text chat involves fewer technological issues and it benefits from visual saliency. While producing a communication, the learner has the opportunity to read it and may become aware of a linguistic problem and consequently be pushed to modify his/her output. Visual saliency in text chat contributes to learners noticing and seeking clarification on new lexicon used by native speaker interlocutors. Text chat encourages learners to be conscious of grammatical and lexical accuracy. By eliciting apperceived input and pushed output, online text chat facilitates and promotes language learning. Apart from the pedagogical significance, the interactions help learners and native speakers to build relationships.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 examines how turn-taking unfolds in dyadic text chat where interlocutors have different language expertise. Online chat has been regarded as an equalizer in providing learners with ample opportunities to practise in a context where turn-taking and preference organization tend to be flexible. Visual saliency and reviewability give learners more freedom to disrupt, split and reconstruct adjacency pairs to initiate repair or make corrections, which offers learners an alternative and naturalistic complement to the initiation–response–feedback pattern typical in classroom interaction. The author concludes that the interweaving of pedagogical and interpersonal trajectories contributes to learning, equality of participation and the uniqueness of dyadic text chat.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 to 7 discuss in great length the issue of repair. Although self-repair is preferred over other-repair, other-initiated repair by native speakers seems to yield the most visible immediate modified output and is acknowledged by learners. As is often the case in second language talk, other-repair is most likely to be embedded correction. However, native speaker–learner dyads frequently orient conversation to the learning of grammar and lexicon through exposed correction, which may not be accompanied by accountings or repetition of correct alternates. Therefore the author points out more attention should be paid to sequential structures of correction in future research. More research is also required in the future about the interactional relevance of repetition, for sometimes social trajectories are preferred to pedagogical ones, which is of help to develop learners’ interactional and pragmatic competence in a second language. In summary, various possibilities are available to learners in negotiation of repair in online dyadic chat. Despite the advantages, dyadic text interactions do not in some cases provide a satisfactory resolution. Paralinguistic features, sub-modes of language in Zheng’s terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612446268">2011</xref>), or body language such as facial expressions, which are available in face-to-face chat, could have resolved some problems easily. In other words, text chat, where visual mode is predominant and aural mode is absent, does have limitations.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8, the author points out areas for improvement in this study. For example, a longitudinal approach is more appropriate for studying interlanguage development. Participation structures and proficiency levels of participants need to be taken into account to evaluate language learning potential. Also, online group chat with a native speaker or teacher providing instruction requires further investigation. Chapter 9 gives specific suggestions and resources for foreign language teachers to integrate online text chat into their teaching programs.</p>
<p>Different from much other research, this study approaches language learning from a CA perspective and demonstrates how online chat provides opportunities for language learning with ample episodes of online interactions (a corpus of over 100,000 turns). Following the traditional practice of CA, the study has done detailed empirical research into online chat and draws conclusions in a deductive way. With ample data, detailed and well-argued analysis, and convincing results, it provides us with documented, observable and credible evidence and insights into language learning concerning form, accuracy, appropriateness and culture from a brand-new perspective, which makes this study unique and inspiring to language teachers and researchers. Its uniqueness lies in its special approach to SLA, large-scaled investigation, comprehensive analysis and feasible suggestions. As language researchers, we may get some inspiration about choosing a perspective or entry point when some issue is put on the agenda. Looking from a different perspective, we may enjoy a finer view.</p>
