<p>The publication of James Cone’s <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> marks a significant theological event, for it shows most vividly why this world in which we now dwell is a world that is to be revolutionized by apocalypse—the in-breaking of the reign of God in the event of Jesus Christ. It also makes clear the extent to which any Christian apocalyptic theology must be a theology of liberation. Any mode of apocalyptic thinking that does not have to do with the liberation on earth of persons who are dying under the weight of the evil powers of this world has nothing to do with the cross of Jesus Christ, and so nothing to do with the Gospel. And any apocalyptic theology that does not proclaim the liberation of those black bodies that even today continue to be enslaved, lynched, and imprisoned by the demonic powers of white supremacy is ideological and precisely thereby heretical.</p>
<p>In many ways, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> is the laying bare of such a twin ideological and heretical failure within American theology. The ideological failure has to do with the way in which some 5,000 lynched bodies—tortured bodies “dangling from southern trees, surrounded by jeering white mobs” (3)—have been abstracted from “the crucifixion of Jesus by Romans in Jerusalem” (31) and so almost completely forgotten within the American religious imaginary. This theological amnesia is symptomatic of the ideological identification of Christianity with the cultured traditions of white, Western Christendom. The heretical failure has to do with the way in which such abstraction fails to acknowledge that this Jesus “was crucified by the same principalities and powers that lynched black people in America” (158), and hence, refuses to acknowledge the defeat of these powers in Christ’s cross, and clings instead to the power of whiteness in the name of one or another of its many cultured christs. In short, it is a denial of the apocalypse of the coming reign of God in the cross and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In what follows, then, I will offer an “apocalyptic” reading of Professor Cone’s text, through a sometimes explicit (though often implicit) conversation with the work of Ernst Käsemann. The impetus for this conversation is twofold. On the one hand, Professor Cone’s identification of Jesus as “symbolically the first lynchee” (96) is in many ways his most pervasive critique of the failure of white theology to think the cross of Jesus Christ in solidarity with “the most obvious cross bearers in American society” (38). On the other hand, Ernst Käsemann is perhaps the one thinker who has demonstrated most clearly the ways in which the apocalypse of Jesus Christ exposes the false pieties and idolatrous theological constructions of white, Western Christianity. And so, I will first suggest the way in which the failure of white theology, which Professor Cone so acutely addresses, is a failure to think apocalyptically. Second, I will recast the lynching tree symbolically as a site of apocalyptic resistance to the powers of whiteness in America, with specific reference to the songs of oppressed black prisoners, as sung by Jim Crow-era chain gangs, as well as by a small congregation of women currently incarcerated in Nashville, Tennessee. In doing this, I aim to address squarely the question of what binds the cross and the lynching tree together within history.</p>
<p>Let me begin with a brief word about “apocalyptic.” Käsemann has suggested that Christian apocalyptic has fundamentally to do with living in expectancy of the imminent reign of God, to which we are opened by Christ’s defeat of the powers of this world, and whose coming is not reducible to any immanent order of things. Apocalyptic thus has to do with a kingdom whose coming to pass in the revelatory event of Christ’s cross and resurrection involves a passing away of the form of this world. I suggest that the eventual emergence of the modern, white theological consciousness has to do in part with a slackening of this imminent expectancy, and the settling of Christianity into an immanent, historical process by which the order of this world is secured by way of its self-transcending movement towards a given absolute <italic>telos</italic>.</p>
<p>My suggestion is borne out in Professor Cone’s chapter on Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr’s realism, together with his focus on this cross, “should have turned his gaze to the lynching tree,” Professor Cone says. But it did not, which leads him to ask: “Why did Niebuhr fail to connect Jesus’ cross to the most obvious cross bearers in American society?” (38). Professor Cone claims this is a failure of theological imagination on Niebuhr’s part, and that “to reflect on this failure is to address a defect in the conscience of white Christians” (32). However, the problem is that Niebuhr’s realism still trades upon a mode of modern Enlightenment reason that invests him in the givenness of this world’s power relations—and that includes especially the power of “whiteness.” This can be seen in his philosophy of history, which assumes that there are objectively discernible causal processes at work in history that are immanently and teleologically related to a transcendent, divinely rational order. Here Niebuhr’s realism remains bound to the dual ideological and heretical failures that Professor Cone’s book lays bare. If “whiteness” (and here I am following the work of J. Kameron and others) names the ideological compulsion to maintain order and structure against chaos and contingency by way of sovereign reason, then the task of white theology is to articulate from within Christianity that divine–human encounter by which God “intervenes to reconstruct the rational concepts of meaning.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573613485527b">16</xref></sup> This encounter is found in the cross of Christ, which is a symbol of both the perfect love that all human beings must expect and the tragic weight that all human beings must bear, as they strive for justice and await the fulfillment of history. The symbol of the cross thus presumes the rational meaningfulness of history, and thus the ideology of whiteness here gets its heretical inflection. That is to say, Niebuhr’s realism will not allow him to think of Christ’s cross as the breaking up and defeat of the powers of this world, but rather as the symbol of God’s ultimate “intellectual control” of those powers, and so he cannot think of the lynching tree as itself a kind of cruciform site of apocalyptic witness to the defeat of those powers.</p>
<p>Niebuhr’s realism forecloses on a real, imminent expectancy of the in-breaking of God’s reign on earth, because he sees realities like racism as symptomatic of fallen powers that belong to an immanent, natural imperfection that can be gradually remedied through these very powers’ reordering. Thus, as a matter of political expediency Niebuhr counsels African Americans “to exercise patience and be sustained by a robust faith that history will gradually fulfill the logic of justice” (35). But a Christianity of expediency is an inherently white Christianity, and Niebuhr cannot help but think that justice and freedom for black people find their <italic>telos</italic> within white progressivism.</p>
<p>The failure of white theology here diagnosed leads me thus to pose again the question that is implicitly at the heart of Professor Cone’s book: Just what is it, theologically, that brings together the cross and the lynching tree? In addressing this question, we must begin with Professor Cone’s own question: “Where is the Gospel of Jesus’ cross revealed today?” (163). Just as all theology begins with the Jew from Nazareth who turned to face the cross by turning his eyes to the sky opening upon him <italic>in solidarity with the oppressed of this world</italic>, so must our theological understanding of the lynching tree begin with the ways in which African Americans themselves faced up to the “ever-present threat of death by lynching” (17) by standing up to the imminent coming of the reign of God that is promised to them in their oppression.</p>
<p>The legacy of the lynching tree is the legacy of black bodies—the legacy not simply of black bodies subjugated to the dictates of white reason, but even more so the legacy of black bodies in determined refusal to be docile inhabitants of the white cultural habitus. One of the primary ways in which African Americans performed this refusal was through the power of song. Whether through the spirituals or the blues, singing was a way for black people to abandon their voices and their bodies to the hope and possibility of a coming “new world,” from “out of a world where the possibility of death was always imminent” (15). Singing has thus always been a way for oppressed blacks to reject the present order of this world by living in expectancy of an imminent future by which that order will be undone.</p>
<p>Such music and singing have always arisen from out of the depths of that particular space of “legal lynching” (163) that is the American prison system. One song in particular that stands out in this regard is the prison holler, “No More, My Lord,” sung frequently by prisoners of chain gangs during the lynching era:<disp-quote>
<p>No more, my Lord,</p>
<p>No more, my Lord,</p>
<p>Lord, I’ll never turn back no more.</p>
<p>I found in Him a resting place,</p>
<p>And he have made me glad.</p>
<p>Jesus, the Man I am looking for,</p>
<p>Can you tell me where He’s gone?</p>
<p>Go down, go down, among flower yard,</p>
<p>And perhaps you may find him there.</p></disp-quote>The multiple layers of this song are remarkable for their subversiveness. It begins with the promise to turn back no more, because of the rest and joy found in Christ. And to what is the prisoner promising never to turn back? The obvious implied answer is “the world.” But what is this world? It is the world structured by those very powers that crucified Christ—the world of the Romans, of the soldiers keeping watch, which is the world of white America, of the all-seeing “Man.” In this world, the white world of rational being and of cool, metaphysical order, there is no salvation, no real life. The resurrected Jesus (to which the final two stanzas clearly allude) is free of this world; in Jesus’ resurrection God has said “No!” to the powers of this world. Whereas Niebuhr’s metaphysical realism requires the ordered perdurance <italic>of</italic> this world, the experience of the black prisoner is an act of disbelief <italic>in</italic> this world. It will not do simply to reorder the powers of this world; one cannot turn to the powers of this world for help, for the “powers of this world” includes the power of those very ones doing the killing, or condoning it, or turning a blind eye to it. What is called for is rather a turning from this world, an “eschatological vision,” to quote Professor Cone, of “a world far removed from the suffering of this one” (155). But to turn from this world is to cry out for its undoing, a cry that emerges out of the hope and conviction that indeed “a change is gonna come.”</p>
<p>This cry can be heard today in the songs and litanies of a little local congregation of women prisoners that gathers weekly inside the walls of a jail in Nashville, Tennessee, which is run by the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the leader among those “private prisons” which have “turned the brutality of the racist legal system into a profit-making venture” (163). Here, in this worship, the very black bodies of women that are subjugated daily to commodification and slave labor sing and dance in a way that at once resists the powers of this world and cries out for their undoing, as heard in the verses they sing to the chorus of “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho”:<disp-quote>
<p>Now sisters, I’m a messenger</p>
<p>I’ve got something for you to hear</p>
<p>These walls, these locks, these guards you see</p>
<p>Ain’t nothin’ for you to fear</p>
<p>Yes sisters, I’m a messenger</p>
<p>There is something you should know</p>
<p>These walls you see around us</p>
<p>Ain’t stronger than Jericho</p></disp-quote>This cry for the defeat of the powers of this world takes place precisely as these women turn to face the imminent reign of God. And so, to the tune of that apocalyptic hymn, “When the Saints Go Marching In,” they sing,<disp-quote>
<p>When C-C-A crumbles to dust</p>
<p>When C-C-A crumbles to dust</p>
<p>Then I’ll know to look for the kingdom</p>
<p>When C-C-A crumbles to dust</p>
<p>Lord Jesus come! Lord Jesus come!</p>
<p>Lord Jesus come, Lord Jesus come!</p>
<p>Tear down these walls and bring your kingdom</p>
<p>Lord Jesus come, Lord Jesus come!</p></disp-quote>And yet, these women do not just sing of an imminent future that is simply “beyond” this world in a way that does not impinge upon it. Such a “beyond” would simply leave the order of this world in place, as would a simple overturning of the power relations of this world. No, these women sing of a “beyond” that presses upon this present world not by competing with the powers of the world for territory or for the right to determine history’s <italic>telos</italic>. Rather, these prisoners sing of the “beyond” of God’s coming reign in such a way as to be given <italic>here and now</italic> to live “beyond” the powers that oppress them even as they labor under their weight. This is evidenced in one of the many litanies that the women often recite together:<disp-quote>
<p>Sisters, do we gather here in freedom?</p>
<p><bold>Yes, we gather in freedom.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, what does this mean?</p>
<p><bold>Here we are not criminals. Here we are sisters and brothers.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, what are you?</p>
<p><bold>We are children of God. We are free.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, this place tells you that you have broken the law.</p>
<p><bold>Yes, it does.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, what is this law you have broken?</p>
<p><bold>It is God’s enemy. God hates this law.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, why is the law God’s enemy?</p>
<p><bold>Because it enslaves me! Because it tells me I am nothing!</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, when we gather, are things different?</p>
<p><bold>Yes, things here are different.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, why?</p>
<p><bold>Because when we gather God’s enemy is overcome.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, why?</p>
<p><bold>Because the law that accuses me has died with Christ. It is nothing.</bold></p>
<p>Sisters, why?</p>
<p><bold>Because the only law here is Jesus Christ. He is freedom.</bold></p></disp-quote>So what are we to make of these prison songs and litanies? And what is it about the apocalyptic vision out of which they are sung that binds together the cross and the lynching tree such as to make the lynching tree a site of apocalyptic resistance to the powers of this world? I think that we must say that the songs of these prisoners are a work of praise that is <italic>in excess of</italic> the logic of the powers holding them in bondage. This work occurs because Christ’s cross and resurrection have opened up an apocalyptic space out of which the oppressed of this world may at once celebrate and cry out for a coming future that can neither be forecasted nor achieved by us, nor foreseen and forestalled by the powers of this world.</p>
<p>And so, I should like finally to suggest the resurrection that constitutes the point of apocalypse at which the cross and the lynching tree come together in history. For Käsemann, the resurrection is “the basic apocalyptic event,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573613485527b">17</xref></sup> insofar as it reveals God’s kingdom to be found in the liberation of the oppressed by the crucified one. The resurrection is God’s liberation of the crucified from the dead by the undercutting of the immanent operations of this world that put him to death; as such, it is God’s “No!” to the torturers of the poor women, men, and children of this world. At the same time Jesus’ resurrection is the <italic>promise</italic> of the resurrection of every oppressed one and so sets that one free to resist the powers. As I think Professor Cone would insist, the resurrection throws us always back onto the reality of the cross, and the life of insurrection and resistance that led the powers to put Jesus to death. We too say “No!” to the powers, but this “No!” is timed apocalyptically, not with an eye towards history’s eventual <italic>telos</italic>, but with eyes and ears turned toward a coming future that transgresses completely the immanent operations of this world. The resurrection of Jesus frees us for crucifixion, frees us to act in solidarity with those who are dying. As such, the lynching tree is liberated by the cross as a privileged site of apocalyptic resistance in this world; the resurrection transforms the lynching tree, as a symbol of the cross, into a call to action, a call to work for and to celebrate life with those who are dying, precisely because the resurrection of Jesus is the overcoming of death. The lynching tree is a site of resistance because it is precisely there, in and with and under those very particular black bodies that our lives are thrown together with the resurrected crucified one.</p>
<p>And so, as Professor Cone says, “the real scandal of the gospel is this: humanity’s salvation is revealed in the cross of the condemned criminal Jesus, and humanity’s salvation is available <italic>only</italic> through our solidarity with the crucified people in our midst” (160).</p>
