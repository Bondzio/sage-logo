<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This special edition contains several of the keynote addresses presented at IEA2012, the 18th Triennial Congress of the International Ergonomics Association (IEA). This was a truly international event with attendees from more than 49 countries. Those of us who attended IEA2012 witnessed an important point in history. This was the first IEA Congress to be held in Latin America, which drew more than 300 attendees from the region. The decision to hold this IEA Congress in this part of the world showed the foresight of the IEA officers and council who made that decision and the courage of the Assocação Brasileira de Ergonomia (ABERGO) for taking on this groundbreaking challenge. The location, representation, and diverse content reflected the current global realities, growth potential, and composition of the IEA.</p>

<title>Congress Keynote Themes</title>
<p>The IEA2012 Organizing Committee, ABERGO, and the IEA Executive Committee worked diligently to assemble a high-quality, diverse, and representative group of speakers to deliver keynote addresses. In the end, they came up with 13 keynote addresses that discussed contemporary social issues, pushed the boundaries of current theoretical paradigms, and reflected the priorities of the IEA. (For a list of the keynote addresses, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iea2012.org/congressprogram.htm">http://www.iea2012.org/congressprogram.htm</ext-link>.) Moreover, these keynotes were consistent with the theme of the congress: designing a sustainable future. There were at least four themes among these keynote speeches.</p>
<sec id="section3-0018720812466409">
<title>Designing Solutions to Address Contemporary Issues</title>
<p>One of the hallmarks of our discipline is the ability to improve situations that affect the human condition. Sustainability has emerged as one of the key social issues of our day that cuts across disciplines and applications. Three of the keynotes explicitly focused on sustainability (Dave Moore, Kenji Kurakata and Georg Krämer, and Frida Marina Fischer). Four keynotes addressed using human factors/ergonomics approaches to design solutions to address aging (Kurt Landau), mining (Elias Apud), schoolbags for children (Kapila Jayaratne), and improving user interfaces (Francisco Robelo). This collection of work addressed a wide range of contemporary and design issues from an ergonomics point of view with a long-term perspective.</p>

<sec id="section4-0018720812466409">
<title>Systems View</title>
<p>A second theme among these keynotes was the emphasis placed on a systems view rather than a single cause-and-effect relationship. Complex relationships among physical, cognitive, environmental, and organizational variables are critical contextual features needed to address problems meaningfully. Waldemar Karwowski elevated our thinking in terms of human–systems integration and complex systems. The concept of <italic>emergence</italic> suggests that we cannot understand problems without the benefit of the systems perspective. In the same way, William Marras suggested a broader systems view to understanding causal pathways to one of society’s most pressing issues, occupationally related lower-back disorders. Finally, Najmedin Meshkati took a macroergonomics approach to examining large-scale systems problems. All three of these keynotes advocated taking a systems perspective to understand and solve problems in meaningful ways.</p>

<sec id="section5-0018720812466409">
<title>Industrially Developing Countries (IDCs)</title>
<p>Bringing ergonomics solutions to IDCs has been an IEA priority for many years, and this was certainly true for the 17th Executive Committee. Our discipline has the potential to design and deliver solutions to the millions of people who live in IDCs and can benefit the most from our efforts. Moreover, the availability and cost of labor in these regions make it easy to exploit humans and create suboptimal conditions. A unique feature of ergonomics is our goal to improve human well-being <italic>and</italic> overall performance.</p>
<p>Two keynotes described procedures that are emblematic of this joint optimization. First, Barbara Silverstein described an intervention that was an IEA lighthouse project to show the way for other ergonomics interventions in IDCs. This project improved the health and safety of coffee bean harvesters in Nicaragua through a participatory ergonomics basket redesign. The project was also designed to help improve productivity for the coffee bean growers to remain competitive in producing the world’s second-largest commodity. This project received technical and financial support from the IEA, universities, government agencies, and an association promoting coffee bean growers. The second keynote in this theme, by Kazutaka Kogi, described a decades-long effort to make ergonomics improvements to occupational health in practical ways. This highly successful, participatory, action-oriented approach promoted low-cost solutions, locally adjusted materials, and use of workers’ know-how. With the use of a stepwise process and a train-the-trainer delivery system, a series of programs has improved the lives of thousands of people directly. Like the coffee project, this work focused on realistic and reasonable solutions for the small enterprises that dominate IDCs. Through these efforts, organizations of all sizes can improve their competitiveness through increased productivity, reduced waste, fewer injuries, and improved work organization.</p>

<title>Our Future</title>
<p>Finally, the keynote by Jan Dul presented the results of an IEA-supported project on defining our field, and it was a first effort toward visualizing the future of our field. Together, with a group of renowned ergonomists, Dul took on the daunting task of drawing boundaries around our field, projecting it on to a future with major changes, and proposing a strategy for making ergonomics more valuable to the rest of the world. In the same way that these keynote themes have been categorized, Dul defined the three fundamental characteristics of human factors/ergonomics as (a) being design driven, (b) taking a systems approach, and (c) focusing on performance and well-being. To be relevant to stakeholders and users, we must work together and act strategically.</p>
<p>This set of articles is a microcosm of our field and mirrors the priorities of the IEA and the 17th Executive Committee in the past 3 years. We are deeply indebted to the authors for their generosity with their time and ideas and to ABERGO and the organizers for making this remarkable international event possible.</p>
