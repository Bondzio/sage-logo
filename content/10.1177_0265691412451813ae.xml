<p>The baker arranged no delivery to the prison because he knew the victims would not need bread on the following day. What more eloquent evidence of both the premeditated and the communitarian nature of the massacres of former ‘terrorists’ in Marseille in June 1795 could there be! They were not the result of crowd panics, although they did occur in direct response to the Jacobins temporarily retaking control of nearby Toulon. Like many other massacres that took place right across the Midi after the fall of Robespierre and the Jacobin government, they were deliberate reprisals against those who had governed during the Terror. Yet Sutherland does not endorse Colin Lucas’s argument that these bitter factional rivalries originated when the Jacobins ruptured community solidarity by soliciting outside intervention in local affairs. Rather, he shows that they dated back to the beginning of the Revolution. Focusing particularly on the small town of Aubagne, near Marseille, he reveals the way that the Jacobin and anti-Jacobin groups formed and mobilized across 1791 and 1792.</p>
<p>Sutherland uses Aubagne to explore not only the political but also the social roots of the local tensions that were to tear the community apart. The most politically committed, on both sides, had a fairly similar social profile, but the Jacobins drew their support predominantly from the poor, although from the peasantry more than urban workers, while their opponents largely represented the artisans and the bourgeois of the town. This was not, therefore, either a classic class or primarily economic division. Nor, Sutherland insists, did its origins lie in long-standing family or political rivalries – he utterly rejects the stereotype of the Mediterranean feud as the source of revolutionary violence. He does note some earlier connections among the activists on each side, while there were next to none observable between those who later became bitter enemies. This was thus a pre-existing social division, although not one, apparently, characterized by prior conflict.</p>
<p>This was not so very unusual a situation in revolutionary France, so the key question is why it led to such extreme violence after the Terror. The answer, according to Sutherland, is firstly that the divisions were so long-lasting and deep-rooted. But equally important was the collapse of authority that followed Thermidor, particularly marked in southern France. The failure of the judicial system to punish the Jacobins led their enemies to take matters into their own hands, further undermining a civic order already damaged by the local Jacobins’ own propensity to abandon legal forms. Here the proximity between the rhetoric and the practice of violence was far greater than in Paris, which I think should lead us to question the nature of the relationship between discourse and action.</p>
<p>For Sutherland, the Federalist revolt was particularly important in undermining civil society. In Aubagne, it was very much a continuation of existing factional conflicts, rather than being explicitly directed against Paris. Its importance for the Midi, however, lay in the repression that followed, which aggravated existing tensions and inaugurated a level of violence and extra-judicial action that would allow no going back.</p>
<p>While Sutherland describes his study as a ‘microhistory’ focused on the town of Aubagne, it is in many respects a regional history, since Aubagne was too close to Marseille ever to be able to follow an independent course. Not only does much of the book deal with Marseille, Aix, and other parts of Provence, but the patterns described were characteristic of this region but quite different from those in the west of France, Paris, or even Lyon. This was not only because of the violence of the White Terror and because of Federalism, but also because of the deep roots of local factions. For this reason, it is a pity that Sutherland does not explore the Old Regime background a little more. Despite his assertion that the revolutionary factions emerged after 1789, he offers hints that confraternities might have helped structure them. It would have been worth looking at pre-revolutionary court records to see whether the later factions had any history of violence. He does look at records of godparents to trace connections, yet these were often dictated by local custom and reveal little.</p>
<p>The great value of Sutherland’s book, however, lies in its holistic treatment of events. He skilfully integrates the social, economic, and political factors that drove the revolutionary process, and while sensitive to language and the importance of symbolism in particular contexts, he does not privilege them unduly. This study reminds us powerfully, too, that the Revolution was simultaneously a single and a multiple process, the impact of national events and broader ideologies always mediated by local tensions and particularities.</p>
