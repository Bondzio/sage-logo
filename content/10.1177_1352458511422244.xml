<p><bold>Background</bold>: The incidence of disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure during pregnancy in multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown and limited data exists regarding the potential harm of DMD exposure during pregnancy.</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To investigate the incidence and effect of <italic>in utero</italic> DMD exposure on perinatal outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: We conducted a retrospective analysis by linking two provincial, population-based databases, the British Columbia (BC) MS database with the BC Perinatal Database Registry. Delivery (duration of the second stage of labor, assisted vaginal delivery and Cesarean section) and neonatal (birth weight, gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score and congenital anomalies) outcomes were compared between women exposed and unexposed to a DMD within 1 month prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. Findings were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: In all, 311 women with relapsing–remitting MS delivered 418 singleton babies between April 1998 and March 2009. 21/101 (21%) of births to MS women treated with DMD prior to pregnancy were exposed to a DMD. In all cases, exposure was documented as unintentional and DMD treatment was stopped within 2 months of gestation. The overall incidence of exposure was 21/418 (5%). DMD exposure was associated with a trend towards a greater risk of assisted vaginal delivery compared to the DMD naïve groups (OR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0–9.2). All other comparisons of perinatal outcomes were unremarkable.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The incidence of DMD exposure was relatively low and no cases were intentional. Further studies are needed to ascertain the safety of DMD exposure during pregnancy in MS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Limited information exists regarding the incidence and potential harm of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref></sup> Most cases of DMD exposure are identified through postmarketing surveillance and pregnancy registries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref></sup> However, this information is rarely collected systematically, likely underestimates the true incidence of exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422244">2</xref></sup> and does not control for non-DMD factors that can affect pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Currently, women with MS are advised to discontinue DMD treatment prior to conceiving,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511422244">3</xref></sup> with some suggesting at least a 1 month wash-out,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422244">4</xref></sup> although others may recommend longer. Nonetheless, given that up to 50% of pregnancies are unplanned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422244">5</xref></sup> exposures to DMD during pregnancy do occur.</p>
<p>The FDA has classified interferon-beta (IFNβ) (Avonex®,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511422244">6</xref></sup> Rebif®,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422244">7</xref></sup> Betaseron®<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511422244">8</xref></sup>) as Pregnancy Risk Category C and glatiramer acetate (GA) (Copaxone®<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422244">9</xref></sup>) as Category B. Animal studies show an increased risk of spontaneous abortion associated with IFNβ,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511422244">8</xref></sup> and human studies report a potential elevated risk of preterm birth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> lower birth weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> shorter length of the baby,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> and duration of gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511422244">11</xref></sup> However, studies have often relied on retrospectively collected data from voluntary participants, thus being open to surveillance and recall bias. GA has not been associated with an increased fetal risk in animal studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422244">9</xref></sup> but the safety of GA is uncertain due to a lack of controlled trials in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422244">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511422244">12</xref></sup> We linked two prospectively collated databases, the British Columbia MS (BCMS) database and the BC Perinatal Database Registry (BCPDR), to determine the incidence and effect of DMD exposure on perinatal outcomes in women with MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511422244" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This observational, retrospective cohort study linked data from two provincial, population-based databases, the BCMS database and the BCPDR, to create a large, study-specific dataset of MS patients with pregnancies exposed and unexposed to a DMD, specifically IFNβ or GA. Since 1994, Perinatal Services BC has prospectively collected perinatal data in the BCPDR, and full provincial coverage was established in April 2000, with over 99% of births in BC captured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511422244">13</xref></sup> The BCMS database has captured clinical data for more than 80% of MS patients in BC since September 1980.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511422244">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422244">15</xref></sup> The data on MS and DMD use was generated prospectively by MS specialist neurologists and collected from four MS clinics in BC (Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver, Victoria). For the purpose of this study, data collected up to 31 December 2008 were used. These data were linked to the BCPDR by Personal Health Number (PHN), a unique identifier assigned to all residents of BC; maternal names and dates of birth were used to verify the linkage.</p>
<p>Singleton births in BC between 1 April 1998 (when the BCPDR first captured births to MS patients) and 31 March 2009 were included if the mother was registered at one of the four MS clinics, had laboratory supported or clinically definite relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) (Poser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511422244">16</xref></sup> or McDonald<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511422244">17</xref></sup> criteria) diagnosed prior to delivery. We excluded non-singleton births (e.g. twins, triplets, etc.) because they tend to be born preterm and/or of low birth weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511422244">18</xref></sup> Births to women with primary– progressive MS (PPMS) or an unknown/undetermined disease course were excluded; no DMD has been approved for use in PPMS.</p>
<p>Births were classified and grouped according to DMD exposure. The two unexposed groups were (i) births to women with RRMS who were DMD naïve (no exposure to a DMD before or during pregnancy), and (ii) births to women who were previously treated (used a DMD before pregnancy, but discontinued treatment at least one month prior to conception).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422244">4</xref></sup> The exposed group consisted of births to women with RRMS exposed to a DMD within 1 month prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The date of conception was obtained by adding 2 weeks to the estimated first day of the last menstrual cycle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511422244">19</xref></sup> which was determined by subtracting the gestational age (as determined by Perinatal Services BC based on ultrasound, date of last menstrual period, newborn exam, or a combination of the above, depending upon when the ultrasound was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511422244">13</xref></sup>) from the baby’s date of birth.</p>
<p>Comparisons of perinatal outcomes were made between DMD exposed and previously treated women to provide a better assessment of the direct effect of <italic>in utero</italic> DMD exposure since women in both of these groups used a DMD before pregnancy. In addition, the DMD exposed and naïve women were compared to assess the combined effect of long-term DMD use before pregnancy and DMD exposure during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes.</p>
<p>Clinical and maternal characteristics of exposed, previously treated, and DMD naïve women were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-squared test for categorical variables. Clinical characteristics from the BCMS database included age of MS onset, disease duration at delivery, and disability as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511422244">20</xref></sup> (EDSS) score closest to the time of delivery (±3 years). Maternal characteristics obtained from the BCPDR included maternal age at delivery, number of antenatal visits, lone parent status, alcohol, and tobacco use during pregnancy, local health area of delivery and pregnancy history (including parity, previous pregnancies, prior spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, and infants with congenital anomalies).</p>
<p>Delivery outcomes included duration of the second stage of labor, assisted vaginal delivery (forceps and/or vacuum extraction), and Cesarean section (emergency or elective). Cesarean section was analyzed among births to primiparous women only as a previous Cesarean section increases the likelihood of future Cesarean sections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511422244">21</xref></sup> Neonatal outcomes included birth weight, gestational age, and the 5-minute Apgar score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511422244">22</xref></sup> for live births only; congenital anomalies (major and minor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511422244">23</xref></sup>) were reported for both live and stillbirths. The Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (for continuous variables), Fisher’s exact test (for categorical variables with sample sizes less than or equal to 40), and Pearson’s chi-squared test (for categorical variables with sample sizes greater than 40) were used to compare perinatal outcomes in births that were DMD exposed vs. previously treated and DMD exposed versus naïve. Statistical significance was defined as a <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Perinatal outcomes were reported with <italic>p</italic>-values and where appropriate, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in this exploratory study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In all, 418 births to 311 women met inclusion criteria. A conceptual selection of women with MS and linkage between the BCMS database and the BCPDR is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511422244">Figure 1</xref>. During the study period, a total of 135 women were excluded, due to: multiple gestations (<italic>n</italic> = 8); maternal onset of MS after delivery (<italic>n</italic> = 105); mother had PPMS (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or an undetermined disease course (<italic>n</italic> = 18). In addition, there was one stillbirth (to a DMD naïve woman) and this was excluded from the analysis of neonatal outcomes of live births. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511422244">Figure 1</xref> for a summary of the number of births exposed and unexposed to a DMD.</p>

<title>Incidence of DMD exposure</title>
<p>The overall incidence of DMD exposure was 5% (21/418) of all births. Following discontinuation of a DMD during an exposed pregnancy, no mother re-initiated a DMD until after delivery. Among women who had ever initiated a DMD before pregnancy, 21% (21/101) of births were exposed to a DMD within 1 month prior to conception and/or during pregnancy; all were documented by the mother’s MS neurologist as being exposed unintentionally. All women discontinued DMD treatment when pregnancy was realised. Of the 21 births exposed to a DMD, 15 were to IFNβ and six were to GA; five stopped the DMD (four IFNβ and one GA) within the month prior to conception, nine stopped within 1 month after conception (five IFNβ and four GA) and seven stopped within 2 months after conception (six IFNβ and one GA). Thus, no woman was exposed to a DMD beyond the second month of gestation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511422244">
<title>Demographics and clinical characteristics</title>
<p>Clinical and maternal characteristics were comparable between the three groups (DMD exposed, previously treated, and naïve), apart from MS disease duration and disability (as measured by the EDSS score), which not unexpectedly, were lower in the DMD naïve group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511422244">Table 1</xref>). The local health area of delivery and previous pregnancy history (including parity, previous pregnancies, prior spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, and infants with congenital anomalies) was also comparable between groups (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is one of the first to assess the incidence of DMD exposure during pregnancy in women with MS. By using clinical data obtained from the BCMS database and perinatal outcomes from the BCPDR, this study minimizes under-reporting that may affect postmarketing surveillance studies. The data were generated by MS specialist neurologists at four MS clinics in BC, thus eliminating biases from volunteering and reporting. Our study reported a relatively low incidence of exposure to a DMD during pregnancy (5% of all births) in clinical practice; this is markedly lower than a 2010 Italian multicenter study which reported a 20% (76 IFNβ-exposed births/372 births to MS women) exposure rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> The proportion of exposed births in BC, however, increases to 21% (21/101) if one only considers women ever exposed to a DMD. In comparison, this incidence was much lower than a 2008 single-center Italian study that reported 65% (13/20)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511422244">11</xref></sup> or a 2010 Finnish study that reported a 36% (12/33) incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511422244">24</xref></sup> The incidence of DMD exposure in MS women could vary by region and individual prescribing practices. The low overall incidence of DMD exposure observed in our study may be due to the comprehensive patient education and reproductive counseling offered at the MS clinics in BC as well as the strict prescribing criteria in BC;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511422244">25</xref></sup> patients are not eligible for DMD coverage by the BC Ministry of Health if the patient is “pregnant, plans to become pregnant or is nursing.”</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impact of DMD exposure during pregnancy on the length of the second stage of labor and the risk of assisted vaginal delivery; only one previous study has examined the effect of <italic>in utero</italic> DMD exposure on the risk of Cesarean section.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> Similar to this study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> our study found no increased risk of Cesarean section for DMD exposed women relative to DMD unexposed women with MS. We also found the second stage of labor to be similar, regardless of DMD exposure. However, there was a trend for an increased risk of assisted vaginal delivery in DMD exposed versus DMD naïve women with MS. IFNβ is a cytokine that has immune, antiproliferative, and antiviral effects; however, the full biological effects are unknown;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511422244">26</xref></sup> the drug may interact with other surface receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511422244">27</xref></sup> altering maternal physiology. Our finding may also be due to the disease itself because the DMD exposed women were more disabled (as measured by the EDSS) with a longer disease duration and hence perhaps had greater neuromuscular weakness (compared to the DMD naïve women), leading to exhaustion during labor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511422244">28</xref></sup> However, van der Kop et al. reported no strong association between assisted vaginal delivery and disease duration or disability in women with MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511422244">29</xref></sup> supporting the possibility that DMD exposure was responsible for the increased risk of assisted vaginal delivery.</p>
<p>We were unable to find another published study examining the 5-minute Apgar scores in DMD exposed births. The 5-minute Apgar score evaluates the physical condition of the newborn and is strongly correlated with neonatal mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511422244">30</xref></sup> Our study found that the 5-minute Apgar score, birth weight, and gestational age of exposed babies were comparable to those from babies of DMD naïve and previously treated women. With respect to birth weight and gestational age, our findings were similar to an earlier Canadian study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511422244">31</xref></sup> However, an association between <italic>in utero</italic> IFNβ exposure and lower birth weight was found in two larger studies from Germany<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref></sup> and Italy;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> our smaller sample size might have contributed to these differences. With regards to congenital anomaly, we found no increased risk, similar to all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511422244">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511422244">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511422244">35</xref></sup> but one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511422244">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interpretation of our findings was limited because of the small sample size. This also prevented us from adjusting for potential confounders, which larger prospective studies were able to do (e.g. Amato et al. (88 exposed pregnancies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422244">10</xref></sup> and Weber-Schoendorfer et al. (100 exposed pregnancies)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422244">1</xref></sup>). In addition, since data on abortions are considered highly confidential and are not available in the BCPDR, we were unable to capture cases of congenital anomalies that ended in spontaneous or elective abortion. No subject was exposed to a DMD beyond the second month of pregnancy and consequently, the safety of DMD use beyond the first trimester of pregnancy remains unknown. Theoretically, randomized controlled trials are the most scientifically valid approach to studying the effect of DMDs on perinatal outcomes, but this would be unethical, impractical, and prohibitively costly. Thus, adequately controlled, retrospective or prospective observational studies with large study populations remain the best way to investigate the effect of DMD exposure during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. The data in this study are valuable and could contribute to future meta-analyses.</p>
<p>In summary, we did not find strong evidence of an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with DMD exposure during conception and the first trimester of pregnancy. This study suggests that if DMD use is promptly discontinued early in pregnancy, women with MS may not be at a greater risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, the possible trend towards an increased risk of assisted vaginal delivery after pregnancy-related DMD exposure warrants further investigation. Larger studies are needed to ascertain the safety of DMD use throughout pregnancy in MS. In future studies, it would also be worthwhile to investigate the long-term effects of DMD exposure on maternal and neonatal health. For patients with MS, reproductive counseling and close involvement of clinicians are important factors to promote a healthy pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511422244">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511422244">38</xref></sup> Women with MS are still advised to discontinue DMD therapy prior to conception.</p>
