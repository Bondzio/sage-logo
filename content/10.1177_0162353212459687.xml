<abstract>
<p>Honors programs represent one way that secondary schools and undergraduate programs address the needs of academically talented students. Evidence suggests that these programs contribute to positive student outcomes in terms of achievement, social development, and career preparation. Because colleges of education produce graduates who typically confront the prospect of low salaries, attracting high-ability applicants is important. Despite the benefits of encouraging talented individuals to become teachers, few traditional teacher education programs use honors programs. This study reports on an honors program in a college of education that incorporates distinct course work and field experiences, focused especially on inquiry and research. Qualitative interviewing revealed three themes: How the program’s focus on inquiry and research fits with participants’ expectations and interests, complex and conflicting responses to the program’s focus on leadership development, and significant logistical challenges. These themes corroborated findings from related literature on honors programs in secondary schools and undergraduate programs.</p>

<body>
<p>At Ohio University, the faculty has recently developed an honors program (HP) with distinct course work and field experiences designed to cultivate intellectual engagement among talented students as well as their abilities to become change agents. By coupling challenging course work with systematic field-based research projects focusing on learning and teaching in a range of educational contexts, the program encourages independent and critical thinking. How well these experiences prepare students to become teachers is as yet unknown because the program is so new, but findings from a systematic study of the program offer insights valuable not only to the program’s faculty but also to faculty and administrators at other institutions that are looking for ways to attract high-ability students to careers in teaching.</p>
<p>The Ohio University Patton College of Education chose to initiate an HP because such programs represent one way that colleges (and secondary schools) address the needs of academically talented students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459687">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212459687">Campbell &amp; Fuqua, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212459687">Long, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212459687">Seifert, Pascarella, Colangelo, &amp; Assouline, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212459687">K. Taylor &amp; Haynes, 2008</xref>). Evidence suggests these programs contribute to positive student outcomes in terms of achievement, social development, and career preparation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212459687">Ory &amp; Braskamp, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212459687">Reed, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212459687">Rinn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212459687">Seifert et al., 2007</xref>). The features of such programs that researchers identify as most productive of positive outcomes are (a) their focus on critical thinking and inquiry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459687">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212459687">McDonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212459687">McKeague, 1984</xref>), (b) their use of cohort models that bring students together in stable learning communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212459687">McDonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353212459687">Testa, 2010</xref>), and (c) their provision of academic supports to students as they encounter challenging academic material (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459687">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the benefits of encouraging talented individuals to become teachers, few traditional teacher education programs use HPs as a way to attract and retain students with high levels of academic ability. Alternative pathways, such as Teach for America, for example, purport to recruit talented individuals, but evidence suggests that their impact is limited in part because of low levels of teacher retention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212459687">Darling-Hammond, Holtzman, Gatlin, &amp; Heilig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353212459687">Tournaki, Lyublinskaya, &amp; Carolan, 2009</xref>). Moreover, most studies of alternative licensure programs suggest that the streamlined professional training they offer is inadequate preparation for the demands of teaching (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212459687">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>, but compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212459687">Glazerman, Mayer, &amp; Decker, 2006</xref>, for conflicting evidence).</p>
<p>The evaluation described in this article, however, demonstrates the potential value of using an HP strategy to challenge high-ability undergraduates who pursue teacher preparation. Although the evaluation uncovered logistical challenges, it also showed how the positive outcomes of the program contributed to the realization of the program’s goals.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>To contextualize the study, we reviewed extant literature on university HPs in colleges of education. Dominating this literature are case studies focusing on particular programs, and those case studies tend to report on program development and progress over a relatively short period of time. Finally, the literature consists entirely of publications that are more than 10 years old. Of the 13 studies, most investigated programs at institutions in the United States, with the exception of two, focusing on programs in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212459687">H. C. Evans, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459687">Webster, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In the review that follows, we examine the perspectives and findings of the studies in this small body of literature in an attempt to answer the following questions: (a) How have colleges of education structured HPs?—What program features have they put in place? What do their curricula look like? (b) What have been the priorities of such HPs? (c) How have these honor programs affected the colleges of education in which they operate?</p>
<sec id="section2-0162353212459687">
<title>How Have Colleges of Education Structured HPs?</title>
<p>Despite the fact that the literature base is small, it reports on programs with diverse designs. In two cases—the University of Connecticut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459687">Norlander-Case, Campbell, Reagan, &amp; Case, 1998</xref>) and the University of Idaho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459687">Heide, Kozicki, &amp; Pedras, 1999</xref>)—the colleges redesigned their entire teacher education programs to incorporate a typical honors focus on research, inquiry, and reflection. More common, however, were programs for a subset of high-ability students—programs distinguished on the basis of the addition of course work and field experiences on top of an existing course of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212459687">H. C. Evans, 1983</xref>). Often, additional course work included seminars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212459687">S. Evans, King, &amp; Landers, 1986</xref>; Kent State University <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459687">[KSU], 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459687">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459687">1989c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212459687">Reed, 1988</xref>) and the completion of action research projects in conjunction with a practicum experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459687">Heide et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459687">Norlander-Case et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only did programs differ in terms of their centrality to the mission of the college, but they also differed in terms of their focus on acceleration and their linkages with colleges of arts and sciences. In the University of Connecticut’s HP, for instance, students finished 2 years of education in the College of Arts and Sciences and then spent 3 years in the teacher education program, graduating with the bachelor’s and master’s degree in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459687">Norlander-Case et al., 1998</xref>). In the Lyndhurst Program at the University of Knoxville (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459687">Boser, Wiley, &amp; Pettibone, 1986</xref>), participants completed an accelerated bachelor’s degree in an arts and sciences field—typically involving 3 years of study during which time they enrolled in no education courses whatsoever. Participants then completed a program that “include[d] an intensive ten-week session of coursework . . . followed by a year-long [paid] public school internship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459687">Boser et al., 1986</xref>, p. 4).</p>

<sec id="section3-0162353212459687">
<title>What Are the Priorities of HPs in Colleges of Education?</title>
<p>HPs in colleges of education tended to favor one of three priorities: the development of practical competence in the classroom through frequent and intense field work, the development of reflective inquiry, and the recruitment of academically talented undergraduates. Although these aims were in play in all the HPs, each program seemed to value one more highly than the others.</p>
<p>The earliest available research on an honors curriculum within a university’s teacher education program was a case study describing the linked BEd degree with honors at Sunderland Polytechnic in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459687">Webster, 1978</xref>). For this program, the highest priority was “the professional synthesis of theory and practice which reaches its culmination in the final year of each course [of study]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459687">Webster, 1978</xref>, p. 230).</p>
<p>The program focused on the development of teaching skills and engagement with curriculum studies in the hopes of producing more capable and confident new teachers. With this end in view, faculty provided experiences intended to cultivate a broad intellectual perspective and critical awareness of a range of educational ideas, including those related to the social justice. When Webster’s article was published, the BEd with honors had not been in existence for very long, and the author concluded the article by recommending that the program be systematically evaluated over time. This program’s explicit attention to the incorporation of relevant field experiences was similar to the focus of some programs developed in subsequent years at other institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459687">Heide et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459687">KSU, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459687">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459687">1989c</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies described programs with the overarching aim of preparing reflective, culturally responsive educators. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212459687">Felder (1986)</xref> reported on a program at the University of Houston that devoted particular attention to a systematic process for engaging students in periodic reflection and “inquiry into the meaning and effect of one’s own and others’ teaching” (p. 4). In their report of the program at the University of Connecticut, Norlander-Case and associates (1998) talked about the program’s efforts to prepare teachers whose practice would be informed by ongoing reflection and critical inquiry. Similarly, the redesign of the College of Education at the University of Idaho resulted in a program whose primary aim was the preparation of teachers who would be highly aware of and responsive to culture and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459687">Heide et al., 1999</xref>). An HP at Northern Kentucky University incorporated an international field experience to expand cultural awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212459687">Bishop &amp; Sittason, 2007</xref>). Across these programs, despite different curricula and field experiences, the emphasis on reflective inquiry manifested as a dominant theme.</p>
<p>In contrast to programs with the explicit aim of developing reflective inquiry, some HPs prioritized the recruitment and retention of academically talented students into teacher preparation. Faculty in these programs tended to express concern about the tendency of the brightest college students to select programs of study that would lead to work in the private sector rather than leading to work in schools. These programs were more likely than others to adopt extrinsic incentives for attracting academically talented students to teacher preparation, in particular accelerated programming and financial support.</p>
<p>The Honors Scholar Program for preservice teachers in the College of Education and Human Services at Wright State University illustrated this approach. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212459687">S. Evans et al. (1986)</xref>, the program, launched in 1984, was designed to “recruit, select, and retain potentially talented teachers” (p. 3) by attracting “the best and brightest” (p. 4) college applicants. Financial incentives included up to 15 full-tuition scholarships per year for students who scored within the top 10th percentile on the SAT or American College Test (ACT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212459687">S. Evans et al., 1986</xref>). This program was one of the few that offered financial support through scholarships to attract and reward talented students. Other universities that provided some financial incentives were Virginia Commonwealth University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212459687">Reed, 1988</xref>) and the University of Knoxville (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459687">Boser et al., 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>How Have HPs Affected Colleges of Education?</title>
<p>Reports of only a few programs, namely, those at the University of Knoxville (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212459687">Boser &amp; Wiley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459687">Boser et al., 1986</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459687">KSU (1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459687">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459687">1989c</xref>), and the University of Connecticut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459687">Norlander-Case et al., 1998</xref>) presented data that had been collected over three or more years. The study of the Lyndhurst Program at the University of Knoxville (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459687">Boser et al., 1986</xref>) involved surveying students every fall and tracking their professional progress postgraduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212459687">Boser &amp; Wiley, 1988</xref>). Results indicated that more Lyndhurst students were given contracts to teach soon after graduation than their counterparts who had graduated from Knoxville’s traditional teacher education programs. Furthermore, at three points in time—during their preparation, directly after graduation, and 2 years following graduation—data showed that Lyndhurst graduates perceived themselves and were perceived by others as having a strong motivation to teach and a deep commitment to the teaching profession.</p>
<p>KSU’s HP, noted above as one of the programs with an explicit focus on helping students link theory to practice through significant field experiences, also aimed to recruit and retain high-achieving teacher-education students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459687">KSU, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459687">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459687">1989c</xref>). The college recruited 450 potential students for its HP and eventually selected 30. The program’s most notable features were individualized advising, faculty participation in a multistakeholder Advisory Council, and the matching of teacher candidates with appropriate mentor teachers at nearby schools. A self-evaluation of the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459687">KSU, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459687">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459687">1989c</xref>) concluded that although faculty reported tensions surrounding the sharing of extra responsibilities, changes in the program had produced a rewarding experience for teacher candidates and increased their employability. The report also suggested that the program features that had been adopted were necessary to the program’s success and that of its students and graduates. As a result, the evaluators recommended that these features be sustained through ongoing support from the college.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the University of Connecticut’s redesign of teacher education focused mainly on developing capacities for reflective inquiry and action research among its students. Four evaluators, all of whom were affiliated with the program, collected data during the course of 5 years. Analyzing data from a variety of sources (e.g., interviews, students’ journal entries), the evaluators identified four major themes: (a) the importance of reflection in the daily lives of teachers, (b) the positive effect of the inquiry project on students’ perceptions of self-efficacy, (c) the impact of teacher inquiry and reflection on individual children as well as on classroom and school culture, and (d) the importance of collegial partnerships in developing reflective practice.</p>
<p>In all three of these cases, evaluations supported the conclusion that the extra effort involved in delivering a special program to talented students was worthwhile. The studies also found that the particular features incorporated into each of these HPs and program redesigns had positively affected the colleges of education in which they operated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353212459687">
<title>What the Research Does and Does Not Show</title>
<p>Although the research on HPs in colleges of education is limited, it points to some rich and varied programs seeking to attract academically talented students to careers in teaching. Although many of the features of these programs are similar—the use of seminars, reflective journals, action research, and intensive field experiences—their specific aims and curricular structures differ considerably.</p>
<p>Because the literature is scarce, dated, and often based on self-reports of faculty participants, however, we see ample room for additional research on such programs. Indeed, others have also noted the limited involvement of College of Education students and faculty in honors efforts as well as the need to create HPs that respond to the particular needs of the preservice teacher candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212459687">L. S. Noble &amp; Dowling, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our contribution is similar in some ways to earlier efforts because our data come from an internal evaluation. Nevertheless, our evaluation used interviewers and data analysts with no prior involvement in program design or delivery. Moreover, our evaluation attempted to surface rich descriptions of participants’ experiences with the program—an approach that enabled us to identify challenges and frustrations as well as valued program features and outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section6-0162353212459687">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Faculty and administrators in the College of Education at Ohio University initiated the HP in response to the critique of the traditional program provided by one talented student in particular and repeated by several others. These students’ concerns drew attention to limited opportunities in the traditional program for inquiry, leadership, and interaction with talented peers. The program’s aim is to create a learning community for high-ability undergraduates in the college’s teacher preparation programs. The features of the program include rigorous inquiry-based courses, research projects that bring students and faculty together to address significant educational problems, and multicultural field experiences. The college provides HP students with opportunities to present their research within the college and at state and national conferences, serve as spokespersons for the college, and contribute leadership and service to various other initiatives.</p>
<p>The college selects candidates on the basis of their academic performance as indicated by high-school grade point averages, ACT and/or SAT scores, and recommendation letters. To a lesser degree, the HP selection decision is based on information about applicants’ leadership and service contributions and original essays written by applicants in response to prompts provided.</p>
<p>An internal evaluation of the program—based on data from surveys and interviews—revealed that students, parents, faculty, and administrators agreed that the program was meeting its academic goals through the provision of rigorous course work and collaborative research projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212459687">A. Howley et al., 2011</xref>). Perceptions of the program’s effectiveness in cultivating leadership and offering multicultural field experiences were mixed. The findings presented below go beyond the analysis of the internal evaluation to identify themes evident in the qualitative data obtained via interviews.</p>

<sec id="section7-0162353212459687" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The evaluation used case study methods to investigate the experiences of students<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162353212459687">1</xref></sup> and faculty who participated in the HP. Participants from these two groups completed an online questionnaire with items focusing on issues relating to the HP. A subset of participants also provided extensive commentary in response to semi-structured interview questions.</p>
<p>The research team solicited participants from two groups: the students who had been admitted to three HP cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 36) and had been pursuing the program for at least 6 months and as much as 2.5 years, and faculty members (<italic>n</italic> = 9) who had taught one or more courses in the program. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212459687">Table 1</xref> shows the number of potential and actual participants from each of these groups. Although respondents to the surveys were anonymous, we believe that most of the participants who provided interviews also provided responses to the survey.</p>

<p>The research team used somewhat different online questionnaires for students and faculty members. Whereas the overall purpose of the questionnaires was the same, the items differed to elicit responses about the specific issues with which each group was likely to be concerned. Each of the questionnaires incorporated Likert-type and open-ended items—23 in total on the questionnaire for students and 20 on the questionnaire for faculty. The matrix presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162353212459687">Table 2</xref> identifies the topics of concern addressed in each questionnaire.

</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>Out of 36 possible student respondents (i.e., all students in the three cohorts), the team received completed questionnaires from 20 for a response rate of 56%. The team sent the link to the online questionnaire to the nine faculty members who had taught HP classes and five responded (also a response rate of 56%). Despite three invitations (one original and two follow-up e-mail invitations) to participate in the survey that the team sent to the faculty and the students, response rates did not improve.</p>
<p>Following participants’ completion of the surveys, the research team sent out a second request to the two groups—this one asking for participation in semi-structured interviews. Guiding these interviews were sets of semi-structured questions positioned to elicit more extensive commentary about the HP from the students and faculty members who agreed to be interviewed. The interview questions targeted issues similar to those identified on the survey—particularly those relating to the focus of HP classes and the program’s strengths and challenges. Moreover, they gave participants an opportunity to share personal perspectives about the program by framing responses in their own words and introducing whatever details and nuances they saw as relevant. A list of interview questions, organized by the participant group, is provided in the appendix.</p>
<p>The research team included three faculty members from the college’s Teacher Education Department, one faculty member from the Educational Studies Department, and two independent research consultants. Four members of the team conducted interviews. Three of these team members also participated in data analysis along with another team member who had not been involved in interviewing participants. Prior to scheduling interviews, members of the research team met with the lead researchers to discuss the interview questions and the logistics of arranging and conducting interviews.</p>
<p>The research team conducted interviews with students and several faculty members in a conference room in the Ohio University building where most professional education courses are taught. Some faculty members, however, preferred to be interviewed in their offices. Each participant provided one interview. The interviews varied in length from approximately 40 to 90 min. The interviews with faculty members tended to be longer than those with students. Once all data were assembled, members of the research team analyzed quantitative responses to questionnaire items using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations), and we used chi-square tests to compare responses to the five questionnaire items common to all participant groups. For responses to open-ended questionnaire items, we used content analysis to categorize the ideas that participants mentioned and to identify the most frequently mentioned ideas.</p>
<p>We then searched for emergent themes in the interview data by first coding, then categorizing, and finally looking for overarching patterns. The team developed this approach using suggestions offered by a number of methodologists, in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212459687">Bogdan and Biklen (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459687">Merriam (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212459687">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>.</p>
<p>At the coding stage, we combined (a) deductive codes that came from our prior content analysis of responses to open-ended survey questions and (b) inductive codes that came directly from the interview data. Within each separate data set (i.e., students and faculty), we then reviewed the codes to classify them into categories. For example, the keyword codes with the greatest salience for faculty were research, diversity, leadership, critical thinking, collaboration (faculty and student), discussion, community engagement, individualized instruction, undergraduate teaching class size, course substitution, program development, student characteristics, concrete rewards, and faculty. Our categorization scheme accommodated the codes within three categories—curriculum, instructional strategies, and program structure.</p>
<p>Although the relevant codes and categories differed somewhat in the faculty and student data sets, we were able to combine them into one categorization scheme to look for cross-categorical patterns. To facilitate this process, we used an analytic matrix, such as those recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212459687">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>, to identify similarities and differences in the salient ideas emerging from the interview data provided by these two groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0162353212459687">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>This analysis supported three themes that characterized participants’ experience of the HP. The first explained how the program’s focus on inquiry fits in with participants’ expectations and interests. The second characterized participants’ complex and conflicting responses to the program’s focus on leadership development. A final theme drew attention to significant logistical challenges that made it difficult for students to reconcile the requirements of the HP with those of the regular teacher preparation program.</p>
<sec id="section9-0162353212459687">
<title>Focus on Inquiry</title>
<p>Across participant groups, interviewees acknowledged the central role of inquiry in the HP courses. Their perspectives regarding the value of specific inquiry-focused assignments—action research projects, point–counterpoint papers, persuasive essays, survey research, in-class debates, reflective journaling—differed somewhat. In particular, interviewees held conflicting views about the relative salience of projects that required students to conduct empirical research, read research critically, and produce written work. Despite some variability in perspective, students found the courses rigorous intellectually and welcomed the social cohesion that resulted from sharing a challenging experience with peers.</p>
<p>In comments indicating their support for the program’s focus on inquiry, faculty members often drew attention to the connections between inquiry, critical thinking, data-based instructional practice, and systematic research. For some faculty, involving HP students in field-based research projects seemed to be a highly productive way to cultivate their capacity as critical and independent thinkers. For others, critical analysis of contemporary issues in education seemed most productive of these ends.</p>
<p>According to students, focus on inquiry was a distinguishing feature of the HP because it promoted greater engagement with challenging academic work than was typical with other courses in their programs of study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353212459687">
<title>Instructional Methods Focusing on Inquiry</title>
<p>The literature on gifted education provides numerous discussions of inquiry as an important approach to curriculum for gifted and talented students across the age span (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212459687">McGregor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212459687">Subotnik &amp; Coleman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212459687">VanTassel-Baska, 1986</xref>). Inquiry curricula vary, ranging from projects in which gifted students conduct empirical investigations to activities in which they engage in problem solving and/or philosophical debate. Students identified two ways in which their classes required engagement with inquiry: (a) assignments requiring varied analyses and critiques of published research, for example, reflective journals, point–counterpoint papers, in-class debates, and persuasive essays, and (b) direct participation as researchers, for example, action research projects and survey research. Many students responded positively to action research projects that involved them in inquiry in ways they believed would prepare them for reflective teaching practice. As one student noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought that was probably the most beneficial and memorable thing . . . because we actually got to get more field experience; we got to go into the classroom and perform action research instead of just learning the theories behind it. (Student 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Faculty members also reported that they structured classes to include high-level reading and writing activities to challenge students.</p>
<p>Although all faculty members required students to think critically and write extensively, their comments revealed differences in instructional focus. Some faculty favored activities that enabled students to function as critical consumers of research, for instance by assigning literature reviews, book critiques, and other activities that focused on critical reading of empirical literature; and others assigned activities that required students to conduct empirical research (e.g., action research, surveys), typically in small groups. A faculty member who used the former approach commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I try to teach them more how to become consumers of what’s out there. So can they, can they look at a study and, and think to themselves, um, “Is this something where I think I can trust the evidence here?” (Faculty Member 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One who used the latter approach noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>One of my goals was to get the kids involved in an actual research project, and so we designed a structured interview protocol over the course of much of the [quarter], and . . . toward the end of the quarter, we went out with the purpose of [interviewing] 200 adults. (Faculty Member 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the focus on reading, writing, and research, faculty members also pointed to other characteristics of HP classes that made them intellectually challenging: (a) the expectation that students produce multiple revisions of written products, (b) the use of various discussion formats (e.g., small group discussion, debate, large group discussion), and (c) the individualization that small class sizes made possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0162353212459687">
<title>Rigor and Relevance</title>
<p>The phrase rigor and relevance has become a catchphrase for recent school reform efforts, but concern about the degree to which curricula for gifted students incorporate both meaningful and challenging content has a long legacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212459687">Howley, Howley, &amp; Pendarvis, 1995</xref>). Although some programs for high-ability students have emphasized rigor over relevance and others have emphasized relevance over rigor, most such program attempt to be “integrative” to the greatest extent possible. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353212459687">Vars and Rakow (1993</xref>, p. 48) explain, “Integrative curriculum provides appropriate opportunities for gifted students to build on their natural inclinations to make connections among abstract ideas.” This perspective illustrates the intrinsic connection between rigor and relevance. Although faculty and students agreed that the HP courses were rigorous, the two groups differed in their assessment of the relevance of the courses, particularly the relevance of the inquiry projects that made the courses rigorous. For most faculty members, the relevance of the courses was a given. They had, after all, participated in developing the courses and would not have selected content and activities that they judged to be irrelevant. One faculty member was more explicit than others in expressing this sentiment:
<disp-quote>
<p>If education is going to continue to stay relevant, it’s going to constantly have to change to meet the demands of the young students coming behind it. And that means that you have to be able to make informed decisions . . . informed . . . by data. You best understand data by using data. (Faculty Member 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not all students agreed that the focus on inquiry was relevant to their preparation as teachers. Some, in fact, expressed the view that focus on inquiry in projects such as reflective journals, persuasive essays, and in-class debates overshadowed learning about teaching methods such as classroom management and lesson planning—skills they thought especially helpful for beginning teachers. One student articulated an oft-shared perspective:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what the explicit goals of the honors program are, but I believe it, it focuses so heavily on research and the theory behind education that I have to believe it’s there to make us better researchers, and better at inquiring, than it is at being teachers. (Student 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some students, by contrast, expressed the belief that the program’s focus on inquiry and particularly the action research they had conducted provided good preparation for teaching. As one student commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s broadened my knowledge of what we can actually do as teachers. Like, if there is a problem in your classroom, now we know we can actually, like, do action research and make an action plan ourselves, rather than just running to the principal and saying, “Okay, what should I do?” (Student 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0162353212459687">
<title>Social Cohesion As a Productive Response to Challenging Academic Work</title>
<p>Studies of intensive experiences in which gifted students have occasion to work closely with similarly talented peers and thereby to develop strong social bonds suggest that various types of special programs −summer residential programs, early college programs, honors program, and other similar initiatives −promote academic growth and social development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212459687">K. D. Noble, Childers, &amp; Vaughan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212459687">Rinn, 2006</xref>). One by-product of the program’s rigor, as well as its intentional use of a cohort model, was the social cohesion it helped to create among the students. Explaining the sources of their social bonding, one student commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that it’s the group of students you’re working with . . . that we all have a common set of goals to obviously strive for more, since we are in the honors program, and going above and beyond. (Student 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For several students, the best part of the program was the camaraderie and friendships that it encouraged:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have called many people crying. I’ve called . . . I’ve emailed at three in the morning the day the paper’s due: “What is this section about? Why in the world do we have to write this?” And . . . just having somebody to commiserate with, basically, is the best part of this process. (Student 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although faculty members had less to say than students about social cohesion, some mentioned the supportive nature of the HP: “They’re very supportive; they’ve definitely developed a little learning community [and] that’s good” (Faculty Member 8). Faculty members also made efforts to connect with students in informal ways to provide support and encourage social cohesion. One student from the first HP cohort described an out-of-class bonding experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was kind of nerve wracking being new to . . . town, not really knowing anyone, and then, to get to know each other better, we had a dinner at our professor’s house. So we got to know each other better and then participate in a project together, which made it a lot better, and it was pretty cool. (Student 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0162353212459687">
<title>Leadership Perspectives</title>
<p>One of the major reasons that educators cite for providing special programs for gifted and talented students is to cultivate their leadership capabilities. Despite the prominence of this rationale, however, little agreement exists regarding several pivotal issues: the definition of leadership, the connection between traits of children and adolescents and their eventual leadership capabilities as adults, and the impact of programs designed to improve the leadership skills of gifted and talented students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212459687">Matthews, 2004</xref>). Matthews’ review of the literature provides an outstanding analysis of the relevant concerns. The second theme concerned leadership, represented by complex and sometimes competing views of the construct and the program’s role in cultivating it. These views implicated the contrast between providers and consumers of leadership preparation, inquiry as preparation for autonomy and intellectual leadership, and distinctions among three stances regarding the aims of leadership preparation.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-0162353212459687">
<title>Contrast Between Providers and Consumers of Leadership Preparation</title>
<p>The HP did not include an explicit set of leadership experiences but rather asked participating students to demonstrate leadership through their engagement with various college activities, including an extensive rural and urban field experience, workshops and presentations provided by guest speakers, and student research fairs. In addition, the college gave HP students opportunities to participate in university governance, state advocacy forums, national professional conferences, and other similar activities.</p>
<p>Comments from faculty and students revealed marked differences in their views of the leadership preparation provided by the HP. On one hand, the students tended to respond from the perspective of passive recipients of these opportunities; on the other hand, faculty responses reflected their own role in shaping course content and field experiences, but did not necessarily credit as particularly salient the extracurricular opportunities provided by the college (e.g., participation in research fairs, attendance at professional conferences).</p>
<p>Even while disagreeing about what leadership preparation ought to entail and for whom it was appropriate, all faculty members used such preparation as part of their instructional planning. Furthermore, all faculty members were committed to engaging ideas relating to leadership and associated concepts such as agency, democracy, power, and resistance.</p>
<p>The following quote from a faculty member illustrates an overarching faculty belief in their role as providers of leadership preparation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The way the courses are sequenced is that it does expose them [HP students] very early to the issues, unlike the regular classes, where by the time they take [the diversity course] they [non-HP students] have very little knowledge about what is happening apart from the different courses that they are taking. So, I think, for me, what it told me was that they are getting a good dose of what is critical for them to understand . . . because if [we] really want to send them out as leaders, we really need them to understand what is going on. (Faculty Member 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students, by contrast, understood the leadership preparation in the HP from their vantage as consumers of the program, and from this vantage, they evaluated the program’s features as well as its immediate and long-term benefits. One student who had left the program, for example, speculated about what others were continuing to receive: “I think it’s awesome that they’re going to get these experiences that they wouldn’t normally get maybe, if they just went through the regular program” (Student 8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0162353212459687">
<title>Inquiry As Leadership Preparation: Autonomy and Intellectual Leadership</title>
<p>As noted previously, students and faculty members agreed about the program’s focus on inquiry. Similarly, they tended to cast comments about leadership development in terms of inquiry. For students, the connection was between the program’s focus on inquiry and its cultivation of autonomy. As one student put it, “We’re getting leadership in the sense of we’re given a lot of freedom in where to go with our research” (Student 4). According to another,
<disp-quote>
<p>Especially in the second class with our research project, they were just kinda like, “Okay, have at it. We’re here for any questions, but [you are] on your own”. . . . So, at first we were like, “Okay, this is a little overwhelming.” But, once you actually got into it . . . there was a lot of work to be done, so we each kind of had to . . . take charge of some certain aspect of it, which was actually pretty cool, because I mean, I haven’t been in a situation where I had to do that before . . . but if I needed any help, they were there to help me, like, no matter what. (Student 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For faculty, a focus on inquiry promoted intellectual leadership, which entailed independent thinking, attention to evidence, moral commitment, and advocacy. Giving students opportunities to develop autonomy was one means to this end but not the end in itself. The following comment illustrates how faculty saw the connection between intellectual leadership and moral action:
<disp-quote>
<p>That [understandings about culture and education] actually intersects nicely with the issue of leadership, because if you understand these issues, can you advocate for what you think is the right choice. I believe in advocating based on, from the moral point of view . . . you can lead better if you understand the issues better. (Faculty Member 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section16-0162353212459687">
<title>Differing Stances Toward Leadership</title>
<p>Whereas most faculty members agreed that the HP should foster intellectual leadership, they differed sharply in their views about whether it should cultivate organizational leadership or political leadership. Their views reflected a continuum ranging from more individualistic and meritocratic to more collectivist and democratic. Although students spoke about organizational and political leadership less often than faculty members, their comments also reflected the same range of perspectives.</p>
<p>Those whose comments revealed the more meritocratic view of leadership saw an overlap between intellectual talent and leadership and made statements suggesting that HP students would benefit from leadership preparation because these students were well-positioned to become leaders. Three of eight faculty members and one of nine students provided comments suggesting they subscribed to this view. A quote from a faculty participant illustrates this perspective:
<disp-quote>
<p>And there’s nothing wrong with thinking about them aspiring to the highest pinnacle of their profession, and that, for me, it’s like the president of the United States, the number one job in America. We’re preparing the “cream of the crop,” the “crème de la crème.” Whether they choose to or not, we ought to be preparing them such that we are giving them the foundation to assume those roles, should they choose it. (Faculty Member 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the other end of the continuum, participants with a more democratic view of leadership expressed skepticism toward the sort of leadership in which more talented individuals assumed control over organizations or political jurisdictions. For these participants, the HP ought not only to steer clear of a conventional approach to leadership preparation but should also explicitly challenge assumptions about leadership. As one of the faculty members noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think leadership is an honorific. I think this country is a democratic nation, and instead of preparing very talented people for leadership positions, we need to prepare all people for leadership positions. That is an example of something that could be taught to all people. (Faculty Member 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A student’s comment elaborated on this position:
<disp-quote>
<p>Leadership is caught in this social mechanism to keep people who are from higher social economic statuses to maintain their position. If . . . you take those students who are the “best and the brightest” and you send them off to special seminars or you create honors track programs for them to prime them thinking they are leaders . . . It’s stupid because you’re taking people who are already secure and calling them and telling them they can do anything in the entire world. (Student 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Between the two conflicting perspectives was an intermediate position that construed the HP as a testing ground for leadership (especially, intellectual leadership) preparation that might be extended through a somewhat less demanding program to all students in the college. Two faculty members made comments reflecting this point of view. According to one,
<disp-quote>
<p>If I could describe a strategy [for] . . . how this whole thing might move forward . . . it wouldn’t so much be expanding the honors program and bringing so many kids in the honors program. It would be take what’s working and what’s exciting, and . . . what’s happening within the honors program . . . [and] expand that throughout the [teacher preparation] program. But keep . . . an honors program for really, really highly motivated and really high performing group of kids and push them even harder. (Faculty Member 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162353212459687">
<title>Logistical Difficulties</title>
<p>Both faculty and students reported that administrative roadblocks interfered with the college’s ability to offer a rigorous HP to students who were pursuing licensure as teachers. These roadblocks appeared to be most troubling for the first HP cohort—all of whom were required to add HP courses to their programs of study along with all required courses in their licensure programs.</p>
<p>At that time, administrators had not yet figured out a way to exempt HP students from any of the licensure requirements, and the HP included eight courses. In the 2nd year of the program, the coordinator worked to develop a plan for allowing some HP courses to substitute for some licensure courses, and the faculty reduced the number of HP courses from eight to six. Despite these changes, several faculty members and students still had concerns about course substitutions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of students are afraid that they’re going to have to take extra classes or do a lot of extra work, or take classes and then have other classes that don’t count for things, and, and even though [now, in contrast to last year] I think that there’s a pretty good plan, but getting the students to believe it is kind of tough. (Faculty Member 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another faculty member expressed that, despite efforts to advise HP students, the changes that had been made still were not clear to all of them:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s my hope that by the next academic year, we will have a template where we can tell the students off the bat what courses are eligible to substitute for which in their content areas . . . . We have a better understanding of it now, but that certainly has been a challenge. (Faculty Member 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several students also expressed concern about what they saw as disorganization regarding scheduling and related advising issues. These students indicated that having a schedule that showed them when to enroll in HP and other required courses would help them better navigate the program. A related issue—scheduling HP classes in time slots that did not conflict with other required courses—also concerned participants.</p>
<p>Despite some faculty members’ awareness of these logistical difficulties, not all of them were attentive to the needs of the HP students. Perhaps because several of the HP faculty members rarely taught regular undergraduate classes, they were out of touch with undergraduates’ experiences, expectations, and concerns. According to one faculty member, “It seems to me that a lot of faculty that typically only teach graduate courses are teaching undergraduate [HP] courses, so that might be the challenge for making this more workable” (Faculty Member 8). By contrast, some faculty members were less sympathetic to the plight of the HP students, feeling, in fact, that the program coordinator and some faculty members were actually providing too much “hand-holding.”</p>
<p>Another concern expressed by some of the students—but notably absent from the comments offered by faculty members—related to the information HP students believed they were missing because they took HP courses rather than non-HP courses. Specifically, the HP students spoke about missing early field observation courses—courses that not only gave students direct involvement with schools but that also provided logistical information about how to arrange and negotiate field placements.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Data analysis revealed three themes suggesting that the HP was providing students with an academic experience that, because of its focus on inquiry, was intellectually challenging and productive of social cohesion, but sometimes frustrating. Logistical difficulties and lack of clarity about how a focus on research fits with practical preparation for teaching contributed to the frustration students reported. The feature of the program that was most controversial was its purported emphasis on leadership development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study of an HP in the College of Education at Ohio University revealed themes also evident in related literature on the use of HPs to meet the needs of talented students. These themes concern the program features that are most generative of intellectual growth as well as challenges often faced by such programs. As the findings indicated, the features of the HP that matched what previous literature pointed to as effective practices included a focus on critical thinking and inquiry, and the use of cohort models to bring students together in stable learning communities. Although the program attempted to give students sufficient support as they encountered challenging academic material, logistical difficulties actually contributed to students’ stress and mitigated the effectiveness of some support structures.</p>
<p>These themes also speak of some of the issues raised in the related literature on HPs in colleges of education. In particular, they provide insights about how HPs might be structured to promote balance between inquiry and practical preparation for teaching, and which program priorities fit best with the characteristics and educational interests of talented teacher-education students. Because this research focused on a relatively new program and gathered data from participants only rather than a wide range of college stakeholders, it cannot support insights about how the HP influenced the College of Education as a whole.</p>
<sec id="section20-0162353212459687">
<title>The Value of Research and Inquiry for Teaching Talented Students</title>
<p>One important finding concerned the HP’s focus on inquiry. Not only did inquiry projects and discussions requiring critical thinking challenge the students, but they also connected deeply to the program’s aim of giving undergraduates opportunities to experience research firsthand.</p>
<p>Universally, students reported that these experiences were memorable and highly instructive, and attributed improved writing and critical thinking skills to these experiences. The spirit of inquiry as well as attentiveness to multiple perspectives also pervaded faculty discussions about the program and how it might improve.</p>
<p>This finding fits with earlier literature reporting on the benefits of HPs for education students—especially programs that sought to promote reflective inquiry and critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212459687">Felder, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459687">Heide et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459687">Norlander-Case et al., 1998</xref>). It also corresponds to findings about the value of HPs in secondary schools and 2- and 4-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459687">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212459687">McDonald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212459687">McKeague, 1984</xref>) as well as intellectually challenging programs of other sorts for gifted and talented students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212459687">A. Howley, Howley, &amp; Pendarvis, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0162353212459687">
<title>The Benefit of Relationships With Talented Peers</title>
<p>The study also showed that the HP supported the development of social networks and friendships that extended beyond the structured experiences of the program. Whereas team research projects helped students challenge and support one another in the process of producing research studies, they also contributed to stress. Students reported relying on one another for emotional support as they encountered the intellectual challenges the program presented. Other studies of HPs and honors academies have provided similar reports of the value of social networks among participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459687">Glennen &amp; Martin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459687">Hébert &amp; McBee, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0162353212459687">
<title>Demanding Intellectual Growth, Providing Support, and Encountering Challenges</title>
<p>Although program faculty sought to provide support to students while requiring high levels of engagement and intellectual performance, the program was beset by logistical problems. These problems contributed to students’ concerns about the relative value of the HP in comparison with the traditional course of study in teacher education.</p>
<p>The logistical problems resulted from the program developers’ initial decision to add the HP courses and field experiences to an already full and tightly regulated program of study. This decision was akin to the choice in K-12 education to require gifted students to complete all the work from their general education classes along with all the work from their gifted education classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212459687">A. Howley et al., 1986</xref>). In K-12, such requirements burden gifted students and run counter to the aim of providing high-level instruction to students capable of handling it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212459687">A. Howley et al., 1986</xref>). Similar dynamics seemed also to pose challenges for the HP. Providing opportunities to accelerate through (or test out of) less challenging required courses seems to work reasonably well in K-12 schools and might be an approach that the HP faculty would want to consider.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0162353212459687">
<title>The Problematic Character of Leadership Development</title>
<p>Leadership development was an intended feature of the HP, but it was not something that all faculty members agreed was important—especially when leadership was construed conventionally as political or organizational leadership. In fact, the focus on leadership sometimes caused confusion even though sometimes it also stimulated generative dialog. Faculty, in particular, had widely differing views about leadership development and its relevance to course work and field experiences in an HP. Students, by and large, expressed the view that the program did not actually focus on leadership or, when it did, treated leadership in an extremely broad way—as autonomy and independent thinking.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most contested idea relating to the program’s purported need to cultivate leadership was the notion that students in the program were the “best and brightest” and therefore better suited than others to preparation for roles as leaders. Similar claims have also been made about gifted students in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212459687">Hughes, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212459687">C. W. Taylor, 1986</xref>). Nevertheless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212459687">Margolin (1996)</xref>, among others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212459687">C. B. Howley, Howley, &amp; Pendarvis, 1995</xref>), has argued, students with academic talent have no greater likelihood than others to possess leadership potential. Treating them as if their academic talents predispose them to leadership positions is potentially damaging to the students as well as to the institutions that require leaders. Talented students’ academic capabilities do benefit from high-level academic instruction, such as the inquiry and research projects that were part of the HP.</p>
<p>This study showed how evidence-based approaches for engaging talented students offer benefits to academically talented undergraduates who are preparing to become teachers. These approaches include (a) fostering learning communities as a way to build social cohesion, (b) assigning inquiry projects to cultivate critical thinking, (c) giving students opportunities to participate in real-world research projects under the mentorship of practicing researchers, and (d) providing support as students encounter intellectual challenges. The value of incorporating explicit leadership experiences into HPs of this type is, as yet, unclear. These findings regarding the HP in the College of Education at Ohio University offer encouraging prospects to other teacher education programs considering similar models for educating talented teacher candidates.</p>
