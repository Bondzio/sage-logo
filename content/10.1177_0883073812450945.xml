<abstract>
<p>Pediatric patients with chronic tension-type headaches often experience significant school impairment. Although some improve after treatment with a neurologist, many require more comprehensive treatment. The authors examined whether school functioning and attendance improved after a multidisciplinary evaluation focusing on a return to functioning despite headaches. They also examined whether patients’ headaches improved. Participants were 47 adolescents ages 12-17, most of whom had not responded to past neurological treatment. Adolescents completed the PedsQL School Functioning Scale at evaluation, 2-3 months later, and again 6 months after evaluation. Information regarding headache frequency, severity and duration, and school attendance was obtained from medical records. Using repeated measures analyses of variance, the authors found that school functioning and attendance improved significantly from evaluation to follow-up, as did headache frequency and duration. An emphasis on returning to functioning can help patients with chronic, difficult-to-treat tension-type headaches improve in their school functioning and experience fewer, shorter headaches.</p>

<p>Chronic or recurrent pain is estimated to affect more than 25% of children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450945">1</xref></sup> Chronic tension-type headache is among the most prevalent pain conditions in children and adolescents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450945">2</xref></sup> with epidemiological studies reporting a prevalence of approximately 15% to 20%; headache is recognized as a serious pediatric health problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450945">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450945"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450945">5</xref></sup> Tension-type headache is characterized by the International Classification of Headache Disorders–Second Edition as bilateral pressure occurring anywhere in the cranium or suboccipital region with mild to moderate pain that is not usually worsened with physical activity and typically is not accompanied by other associated symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450945">2</xref></sup> In addition, chronic tension-type headache is often associated with significant impairment in daily functioning, including difficulty with school functioning and attendance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450945">6</xref></sup> In fact, children with chronic tension-type headache exhibit higher rates of school absences than children with other chronic illnesses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450945">7</xref></sup> perhaps because they perceive the demands of school to be greater than their headache-free peers, resulting in increased school stress, headaches, and absences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450945">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812450945"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450945">10</xref></sup> Frequent school absences also may result in parents missing work and incurring additional financial burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812450945">11</xref></sup> Thus, interventions targeting headache symptoms and associated disability are essential in pediatric patients to mitigate these negative outcomes.</p>
<p>According to the biopsychosocial model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450945">12</xref></sup> chronic pain, including chronic tension-type headache, is a centrally mediated phenomenon, shaped jointly by physiologic, psychological, social, and environmental forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812450945">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812450945"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812450945"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812450945">16</xref></sup> Based on this framework, multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment for chronic headache have been recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450945">2</xref></sup> Multidisciplinary headache clinics often involve a team approach to assessment and management, including input from neurology, psychology, nursing, and physical therapy, to address the multiple factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of chronic headache. Outcome research from adult headache clinics demonstrates that this approach is effective in reducing headache frequency, intensity, depression, and missed work days over time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812450945">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812450945"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812450945">19</xref></sup> and is well accepted and perceived as effective by adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812450945">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812450945">18</xref></sup> Although results from adult multidisciplinary headache clinics are promising, empirical data supporting the benefits of this approach in children and adolescents with chronic tension-type headache are limited.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conducted the current study to address limitations in the literature by assessing a cohort of pediatric patients with chronic tension-type headache who received evaluation and treatment at a multidisciplinary headache clinic over time. The majority of patients in our clinic have already been evaluated and treated by a neurologist and often are referred by their neurologists because of the chronic nature of their headaches and their poor response to traditional neurological treatment. We conducted a first follow-up assessment approximately 2 to 3 months following the initial presentation and a second follow-up 6 months later to assess for both immediate and long-term improvement following multidisciplinary evaluation. The Pediatric Headache Program at Children’s Hospital Boston is the only tertiary care center in the northeast that provides comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations (both neurological and psychological assessments) and treatment for children and adolescents with chronic headaches, and all patients who participate in our multidisciplinary headache team evaluation are educated about the importance of maintaining school attendance and performance despite headaches, consistent with the biopsychosocial model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450945">12</xref></sup> We emphasize that our patients experience improvement in their headaches <italic>after</italic> they return to activities. This idea is often counter to what patients and families expect, as they tend to believe that a return to school should occur after the headaches resolve.</p>
<p>Thus, the aims of this study were to examine (1) if school functioning and attendance improve after participation in a multidisciplinary headache evaluation that emphasizes a return to function despite pain and (2) if patients experience an improvement in headache frequency, severity, and duration 2 to 3 months after their initial evaluation as well as at a second follow-up 6 months after the initial evaluation. Consistent with the adult headache clinic literature, we hypothesized that there would be significant improvements in functioning and headache frequency, severity, and duration following multidisciplinary clinic evaluation, even for patients who have not responded to past neurological treatment of their headaches.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073812450945">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 47 patients ages 12-17 diagnosed by their neurologist with chronic tension-type headache who underwent a multidisciplinary evaluation at a tertiary headache clinic in a large, urban, northeastern pediatric hospital between October 2009 and August 2011. All patients with tension-type headache who completed an initial evaluation and both follow-up assessments were included in this study. The sample was predominantly Caucasian (93.0%) and female (76.6%), reflecting the composition of patients seen in this tertiary care clinic. The mean age was 15.11 years (standard deviation, 1.51). At the time of the evaluation, patients’ mean duration of pain was close to 2 years, mean, 22.58 months (standard deviation, 25.84). Most patients’ parents were married (76.6%) and well educated (ie, college graduate or above: 70.6% of mothers and 61.6% of fathers).</p>
<p>In addition, the majority of patients (83%) had been treated by a previous neurologist with poor response prior to their multidisciplinary evaluation in the Pediatric Headache Program: 46.8% had been treated by one previous provider, 19.1% had been treated by 2 previous providers, and 17% had been treated by 3 or more providers. Patients were followed on average for almost 2 years prior to their referral to our clinic (mean, 19.64 months; standard deviation, 21.99). Most patients (76.6%) had been prescribed prophylactic medications prior to their evaluation. All patients in this study had neurological evaluations that were within normal limits. Of the 33 patients who had a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 4 had a history of postsurgical resection with subsequent stable MRIs, and one patient had a stable, frontal, nonmalignant lesion. A small percentage of patients (6.4%) had been previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, while 29.8% of patients had previously been diagnosed with a learning disorder. In addition, 29.8% of patients had a prior history of concussion.</p>

<sec id="section3-0883073812450945">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Approval from the hospital’s Institutional Review Board was obtained prior to conducting the retrospective chart review. Questionnaires were mailed to families prior to the child’s multidisciplinary headache clinic evaluation. Parents and children were asked to complete the questionnaires individually and return them on the date of the evaluation. Children then underwent a multidisciplinary evaluation by a neurologist and clinical psychologist. The neurological evaluation (approximately 1 hour) included a medical history, neurological examination, and treatment recommendations including medication, pursuit of psychological treatment, return to school, and additional tests (electrocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging) when indicated. The psychological evaluation (approximately 1 hour) included a review of patient and parent standardized psychological measures as well as a semistructured evaluation assessing patients’ headaches, impact of headaches on functioning and activities (including school), patient’s school attendance and performance, patient’s current psychological functioning and psychosocial stressors, and family psychiatric history. Psychologist recommendations included pursuit of psychological treatment (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, family therapy), and recommendations to facilitate a return to school and improved lifestyle (eg, improved hydration, exercise, and sleep hygiene). Families were provided with feedback by our clinic nurse (approximately 20 minutes) that integrated the results of both evaluations and that emphasized a return to functioning, especially school, despite headaches.</p>
<p>Approximately 2 to 3 months after their initial evaluation and again 6 months after their initial evaluation, patients returned for follow-up appointments with their neurologist and again completed questionnaire measures regarding school functioning. School functioning was also emphasized as an important component of treatment at follow-up appointments. Patients’ headache diagnoses, school attendance, and information regarding headache frequency, severity, and duration at both the evaluation and each follow-up appointment were obtained from a review of patients’ medical records.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0883073812450945">
<title>Pediatric Quality of Life School Functioning Scale</title>
<p>The Pediatric Quality of Life School Functioning Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812450945">20</xref></sup> is a 5-item child self-report subscale of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory that assesses school functioning in the past month. We originally administered this measure for clinical purposes and had therefore modified the time frame covered by the questionnaire to 3 months to assess our patients’ school functioning during the current school term. Thus, in the current study the stem for each item was, “In the past 3 months, how much of a problem have you had with….” Items on the School Functioning Scale assess difficulty paying attention in class, forgetting things, keeping up with school, missing school because of not feeling well, and missing school because of medical appointments and hospitalizations. Responses are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from <italic>never</italic> (0) to <italic>almost always</italic> (4). A total score is computed by calculating the mean rating. Higher scores indicate greater difficulty with school functioning. Adolescents completed this measure at the initial evaluation and the 2 follow-up appointments. Alpha reliability in this study was .87 for the initial assessment .75 at the first follow-up assessment and .85 at the second follow-up assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0883073812450945">
<title>School attendance</title>
<p>A trained research assistant reviewed the patients’ medical records and rated adolescents’ school attendance for the past 3 months on a 3-point scale with 0 indicating <italic>not attending school</italic> (when patients missed greater than 75% of school days), 1 indicating <italic>partially attending school</italic> (when patients missed between 20% and 75% of school days), and 2 indicating <italic>attending school fully</italic> (when patients missed less than 20% of school days). School breaks and summer vacations also were factored into the number of possible school days used to compute these percentages.</p>

<sec id="section7-0883073812450945">
<title>Headache characteristics</title>
<p>Ratings of headache frequency, duration, and severity were collected from a review of participants’ medical records.

<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0 software for Windows. Pearson correlations were computed to determine whether there were significant associations among headache variables and school variables. Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted for each headache characteristic (ie, frequency, duration, severity) and school variable (school functioning and attendance) to assess for change over time in these variables across the initial evaluation and 2 follow-up assessments.</p>

<p>Study variable means and standard deviations for each of the 3 time points are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812450945">Table 1</xref>. As we expected, patients’ headache frequency, duration, and severity decreased over time. In addition, patients’ school functioning and attendance improved over time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812450945">Table 2</xref> presents correlations among the variables at Time 1. At the initial assessment, headache duration was negatively associated with school attendance (<italic>r</italic> = –.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), suggesting that adolescents with headaches of greater duration exhibited poorer school attendance. Headache frequency and severity were not related to school attendance or functioning. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812450945">Table 3</xref> presents correlations among the variables for the 2 follow-up assessments. At Time 2, no headache characteristics were associated with school functioning or attendance.

<title>Improvements in Functioning From Evaluation to Follow-Up</title>
<p>Using repeated measures analyses of variance, we examined whether participants improved in their headaches and school functioning from initial evaluation to the 2 follow-up assessments. Participants’ reported headache frequency changed significantly across the 3 time points, <italic>F</italic>(2, 44) = 5.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Examination of the within-subjects contrasts showed a significant linear effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 4.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicating that reported headache frequency decreased from the initial evaluation to the first follow-up, and again from the first follow-up to the second follow-up (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812450945">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, reported headache duration changed significantly over time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 45) = 7.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with the within-subject contrasts showing a significant linear effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 46) = 12.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Thus, headache duration decreased consistently from the initial evaluation across both follow-up assessments. There was no change in reported headache severity across the 3 assessments, <italic>F</italic>(2, 20) = 0.57, not significant, indicating that patients continued to report moderate levels of pain severity at initial evaluation and both follow-ups.</p>

<p>With regard to school functioning, there was a significant change over time in adolescents’ reported school functioning overall, <italic>F</italic>(2, 33) = 4.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Examination of the within-subjects contrasts showed a significant linear effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 34) = 8.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, indicating that overall school functioning improved from initial evaluation to first follow-up, and from first follow-up to second follow-up, per adolescent report (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812450945">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, school attendance changed significantly over time, <italic>F</italic>(2, 34) = 4.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The within-subjects contrasts showed a significant linear effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 5.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, suggesting that school attendance improved consistently across the 3 time points. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812450945">Figure 2</xref> presents patients’ school attendance over time. At the first and second assessments, patients’ school attendance rates were similar, with 8.5% of patients not attending school, 23% to 25% partially attending school, and 66% to 68% fully attending school. At time 3, school attendance improved significantly, with 92% of patients attending school full-time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined whether patients with chronic tension-type headache improved in both their headaches and school functioning after participation in multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. The majority of the patients in our study had previously been treated by a neurologist (many had consulted more than 1 provider) without improvement in headaches or daily functioning. Using longitudinal analyses, we found that patients had significant improvement in headache frequency and duration after participation in our program. In addition, we found that patients’ school attendance and school functioning (including difficulty paying attention in class, forgetting things, keeping up with school, missing school because of not feeling well, and missing school because of medical appointments and hospitalizations) improved significantly after multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. We also found that at the initial evaluation and the second follow-up, patients’ headache duration, but not frequency or severity, was significantly correlated with overall school functioning. Those patients with longer headaches appear to be at greater risk for difficulties with academic functioning, while patients who have shorter headaches may be less affected in their school functioning. Perhaps patients who have periods during the day in which they are headache-free are able to devote this time to their school activities. Interestingly, headache frequency, severity, and duration were not associated with patients’ school attendance at any time point.</p>
<p>All patients who participate in our multidisciplinary headache team evaluation are educated about the importance of maintaining school attendance and performance despite headaches. This approach is often a surprise to families who expect headache resolution prior to expectations for functioning. However, we explain that patients report improvement in their headaches <italic>after</italic> they return to school, which at times is met with some resistance from families who believe that a return to school should occur after the headaches resolves. Some parents will even tell us it feels mean to expect their child to function with chronic pain. However, unlike with acute pain, where treatment reasonably emphasizes a brief respite from activities to promote healing, chronic pain treatment requires that children begin to train their bodies to function despite the pain. We encourage patients to engage in all the regular activities that their same-age peers do, rather than allowing the headache to control their life and to prevent them from functioning adaptively. In fact, most of our patients who fail to return to school report even higher levels of pain and disability, as the stress associated with continued absences and large amounts of makeup work only serve to exacerbate their headaches. When patients have missed excessive amounts of school, we typically recommend a gradual return to school, beginning with a few hours or a partial day and then working up to a full school day. Parents also must be willing to embrace this approach, as we have seen many well-meaning parents inadvertently give the message that it is acceptable to remain home while in pain. It is important to note that for many of our patients, significant improvement in school attendance did not occur until Time 3, approximately 6 months after their initial evaluation, emphasizing how long it can take for patients to follow through with this recommendation. However, by Time 3, over 90% of our patients had fully returned to school.</p>
<p>This study also found that at the initial assessment and the second follow-up appointment, headache duration, rather than frequency or severity, was associated with school functioning, such that patients with increased headache duration also experienced greater difficulty with school functioning. However, overall, patients’ school functioning had improved and at Time 3, almost all patients had returned to school full time. In addition, patients reported that their headaches had improved in frequency and duration. Thus, it is possible that patients’ school functioning and attendance improved at follow-up because their headaches also improved, or it may be that patients’ headaches improved because they had improved their school functioning and attendance. Additional longitudinal research including a control group will be necessary to determine the direction of effect, although it is likely that the relation between headache variables and school functioning is bi-directional. Alternatively, a third factor, such as effective medication treatment, may be associated with improvements in both school functioning and headache characteristics.</p>
<p>Our findings must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, the predominance of girls in the current sample and the lack of ethnic heterogeneity may limit the generalizability of findings. This issue is not unique to our sample, as high rates of female and Caucasian patients also have been reported by other pediatric multidisciplinary pain clinic samples,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812450945">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812450945">22</xref></sup> and research documents gender and ethnic discrepancies in those who seek treatment for chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812450945">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812450945">24</xref></sup> Second, we are unable to causally determine which factors account for the improvement in functioning and headaches from the initial evaluation. While the education regarding a return to functioning that is provided within the context of our multidisciplinary evaluation likely plays some role, there are certainly other factors beyond the scope of this study, such as improved sleep hygiene, diet, and exercise, that may contribute to patients’ improved functioning at follow-up. Additional research with a matched control group would be required to more clearly delineate the effect of our multidisciplinary treatment approach emphasizing improved school functioning.</p>
<p>This study provides preliminary longitudinal data demonstrating that patients with chronic tension type headaches experience improvements in their headaches, school functioning, and school attendance after participation in a multidisciplinary headache team evaluation and treatment approach. Future research that helps to identify specific factors associated with this improvement is needed. It also would be helpful to assess both parent and child perceptions of the effectiveness of this approach, similar to research with patients in adult headache clinics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812450945">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812450945">18</xref></sup> to determine whether families find this approach, which is typically opposite to their previous headache management, to be acceptable. Finally, future research also should assess whether improvements in children’s school attendance are associated with decreased parental work absences as well as decreased family financial burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812450945">11</xref></sup></p>
