<p>This edited collection grew out of a session at the 2004 Australian Anthropological Society conference. That session in turn was part of a larger project led by the editors, Mary Patterson and Martha Macintyre, entitled ‘Managing modernities: capitalism, globalization and governance in Melanesia’. Their project received Australian Research Council funding and support from the University of Melbourne, where both editors are based. Of the seven other contributors to the volume, three others are also associated with the University of Melbourne: Kalissa Alexeyeff is a McArthur research fellow in the School of Social and Political Sciences there; Nicholas Bainton completed a PhD in anthropology there in 2007; John Fox is listed as a current PhD student there; and while Richard Sutcliffe’s bio in the book does not state this, his Deakin University staff webpage indicates he is also enrolled as a PhD student there. Two US-trained but Australian-based anthropologists, Debra McDougall who teaches at the University of Western Australia, and Matt Tomlinson who teaches at Monash University, are among the contributors. Australian National University-trained and Otago University-based Greg Rawlings rounds out the team.</p>
<p>Multi-authored volumes are often tricky to pull together. This one consists of an introduction co-authored by the editors, and nine chapters − one individually authored by each of the contributors and each of the editors. The ‘Western Pacific’ signalled in the title as the focus of the book, refers to Melanesia, so Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji all get coverage; New Caledonia, however, is omitted. The chapters for the most part explore localized manifestations of the convergence of ‘capitalism, cosmology and globalization’ (p. 1) so topics such as fast money schemes; Christian religious ideologies around individual morality and the virtues of accumulation; and tax havens are all grist for the mill.</p>
<p>While most of the coherence of the volume is afforded by, one would imagine, sustained conversations over at least a seven-year period from genesis to publication, there are some incongruities that attract attention. For example, a chapter on gambling in the Cook Islands by Alexeyeff is engagingly written and as interesting as all the other chapters, but no explanation is provided for including it when the Cook Islands are neither Melanesian nor located in what is generally recognized as the ‘Western Pacific’.</p>
<p>The most prominent variance occurs in Chapter 1, entitled ‘The imaginary excess of reason: critical reflections on magic and modernity in the context of post-millennial capitalism’. It is not so much Sutcliffe’s almost exclusive focus on critiquing the co-existence of European fantasies of rationalism and the persistence of magic, occultism and religion in modernity that puts his chapter at odds with the others. Rather, it is the manner in which his chapter is invoked by the editors in their introduction that stands out: Sutcliffe’s chapter is treated as yielding generative ideas, while the other chapters are merely illustrative. In fact, Sutcliffe’s work undermines the very premise of the original project that generated this book: the concept of ‘multiple modernities’. Sutcliffe is quoted as acknowledging the usefulness of such a framing for the purposes of relativizing, but seems to think that it has more commonly been confused with contemporaneity (p. 1). The editors find further reason to abandon their original premise after citing Englund and Leach who ‘are critical of the way that modernity is the now almost ubiquitous plural in a meta-narrative that undermines the ‘knowledge practices of the ethnographic method in which the anthropologist’s interlocutors are given “a measure of authority in producing an understanding of their life-worlds”’ (p. 3). Et voila! The ‘Managing Modernities’ project produces a book entitled <italic>Managing Modernity</italic>. The notion of an investment in the ethnographic method deserves further comment, and I will come to that presently, but there is yet more to say about this ‘Chapter 1’.</p>
<p>Reading this book in the context of the history of anthropological representations of Melanesia, one cannot help but also suspect that the editors have discursively positioned Sutcliffe’s chapter as a shield to protect the volume as a whole from the taint of a previous generation of anthropologists’ now unfashionable renderings of cargo-cultish Melanesians. Without any explicit cross-referencing between chapters, however, the enchantment offered by Sutcliffe seems confined to the introduction. His entirely valid demystification and destabilization of any belief in ‘the West’ as the purveyor of pure reason, though, is echoed implicitly in several other chapters (e.g. Patterson’s, Tomlinson’s, Alexeyeff’s, Rawlings’), but not as evident in others. For example, if Fox’s chapter had taken up the challenge laid down by Sutcliffe, it would have provided some international contextualization of Ponzi schemes before making ones popular in Papua New Guinea in 1999 the focus of his discussion. It will be interesting to see whether and how Sutcliffe’s chapter might be taken up in the future by academics teaching Melanesian and Pacific anthropology, who are likely to be the primary audience and consumers of this book.</p>
<p>This brings us to the question of what anthropology can contribute to our understanding of modernity. The editors suggest that:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the aims of this volume has been to attempt to unsettle the imaginary of modernity, where anthropologists so readily fail to recognise their own commitment to many of the dichotomies that historically underpin its trajectory as a major concept-metaphor in the social sciences. This, perhaps even more than Melanesian encounters with global forces, leads us to suggest that theoretical frameworks and anthropological understandings of modernity require as much ‘management’ as we assume Pacific people have utilized in dealing with the material and intellectual challenges of those encounters. (p. 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
The level of uncertainty expressed here about what anthropology has to offer is surprising, and explains to a certain extent why there is no clear articulation in the introduction, nor in most of the chapters, of how the ethnographic method or anthropological theory can shed new light on phenomena that most economists and political scientists have been able to comfortably ignore and dismiss as primitive curiosities unworthy of serious study. This is where Rawlings’ chapter, then, marks its difference from the others in the volume, both in methodological terms and in content; it serves as an example of the movement to ‘study up’ within anthropology inspired by Laura Nader in the late 1960s and 1970s. Rawlings’ ethnographic approach to studying tax havens in Vanuatu, his interviews with High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs), his analysis of their strategic movements of capital, and the various national and international regimes of legislation that constrain and enable them seems as though it would itself travel well across disciplinary boundaries, and with particular resonance in the field of international finance law. In the end, the sense that one gets when reading most of the other chapters in the volume is that these are mostly anthropologists writing for other anthropologists.</p>
<p>As a discipline, anthropology’s great contribution to the social sciences surely has to be its dedication to seeking an ‘emic’ view, describing cultures from native points of view. As professionals, however, many anthropologists in the Pacific Islands region appear ambivalent about the work of native anthropologists − very few of the chapters in this volume cite native scholars from the countries they write about. In the twenty-first century, it is disturbing that anthropologists can conceive of publishing edited collections on any region of the world without securing any indigenous contributions or co-authorship at all. While a volume entirely authored by indigenous scholars from the Western Pacific entitled <italic>Managing Anthropologists</italic> is probably not too much to expect in the near future, a publication of collected essays and insights from our own research on how we as Pacific people understand/confuse/embrace/resist/transform the concept of modernity is long overdue.</p>
