<abstract>
<p>While the conflagrations that took hold of the South Bronx in New York City from the 1960s to the 1980s and the widespread devastation that resulted focused attention on not only the US ‘urban crisis’ but also on the area’s potential for cultural resurrection and targeted economic development, the struggles of its immediate neighbours to the Northwest have received much less attention. What were the factors that stayed the arson ‘epidemic’ from consuming Northwest Bronx so that it retained some viability? While neighbourhood community organisation has been largely credited with this, and undoubtedly had a major impact, much less attention has been paid to the consequences of cheaply and cynically housing refugees from war-torn Southeast Asia, under a so-called resettlement programme, in the Northwest’s semi-derelict, unheated buildings. Here, perforce, they had no option but to survive and carry on their lives; survival can itself be a form of political resistance, one that does not easily submit to a premature resolution of the conflict.</p>

<p>‘One-ninety-third is straight-up ’hood’, insists 25-year-old Prak Nhil. ‘It’s ghetto.’ During the mid-1980s, Prak and his parents were among the first group of Cambodian refugee families to be moved into an apartment building on East 193rd Street in the Northwest Bronx – a building that was once on the verge of abandonment. ‘But it’s not the ’hood you’re used to seeing in the movies’, says Prak. ‘No tall projects. No crackheads or junkies. No bullets flying outside the window. Most times it’s quiet. But then a gun goes off at four in the morning. It’s no joke up here.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396813476170">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Northwest Bronx is no joke. Having spent almost a decade as a community organiser in the Cambodian refugee neighbourhoods of the Northwest Bronx, I heard this refrain often from the young people with whom I worked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396813476170">2</xref></sup> It was as if, on being asked from which part of the Bronx they hailed, Northwest Bronx youth automatically assumed a defensive posture – one that required them to stress upon inquisitors that their neighbourhoods were as troubled, as violent and as depressingly ‘hardcore’ as any other Bronx turf. At first, I thought these proclamations to be trite and overbearing. The dialogue seemed rehearsed, hijacked from the latest genre of Hollywood gangster films. My position softened, however, as I came to the realisation that the over-emphasis was not so much posturing as it was a reasonable reaction to an obvious and incontrovertible fact: north is always opposite of south. And there can only be one South Bronx.</p>
<p>The Bronx is the fourth largest of New York City’s five boroughs, and for the past four decades its southernmost neighbourhoods have been looked to as the premiere iconographic site from which to narrate sagas of US urban destruction, struggles with poverty and the drug epidemic, and finally the ‘miracle’ of urban recovery. The South Bronx earned this status due to the massive scale of conflagration that consumed the area from the late 1960s through to the early 1980s. Less than a mile separates the South Bronx from northern Manhattan, making it an ideal site for manufacturing firms during the first half of the twentieth century. But, beginning in the late 1960s, an arson epidemic took hold of the south-eastern section surrounding the bustling industrial zone, before spreading north-westwards to consume neighbourhoods closer to the centre of the borough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306396813476170">Figure 1</xref>). From 1970 to 1980 alone, roughly 600,000 people’s homes were lost to fire and abandonment in the Bronx, a figure which accounted for approximately 80 per cent of both the housing units and the population of the South Bronx.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396813476170">3</xref></sup> These fires served as the apotheosis of the US ‘urban crisis’ – a shorthand to describe the rapid structural and economic decomposition of US cities following the global economic downturn of the late 1960s and early 1970s. But from the proverbial ashes grew new cultural and political movements: the hip-hop revolution; the rise of the politically revolutionary street gang; and a renaissance in community economic development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396813476170">4</xref></sup> Indeed, ‘South Bronx’ has since emerged as an idiom for national urban resurrection; it carries a political currency that few other communities can match. As such, its invocation easily eclipses the struggles of other urban communities, particularly its immediate neighbours to the Northwest.</p>

<p>Many longstanding residents of the Northwest Bronx resent the way in which the South Bronx has drawn the lion’s share of media attention when it comes to the topic of urban resilience and redevelopment. Their sense of frustration is understandable when one considers that the public’s fixation with the fires allowed the South Bronx to monopolise funding for urban redevelopment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396813476170">5</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the Northwest Bronx is rarely acknowledged for the fact that it <italic>did not</italic> burn. As Prak intimates, his neighbourhood experienced an intensification of crime, joblessness and poverty similar to that of the South Bronx, and yet it never fell victim to an arson epidemic. However, there was a brief moment during the early 1980s when some large apartment buildings in the Northwest Bronx did burn, and some feared that an arson epidemic was, literally, rounding the corner. These sporadic fires were indeed the collateral damage from the state’s war of attrition in the South Bronx, known as planned shrinkage. Derived from US counter-insurgency strategies in the Third World, particularly in Southeast Asia, planned shrinkage called for the withdrawal of fire fighting, police and other vital services from South Bronx neighbourhoods that city planners deemed beyond saving. The goal was to accelerate the rate of residential abandonment and population dispersal so that these blighted sections could be eliminated once and for all. But before they were completely eviscerated, these neighbourhoods with shuttered firehouses continued to burn, and a decision was made to tax Northwest Bronx firefighting resources to bring the penultimate fires under control. Of course, this reduced the quality of fire protection in the Northwest Bronx, and before long some northern neighbourhoods would exhibit the deleterious signs that once heralded the South Bronx epidemic: the burning of large apartment buildings and the subsequent abandonment of adjacent properties.</p>
<p>But, remarkably, the Northwest Bronx averted the fate its southern neighbours had suffered. Many attributed this to the area’s powerful community organising movement. Beginning in the early 1980s, a coalition of tenants, housing organisers and faith-based leaders joined forces to stop the spread of arson by exposing negligent landlords and demanding greater protection from city officials. Their efforts proved successful, and today some Northwest Bronx residents continue to live by the creed ‘We’re Still Here’. With its housing stock preserved, the area was poised to make a strong recovery after the crisis, and this included the potential for population growth. While other Bronx neighbourhoods experienced only the massive flight of residents, the Northwest Bronx actually saw the arrival of newcomers. Amongst them were 6,000 refugees from Cambodia and Vietnam who resettled in the area between 1984 and 1994. Refugee resettlement seemed to bolster narratives of the area’s resilience and grassroots heroics, as the war-touched refugees were easily cast as the beneficiaries of dogged, local activism.</p>
<p>The community organising narrative is certainly inspiring, exemplary of history-making from below. And yet, as with any dominant narrative, it can conceal as much as it reveals. In what follows, I take a closer look at the early years of refugee resettlement to uncover an alternative set of circumstances that contributed to the staying of the Bronx arson epidemic. The Northwest Bronx buildings most vulnerable to arson were the ones on the verge of abandonment. With so few tenants, these properties could hardly be organised, let alone protected, and in the view of community leaders and public health experts the destruction of only a few such buildings could spark a new epidemic. Here, the unanticipated arrival of new tenants – in this case, refugees from the wars in Southeast Asia – served as a critical stopgap, allowing these properties to become viable again. Could it be, then, that refugee resettlement was not the <italic>outcome</italic> of quelled fires, but rather a key factor in preventing the further spread of arson?</p>
<p>As the South Bronx burned during the mid- to late 1970s, these refugees were in the throes of the ‘zero years’. The US invasion of Vietnam and its subsequent covert bombings of Cambodia precipitated the rise of the Khmer Rouge regime. Under the leadership of Pol Pot, that regime repudiated every perceived cultural and political influence of western modernity in Cambodia, demanding that the nation effectively ‘start over’ by returning to year zero. Thus began the Cambodian genocide that took the lives of approximately two million people, particularly those accused of being indoctrinated by the West: scholars, business professionals, cultural workers and religious leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396813476170">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Amongst those who survived, approximately 300,000 were resettled in the United States following the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396813476170">7</xref></sup> As it happened, the majority of them were placed in some of the most precarious urban neighbourhoods in the US – areas that were being abandoned and in some cases marked for destruction. In the words of one refugee community leader, ‘We were moved from one war zone to another.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396813476170">8</xref></sup> What follows is a serious consideration of this claim. By analysing refugee presence in the Bronx, I trace the connections between US wars of imperialism abroad and the low-intensity warfare in its inner cities. I also describe how acts of refugee survival across both locations created the conditions of possibility for political activism while complicating the very terms of grassroots resistance.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306396813476170">
<title>The war revisited: South Bronx fires</title>
<p>The South Bronx seemed to offer something for everybody. From elected officials who toured its ruins for photo opportunities, to local community leaders eager to launch their not-for-profit careers by engineering its resurrection, to the pioneers of the hip-hop generation who rightly hailed it as the cultural movement’s indisputable point of origin – each enlisted the South Bronx as the pre-eminent theatre of urban danger and unlikely survival, wherein new heroes, heroines and villains could be cast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396813476170">9</xref></sup> In return, the South Bronx became the focus of an unprecedented urban reconstruction programme that lasted for over twenty years, from 1977 until at least 2000.</p>
<p>Its fires were truly unlike anything the country had witnessed before. So breathtaking were the images of the South Bronx’s vast, smouldering landscapes that observers were left to wonder if a real urban apocalypse was upon them. Even as other theatres of the US urban crisis, such as Detroit, Newark and Baltimore, suffered unprecedented rates of destruction, the media and politicians continued to fixate on the South Bronx. In their view, the South Bronx was exceptional – it had the look and feel of a veritable war zone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396813476170">10</xref></sup> By the late 1970s – at the nadir of what President Jimmy Carter described as the nation’s post-Civil Rights, post-Vietnam war ‘malaise’ – the rebuilding of the South Bronx posed a new challenge to US leaders. Carter himself toured its ruins, commenting that the decimated buildings reminded him of eviscerated postwar Europe. He promised to make the South Bronx right again. Its reclamation could serve as a beacon for devastated urban communities throughout the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396813476170">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The president’s call to resurrect the South Bronx was premised on the liberal thesis that the recessions of the early and mid-1970s, combined with the policies of President Richard Nixon, his conservative predecessor, had completely disempowered the urban working class and that its profound sense of hopelessness led to acts of negligence and self-destruction in the poorest of poor neighbourhoods. This analysis masks two important facts. First, the fires were often set by landlords who were attempting to liquidate their devalued properties in order to secure an insurance payout.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396813476170">12</xref></sup> Second, these arsons (for which relatively few landlords were prosecuted, let alone convicted) seemed to be in lock-step with New York City’s official planned shrinkage strategy. By the mid-1970s, city officials determined that some New York City neighbourhoods, particularly those of the South Bronx, were simply beyond saving. They reasoned that poverty, crime and housing abandonment had reached a point of no return in these areas and that it was best for city government to withdraw major services – specifically its fire stations and police stations. Those who remained in these forsaken zones would then have no choice but to leave. Planned shrinkage was dubbed ‘shrink to survive’, but, in the view of black and Latino residents, it was equivalent to being left for dead. Those who closely studied planned shrinkage, such as epidemiologists Deborah Wallace and Roderick Wallace, argue that it was impossible for city planners to predict whether or not the remaining residents would abandon their homes or if they would hold out in the face of the destruction. In this sense, planned shrinkage was nothing short of an unethical human experiment – urban planners deliberately putting the lives of poor people of colour at risk in order to achieve their vision of a city cleansed of its troubled areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396813476170">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering the state’s role in destroying urban territories and dispersing its populations, one could argue that President Carter’s invocation of the South Bronx’s war-ravaged condition exceeded mere metaphor. Indeed, such targeted destruction of urban communities was strikingly reminiscent of the ‘clear and destroy’ counter-insurgency measures recently deployed during the Vietnam War. In both instances, the undergirding logic was to eviscerate a troubled area before quickly abandoning it; the traditional strategy of securing and rebuilding the territory was irrelevant. The linking of the South Bronx and South Vietnam may at first seem far-fetched, but consider that both planned shrinkage and counter-insurgency share a common point of origin.</p>
<p>That common point of origin has much to do with the development of the RAND corporation. Founded shortly after the second world war, its aim was to bring ‘order and rationality’ to US military endeavours through the application of statistical analysis and game theory (developing mathematical formulas to weigh, analyse and anticipate hitherto unpredictable human behaviour). With the US invasion of Vietnam, RAND’s influence reached new heights as its researchers were tasked with developing and rationalising the counter-insurgency strategies that would guide the US military campaign: strategic bombing raids, herbicidal warfare, the relocation of populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396813476170">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the early 1970s, RAND had turned its sights to domestic issues, positioning itself as the thinktank to solve America’s seemingly intractable urban dilemmas. In the two decades after the second world war, black residents took to the streets to protest poverty, segregation and an unrelenting racial violence perpetrated by both white residents and urban police forces. By the mid-1960s, major cities such as Rochester, Philadelphia and Watts burned in what at first appeared to be sporadic incidences of unrest. But, by the summer of 1967, it was clear that a full-scale insurrectionary movement had taken hold, as nearly 200 eruptions shook cities large and small throughout the country. Reactionaries initially sought to dismiss this as senseless rioting amongst the hopeless and disorganised, but to the trained eye of a RAND researcher, the urban conflagration was low-intensity warfare. RAND’s transition from counter-insurgency in Vietnam to management of the US urban crisis was seamless. When President Johnson appointed the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (better known as the Kerner Commission) – the group tasked with analysing the roots of the crisis and proposing remedies – its members and key scribes included those who had pioneered the application of statistical analysis during the second world war, as well as younger RAND researchers such as Anthony Downs, who was to become influential in the newly created urban division of RAND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396813476170">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sections of the Kerner Commission report written by Downs were particularly influential with New York City planners during the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396813476170">16</xref></sup> Downs believed that future civil disorders could be prevented if cities adopted counter-insurgency tactics proven to work in the Third World. In particular, he argued for the dispersal of black communities through the withdrawal of economic support and the acceleration of rates of abandonment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396813476170">17</xref></sup> His work would strike a chord with New York City officials who championed planned shrinkage, calling for the eviction of tens of thousands of South Bronx residents in advance of the area’s destruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396813476170">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Collateral damage is a necessity of war, and the destruction of the Bronx proved no different. Before the South Bronx neighbourhoods targeted by planned shrinkage were completely destroyed, they continued to burn, and city officials called upon the fire companies of the Northwest Bronx to extinguish these enduring flames. With their resources already stretched thin, Northwest Bronx firefighters were unable to respond quickly enough to fires in their own catchment area, and many feared that, over time, this would result in a new arson epidemic. By the mid-1980s, those fears were becoming reality as several large apartment buildings in the Northwest Bronx succumbed to arson. Community leaders such a Monsignor John Jenik, head of the Our Lady of Refuge Parish, believed that it would take only a few large fires to start an epidemic; he was certain that the area was quickly becoming the ‘next part of the South Bronx’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396813476170">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jenik was all too familiar with South Bronx fires, having served there for years before relocating to the Northwest Bronx. He describes with vivid detail the destruction he witnessed in the South Bronx: ‘When those buildings went, the guts just spilled out, the mattresses were half out the doors, as if the buildings were regurgitating their insides.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396813476170">20</xref></sup> Now he feared that something similar was taking hold of the Northwest Bronx. All the early warning signs were there: partially abandoned buildings, fires over a concentrated area of the neighbourhood, residential flight from a particular street. It was as if the South Bronx fires were stalking him: ‘When I came to Our Lady of Refuge, I looked around and said “It’s going to happen here.” I saw it creeping northward across Fordham Road.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396813476170">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, to the Monsignor’s surprise, the Northwest Bronx proved different. In Jenik’s estimation, the residents of these neighbourhoods, unlike those of the South Bronx, were determined to stay. That determination translated into the formation of tenant organisations and community organising groups that worked in alliance with local churches. By 1979 the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition (NWBCC) had been formed, and Jenik was buoyed by its bold stances against landlords, banks and city officials. Its activism stood in stark contrast to the helplessness that had characterised his South Bronx days. ‘The coalition was very savvy. They had expertise and altruism. When buildings were abandoned in the South Bronx, no one protested. When buildings burned [here] we said we had to do something, and we did.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396813476170">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Jenik, the resilience of Northwest Bronx residents may have altered the fate of the entire borough. Who knows how much of the Bronx would have been consumed had they not stopped the corridor of spread? Jenik’s only regret is that so few truly understood and appreciated the singular role of these organising efforts. By the early 1980s, in the denouement of the urban war, the public’s attention turned to rebuilding the South Bronx.</p>

<sec id="section2-0306396813476170">
<title>Enter the refugees</title>
<p>If the residents of the Northwest Bronx felt invisible, then such marginality was compounded for Southeast Asian refugees. All were survivors of the aftermath of the US war in Vietnam and surrounding conflicts in Cambodia and Laos, particularly the Khmer Rouge genocide. Most of them had spent years in UN refugee camps prior to their arrival in the Bronx.</p>
<p>‘We’re nobodies’, says Prak. ‘I look around and say to myself, “What the hell we doing here?” The Vietnamese and Cambodians walk around here like a bunch of ghosts.’ He is referring to the fact that few Bronx residents, let alone New Yorkers, are even aware of the existence of this Southeast Asian refugee enclave. The refugees appear only as a curious footnote – a population that one literally stumbles upon.</p>
<p>One who did stumble upon them was the photographer Mel Rosenthal. The consummate hometown chronicler, his black and white photographs of the Bronx from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s offer some of the most powerful representations of urban crisis and resilience. Rosenthal had come of age in the South Bronx during the 1940s and 1950s. After travelling to Africa and South America to do humanitarian work, he returned home in 1975 to find that ‘a once good, working-class neighborhood when I left, was now in ruins’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396813476170">23</xref></sup> The arson epidemic had reduced much of his community to tracts of rubble. At the time, the mainstream media routinely blamed the destruction on the residents of the community. Rosenthal was determined to tell a different story. He captured intimate portraits of the heroism, pride and mutual compassion exhibited by those who survived and in some instances resisted the burning of the Bronx. Rosenthal, recognising that the destruction was not limited to the South Bronx, also took his project to other neighbourhoods, including the Northwest Bronx. It was during one of his routine outings that he happened upon the Southeast Asian refugees.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One day I was photographing with a medical team from the clinic that was trying to find children who had been exposed to lead-paint poisoning … We went into a building that I thought had people from Puerto Rico and instead Cambodian refugees were there. I was very surprised. The building was in disrepair with broken windows and leaking plumbing. The Cambodians, I later found out, were farmers and completely unprepared for their new lives in the Bronx.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396813476170">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rosenthal seemed to be asking the question on the minds of so many who encountered the refugees during those early years: <italic>why resettle here, of all places?</italic> He surmised that the federal government had decided on the Northwest Bronx so that refugees could take advantage of the new ‘enterprise zone’ being proposed just south of their neighbourhoods. Enterprise zones were government-subsidised programmes that attempted to recruit new manufacturing and retail businesses to devastated urban communities. The photographer wondered whether or not the decision to place refugees so close to the zone signalled the public and private sector‘s faith in the future stability of the area. ‘Perhaps [the refugees] will provide the factories of the enterprise zone a source of reliable and low wage laborers?’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396813476170">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>A rather disappointing answer to Rosenthal’s question would unfold in the coming years, as the South Bronx enterprise zone never came to fruition, and refugees failed to be integrated into local labour markets. Instead, as the new millennium approached, the vast majority of Southeast Asian refugees continued to subsist on welfare grants and the cash wages earned by working in the downgraded manufacturing firms of neighbouring New Jersey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306396813476170">26</xref></sup> After more than a decade of refugee resettlement to the Northwest Bronx, there seemed little to celebrate save for the fact that the housing stock remained largely intact, as the wave of arsons that ravaged the South Bronx never spread to the northern parts of the borough. It seemed that Rosenthal’s sanguine assessment that Cambodian refugees had arrived at an opportune moment – at the tail end of urban decline and the dawn of resurrection – was somewhat accurate. The suggestion was that refugees, despite their relative invisibility, were the unlikely beneficiaries of the activism of locals who protected their homes from arson while demanding government accountability. Yet this urban <italic>bildungsroman</italic> left no room for the possibility that some refugees, particularly the earliest arrivals, were themselves an integral part of the resistance effort. Indeed, if abandoned apartment units invited arson, then it followed that the unanticipated arrival of new tenants to fill those vacancies neutralised the threat. Although the refugees were rarely known to be active in tenant organisations or in the community coalition, did their occupation of forsaken housing units provide a condition of possibility for the staying of the Bronx fires? This is the view of at least one housing organiser who was active with the NWBCC during the 1980s.</p>
<sec id="section3-0306396813476170">
<title>The organiser</title>
<p>Blanca Ramirez also grew up in the South Bronx. But unlike Rosenthal she endured the height of the conflagration. While most Americans watched the Bronx fires on the television news, she ‘smelled the burning each morning, as I walked to school’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306396813476170">27</xref></sup> Ramirez left the Bronx for college only to return a few years later to take a job in community organising. It was a position with the NWBCC, working in a neighbourhood just north of where she had grown up. Ramirez’s Bronx roots distinguished her from the other staff organisers of the NWBCC who were paid to co-ordinate tenant associations, recruit tenant leaders and oversee the day-to-day operations of the coalition. Staff organisers fashioned themselves as the technical support behind the true leaders of the movement: the community residents themselves. The coalition adopted an organising model that is often attributed to Saul Alinsky – the putative founder of modern community organising in the United States – that called upon staff organisers to manage behind- the-scenes logistics so that the community members could be free to exercise their activist leadership: taking to the front lines of rallies; speaking to the media; negotiating directly with power-brokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306396813476170">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet Ramirez never quite believed in this clean division of labour, owing perhaps to her status as neither complete outsider nor insider. Having been raised in the South Bronx during the urban crisis, she could hardly be characterised as the type who was ‘parachuted in’ to organise tenants. And yet she was a college graduate who had returned to the Bronx of her own volition, assigned a post in a neighbourhood that was not exactly hers. From this unique standpoint Ramirez understood community organising to be far more complicated than most career organisers let on. It was clear to her that the staff exercised its political will beyond the carrying-out of daily administrative tasks, and that ‘indigenous leadership’ was too easily romanticised. She was reluctant to attribute leadership solely to those who held the strong political line or engaged in bold direct action. Ramirez instead valued the smaller acts of mutual compassion and survival on the part of tenants who were not necessarily card-carrying members of the coalition; the latent solidarity they forged in their daily attempts to endure, if not always resist, their conditions. According to Ramirez, such solidarity determined whether an organising effort would succeed or fail in a particular building. This point came into sharpest view when she and other staff organisers attempted to form tenant associations in buildings on the verge of abandonment.</p>
<p>Buildings considered top priority for tenant organising were those that were at least one-third vacant, as they were the most vulnerable to arson. Yet it was precisely because of the paltry numbers in these buildings that effective tenant associations were very difficult to organise. ‘There simply weren’t enough folks around to safeguard the property’, Ramirez said. The immediate task, then, was to encourage the remaining tenants not to leave, to assure them that the NWBCC was fully committed to protecting the building. Yet for these tenants, staying was the foregone conclusion; some had nowhere else to go, others simply felt an ineluctable rootedness to the place. In other words, Ramirez and the other organisers didn’t need to worry about their resolve. The most useful thing an organiser could do was to recruit new tenants to occupy the vacated units. But the chances of convincing even those desperate for housing to take residence in a building that others were abandoning was slim to none. In the end, there proved no clear solution to the dilemma of organising in partially abandoned buildings. Any such attempt was always fraught with risk. ‘So much was simply out of our control’, Ramirez said.</p>
<p>One building in particular made her especially nervous. The landlord was a real-estate attorney who held several properties in the Bronx that were on the verge of abandonment. According to Ramirez, he had even been suspected of setting fire to one of the buildings in the University Heights section. The building in question was located on 193rd Street, between Valentine and Decatur Avenues. ‘All signs pointed to him burning 193rd Street next’, Ramirez said. With ‘over a third of the units empty, common areas in disarray, and terrible rodent infestation, the building was an arsonist’s dream’.</p>
<p>But then in the fall of 1983, a housing organiser assigned to the building presented Ramirez with some surprising news. The aforementioned landlord was planning to rent many of the empty apartments at 193rd Street. He had apparently struck a deal with an agency seeking affordable housing for new immigrants. The agency was willing to pay the landlord near-market rents for the units. In return, the landlord was to guarantee housing for several families within the same building. With so many empty units at this property, the request was easily met. Sceptical of the news, Ramirez pressed the organiser for more information. ‘Where did [the landlord] find people crazy enough to move into that building?’ she asked. ‘I’m not sure’, Ramirez recalls the organiser replying. ‘Something about refugees from Thailand.’</p>
<p>Within a week of the arrival of the first refugee families, Ramirez paid them a visit. What she saw shocked her. ‘When we first went to see the refugee families at 193rd Street, the conditions were horrible’, she recalled. ‘There was no heat, no hot water. The windows were broken. It was freezing and you could see your breath in the air. It was like nothing I had seen before.’</p>
<p>For the housing organiser, the resettlement of refugee families in 193rd Street was a bittersweet occurrence. On the one hand, their presence provided some assurance that the building would not be torched, as the landlord had found a way to make it profitable again. ‘[He] would pocket, I would say, $200 a month from the resettlement agencies for each of those empty apartments he rented to the refugees’, Ramirez recalled. ‘And back then that was a life-saving deal for him.’ The revenue from refugee rents effectively neutralised the monetary incentive behind burning a building and cashing in on the insurance. Yet, on the other hand, Ramirez wore a heavy heart. She was certain that those who were inserted into the building were ‘getting the shaft in the worst way’. ‘How were they going to fight for their rights? They had just arrived – from war. Nobody spoke any English. And on their first day here, somebody had already found a way to take advantage of them.’</p>
<p>According to Ramirez, the agency responsible for striking a deal with the landlord and placing the refugees in the Northwest Bronx was a Manhattan-based immigrant and refugee services group that had received a large block grant from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). In addition to providing basic support services, it was to locate housing for Southeast Asian refugee families who arrived in New York City beginning in 1983. The federal grant paid the resettlement agency a set amount for each family, and this included rental fees for the first year. But the agency could negotiate rents that were below original budget projections and to this day it remains unclear how much it was able to save by placing the refugees into substandard housing.</p>
<p>What is certain, however, is that few, if any, additional funds were used to make meaningful repairs to the units that the refugees were given. So Ramirez continued to hold the landlord accountable, doing her best to advocate for tenants who spoke little-to-no English, and who were uncertain of whom to trust. Ramirez also implored the resettlement agency to leverage pressure by withholding the rent payments. But the agency’s social workers absolutely refused to do so. Instead, they stymied Ramirez’s efforts by asserting that the refugee tenants were ‘okay with their situation’, and that they ‘didn’t want trouble’. Nearly twenty years later, Ramirez continues to smart over how little was done to help the refugees during those initial years. Yet through it all the organiser was also cognisant that the refugees’ mere insertion into the building was enough to shift the balance of power. The landlord would not liquidate the property, and this provided a condition of possibility for future organising efforts. Before the end of the following year, four nearby properties – all partially abandoned – had been repopulated with refugee families. Each had once been on the arson trouble list, but in the end none would succumb to fire.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section4-0306396813476170">
<title>We’re still here</title>
<p>Today, the Southeast Asian refugees continue to live in the very same buildings to which they were initially resettled. In the early 1990s, the landlord sold his buildings to new owners who made modest renovations to some units, with other property owners doing the same. And although housing code violations and environmental hazards persist at these properties, the conditions appear qualitatively better than they were twenty years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306396813476170">29</xref></sup> In many ways these buildings tell the story of the resilience and transformation of the Northwest Bronx as a whole.</p>
<p>When Monsignor Jenik first arrived in the Northwest Bronx, many colleagues cautioned him that, ‘the neighbourhood has got a maximum of two years left’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306396813476170">30</xref></sup> They were certain that it was only a matter of time before it went the way of the South Bronx. Today, one of the NWBCC’s more popular and lasting slogans is ‘We’re Still Here’. It reminds residents of the power of community organising. And although coalition leaders, including the Monsignor, are well aware of the presence of refugees, of how their resettlement coincided with a critical moment in the history of the Bronx fires, their account makes no mention of them. But this omission should not be interpreted as a mere disregard for the newcomers; indeed, Jenik has often lauded the refugees for being a vital part of the neighbourhood’s multicultural fabric. Nevertheless, by leaving them out of the resistance narrative, he can better privilege the community organising work as the historical determinant. For to suggest that the fate of the Northwest Bronx was determined, however obliquely, by the arrival of the refugees – by those placed in substandard and abandoned units due to agency negligence – is to take away from the tenet that political change is always generated by the politically active grassroots; by common people who find the will to join together in a fight. Unlike Blanca Ramirez, who believed that so much was always outside the control of even the most skilled and committed organising group, there is a sense of inevitability that attends Jenik’s analysis: the people will win so long as they are organised and persistent.</p>
<p>That grassroots resistance should be analysed and appreciated beyond the strictures of the organisation – its goals, strategies and tactics – to take into consideration everyday forms of resistance is by now a common point of critique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306396813476170">31</xref></sup> But my specific concern has more to do with how the privileging of organisational resistance can naturalise the daily violence experienced by those who live under the threat of fires and other forms of post-industrial devastation. I want to challenge the logic that one either succumbs to violence or organisationally resists it. Could it be that an experience with violence without the guarantee of political redemption may nevertheless result in critical social change?</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Eight years old at the time of their arrival to East 193rd Street, Sokhan, Prak’s cousin, vividly recalls the terror he felt upon resettling to the building:<disp-quote>
<p>Roach infested. Rat infested. Trash everywhere. It was dangerous to walk outside, even in the hallway. Some folks were scared of the roughnecks who lived on 193rd. But I was scared because I never knew what I was going to step in when I went outside – even in the hallway. It was like the whole place was a hellhole.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Maly Nhil, Prak’s mother, it is the blistering cold of that first winter that she will never forget. Nothing could have prepared her for the cold of a Bronx winter, particularly one void of indoor heat and hot water. For long stretches of the winter, both were unavailable to tenants at 193rd Street, as the landlord refused to refill the building’s fuel. And when the heat and hot water returned, the tenants found themselves having to keep their apartments warm by locating material to patch the missing or broken window panes.</p>
<p>Maly Nhil recalls how she and her husband spent the first days after their arrival in the Bronx tracking down highly coveted pieces of cardboard used to cover the windows:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s how I learned to get around the neighbourhood in the first days. We would go out to search the trash for cardboard. I remember there was so much trash in the streets! One day, we even found some wood. It came from chairs that somebody threw away. My husband started to break the wood into small pieces. He wanted it to make a fire inside the apartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306396813476170">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But the irony of her husband setting a fire in this particular Bronx unit was lost on Maly Nhil. Indeed, there was nothing ironic about these harsh living conditions, this distinct form of violence that refugee families were subjected to. She is brought to tears when she recalls how she and the other parents found themselves herding their children into the warmest of the six apartments that were assigned to refugees:<disp-quote>
<p>Because of the cold, the little children became sick very easy. They had never felt a winter before. Prak and his cousins had very high fevers. Most of the children were sick. We checked to see who had the warmest apartment. Sometimes it would be ours. Sometimes a neighbour would have more heat. We would move all the children to the warmest one. Ten or twelve people – we all lived in the warm apartment. We would use the cold apartment for cooking only.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As they had done in the refugee camps and throughout their harrowing escape from the war zone, the refugee community sustained itself that first winter by drawing upon a tradition of mutually supportive networks. Here, it would be easy if not tempting to turn to a discussion that lauds the refugees for enlisting their uncanny survival skills, for taking matters into their own hands as displaced peoples are so inclined to do. But to focus on the resilient nature of refugees is to naturalise the deliberate violence being perpetrated against them. For Maly Nhil it was less about her proclivity for survival than it was a matter of self-defence. ‘What else were we going to do?’ she asks, her voice rising slightly with anger.</p>
<p>Her experiences point to a certain continuity of violence. It was as if nothing had changed upon crossing into this final nation of asylum. Here again she was forced to contend with the negligence and venality of agency workers and keepers of the settled space (in this instance, the urban slumlord) who promised safety – or at least a reprieve from violent conditions – but granted the opposite. The clean break between the past and the present was a grand abstraction; no sooner did she arrive in the Bronx than she found herself scavenging for materials, outmanoeuvring the elements. ‘We had waited a long time to come to America. It was supposed to be our happiest day, [but] instead it hurt me very much’, Maly Nhil said.</p>

<sec id="section5-0306396813476170" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>If the refugees played a pivotal role in staying the spread of the South Bronx fires, then the question remains what kind of political recognition should we bestow upon them? As a matter of political agency, how are we to understand their forced settlement and survival in relation to the stalwart community organising that is largely credited with preventing the burning of the Northwest Bronx? By way of conclusion, I resist the temptation to cast the refugees as unsung heroes – as those whose valiant political work has heretofore gone unnoticed. This is not how the refugees view those initial years; they did not enlist themselves for this role any more than they chose to be inserted into the precarious housing units of the Northwest Bronx. And though they, too, can claim the slogan ‘We’re Still Here’, it may mean something entirely different to them. In recounting the harsh conditions that she was forced to endure, Maly Nhil betrays no desire to be hastily included into the community organising narrative. Her testimony comes across as a critique of the failures of the US refugee resettlement programme as well as an assertion that her arrival in the Bronx did not bring an end to her long sojourn. Her sense of placelessness continued in the new territory, where she and others were forced to defend themselves in much the same way they had in the camps.</p>
<p>Be it the camp or the ghetto, refugees are negotiating a space of confinement set within a broader conflict. They manoeuvre within the confines in order to optimise their life chances. Such movements may at times yield improbable outcomes, but the refugees are cognisant that their freedom is far from guaranteed so long as the larger war persists. This expansive view is what distinguishes refugee survival from the tightly localised, if not myopic, representation of neighbourhood-based class struggle championed by traditional community organising. Those who suggest that the South Bronx failed to save itself because its residents possessed neither the capacity nor resolve for sustained community organising campaigns fail to appreciate how the north and south were targeted to play very distinct roles in the state’s counter-insurgent strategy of disassembling and eradicating the poorest and most volatile urban communities.</p>
<p>The black and Latino residents who inhabited these communities were the direct descendants of American labour enslaved and colonised. Their presence was a central feature in the emergence of the industrialised US nation state, and its rise to unprecedented power throughout the long twentieth century. But now, with the arrival of the post-industrial epoch, in a city well on its way to becoming the primary node of a truly global capitalism, these populations were deemed excessive, expendable. A cleansing was in order. The burning of the Bronx cleared the way for a new and perhaps more permanent stage of urban war and captivity defined by the collapse of the modern welfare state, the crack-cocaine epidemic, and skyrocketing incarceration rates of black and brown youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306396813476170">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the outset, all of this was obscured by loose talk of urban recovery and resurrection. The promises made by politicians who toured the ruins of the South Bronx during the early 1980s masked the pending and irreversible tragedy of the coming years. But into this stepped the refugees whose occupation of forsaken buildings continued to expose the underside of urban recovery. The environmental violence to which the refugees were subjected evinced not just the failure of the resettlement programme, but its fundamental <italic>impossibility</italic> in a context of protracted urban warfare. As a matter of justice, their acts of mutual survival exposed the ongoing ruptures of the post-arson ghetto. Survival can itself be a form of political resistance, one that does not easily submit to a premature resolution of the conflict.</p>

<citation citation-type="other">According to the Wallaces, the arson ‘plague’, as with any infectious disease, propagates when one abandoned property (the infected individual) is able to pass infection to several susceptibles clustered around the disease. In the most typical scenario, a structural fire results in the abandonment of a building which in turn leads to the sudden abandonment of an adjacent property, as those neighbouring tenants fear the spread of arson from a vacated to occupied site. Compounding matters is the landlord of the second property who believes that the loss of his building is inevitable, and therefore fails to maintain it. This only advances the overall rate of susceptibility at the specific site. The Wallaces use this model to explain how quickly an arson epidemic can take hold. It only requires one or two strategically situated buildings to begin propagation. Wallace and Wallace, op. cit., pp. <fpage>47</fpage>–<lpage>77</lpage>.</citation>

<citation citation-type="other">During the late 1990s and early 2000s, I provided housing advocacy to several Cambodian and Vietnamese tenants who continued to live in the semi-derelict apartment buildings to which they were originally resettled. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (the agency that regulates housing conditions), there are three grades of housing code violations – A, B and C – with C violations representing the most serious infractions that require immediate correction. Through my advocacy work, I observed that landlords were careful to keep C violations at a minimum, as these brought immediate scrutiny from the state. However, A and B violations were pervasive, and they too continued to create hardships for tenants.</citation>

<citation citation-type="journal">The work of Loïc Wacquant is particularly incisive in its articulation of a new phase of ‘advanced marginality’ in the US ghetto and other urban centres across the globe. This phase, argues Wacquant, relies on policies and practices that ‘<italic>make the ghetto more like a prison</italic> and <italic>… the prison more like a ghetto</italic>’.
