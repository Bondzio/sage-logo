<abstract>
<p>Marxism was central to the understanding of South Africa’s struggle for freedom. This article provides a critical analysis of Marxist literature on South Africa since the 1970s, drawing out its relevance for contemporary analyses of the post-apartheid state and for radical politics today. It suggests that while the literature offered important insights into the character of the apartheid state, it failed to provide a critical appraisal of the state per se. Moreover, the capturing of state power by the liberation movement was not grounded in an understanding of the oppressive character of the state-form. The undermining of mainstream Marxism under neo-liberalizing conditions in post-apartheid South Africa has opened up the prospects for anti-statist radical libertarian thinking (including autonomist Marxism), and this thinking is consistent with the practices of certain autonomist popular politics currently emerging. Social theorizing on South Africa has had a complex relationship with Marxism. This article is interested in drawing on this experience in an effort to understand its implications for the ‘new’ South Africa where, 20 years after apartheid’s formal ending, social transformation remains caught in the logic not of Marxism but neo-liberalizing capitalism.</p>

<p>If Marxism is going to have a more prominent place in South African studies, then let us hope that it will be a civilised Marxism rather than a Neanderthal Marxism, one that is committed to dialogue and that eschews narrow dogmatism.

<title>The rise of South African western Marxism</title>
<p>Frederick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612470532">Johnstone (1976)</xref> wrote the epigram to this piece two years after publishing the first full-length study – <italic>Class, Race and Gold</italic> – of an aspect of South Africa history from within western Marxism. Along with a number of South African scholars (exiles and émigrés), mostly based in England, notably Harold Wolpe, Martin Legassick, Shula Marks, Richard Atmore and Stanley Trapido, Johnstone vigorously attacked the hegemonic ‘Liberal School’ within South African studies which claimed that racial domination undermined capitalist economic growth and that, with time, capitalist growth would end racial domination and so demonstrate the strength of liberal capitalism to foster social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0725513612470532">O’Dowd 1977</xref>). In contrast, the ‘New School’ – to use Johnstone’s label (1978) – argued that racial domination was historically functional to capitalism.</p>
<p>Overall, two main Marxist perspectives emerged on South Africa:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612470532">1</xref>
</sup> these reflected the classifications in English Marxism that Perry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612470532">Anderson (1980)</xref> first made. Drawing these closer to South Africa, the sociologist Wilmot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470532">James (1983)</xref> called these two positions ‘social history’ and ‘historical sociology’. The former was associated with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London, which was then directed by the Cape Town-born historian Shula Marks, but the position is more readily associated with the name of Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0725513612470532">van Onselen (1982)</xref> and, institutionally, with the History Workshop at Johannesburg’s University of Witwatersrand. This perspective was influenced by E. P. Thompson and the British empirical tradition – it stressed agency over structure and sought to reconstruct South African history from below through sensitivities to the experience and resistance of the popular classes.</p>
<p>The other approach, what James called historical sociology, was championed by Harold Wolpe, Frederick Johnstone and Martin Legassick – the historian Christopher Saunders called these three the ‘elder statesmen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0725513612470532">1988</xref>: 169). This approach represented a more structuralist tradition in sociology and was strongly influenced by the work of Nicos Poulantzas, whose influence was evident in the work of the ‘second generation’ structuralists, notably Michael Morris, Dan O’Meara, Dave Kaplan and Duncan Innes, who were once called the ‘gang of four’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470532">Burawoy 2004a</xref>: 663). The historical sociologists often debated amongst themselves on issues of class, state and power, but rarely did the two main trends in South African western Marxism engage each other.</p>
<p>In an early review of this literature, sociologist Belinda Bozzoli expressed methodological (and political) concerns by arguing that South African Marxism simply entailed the crude importation and adoption of a ‘northern theory’ into which South African realities were fitted, leading to what she called ‘locally received orthodoxies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612470532">Bozzoli 1981</xref>: 53); in particular, the very specificity of South African society, namely the constitution of racial subjectivities, was regularly reduced in a functionalist manner to ‘class’, so that ‘race’ (in Bozzoli’s view) was treated as an mere epiphenomenon. Her own writing was more inclined to social history and bent towards E. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0725513612470532">Thompson’s (1978)</xref> ‘poverty of theory’ argument which sought to promote theory in a flexible and contingent manner with an eye to both interrogating and breathing life into historical and social evidence. For Bozzoli, the act of theorizing in South African Marxism meant that ‘real’ theory’ was produced in the North and that South Africa is not a ‘source of theorizing’. As a result, she argued, ‘what South African reality could demonstrate to the intellectual world, has increasingly been pushed aside in favour of what that world can tell us about South African reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612470532">Bozzoli 1981</xref>: 54).</p>
<p>Despite this criticism, Marxist intellectual work on South Africa flourished throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and a range of disciplines (mainly at the country’s white English-speaking universities) were dominated by Marxism. This blossoming was lifted by the re-birth of radical thinking and activism in Western Europe after the momentous events of 1968. As a result of this influence, South Africa Marxism might be classified as a ‘civilized’ as opposed to ‘Neanderthal’ Marxism (to use Johnstone’s terms) that was espoused by the exiled South African Communist Party (SACP), which ‘had little sympathy’ for western-style Marxism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470532">Nash 1999</xref>: 73).</p>
<p>Of great significance in the development of South African Marxism were the linkages that developed between work in the academy and the political work in workplaces and the townships. It was especially through the re-activation of work-based and community-based organization and mobilization against the apartheid regime which took place during the 1970s and 1980s that the theory-practice divide was closed. This was vividly seen in the activist role of white intellectuals in the non-racial (but mostly black) trade union movement which grew in the 1970s, notably in the cities of Durban and Johannesburg. And it was also found in the mass-based nation-wide movement called the United Democratic Front (UDF) – sometimes called the internal wing of the exiled African National Congress (ANC) – which was founded (and indeed flourished) throughout the 1980s.</p>
<p>The sociologist Ari Sitas, reflecting on ‘these “struggle days”’, speaks of the ‘indigenous hybridity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0725513612470532">Sitas 1997</xref>: 16) of radical intellectual formations. He continues:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>What can be traced as an intellectual formation started being developed outside and despite [of] University ‘disciplinarities’. What started from the early 1970s onwards through marginal and harassed groupings of left intellectuals, white and black, was a social discourse which had a normative and political foundation; it was such a formation that provided the culture levers to prize open departments and disciplinary fields of inquiry. And such a formation, contained different narratives of emancipation and was animated by egalitarian norms. (1997: 13)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sitas further notes that the resulting formation included not only white Marxist academics and students, but also intellectuals linked to the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) of Steve Biko,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0725513612470532">2</xref>
</sup> ANC-linked intellectuals (who were in and out of Robben Island), and a younger generation of trade unionists, most of whom were black. Western Marxism took root in South Africa in this fluid, contested and creative context. Opening a sociology of knowledge optic on this history, Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470532">Nash (1999</xref>: 66–7) has argued that it was ‘the peculiarities’ of the ‘process of assimilation’ of western Marxism, ‘rather than the ideas …which influenced specific individuals’, which was largely responsible for the ‘form of this [South African] moment [in] western Marxism’.</p>
<p>The ideas of the historical sociologists were quickly disseminated through their published work and seminars, and also through a cohort of graduate students, many of whom had returned to South Africa to teach. In the country their ideas were absorbed by academics and students who had been radicalized by the student revolt in Europe in 1968 and by local events which included the 1976 Soweto Insurrection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513612470532">3</xref>
</sup> By the early 1980s, there was talk of a Kuhnian-style scientific revolution, as Marxism made ‘great headway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470532">Jubber 1983</xref>: 54) within the academy.</p>
<p>Despite reservations that it had all the negative characteristics of a ‘normal science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612470532">Bozzoli 1981</xref>), a critical intellectual formation had emerged which, by the 1980s, had become an (extra-academic) public intellectual formation which seemed determined to serve the cause of liberation.</p>
<p>The sociologist Shireen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470532">Ally (2005)</xref> has traced the emergence of western Marxism amongst white intellectuals, linking it to the growth of the BCM and the non-racial black trade unions. Although specifically interested in the role played by her discipline at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, Ally drew a broad – and highly critical – conclusion about the growth of this radical intellectual formation. South African Marxism, she says, was ‘a reflection of power’ and was ‘the product of a conditioning by various social and political forces and processes that … deeply implicate it in power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470532">Ally 2005</xref>: 2, 5). But there was a further, more practical complication over the issue which deserves our attention. In the late 1960s, the BCM had begun to stress the importance of race over class; organizationally, it excluded whites and assigned whites – Marxist or other – no role in the struggle against apartheid. In Ally’s view, Marxism did not appeal to white intellectuals on the basis of objective truths and rationality; rather, she argued, it provided them with ‘a comfortable discourse’, which stressed class over the uncomfortable issue of race, with which to ‘interrogate structures of power’ – this rendered them politically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470532">Ally 2005</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Further, the acceptability of class analysis was made easier by the organizational and political space provided by the emerging black trade union movement, with its non-racial stance. The facts seem to bear out this interpretation because during the 1970s, and well into the 1980s, most of the senior and more powerful positions in these unions were occupied by white Marxists. Another sociologist, Sakhela <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612470532">Buhlungu (2006)</xref>, offers an additional critical view of white trade union officials by arguing that their positioning in the union movement side-lined black organic intellectuals. Responding to the latter charge, a third sociologist – Johan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470532">Maree (2006)</xref> – claims that white radicals made a crucial contribution to building democratic union structures. For Ally, though, the adoption of western Marxism – and the resulting political activism – by white intellectuals was a ‘self-preservation mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470532">Ally 2005</xref>: 13) or a means to justify some form of intellectual or political career.</p>
<p>There was, however, great diversity in the relationship of university intellectuals towards the various organizations which constituted the liberation movement; some worked directly (and often on a full-time basis) within movements, as we have seen in the trade union case, others stood at a distance and enjoyed greater intellectual autonomy. Hence, serious debates (and many divisions) grew during ‘the struggle days’ within the liberation movement and between Marxist intellectuals. The historian Martin Legassick offers an interesting example of the dilemmas and choices facing individuals. Although deeply committed in the anti-apartheid struggle, he adopted a critical perspective towards the liberation movement. Because of this, in 1979 he was expelled and (with others) formed the Trotskyite-affiliated Marxist Workers Tendency of the ANC. Within the non-racial trade union movement, there were also ongoing contestations between two factions, respectively called ‘Workerist’ and ‘Populist’. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612470532">Buhlungu (2006)</xref>, white union activists normally adopted the former (a more ‘class-ist’) position and viewed the national liberation movements with great suspicion. There were further Marxist-directed debates within the ANC and UDF on the significance of working-class leadership, and on the issue of ‘one-stage’ and ‘two-stage’ theories of social transformation.</p>

<sec id="section2-0725513612470532">
<title>The waning of South African western Marxism</title>
<p>With apartheid on the verge of collapse, in the late-1980s, South Africa was a country fecund with Marxist debate and it seemed plausible that the country’s future would be speeded by two developments in this direction. The first was the strong socialist current that ran through an increasingly confident trade union movement. Secondly, throughout the 1980s local affiliates of the UDF had established street-level cell structures (called street committees<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612470532">4</xref>
</sup>) in urban black townships which were strongly inclined to employ Marxist rhetoric. These factors suggested the potential, if not the reality, of a competing national ideology and a series of dual-power organs which, themselves, pre-figured post-apartheid forms of radical democratic practice. Certainly, the scene seemed set for exciting times under post-apartheid conditions in which, surely, social transformation would have to be a national priority. There were also grounds for believing that, notwithstanding the collapse of the Soviet system and the deepening appeal of neo-liberal economics, the international community would be comfortable with a post-apartheid state pursuing – at the very least – a path of social democratic development with an eye to redressing the historical legacy of inequality and social injustice.</p>
<p>Today, the post-apartheid government, led by the ANC and its alliance partners (the SACP and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (known as COSATU)), both enunciates and follows a populist form of politics which is devoid of progressive content. Although redistributive social programmes are in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0725513612470532">Seekings and Nattrass 2005</xref>), these are framed within, and are subordinated to, an orthodox neo-liberal macro-economic programme. The result is a form of top-down technocratic development in which policies seem devoid of any serious commitment to grassroots democratic mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612470532">Heller 2009</xref>). At issue here is not simply the pace of social change within the post-apartheid state but, more importantly for our purposes, its very direction. Several controversies around the tricky question of nationalization suggest that the government baulks at calls for nationalization of the mines, for example. The ANC’s stance on this issue seems to imply that nationalization in the cause of redistribution represents a radical form of change which is far too difficult for the country to take. Although nominally committed to undoing the worst excesses of apartheid, the ANC seems to have chosen a path that firmly integrates the country’s economy into an international economic system which seems intent on reinforcing divides between rich and poor with no regard for history, either local or global.</p>
<p>Despite the very real historical functionality, both of segregation and apartheid to capitalist development in the country, the South African Marxist literature of the 1980s did raise questions about the rising ‘dysfunctionality’ of racial domination, especially for the economic and political needs of monopoly capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470532">Fine 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0725513612470532">Saul and Gelb 1981</xref>). This argument formed the basis of Harold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0725513612470532">Wolpe’s 1988</xref> book, <italic>Race, Class and the Apartheid State</italic>, which made two main claims. First, though it highlighted contradictory trends within racial capitalism, South African-style western Marxism ultimately subsumed these within the broad functionality of racial domination. Secondly, the relationship between apartheid and the capitalist economy was a contingent, not a structural one. So, under favourable conditions, South African capitalism could survive – indeed, blossom – without racial domination in any form. This explanation has had serious strategic consequences for social transformation in post-apartheid South Africa, including the implication that the struggle against racial domination was not inherently an anti-capitalist struggle. It certainly seemed that the contradictions and crises of the 1980s had raised the prospects of South African capitalists adapting to conditions of de-racialization and even, perhaps, pursuing this end as a deliberate intellectual and ideological project.</p>
<p>The so-called ‘years of transition’ (1990–1994) saw this class project pursued to its logical conclusion with ANC backing, in what John Saul ironically called the ‘class snuggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0725513612470532">Saul 2000</xref>); others have called this an ‘elite transition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612470532">Bond 2005</xref>). This was a time when mass-based community organizations, at the forefront of critical urban struggles, were being de-mobilized; overall, this was not necessarily a deliberate strategy, but was as a consequence of the conclusion to ‘the struggle’ in which the ANC, to all intents and purposes, had been declared victor. But, if truth be told, none of the debates within the anti-apartheid movements offered a serious and engaged critique of state-driven transformation as an alternative way to build a new society.</p>
<p>Not only did the ANC choose the well-trodden path on apartheid’s ending, South Africa’s western Marxists seemingly did likewise. Andrew Nash argues that ‘the leading [intellectual] figures of [a] generation capitulated almost without exception to the imperatives of the market and the crudest forms of bourgeois ideology’ (1999: 66). Not all moved away from radical praxis, though; an important exception to the rule was a small grouping of Trotskyites including Martin Legassick, to whom the reader has already been introduced, and who continues to engage with social movements. Others of a younger generation, who were not deeply schooled in local Marxism with its statist leanings, did not follow the dictates of market-driven policies; neither did they go into the state or a state-aligned project but moved, instead, either into NGO-based civil society or into popular struggles.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the global retreat from Marxism, following the end of the Cold War, also played a role in the neo-liberalizing turn amongst an older generation of thinkers on South Africa. In this, the country is no different from what has happened elsewhere. As several observers have confirmed, throughout Africa in recent years there has been ‘a sterile array of sociological production’ which has been devoid of ‘transformational and emancipatory agendas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470532">Aina 2004</xref>: 90, 91). Tariq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470532">Ali (2006)</xref> has also pointed out that only Indian scholars remained faithful to Marxist thinking during the ‘lost decade’ of the 1990s.</p>
<p>However, just as the rise of western Marxism in South Africa had local dynamics, so did its collapse. To this issue our discussion now turns. Three years after the coming to power of the ANC government, Sitas pessimistically declared that the powers of sociology – especially the critical edge provided by Marxism – were ‘beginning to wane’ (1997: 12). We must question this statement, though. Did he mean the sociologist’s powers or the powers of sociology were on the wane? This is because, seven years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0725513612470532">Sitas (2004</xref>: 19) admitted that ‘we [South African sociologists] are growing our very own psychological blockages’ and, further, that there is a ‘collapse in our broader social-ethical commitments’. So, it is likely that both the capacity of sociologists and their discipline were on the wane in the face of neo-liberalism. This obviously had a deleterious effect on radical thinking in South Africa.</p>
<p>As John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470532">Holloway (2002)</xref> notes, personal and political pessimism often leads to theoretical re-working and, more importantly, retreat which, understandably, has a negative feed-back effect on thinking and activism. By 2002, even the committed Martin Legassick (then lecturing at the purportedly left-wing University of the Western Cape) could matter-of-factly claim: ‘At the moment, Marxism and Revisionism are not the main sorts of history being written. Even I’m not writing that, mainly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513612470532">Legassick 2002</xref>: 124–5). Marxism in South Africa had experienced what everyone else had, namely both a dilution and a challenge that came from the likes of post-structuralism. The outcome of all this is to be seen all about the post-apartheid academy: in the past 20 years, Marxism is hardly recognizable as a distinct perspective. Indeed, it is rare to find any university-based intellectual who openly declares him or herself as a Marxist, and it seems safe to say that any such academic would be considered ‘Neanderthal’ (or intellectually backward) amongst most in the country’s academic community.</p>
<p>Two white intellectuals of the ‘struggle days’, Ari Sitas and his one-time Wits colleague, Eddie Webster, both of whom were involved in the union movement, expressed their concerns at the direction of these events. For Webster, the transition to democracy had ‘profoundly changed the context of South African sociology’ and, as he lamented further,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[i]t is ironic that the moment of liberation from apartheid should be accompanied by new constraints on independent intellectual work. The advent of democracy has indeed shifted the centre stage away from the social movements that led to the democratisation process, toward the new state whose demands are for more technical policy-oriented research. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0725513612470532">1997</xref>: 280)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Seven years later, he reiterated this view, admitting that changes within the country continued to</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[e]xert pressure on South African sociologists to move away from a critical and public sociology towards an instrumentalist approach to knowledge that focuses more narrowly on publishing in professional journals and the generation of income through policy oriented research. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0725513612470532">2004</xref>: 35)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a similar vein, Sitas argued, with only a hint of self-blame:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>At a moment when a remarkable transition is underway with its transformation processes and struggles … when one of the world’s most acute laboratories of social experience is working itself out in front of us, we have lost the capacity to respond creatively. At a moment too, when the state priorities and its research agendas are favouring meeting the majority’s basic needs, we look, despite our past, conceptually threadbare. (1997: 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Besides the reversal of Marxist thinking worldwide and the demobilization of local social movements, commentators routinely finger two further reasons for why the critical edge to intellectual work (and specifically western Marxism) lost its footing in South Africa. First, there has been a restructuring of higher education which, in following the international fashion, has embraced the commodification of the work of the academy with an accompanying obsession with quantified research outputs and external benchmarking. Secondly, as already suggested, there has been a significant migration of ex-liberation intellectuals into well-paid consultancy work and into both corporations and government; these include several who have become policy researchers with the state-supported Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0725513612470532">Uys 2005</xref>). The ability of these often talented people to foster progressive social change comes at a time when the humanities, with their critical edge, are on the back-foot in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0725513612470532">Vale 2008</xref>). There has also been, as in other countries, a dramatic donor-driven NGO-ization of the ‘radical’ academy. These, taken together, have resulted in what Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612470532">Burawoy (2004b</xref>: 25) calls the ‘instrumentalization’ of intellectual knowledge, which involves ‘turning it away from an interrogation of ends to an obsession with means’. On this issue, and with great accuracy, Burawoy notes that the post-apartheid state sees the discipline of sociology ‘as an instrument in plans for national reconstruction. It has little patience for public and critical sociologists that articulate the disparate interests to be found in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612470532">2004b</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>These insights follow Zygmunt Bauman’s distinction between two types of public intellectuals, namely, ‘legislators’ and ‘interpreters’. For Burawoy, the first type, the intellectual-as-legislator, engages with the priorities of the party (during liberation) or state (during reconstruction), and has limited autonomy. The intellectual-as-interpreter, the second type, is concerned with visualizing a new moral and political order: as a result, s/he has significant critical distance from any party or political organization. In Burawoy’s view, the ANC government has reversed priorities on this. Instead of encouraging critical reflexive intellectuals in the post-apartheid period, South Africa’s government believes that while ‘intellectuals had played an effective interpreter role in the trenches of civil society during liberation, they must return to the barracks to be legislators [by] focusing on training and policy research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470532">Burawoy 2004a</xref>: 672–3).</p>
<p>This is the very problem that John Holloway sees for intellectuals who seek state-centred change. For Holloway, no political organization or entity (say, ‘The Party’) can claim a monopoly of insight into the features of a just order: therefore intellectuals – as autonomous reflexive individuals – can never simply investigate means to given political ends. To do this would be an intellectual compromise and represents even a contradiction in terms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470532">Burawoy (2004a</xref>: 659) notes this in relation to the career of Harold Wolpe, the South African sociologist whose name has already crossed our path. ‘Like Althusser’, Burawoy writes, ‘Wolpe wanted to create a space for independent theorising within the framework of liberation’, so as not to become simply a party functionary. And, certainly, the last years of Wolpe’s career reflected this: after apartheid, Wolpe (who had long been a member of the ANC) increasingly criticized the post-apartheid government by questioning its very goals and priorities with a view to stimulating a broader debate about the possibilities for deeper social transformation.</p>

<title>South African Marxism and northern theory</title>
<p>The problem about the application of western Marxism to South Africa, which was raised by Belinda Bozzoli, raises questions about the dominance of ‘northern theory’ not only in South Africa but globally, too. This was, thus, a problem not unique to Marxism in South Africa during its flowering years, the 1970s and 1980s. The sociologist Ken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470532">Jubber (1983)</xref> traced the development of the social sciences at the University of Cape Town (UCT), the country’s oldest university, and argued that, in terms of course content, it resembled a ‘displaced British university’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470532">Jubber 1983</xref>: 58). Prior to the coming of Marxism, Parsonian structuralism-functionalism was the dominant paradigm in sociology at most South African universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470532">Jubber 2007</xref>). This fact only confirms that, throughout the last century, ‘northern theory’ was hegemonic throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America, as it both defined and delimited intellectual projects and formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470532">Connell 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>But sociology was not alone, as all academic fields of inquiry in South Africa are linked – in varying degrees and forms – with northern centres of knowledge and, if anything, these links deepened with the ending of apartheid. In her 2003–4 study of intellectual workers in South Africa, Raewyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470532">Connell (2007b</xref>: 25) concludes that both their lives and labour are ‘profoundly shaped’ by</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he geo-politics of knowledge. The history of colonialism, the peripheral economy, the strategies of the Apartheid state, the events of the transition, the global rise of neo-liberalism, all shape their destinies and identities. Their stories interact with the history of intellectuals in the metropole, but are in no sense reducible to it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>South African scholars understood this, too. Ari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0725513612470532">Sitas (2006</xref>: 369) has written about the ongoing ‘culture of application’ that involves the borrowing of ‘discourses incubated in the centre’.</p>
<p>Here, further points seem worth making. The prevailing critique of the dominance of northern theory, and the often-repeated call for the development of ‘southern theory’, does not entail a wholesale rejection of northern theory. Of course, the notion that two distinct intellectual formations (one, northern; the other, southern) exist can – indeed, should – be called into question, especially given the existence of a common social-system globally. However, scholars from ‘most of the world’, to use Partha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0725513612470532">Chatterjee’s (2004)</xref> phrase, have reflected on the debilitating conceptual ramifications of intellectual-cultural domination of northern thinking and often seek to counteract it. But when they speak about developing indigenous (‘southern’) theory, they invariably ask that this should constructively engage ‘northern’ theories, allowing for cross-fertilization. Debunking Euro-centrism, which is embedded in northern theory, is encapsulated in Frantz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612470532">Fanon’s (1986)</xref> notion of returning the colonial gaze and Edward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0725513612470532">Said’s (1978)</xref> admonition to strike back at Empire. However, neither Fanon nor Said sought to replace northern knowledge-systems with their polar opposite, namely, ‘nativist African’ and ‘Muslim fundamentalist’ cosmologies respectively. Rather, their intention was to identify, understand and transcend dichotomous thinking patterns that remained trapped within distorting spatial-temporal dualisms which reflect the northern experience only.</p>
<p>Any claim about Marxism’s irrelevance to South African realities (or the inherently negative implications of its application to South Africa) must overstate the case. Indeed, though often crude and reductionist, Marxism regularly displayed these tendencies in its ‘countries of origin’, too. So, Marxism’s engagement with South Africa, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, involved coming to terms with the country’s specificities. Further, South African Marxism also showed remarkable flexibility in rethinking its understanding of the relationship between class, race and state as the apartheid regime became increasingly dysfunctional to capitalist economic growth.</p>
<p>Then, since the 1970s and 1980s, there has been – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470532">Callinicos (1999</xref>: 259–95) suggests – a cracking-up or splintering of social theory as long-standing theoretical traditions have broken apart, and a new repertoire and diversity of approaches to social theorizing has emerged. This, a ‘significant proliferation in new conceptual approaches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470532">Elliot and Ray 2003</xref>: xi), has both complicated and reinvigorated theoretical perspectives on the social world. Routinely, however, these developments have been un-problematically presented as reflecting universal concerns, when arguably they are bounded by assumptions inherent in northern epistemology and ontology. The splintering itself reflects the influence of post-modernist/post-structuralist thinking both in the humanities and the social sciences, but here a central problem is that much of the literature which speaks to ‘the post-modern condition’ is removed from socio-economic life in Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>The same pathway applies for claims which detail the transition from Fordist to post-Fordist regimes of production, or for those interested in exploring transitions from material to immaterial labour forms. Many modernist forms of reasoning, including those emanating from ‘the North’ (and there should be no doubt that Marxism remains important to the North), are deeply relevant to ‘the South’. This said, it is clear that theoretical splintering has had universal effects and has certainly opened up intellectual space for non-Marxist kinds of radical thinking (such as radical libertarianism) to be drawn to the fore.</p>

<title>Marxism, state theory and libertarian change</title>
<p>Despite the weaknesses of the historical sociology approach within South African-style western Marxism during the 1970s and 1980s, including pronounced structuralist and reductionist leanings, it did seek to conceptually confront the nagging question of the state, especially its racialized and class character. This is unmatched by the literature which has appeared on the post-apartheid state.</p>
<p>The South African literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612470532">Davies et al. 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0725513612470532">Innes and Plaut 1978</xref>) on class, race and state initially involved a debate between Poulantzians and state derivationists, raising questions about the relative importance of intra-capital conflicts and capital-labour struggles in shaping the politics of apartheid. However, it soon became clear that the terms of this debate were limited. Despite a common concern with developing state theory and, notwithstanding that both Poulantzian and German state derivationist thinking was sensitive to the crystallization of struggles within the state-form, its protagonists failed to give attention to the nature of the state itself. In all this work, the state appears almost as a ‘black box’: in systems theory terminology, ‘inputs’ entered the South African state and ‘outputs’ emerged. But there was no exploration – let alone analysis – of the transformation effects either of these inputs or outputs, or, indeed, the relationship between them.</p>
<p>As we will soon discover, the Marxist work sought to overcome this critical weakness, but not always successfully. This work did, however, raise crucial questions about the interests, agency and consciousness of state officials, about struggles internal to the state, and about policy formation and implementation processes, especially during apartheid’s final phase. This, a more Weberian concern with state and bureaucracy, was potentially important in enriching Marxist state theory because it viewed the state (in and of itself) as an ‘object’ of investigation and conceptualization. But, although it did mark an advance in South African approaches to understanding state and society, this work was often coloured by functionalist and reductionist lenses. Thus, the state was said to have interests, but these were compatible with the interests of capital: in other words, there are struggles within the state but, the reasoning went, their outcome was a function of capital.</p>
<p>With an eye to demonstrating this, we turn to consider some of the literature on state interests and intra-state struggles. The political scientist Stanley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513612470532">Greenberg’s book, <italic>Race and State in Capitalist Development</italic> (1980)</xref>, stands out in terms of its discussion of the interests of the apartheid state. Greenberg saw the apartheid state as largely serving the interests of white capital. But, in discussing the apartheid state’s sustained assistance to white commercial farmers, he suggested that this lay, perhaps, in ‘the development requirements of the state itself rather than in the political standing of the white farming community’ (1980: 87). More broadly, he argued that the ‘fate, identity, and ideology [of state officials are] intimately bound up with the survival and continuing elaboration of the [apartheid] racial order’ (1980: 389). Unsurprisingly, state bureaucracies and officials were said to be resistant to any undoing of the racial order in the 1970s. While the relation between capital and state is historically contingent, from Greenberg’s perspective, the state remained conceptualized in terms of a crude object-subject dichotomy: for one observer, Greenberg’s book ‘treated’ the state per se as a ‘monolith’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612470532">Hindson 1980</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>In 1982, Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612470532">Burawoy (1982</xref>: 112) helpfully suggested that if South African state theory was to advance it ‘must escape the subject-object conceptualisation and begin to develop a notion of the state as a specific set of relations’. In this respect, Harold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0725513612470532">Wolpe (1980</xref>: 419) had spoken of the state as a ‘complex structure of contradiction and conflict’. This emphasis on intra-state relations undermined the notion of a single and endlessly homogeneous ‘state interest’: the state itself does not have interests, rather groups (vertically defined in terms of apparatuses or, horizontally, defined as levels of management-cum-administration) within it do. Dan O’Meara’s acclaimed study <italic>Volkskapitalisme</italic> (1983), which was an examination of the development of Afrikaner capitalism, sheds further light on this. O’Meara argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0725513612470532">1982</xref>: 2) that the state is not external to class struggles (including, at the time, struggles within and amongst the governing Afrikaners) but, rather, is itself ‘a site of class struggle’. He identified a number of these within the state bureaucracy. So, under the prime ministership of John Vorster (1966–78), ‘[t]he factionalist struggle within the NP [National Party] was increasingly fought within, but more particularly between, various government ministries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0725513612470532">1983</xref>: 252). Later, P. W. Botha’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513612470532">5</xref>
</sup> reorganization of the state bureaucracy sought to weaken the resistance of the so-called <italic>verkramptes</italic> (conservatives) against the reformist efforts of the <italic>verligtes </italic>(modernizers). These conflicts certainly contributed to marginal changes in the character of the state.</p>
<p>This genre of writing, though significant in its appeal, often reduced state interests to class interests and intra-state struggles to class struggles. In this way, the literature did not provide an overarching and coherent theoretical framework for understanding state-capital relations in a non-reductionist and non-functionalist manner. David Yudelman’s book, <italic>The Emergence of Modern South Africa </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0725513612470532">1983</xref>), spoke of a symbiotic (or power sharing) relationship between state and capital – a relationship that is ‘a more or less permanent relationship of mutual dependence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0725513612470532">1980</xref>: 67). So, for Yudelman, not only capital, but the state itself had its own logics, interests and powers. This position is reminiscent of C. Wright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513612470532">Mills’ (1956)</xref> power elite theory which had fore-grounded the existence of separate, non-reducible, power centres which were both economic and political. Yudelman applies the symbiotic framework, with certain functionalist implications, in analysing the gold mining industry from 1902 to 1939, a period during which both mining capital and the state incorporated white labour and exploited black labour. This understanding suggested that the state has its own interests and rationale in pursuing particular policies and programmes.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, these insights provided an important corrective to more reductionist Marxist renderings of the apartheid state. The willingness to engage with non-Marxist contributions and indeed to incorporate these into a broad and flexible Marxist framework was one hallmark of what Frederick Johnstone in the epigram to this article called ‘civilised’ Marxism.</p>
<p>The rise of post-modernist and post-structuralist perspectives on the social world suggests that the prospects of engaging with non-Marxist thinking are much greater under post-apartheid conditions. The splintering of theoretical traditions and specifically the challenges to Marxism in academia – both of which we have discussed – has opened up space for radical libertarian initiatives including both classical anarchism and post-anarchism. This, one might think, should bode well for the development of state theory. This is especially important given the ongoing fixation in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513612470532">Neocosmos 2004</xref>) with the state, which is viewed as the necessary – and seemingly only – basis for post-apartheid social transformation. At the same time, ‘Neanderthal’ Marxism in the form of ongoing Stalinism embedded in the SACP survives, along with a sprinkling of overtly Trotskyite intellectuals with vanguardist inclinations. Against these, there is a non-statist Marxism in the form of autonomism – here we have in mind specifically John Holloway’s autonomism of negativity (2002, 2010) – with its clear affinities to certain non-Marxist libertarian work. We suggest that autonomist Marxism, along with Marxist social history, is critical for revitalizing Marxist work in post-apartheid South Africa and for re-imagining a new form of radical politics.</p>
<p>Based on an understanding of the specificities of the Zapatista movement in southern Mexico, John Holloway argues for a society-centred theory of change that counterposes social power to state power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470532">Holloway 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612470532">2010</xref>). This approach disputes a state-centred theory of change which conceptualizes power as centralized and entrenched in the state. State-centric change ignores the critical basis for capitalist cohesion, namely the everyday fetishized social relations in which all actors are located. The modern state-form has arisen primarily through the historical separation of ‘the economic’ and ‘the political’ – as a force, not for emancipation, but oppression. So, dramatically seizing the state in capitalist society or even acquiring state power through electoral means along more evolutionary lines entails reproducing the conditions necessary for sustaining capitalism. This, as we have suggested, is what has happened in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>
<p>The Holloway approach does not deny that the contradictions of capitalism become reflected (and refracted) in the state which – as a set of material practices – is itself a site of struggle; in fact, Holloway himself was linked to state serivationism in the 1970s and to this specific claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612470532">Holloway and Picciotto 1978</xref>). But, as Bob <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513612470532">Jessop (2007)</xref> has shown, there are certain strategic imperatives embedded in the state under capitalism which seriously compromise its powers to transform. For Holloway, true emancipatory power lies deep within active civil society, and social transformation entails pre-figurative politics and interstitial revolution in which the cracks within capitalist society are constantly pried and pushed open by ‘autonomous’ forms of politics.</p>
<p>This approach, which involves a critique of the generic state-form, links with other intellectual trends. Besides classical anarchism, over the last few decades post-anarchism – a ‘fusion’ of anarchism and post-structuralism – has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470532">Day 2005</xref>). This claims that many of the localized struggles taking place, across the global landscape, have anarchistic principles embedded within them. Simultaneously, there are a number of older, former-Marxists such as Alain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470532">Badiou (2005)</xref>, who remain influenced by the worker/student struggles of 1968 and who continue to highlight the significance of anti-statist politics for authentic emancipation.</p>
<p>These intellectual trends, which are not beyond critique, have ramifications for popular struggles in post-apartheid society. So, for instance, the writings of Holloway and Frantz Fanon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612470532">Gibson 2011</xref>) animate the logic and practices of some of the shack-dweller movements – notably <italic>Abahlali baseMjondolo</italic> in Durban. The sociologist Franco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612470532">Barchiesi (2004</xref>: 328), who once taught in South Africa, has suggested that there is a ‘decline of established [that is, state-centred] paradigms of the “Left” in South Africa’, arguing that this opens the prospects for pursuing refreshing forms of radical popular autonomous politics which seek to recover control over local spaces which are free of old-style vanguardist politics. This form of politics, though, is not divorced from the state and may indeed at times operate on the state’s turf through, as an example, the formal legal processes. Ultimately, however, it seeks to act in a manner that goes beyond the state’s terms and its routines for determining what is, and what is not, politics.</p>
<p>Autonomist politics is not merely a post-apartheid phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0725513612470532">Neocosmos 2009</xref>). So, although state-centred struggle and the capturing of state power were embedded, as trajectories, within domestic anti-apartheid organizations of the 1970s and 1980s, there was also an anti-statist thread that sought to build alternative forms of communality in a pre-figurative way. This was true of the (previously mentioned) street committees which were attached to the urban civics affiliated to the UDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0725513612470532">Seekings 2000</xref>). This, a situational autonomist form of politics, always threatens conservative social forces. Hence the ANC, in its quest to consolidate state power since the mid-1990s, has neither maintained nor facilitated social mobilization; at times, it has in fact subdued any form of community-based politics that exists outside of its party structures. Likewise, today, autonomous movements have been subject to active hostility and, indeed, direct repression by the state, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470532">Chance (2010)</xref> details in relation to <italic>Abahlali </italic>and its members.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470532">Nash (1999</xref>: 79) has argued that a key lesson to be learnt from the demise of western Marxism in South Africa is that the basic philosophical division between Soviet and western Marxism has not entirely disappeared, but that they remain as two ‘fundamentally different philosophies’. While this is certainly true, the strands of Marxisms in post-apartheid South Africa are more complicated than Nash seems to posit. Of interest is the intellectual work and activism of high-profile Trotskyites, such as Patrick Bond, Ashwin Desai and Martin Legassick (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0725513612470532">Friedman (2012)</xref> on Legassick). So, although western Marxisms in South Africa have declined, Trotskyism is present not only in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0725513612470532">Ngwane et al. 2012</xref>) but also in NGOs and to a lesser degree in popular struggles including the powerful HIV/AIDS movement called the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0725513612470532">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>South African Trotskyites tend to be state-centric and at times they have criticized social history. In doing so, they have drawn parallels between social history and autonomism. Thus Desai (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513612470532">Lee 2009</xref>: 154) argues that ‘South African intellectual life is sterile with … many younger intellectuals espousing a kind of social history that simply wants to record the voices of the poor devoid of any theory’. This interpretation of the intent and work of social historians (and of the current younger generation of radical libertarians) seems over-stated. Embedded in their work are theoretical underpinnings sensitive to the proto-theorizing of subaltern peoples. This kind of intellectual work is critical to revitalizing the recognition that everyday life and experiences, on the one hand, and social and political activism, on the other, are not different spatial practices but represent a continuum in intertwined social processes.</p>

<sec id="section5-0725513612470532">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have argued that certain brands of South African Marxism both past and present have overly-statist orientations. While they recognize the limitations imposed by the capitalist form of the South African state and its continued racial manifestations, they have failed sufficiently to consider the state-form itself and its underlying logics and rationalities. As autonomist Marxism and other radical libertarian traditions recognize, Marxism in South Africa needs a different perspective. More autonomist and libertarian leanings will help to identify the significance of pre-figurative politics and will reinforce the need to build a new humanity in the country on the ruins of apartheid and following 20 years of post-apartheid disappointment. To succeed, however, this must draw from a politics of dignity rather than purely a politics of redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470532">Holloway 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of many strands within western Marxism is an idea of humanism. Any post-capitalist project in South Africa must be a humanist project, in the Fanonian sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612470532">Gibson 2011</xref>). In their famous work <italic>Empire</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470532">Hardt and Negri (2000)</xref> drew a distinction between a transcendental humanism (propagated often by vanguardist political organizations) and an immanent humanism that arises from the everyday experiences and struggles of specific and diverse groups of people. The latter does not entail a clear divide between statist politics and anti-statist politics. In practice, statism and anti-statism are simply ends of a continuum which, in themselves, never exist in pure forms as they are interrelated and exist dialectically. For example, the dialectical quality of the Bolivarian revolution in contemporary Venezuela is suggestive of the need for both statist and non-statist autonomist political trajectories. This experience teaches that a revolutionary party, if subject to the discipline or democratic control of a range of ongoing constituent powers, may forge an immanent presence in the daily lives of its citizens. This, however, does not undermine the need for an interstitial revolutionary process which undercuts everyday cohesion in capitalist societies and that, in a pre-figurative manner, will build the new humanity which South Africa so desperately needs.</p>
