<p>This year’s presidential election confirmed how strong a grip the far right has achieved over the Republican Party, once a political vehicle for big corporations, small business owners, farmers, and progressive reformers like Teddy Roosevelt and Fiorello La Guardia. To win the nomination, Mitt Romney renounced many of his former positions, including support for abortion rights and a health care mandate, rewriting history to describe himself as having been a “severely conservative” governor of Massachusetts. Like John McCain, four years earlier, Romney sought to energize unenthusiastic conservative voters and contributors by picking a red-meat, right-wing running mate, the tax-cutting, budget-slashing, abortion-banning Paul Ryan. Tea Party Republicans have managed to purge centrists (RINOs or “Republicans in Name Only”) or have compelled those who remain to adhere to the ideological predilections and programmatic demands of the right. All this is evidence of how far right the Grand Old Party (GOP) has moved since the mid-twentieth century, when leaders of even its conservative wing took positions more liberal than those embraced by one-time party moderates like Romney and McCain. More startling still, conservative Republicans once questioned the imperial vision that has informed American foreign policy since soon after World War II.</p>
<p>Take Robert Taft—“Mr. Republican”—the standard bearer for the conservative wing of the GOP, who repeatedly was edged out of his party’s presidential nomination by more moderate candidates, Wendell Willkie in 1940, Thomas Dewey in 1948, and Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. The son of President William Howard Taft, the younger Taft, made his reputation in the Senate as a bitter opponent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Yet in spite of his distaste for federal regulation and bureaucracy, he accepted the idea that government has a responsibility to ensure basic social well-being. By the early 1940s, he had come to support federal aid for health and medical care, an expansion of the social security system, and public works as an economic stimulus “when private activity falls off.” All Americans, he believed, should be ensured “a minimum standard of living” unless they refused to work. “Apart from the general humanitarian interest in achieving this result,” he said in 1947, “equality of opportunities lies at the basis of this Republic.”</p>
<p>For Taft, equality of opportunity meant equality for blacks as well as whites. He opposed the poll tax and, unlike FDR, supported federal antilynching legislation. Although he generally dismissed federal aid to education, he thought that federal dollars should be used to upgrade African-American schools in the segregated South to national standards. In asserting that “No child can begin to have equality of opportunity unless he has medical care in his youth, adequate food, decent surroundings, and above all effective schooling,” he anticipated the language Lyndon Johnson would use to justify his “War on Poverty.”</p>
<p>Taft was not a New Dealer—far from it. He feared that a large federal government would undermine individual liberty and that the taxes to pay for it would sap the economy, a strain of thinking that had strong support within the GOP, especially in the Midwest. Many owners of small- and mid-sized family businesses, who provided a backbone of support for GOP conservatives, opposed both government regulation and organized labor on grounds of political philosophy and personal self-interest. Today, Taft is best remembered—to the extent he is remembered at all—as coauthor of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which amended the National Labor Relations Act to check the power of unions, which were a crucial element of the New Deal coalition.</p>

<p>But in spite of his personal conservatism and the inclinations of his base, the political dynamics of the country and the Republican Party pulled Taft toward the center. The Great Depression and the New Deal radically changed public thinking about the role of government in regulating the economy and promoting social well-being. An activist liberal state became accepted as the new norm. Progressive Republican governors, like Thomas Dewey in New York and Earl Warren in California, promoted expansive views of what government could and should do, with Warren even proposing a compulsory, state-sponsored, single-payer health insurance system, far more radical than the plan Romney established in Massachusetts before rejecting the whole idea of mandated health coverage.</p>
<p>Taft was unwilling to go as far as Warren, who before his appointment to the Supreme Court was Dewey’s vice presidential running mate in 1948. (The ticket of Dewey and Warren was itself indicative of the extent to which moderates dominated Republican politics then.) But seeking to move beyond his conservative home grounds in Southern Ohio to win the Presidency, Taft bent with the times, accepting the need for large-scale federally funded social programs, especially if they were run by the states or local governments rather than directly from Washington, D.C. Besides the Taft-Hartley Act, Taft’s other major legislative achievement was the 1949 Housing Act, which he cosponsored with two Democrats. The law authorized the construction of more than 800,000 units of public housing through funding for local housing authorities and included provisions for slum clearance and urban renewal, a bold use of government money and power unthinkable today among conservatives.</p>
<p>Taft’s foreign policy outlook was shockingly at odds with the dominant thinking in both political parties today. Throughout his career, Taft challenged the wisdom of the United States trying to impose its values and power on the rest of the world, seeking to avoid military conflict except in the direct defense of American territory. When in 1941 <italic>Life</italic> magazine publisher Henry Luce wrote of a coming “American Century,” Taft decried the notion as being based “on the theory that we know better what is good for the world than the world itself.” Taft opposed military alliances, which the United States started to construct after World War II. Maintaining a large military apparatus required a general expansion of government, just what Taft hoped to avoid, and would be, in his view, an unsustainable economic burden. Many Republicans—along with liberal Democrats—put up stiff resistance to the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, which won passage only when top government officials fanned anticommunist fears.</p>
<p>Eventually, Taft did go along with the increasingly aggressive, militarized globalism promoted by President Truman and his allies in both parties but only reluctantly. Almost predicting Republican foreign policy doctrine since the 1980s, he warned “We will occupy all the strategic points in the world and try to maintain a force so preponderant that none shall dare attack us.” But “potential power over other nations,” he warned, “however benevolent its purposes, leads inevitably to imperialism.”</p>
<p>By the mid-1950s, anti-internationalist views like Taft’s had all but disappeared from both parties. Ron Paul’s anti-imperialism during the past primary season, with its echoes of long-ago conservative critiques of the Cold War, made him a pariah among Republican power brokers, an outlier from support for a worldwide military presence and proclamations of American moral superiority embraced by Romney and every other leading politician, Democrat and Republican.</p>

<p>Of course, just as it does today, the Republican Party of the 1940s and 1950s had more than its fair share of nuts and demagogues, from Joseph McCarthy, with his vicious red-baiting and lack of interest in factuality (a precursor to so much of current politics) to John Bricker, the other Ohio Senator, a dim-witted isolationist who drove President Eisenhower to fury with his efforts to constrain the conduct of diplomacy. More moderate Republicans tolerated and sometimes used the party’s far right to gain partisan advantage. But when the loony right threatened to get out of hand, party centrists reeled it in, as when McCarthy’s false charges about communist influence in the Army and the CIA led Eisenhower to work behind the scenes to undermine him. The acceptance by GOP moderates, especially Eisenhower, of the welfare state and liberal internationalism led to the demise of the old Republican right and an era in which debate over the New Deal at home and Cold War abroad all but ended. Republican leaders with strong ties to multinational corporations and internationally oriented banks, such as Nelson Rockefeller, had little patience for the parochial, domestic-oriented, small government conservatism of what remained of the Taft wing of the party.</p>
<p>Today, the dynamics within the Republican Party are the opposite of what they once were, with far right politicians, donors, and issue groups forcing moderates to move in their direction, rather than the other way around. The change has been a long time in coming. The massive defeat Barry Goldwater suffered in 1964 seemed to demonstrate long-term liberal hegemony. But the idea of an expansive, activist state began losing its luster in many quarters once government power was used to support equal rights for African-Americans, women, and gays and when liberal, Keynesian policies proved incapable of overcoming the deep economic woes of the 1970s. The election of Ronald Reagan (who first won national political attention with a speech backing Goldwater) marked a clear shift in the center of gravity of American politics, as the tidal drift pulled the Democrats as well as the Republicans sharply to the right. By the 1990s, even the leader of the Democratic Party, Bill Clinton, was declaring the age of big government over.</p>

<p>Right-wing Republicans have proved shrewd political operators, aided by vast pools of money from wealthy individuals and corporations. Their effective takeover of the GOP reflects a substantial popular base, built through decades of grassroots organizing around opposition to abortion and gay rights, alliance with evangelical churches, economic deregulation, chest-thumping patriotism, support for the military, and tax reductions. The conservative triumph we are witnessing is a rare moment in U.S. history, the ideologically driven capture of one of the two major parties. Unlike in the rest of the democratic West, American parties generally have avoided ideological clarity, building power through often incongruous alliances—like that between New Dealers and Southern segregationists—and pragmatic compromises. Conservative Republican activists have broken the mold. It is hard to know what something so radical portends about the future of American politics. Romney’s loss may lead to a reassessment of the hard right Republican turn by party leaders and their business backers who need electoral victories for practical reasons. Alternatively, if conservatives take the defeat as an occasion for insisting on even greater conformity to right-wing positions, it will mark another step in the fundamental realignment of American politics along ideological lines.</p>
