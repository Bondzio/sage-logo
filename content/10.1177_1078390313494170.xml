<abstract>
<p><bold>BACKGROUND:</bold>A number of states have implemented Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams statewide. The extent to which team-based care in ACT programs substitutes or complements primary care and other types of health services is relatively unknown outside of clinical trials. <bold>OBJECTIVE:</bold> To analyze whether investments in ACT yield savings in primary care and other outpatient health services. <bold>DESIGN:</bold> Patterns of medical and mental health service use and costs were examined using Medicaid claims files from 2000 to 2002 in North Carolina. Two-part models and negative binomial models compared individuals on ACT (<italic>n</italic> = 1,065 distinct individuals) with two control groups of Medicaid enrollees with severe mental illness not receiving ACT services (<italic>n</italic> = 1,426 and <italic>n</italic> = 41,717 distinct individuals). <bold>RESULTS:</bold> We found no evidence that ACT affected utilization of other outpatient health services or primary care; however, ACT was associated with a decrease in other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT) through a reduction in the intensity with which these services were used. Consistent with prior literature, ACT also decreased the likelihood of emergency room visits and inpatient psychiatric stays. <bold>CONCLUSIONS:</bold> Given the increasing emphasis and efforts toward integrating physical health and behavioral health care, it is likely that ACT will continue to be challenged to meet the physical health needs of its consumers. To improve primary care receipt, this may mean a departure from traditional staffing patterns (e.g., the addition of a primary care doctor and nurse) and expansion of the direct services ACT provides to incorporate physical health treatments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing attention focused on the physical health needs of persons with severe mental illness, who have higher rates of chronic conditions and poorer physical health than those in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313494170">Chwastiak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313494170">Cuddeback, Scheyett, Pettus-Davis, &amp; Morrissey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313494170">Joukamma et al., 2006</xref>). Although the Affordable Care Act encourages linking Medicaid enrollees with severe mental illness to a primary care–based medical home, critics have charged that a specialty-based home may better serve the needs of this complex population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313494170">Alakeson, Frank, &amp; Katz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390313494170">Smith &amp; Sederer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is a community-based service delivery model that helps individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals to function in the community and avoid readmission. ACT is based on several key principles, including 24-7 wrap-around services, integration of services, and multidisciplinary staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313494170">Bond, Drake, Mueser, &amp; Latimer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313494170">Stein &amp; Test, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390313494170">Trawver, 2010</xref>). The requirement of multidisciplinary staffing includes nurses, and although the role of nurses in ACT has not been widely studied, nurses often play a key role on ACT teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313494170">Cuddeback &amp; Shattell, 2010</xref>). Potential avenues for expanding nursing roles within ACT teams have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078390313494170">Weinstein, Henwood, Cody, Jorden, &amp; Lelar, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Through a broad set of possible services, which can include medical care, stabilizing living situations, vocational rehabilitation, and improving functioning and quality of life, ACT may be a specialty service that can meet both the medical and psychiatric needs of persons with severe mental illness. In fact, ACT is one of the most widely studied interventions for persons with severe mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390313494170">Trawver, 2010</xref>) and has shown to be effective at reducing psychiatric hospital admissions and hospital days in more than 40 clinical trials (Lehman, Steinwachs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390313494170">&amp; Co-Investigators of PORT Project, 1998</xref>). However, little is known about the impact of ACT on use and costs of either other outpatient health services or primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313494170">Latimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390313494170">Shattell, Donnelly, Scheyett, &amp; Cuddeback, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although several studies have touched on issues of continuity of care for persons with severe mental illness and more specifically ACT recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313494170">Crawford, de Jonge, Freeman, &amp; Weaver, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313494170">Lachance &amp; Santos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313494170">Marshall &amp; Lockwood, 2000</xref>), few studies have looked directly at patterns of use for other outpatient health services among ACT participants. An extensive review of the ACT literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313494170">Latimer, 1999</xref>) notes that ACT teams can substitute for a variety of other outpatient services, and in so doing, actually decrease the use of other services outside the ACT team. Yet this substitution has not been consistently demonstrated in the literature. For example, the original ACT team in Wisconsin appeared to decrease the use of outpatient clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313494170">Stein &amp; Test, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390313494170">Test &amp; Stein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078390313494170">Weisbrod, 1983</xref>), but studies of other teams and intensive case management programs found a range of results. For example, ACT has been associated with site-level differences in use of outpatient clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313494170">Chandler, Hu, Meisel, McGowen, &amp; Madison, 1997</xref>), no difference in use of programs at a community mental health center between ACT team consumers or those in standard care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313494170">Bond, Miller, Krumwied, &amp; Ward, 1988</xref>), higher costs for mental health outpatient visits for individuals on ACT compared with standard aftercare at an outpatient clinic with no community care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390313494170">Lehman, Dixon, Keman, &amp; DeForge, 1997</xref>), and lower outpatient costs for ACT consumers than for those in standard case management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313494170">Clark et al., 1998</xref>). A systematic review of research on ACT noted that these differences in reported outcomes might be a product of ACT teams not having high fidelity to the ACT model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313494170">Latimer, 1999</xref>). In addition, there are several studies that address issues of continuity of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313494170">Crawford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313494170">Lachance &amp; Santos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313494170">Marshall &amp; Lockwood, 2000</xref>), but few ACT studies have looked directly at primary care.</p>
<p>In this article, we examined patterns of primary and other outpatient health care for persons with severe mental illness participating in a statewide implementation of ACT in North Carolina from 2000 to 2002. In particular, using Medicaid claims files, we analyzed whether investments in ACT yielded savings in services such as primary care and other outpatient health services, emergency services, and Medicaid-funded inpatient psychiatric services. Changes in outpatient service use outside of the ACT team may affect Medicaid expenditures as well as patterns of care for ACT participants, and these changes are important to track.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was reviewed and exempted by the institutional review board at the University of North Carolina.</p>
<sec id="section3-1078390313494170">
<title>Data Sources and Sample</title>
<p>Claims data from the NC Medicaid program were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the calendar years 2000 through 2002. ACT participants were identified in the claims data through billing records for ACT services. The sample included adults above the age of 21 years who were enrolled in NC Medicaid at some point during 2000 to 2002 and who had a qualifying mental health diagnosis (schizophrenia [ICD-9 = 295], affective disorders [ICD-9 = 296, except 296.2], paranoia [ICD-9 = 297], and psychoses [ICD-9 = 298]). NC’s claims data include all services paid for by Medicaid. NC did not use any mental health managed care carve outs during the study period and only used a capitated model in one five-county area (100 counties statewide). Persons in the capitated area are not included in the present study, since actual service use is not observed in capitated systems. In all other counties, claims for both physical and mental health care are included. Data were collapsed to the person-quarter level.</p>
<p>To examine whether team characteristics served as a moderator of the patterns of health services used, claims data were linked to a phone survey of NC ACT teams conducted in the fall of 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390313494170">Meyer &amp; Morrissey, 2004</xref>); team-specific data on fidelity to the ACT model during the sample period (2000-2002) were not available. From the Medicaid data, unique ACT participants were linked to specific ACT teams using billing provider codes in the claims data. Each Local Management Entity has one or more provider identification number(s) listed as billing providers on the ACT Medicaid claims. These provider identification numbers were used to link the ACT survey variables to the claims for those on ACT. A small number of individuals (3% of people on ACT) had claims from multiple ACT providers within one quarter, likely because of relocation. These individuals were assigned to the team that was used for most of the quarter.</p>
<p>The ACT team survey provides details on ACT team fidelity and was part of an evaluation component of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Institute of Mental Health’s Science to Service planning grant, which was given to North Carolina to improve service delivery and implementation of evidence-based practices. The respondents were often the team leaders (<italic>n</italic> = 28) but were sometimes administrators or supervisors (<italic>n</italic> = 10). The survey provided ratings for the following aspects of fidelity to the ACT model based on the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078390313494170">Teague, Bond, &amp; Drake, 1998</xref>): admission criteria, intake rate, team size, staffing, caseload size, community-based services, responsibility for treatment, crisis services, team approach, dropout policy, and program meetings. These data were then used to classify whether teams were considered to be “established” (functioning with at least 60 consumers and a staff of 6 full-time mental health professionals; <italic>n</italic> = 7) or “developmental” (functioning with 8 to56 consumers and 2 to 10 full-time staff; <italic>n</italic> = 33). These classifications were defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390313494170">Meyer and Morrissey (2004)</xref>, and the cutoff points were based on criteria suggesting that the optimal ratio of patients to clinicians is 10 to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390313494170">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the use of Medicaid claims data for this analysis, which include no information on fidelity to the ACT team model, we are unable to observe the fidelity of each ACT team during our study period. However, ACT teams in the present analysis were reimbursed with ACT payments from NC Medicaid and met the state’s criteria as an ACT team during this time period. We conducted additional analyses using secondary data on team-level characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390313494170">Meyer &amp; Morrissey, 2004</xref>) collected shortly after our study period to determine whether being on an established or developmental team affect our findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078390313494170">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A longitudinal, observational study design was used. The intervention group included individuals who had at least one Medicaid claim for ACT services between 2000 and 2002 (<italic>n</italic> = 11,374 person-quarters and 1,065 distinct individuals).</p>
<p>We used two control groups in this study to better understand how ACT worked when compared with different referent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390313494170">Rosenbaum, 2002</xref>). The first control group, referred to as the “Potential ACT Group,” consisted of individuals with two or more psychiatric hospitalizations in general hospitals (Diagnosis Related Groups [DRGs] 424-427, 430, 432-437), who were not on ACT during our study period. These persons meet the eligibility criteria for ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313494170">Bond et al., 2001</xref>) and were included here as potential ACT consumers (<italic>n</italic> = 15,043 person-quarters and 1,426 distinct individuals). Because this control group was conditioned on hospital use, their levels of hospital use and Medicaid expenditures during the study period were expected to be higher than for the ACT intervention group, which was not required to have prior hospital use during the study period.</p>
<p>We also employed a broader, second comparison group, which we refer to as the SMI Control Group. This control group was composed of individuals who did not receive ACT services during our study period but who had a diagnosis of severe mental illness in the claims files regardless of hospital use. This larger control group (<italic>n</italic> = 405,942 person-quarters and 41,717 distinct individuals) included those in the Potential ACT Group. It should be noted that this second control group was designed based on diagnosis only, not duration or disability. These persons reflected a mix of functionality and disability, including those who likely would not use the same intensity of services as either ACT consumers or those assigned to the Potential ACT comparison group. However, the mix of hospital use made this group an appropriate comparator to ACT recipients during our study period.</p>

<sec id="section5-1078390313494170">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1078390313494170">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>We examined a mix of health services use measures, including the use of primary care, a broader measure of other outpatient health care (excluding ACT), emergency care without respect to diagnosis, and inpatient psychiatric care. These measures are further described below. Primary care was defined using CPT codes for evaluation and management services likely to be used by primary care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078390313494170">Rosenthal, 2008</xref>; procedure codes 99201-99215, 99341-99350, 99354, 99355, 99358-99359, 99361-99373, 99381-99429, 99499). Outpatient services other than ACT included both mental and physical health services including primary care. Emergency care was identified by procedure codes (99281-99285), revenue codes (450-459, 981), and/or place of service codes (23) and includes both psychiatric and medical emergency services. Inpatient psychiatric care included stays with a mental health DRG code in either general or specialty hospitals. Total Medicaid expenditures is the sum of Medicaid spending on all Medicaid reimbursed services each quarter, including all outpatient costs as well as ACT costs. Hospital stays with substance abuse DRG codes only were not separately analyzed but are included in total expenditures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078390313494170">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The percentage of the quarter that an individual used ACT was defined using the ACT procedure codes and Medicaid enrollment dates. ACT is considered an outpatient service both for Medicaid reimbursements and for program planning purposes. In this study, we distinguish use and costs for ACT and for other outpatient health services (excluding ACT). This allows us to estimate the impact of ACT on other outpatient service use and costs without confounding estimates with the monthly costs of ACT itself.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven percent of ACT participants had at least one gap in ACT billing during the 3-year period of interest. We conducted sensitivity analyses recoding these gaps as ACT months but found no significant differences in the results as reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078390313494170">
<title>Regional effects, demographics, and comorbidities</title>
<p>To control for the potential correlation of ACT services with other annual county-level characteristics, we controlled for the number of Medicaid enrollees per thousand people per county (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390313494170">North Carolina Division of Medical Assistance, 2003</xref>) and the number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychological associates per thousand per county (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313494170">Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we controlled for time-invariant demographic factors such as age on January 1, 2002, male gender, and race (mutually exclusive categorical variable of non-Hispanic Caucasian, non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic, other, and unknown, as coded in the Medicaid eligibility file); these measures are subsumed in the fixed effect regressions, described below. We also controlled for time varying characteristics, such as dual Medicare enrollment, specified low-income Medicare beneficiary program (SLMB/QMB), and Medicaid disability status.</p>
<p>We used an annual comorbidity index developed specifically for psychiatric research using administrative data to create eight mental health comorbidity indicators—drug abuse, alcohol abuse, bipolar and manic depressive disorders, psychoses, personality disorders, depression and schizoaffective disorders, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390313494170">Ricci, Dorfman, &amp; Martin, 2001</xref>). The sum of 37 medical comorbidity indicators was also included as a control variable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078390313494170">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We first examined binary associations between the main covariates and outcomes using <italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square statistics between ACT users and nonusers, ACT versus SMI, and ACT versus Potential ACT. We then used person-level fixed effects regression models with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors to look at the effect of ACT on the dependent variables described above, controlling for person-level factors that do not change over the study period. Two-part multivariate regression models were used to examine differences in the probability of using services and expenditures among users, and negative binomial regression models were used to examine differences in the number of visits. We generated predicted Medicaid expenditures for a representative individual: a disabled Medicaid enrollee with schizophrenia and no other comorbidities who lived in a county with 167, 0.15, 0.10, and 0.088 Medicaid eligibles, psychologists, psychological associates, and psychiatrists per thousand per county, respectively, in Quarter 12. We also reported marginal effects of ACT from the two-part models, reporting standard errors based on 100 bootstrap replications. We used nonlogged models on all outcomes based on the results of the Wooldridge test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078390313494170">Wooldridge, 1994</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1078390313494170">
<title>Moderator Analysis on Established Teams</title>
<p>In the moderator analysis, ACT team type (established or developmental) was interacted with the percent time on ACT during the quarter to obtain separate estimates of the effects of these two team types on service use.</p>
<p>We examined whether there were significant differences between the estimates of being on an established ACT team and being on a developmental ACT team.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078390313494170" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In bivariate comparisons, unadjusted mean expenditures of individuals on ACT ($40,672) were between those of the SMI group ($32,672) and the Potential ACT group ($57,094), as expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390313494170">Table 1</xref>). These same patterns of highest Medicaid expenditures and use in the potential ACT group and lowest expenditures in the SMI group were true for emergency visits and inpatient psychiatric care. ACT participants had significantly lower expenditures and visits for other outpatient health services, and for primary care in unadjusted comparisons than did individuals in either control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Rates of primary care use were also highest in the potential ACT group (71%) and lowest for those on ACT (50%).</p>

<p>Adjusting for covariates, we find no difference between ACT participants and either set of controls in the likelihood of receiving primary care services, other outpatient health services, and in the level of primary care expenditures among primary care users (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078390313494170">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078390313494170">3</xref>). ACT was associated with a decrease in the amount of other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT) among persons using outpatient services in the quarter, potentially indicating a decrease in the intensity of medical care use. Negative binomial models indicate that ACT reduced the number of other outpatient health visits in contrast to the SMI controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1078390313494170">Table 4</xref>), but this effect was not significant compared with the potential ACT controls.</p>

<p>ACT was associated with decreases in the likelihood of any ER visit in the quarter (2.0% point decrease; <italic>SE</italic> = 0.010; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in contrast with the potential ACT controls.

<p>Combining both parts of the reported models, the marginal effect of being on ACT for a full quarter was to increase an individual’s total Medicaid expenditures by $2,177 (bootstrapped standard error [bsse] = $93) over someone in the potential ACT group. Other marginal effects were as follows: primary care costs: −$2.30 (bsse = $2.45); other outpatient health care costs: −$111 (bsse = $24); emergency room costs: −$51 (bsse = $48); and inpatient psychiatric care costs: −$51 (bsse = $38). As noted, no differences were found between ACT and the control group for ER, primary care and inpatient psychiatric expenditures.</p>
<p>The analysis using the established team variables (not reported; available from the first author by request) found that the coefficients by team type were very similar to those presented in the tables. The direction and significance of the team-type variables were all similar, although magnitudes were different, except in two cases. First, the established team variables were not related to the likelihood of ER costs as they were in the aggregate models. Second, being on an established ACT team was not associated with a significant decrease in other outpatient health costs (β = −62; <italic>SE</italic> = 72; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) although being on an ACT team that was not established was (β = −265; <italic>SE</italic> = 52; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The <italic>t</italic> tests suggest that there are significant differences between those on established ACT teams and those on developmental ACT teams for the likelihood of any expenditures, total expenditures (including ACT), the likelihood of any other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT), amount of other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT), and the likelihood of any inpatient psychiatric care expenditures. Established teams had a greater likelihood of any expenditures but fewer total expenditures for those using services and a lower likelihood of any inpatient psychiatric use. Developmental teams had a lower likelihood of any other outpatient health expenditures and lower expenditures for those accessing other outpatient care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings suggest that ACT is associated with increased Medicaid expenditures due mostly to the costs of monthly ACT enrollment, but ACT did not specifically affect the use of primary care. Despite the fact that only 50% of ACT recipients received any primary care visits during the 3-year study period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390313494170">Table 1</xref>), no notable improvements in use were found to be correlated with ACT receipt. Although ACT teams may substitute for certain primary care activities, such as responding to new medical symptoms, teams may also have the potential to increase referral opportunities and increase participants’ compliance with vaccinations, vision screening, and other primary care services. In our sample, these two pathways may have balanced each other out, yielding no net change in the use of primary care.</p>
<p>We did find that receipt of ACT decreased other outpatient Medicaid expenditures excluding ACT; this effect was larger in developmental teams. Reductions were seen in the number of other outpatient health visits and expenditures among those already accessing other outpatient services, which likely indicates a reduction in intensity of use rather than a reduction in access. This finding suggests that ACT teams may provide sufficient attention to outpatient health needs because ACT providers sufficiently address general health as well as other needs; however, more research would be necessary to verify this speculation. Thus, there may be a range of other outpatient services, especially specialty mental health services, for which ACT is a natural substitute, consistent with these findings.</p>
<p>ACT also decreased the likelihood of emergency room use as well as the number of emergency room visits, in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313494170">Latimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390313494170">Quinlivan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390313494170">Stein &amp; Test, 1980</xref>). Finally, ACT had the expected effect on hospital use—it reduced the likelihood of inpatient psychiatric stays. Reduction of inpatient psychiatric care is one of the most consistent findings in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313494170">Bond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313494170">Burns &amp; Santos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313494170">Latimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390313494170">Marshall &amp; Lockwood, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, ACT was associated with increases in total expenditures of $2,177 per quarter. The payments for ACT consumers during the study period started out in the beginning of 2000 at $590/per person/per month and increased every few months until it reached $828 at the end of the study period. This suggests that, even at the most expensive point, ACT cost $2,484 per quarter per person. In this context, even if the costs are as high as $2,177 per quarter more for ACT (the highest estimate we found in our data), the increase in expenditure appears entirely due to ACT expenditures, with little offset observed in total spending. These higher expenses could also be an indication that previously underserved consumers (i.e., those with unmet health needs) were receiving more appropriate levels of care as a result of ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390313494170">Salsberry, Chipps, &amp; Kennedy, 2005</xref>), although increases in outpatient care were not observed in our sample. As noted, persons with severe mental illness often have higher rates of chronic conditions and poorer physical health than those in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313494170">Chwastiak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313494170">Cuddeback et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313494170">Joukamma et al., 2006</xref>). In our study, this was highlighted by the fact that the number of comorbidities was associated with a greater likelihood of all services analyzed here and increased expenditures for those receiving any services (except when the ACT group was compared with the SMI group for other outpatient health expenditures).</p>
<p>Being on an established ACT team was found to decrease total Medicaid expenditures among those using services in a quarter and lower the likelihood of any inpatient psychiatric care when compared with developmental teams. This may suggest that more established teams may be saving the state money, while also promoting better outcomes than teams still under development.</p>
<p>A number of limitations should be noted. Team fidelity was not observable in our Medicaid claims data, precluding us from determining the extent to which the teams were faithful to ACT principles. Although we tried to hone in on fidelity levels through the use of the established/developmental team variable via the ACT team survey, the survey was conducted in 2003, 1 year after our study period, and it was a point-in-time estimate that did not allow us to look at variations within teams over time. Furthermore, Medicaid claims do not permit the detection of inpatient use in state psychiatric hospitals for those aged 22 to 64 years because of the IMD restriction on Medicaid payments; the magnitude of the loss of these data is unknown. We do not determine the adequacy of primary care receipt in our sample, since this likely depends not only on the presence of mental illness but also as a complex function of physical comorbidities. In addition, we were not able to observe individual contacts between ACT teams and consumers, since the payments are made on a capitated basis regardless of use. As is true of most effectiveness studies in specific contexts, external validity beyond North Carolina may be limited. However, North Carolina is one of the larger Medicaid programs and has a diverse population, which may increase the generalizability of these results. In addition, the use of diagnosis only is a limitation common to most claims data studies; and we did not separately examine the influence of ACT on services such as dental and vision care. It should be noted that our sample has a paucity of incident ACT users, so the estimates here are largely for prevalent or ongoing services users.</p>
<p>Given recent and expansive efforts to better integrate primary and behavioral health care, ACT has the potential to be the vehicle with which persons with severe mental illness access care for their physical health needs. The evidence base for ACT is well established; however, additional ACT studies are now needed to address the effectiveness of the model toward improving physical health outcomes. Future research should also examine more specific primary care activities, such as vision screening, vaccinations, or referrals for age- and gender-appropriate cancer screening. In addition, the association between specific types of staffing, such as nursing hours, and primary care receipt could help determine the optimal configuration of team staffing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study examined whether investments in ACT resulted in savings for other outpatient health services and primary and care. Consistent with prior literature, ACT decreased the likelihood of emergency room visits and inpatient psychiatric stays. To our knowledge, this may be the first article to show that ACT was associated with a decrease in other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT) through a reduction in intensity of service use but that ACT had no effect on primary care use. Given the increasing emphasis and efforts toward integrating physical health and behavioral health care, it is likely that ACT will continue to be challenged to meet the physical health needs of its consumers, especially consumers who do not visit routine outpatient primary care settings. This may mean a departure from traditional staffing patterns (e.g., the addition of a primary care doctor and nurse) and expansion of the direct services ACT provides to incorporate physical health treatments. Future research will be important toward establishing the effectiveness of ACT on improving physical health outcomes and the staffing and service structure needed to achieve these outcomes.</p>
