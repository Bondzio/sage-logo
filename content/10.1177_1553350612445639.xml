<abstract>
<p>Surgery to the trunk often results in a change of gait, most pronounced during walking. This change is usually transient, often as a result of wound pain, and returns to normal as the patient recovers. Quantifying and monitoring gait impairment therefore represents a novel means of functional postoperative home recovery follow-up. Until now, this type of assessment could only be made in a gait lab, which is both expensive and labor intensive to administer on a large scale. The objective of this work is to validate the use of an ear-worn activity recognition (e-AR) sensor for quantification of gait impairment after abdominal wall and perianal surgery. The e-AR sensor was used on 2 comparative simulated data sets (N = 32) of truncal impairment to observe walking patterns. The sensor was also used to observe the walking patterns of preoperative and postoperative surgical patients who had undergone abdominal wall (n = 5) and perianal surgery (n = 5). Methods for multiresolution feature extraction, selection, and classification are investigated using the raw ear-sensor data. Results show that the method demonstrates a good separation between impaired and nonimpaired classes for both simulated and real patient data sets. This indicates that the e-AR sensor may be used as a tool for the pervasive assessment of postoperative gait impairment, as part of functional recovery monitoring, in patients at their own homes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A patient’s ability to mobilize normally after surgery is a key part of functional recovery, with changes in gait over time providing an important indication of postoperative recovery. Following abdominal surgery, patients are particularly prone to limitations in truncal and limb mobility. Truncal mobility impairment occurs directly as a result of abdominal surgery and involves increased abdominal rigidity, secondary to muscle spasm and pain, occurring directly as a result of skin, soft tissue, and muscle-splitting wounds that are made during abdominal incisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612445639">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612445639">2</xref></sup> The increase in abdominal wall rigidity resulting from such incisions leads to reduced chest expansion, because of limited diaphragmatic movement, and reduced speed and agility of movement, because of pain, affecting common activities of daily living such as walking and standing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612445639">3</xref></sup> Impaired locomotion due to limb mobility impairment can occur either directly, as a result of abdominal wound pain being exacerbated by movement of the legs, or due to swelling and stiffness of the limb from complications such as a deep vein thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612445639">4</xref></sup> In the case of deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the legs following the period of immobilization that surrounds surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Both truncal and limb mobility impairment can result in an abnormal patient gait, which during the course of a hospital admission can at best be observed and subjectively monitored. This impairment may include lateral trunk bending (which normally reduces the force required by abductors of the hip), anterior trunk bending (putting more pressure on extensors of the knee), posterior trunk bending (putting more force on hip extensors), inefficient push-off, or abnormal walking base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612445639">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of systems have been developed to study human gait irregularities, particularly in the laboratory setting. Most of these systems rely on video image sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612445639">6</xref></sup> or optical motion tracking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612445639">7</xref></sup> These features permit quantitative analysis of gait characteristics such as joint moments and powers, joint angles, angular velocities, and angular accelerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612445639">8</xref></sup> Parametric models have been used extensively to describe a set of image observations. An example is the 3-D modeling of moving people, which can be achieved by using volumetric bodies based on elliptical cylinders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612445639">9</xref></sup> or tapered super quadrics. Alternatively, 2-D models that represent the projection of 3-D data to an imaging plane can be used (2D/3D contour modeling, for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612445639">10</xref></sup>). In general, methods that consider the use of kinematic constraints can handle more complex motions and occlusions. These constraints are used to improve tracking as well as preventing model violations of the derived 3-D structures.</p>
<p>Wireless body-worn sensors provide an alternative to vision-based systems that can be used to observe patients in their own environment. Accelerometers are widely used in body sensor networks because of their small size as well as the ease of integrating them with existing wireless devices. Several systems using accelerometry have been proposed for gait observation, as summarized in the survey by Kavanagh and Menz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612445639">11</xref></sup> Several positions have been investigated for gait analysis using sensors, including the lower lumbar spine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612445639">12</xref></sup> shoe-based sensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612445639">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612445639"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612445639">15</xref></sup> the head,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612445639">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612445639">17</xref></sup> and a combination of body positions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612445639">18</xref></sup> Despite being a relatively stable part of the body during motion, the head moves proportionately more with increasing activity (eg, climbing stairs vs walking on a flat level),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612445639">19</xref></sup> which is important to consider when evaluating gait. It does, however, move less than the limbs because of the stabilizing effect conferred by the trunk and neck, making it an attractive site for sensor placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612445639">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612445639">21</xref></sup> The trunk plays a critical role in maintaining head stability by regulating gait-related oscillations in all directions, and the neck confers additional control, thereby enhancing head stability during walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612445639">16</xref></sup> Accelerometers may be used to measure initial contact, which defines the beginning of a complete gait cycle and thus cycle duration/frequency, and terminal contact, which marks the start of the swing phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612445639">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612445639"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612445639">24</xref></sup> They may also be used to observe frequency peaks in the anterior plane to detect leg injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612445639">25</xref></sup> We present a novel approach to gait impairment detection where gait features (such as timing information) are not measured directly but through a discriminative approach. By modeling a normal class and observing how different people are from this class, we aim to address the issue of modeling time–frequency features extending to more than one direction of motion, which are normally not picked up by simple gait features.</p>
<p>We have previously presented the use of the sensor for overall activity detection and classification for postoperative patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612445639">26</xref></sup> and have addressed simulated gait changes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612445639">17</xref></sup> but to date we have not looked into the effects of abdominal surgery on patient gait. This pilot study presents 2 comparative laboratory-based data sets of normal versus impaired mobility that were acquired to establish the sensitivity of our gait impairment detection techniques, which were then validated on patients who had undergone perianal surgery and abdominal wall surgery.</p>

<title>The Ear-Worn Activity Recognition Sensor</title>
<p>The ear-worn activity recognition (e-AR) sensor, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612445639">Figure 1</xref>, is a device that can be worn on the outer ear cartilage and contains a 3-axis MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems) accelerometer (ADXL330, Analog Devices Inc, Norwood, MA) that captures the mobility and activity information of the subject. This information is wirelessly transmitted to a receiver connected to a laptop/tablet computer in real-time. The ADXL330 accelerometer measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of ±3<italic>g</italic>. Analog-to-digital conversion of these data results in <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> axis accelerometer channel outputs ranging from 0 to 4096, representing 0 to 3 V. A sampling rate of 50 Hz was used in all experiments conducted in this study. For long-term monitoring, a light-weight version (5.6 × 3.5 × 1.0 cm, 7.4 g) of the e-AR sensor has been developed (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612445639">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants and Settings</title>
<p>As a first step of this study, 2 comparative data sets of normal versus impaired mobility were acquired for this study. In the first data set, lower limb mobility was impaired through simulation using a knee brace system. Ten healthy subjects were asked to wear the e-AR sensor on the right ear then walk on a treadmill at 2.5 km/h for 3 minutes. This was done without any braces, with mild lower limb impairment (Tubigrip), and with moderate lower limb impairment (Ligament Knee Brace, McDavid Woodridge, IL), shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612445639">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>

<p>In the second data set, truncal mobility was impaired using an abdominal brace system (Air Back Spinal Support System, Orthomerica, Newport Beach, CA), shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612445639">Figure 2B</xref>, as well as thigh straps to reduce mobility. A total of 22 normal volunteers were asked to perform the following activities both with and without the abdominal brace system and the straps while wearing the e-AR sensor:</p>

<p>In addition to the simulated data set, a third data set comprised patients whose demographics and operative procedures are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612445639">Table 1</xref>. The procedures included perianal surgery (for hemorrhoids, fistulas, and fissures) and abdominal wall hernia surgery groups. All patients underwent uncomplicated procedures and were discharged the same day as their operation. Preoperative and postoperative walking data in a corridor were successfully collected from all 10 patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612445639">Figure 3</xref> shows an example of 3-D accelerometer data obtained from a healthy subject walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612445639">Figure 3A</xref>), with simulated lower limb impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612445639">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Modeling Approach</title>
<p>Modeling consists of developing techniques to process 3-D accelerometer sensor data obtained by the ear sensor to derive parameters or <italic>features</italic> that could be indicative of gait change. The techniques used in this work consist of independent component analysis (ICA), feature selection, and classification. These are further explained in the next few sections.</p>
<sec id="section6-1553350612445639">
<title>Independent component analysis</title>
<p>Independent component analysis is a technique that is used to decompose complex data, such as that received through each of the 3-axis accelerometer signals from the e-AR sensor, into its underlying component parts. It is a means of performing blind-source separation and determines the source or original signal without making assumptions about the mixture. As a result, only the desired signals are extracted. In this work, ICA was implemented as suggested by Bell and Sejnowski.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612445639">28</xref></sup> As each one of the <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> axis signals from the accelerometer contained some information about the underlying motion, using ICA enabled the analysis of the resulting source signals that summarize the underlying motion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350612445639">
<title>Multiresolution wavelet analysis</title>
<p>The wavelet transform allows the observation of the multiresolution properties of the acceleration signals across both time and frequency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350612445639">29</xref></sup> by using a fully scalable modulated window that is shifted along the signal and for every position the spectrum is calculated. The process is repeated a number of times with a window for every new cycle, resulting in a collection of time–frequency representations of the signal, all with different resolutions. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was used in this study as it can provide a compact representation of a signal in time and frequency that can be computed efficiently. DWT analysis can be performed using a fast, pyramidal algorithm related to multirate filter banks. The features extracted from the DWT coefficients are means and standard deviations over time windows of size 5 seconds and over 4 scales. This leads to 24 features per point in time as 8 features are derived for each accelerometer channel. Different window sizes could be used, but we have chosen a 5-second window to empirically obtain features that could reflect a person’s walking pattern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1553350612445639">
<title>Feature selection</title>
<p>Because of the fact that a large feature space was generated from the DWT, supervised feature selection was used to select the most useful features in terms of separating impaired from nonimpaired data. In this work, we compared 3 algorithms for feature selection, namely, Relief, Simba (iterative search margin based algorithm),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612445639">27</xref></sup> and mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350612445639">30</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1553350612445639">
<title>Classification</title>
<p>Classification techniques used in this work include K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM). N-fold cross-validation was used to observe rates of correct classification. Data were divided into N subsets, where one of them was used for testing and the others for training. The process was repeated for testing each of the N subsets.</p>
<p>KNN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612445639">31</xref></sup> a supervised learning algorithm, is a simple classifier that can deal with nonlinear class boundaries and was used to separate classes of normal versus impaired mobility in this work. KNN uses the similarity to K neighbors to classify a new data point. K can be varied to include more data points (large K values) or allow for more accurate boundaries (small K values). We found values of K = 10 to provide the best separation experimentally in this work.</p>
<p>Support vector machines (SVM) are a supervised learning algorithm that aims to construct a hyperplane in high dimensional space by learning from samples in order to classify new data points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350612445639">32</xref></sup> Generally, good separation is achieved by hyperplanes that have the largest distance to the nearest training data points (also known as the margin). SVMs deployed in this work use RBFs (radial basis functions) to construct margins.</p>

<title>Lower Limb Mobility Impairment</title>
<p>Although 3 classes of data were collected, namely, normal walking, walking with mild lower limb involvement (tubigrip), and walking with moderate lower limb impairment (knee brace), the mild lower limb impairment class seemed to completely merge with the normal walking class. The main reason for this was that the leg-tubing did not alter the subjects’ gait sufficiently when walking, and as a result most subjects walked normally even when wearing it. As a result, for the purposes of this study, the 2 groups were combined and compared with the moderate lower limb impairment group. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350612445639">Figure 4</xref> show the 5-fold classification rates between impaired and nonimpaired walking with and without the use of ICA. Optimal results were attained by using 12 features obtained from the accelerometer data. Although the KNN algorithm provided better results for a low number of features, SVM provided better rates with &gt;97% correct classification (using ICA) when the number of features was increased to more than 10. In general, classification rates were &gt;95% regardless of technique used, indicating a very good separation between impaired and nonimpaired walking for all subjects combined.</p>

<p>The KNN classifier with inclusion of ICA as a preprocessing step increased the correct classification rate from 73% to 99% for the 1.5 km/h speed, 85% to 100% for the 3.5 km/h speed, 88% to 100% for the 3.5 km/h with slope, 84% to 100% for corridor walking, and 80% to 99% for stairs, an improvement of at least 10% for all cases considered. The SVM classification method provided similar classification rates. The use of the 3-feature selection methods provided close classification accuracy results. Even with a variation in speed, sway, and gait cycle relating to subject-specific gait patterns, especially in corridor and stair walking, the method was able to distinguish impaired from nonimpaired walking for all subjects combined.</p>

<title>Real Patient Data</title>
<p>The results from patients before and after abdominal wall and perianal surgery are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1553350612445639">Table 3</xref>. Using 5-fold cross-validation, for the 2 groups (each containing 5 patients), all patient data (per group) were combined, as the aim was to classify impaired from nonimpaired walking regardless of patient-specific walking patterns. Results showed good separation between the preoperative and postoperative patient groups: 100% for the hernia patients and 98.75% for perianal patients. Interestingly for this data set, the inclusion of ICA as a preprocessing step did not improve correct classification rates. A possible explanation is that patient walking patterns could have been quite different in terms of speed and motion, meaning that ICA could not find underlying commonalities as it did for the cohort of lab participants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article demonstrated a method for multiresolution gait analysis using an ear-worn sensor. Instead of defining prefixed parameters that could distinguish impaired from normal mobility, automatic feature selection methods were explored, with DWT used for feature extraction and methods of classification compared. Models of truncal and limb mobility impairment were tested, both of which have relevance to patients who have undergone abdominal surgery and are recovering at home. The method was also used to observe a group of patients who had abdominal wall surgery (n = 5) and perianal surgery (n = 5). The results of this study demonstrate good separation between impaired and nonimpaired classes, suggesting that the features obtained could be used to observe postoperative improvements in a patient’s mobility following truncal surgery.</p>
<p>As the effect of surgery decreases, changes in walking patterns may occur over time, with a patient’s class approaching that of normal walking. If a cluster was used to model healthy subjects, the “distance to the normal cluster” measure may directly correlate with measures of functional postoperative recovery. Plotting this parameter over time may provide a means of objective functional recovery measurement in the form of a “recovery curve.” Such objective measures may be used not only to monitor an individual’s recovery but also to directly measure the impact of one intervention compared with the other—an example is minimally invasive versus open surgery.</p>
<p>It is important to mention several limitations of this study. First, the number of subjects included was limited to 32 healthy subjects with simulated impairment and 10 patients who have undergone surgical procedures. Larger scale studies are required to investigate the possibility of detection of gait impairment over specific patient populations. A time-based observation of features extracted from the ear sensor versus objective measures of patient improvement over time would also be required to validate the sensor for use in impairment detection. Second, only activities involving walking were assessed in this work. The study of other activities that could reveal gait and balance changes after surgery, such as lying down and getting up, would also be of interest. Combining walking gait indicators with behavioral patterns that can also be obtained by the e-AR sensor would provide a better overall picture of improvement over time. Adapting these results to incorporate patient-specific walking patterns would also provide a more personalized measure of gait improvement. Finally, the gait impairment techniques used in this study were evaluated retrospectively. The e-AR sensor has the ability to undertake these data processing in real-time, thereby measuring the mobility impairment on the device itself before transmitting it wirelessly for clinical review. This will be the focus of future research and key to the use of this technology in real-time by clinical staff.</p>
<p>Compared with recently published work investigating accelerometers for gait analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350612445639">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350612445639">34</xref></sup> the e-AR sensor presents a much lighter sensor (7.4 g) with an additional advantage of its stability behind the ear, which could enhance patient compliance in the long run. Although a detailed analysis of gait features was not the subject of this study, the finding that this type of information could be extracted from the e-AR sensor suggests an application for this technology in areas such as sports medicine, neurology, orthopedics, and physiotherapy, where continuous and pervasive gait analysis may be of great benefit in monitoring disease processes, providing objective measures of recovery, and ultimately measuring the impact of an intervention on final outcome. The e-AR sensor is now marketed commercially by Sensixa, a spin-off company from Imperial College London.</p>
