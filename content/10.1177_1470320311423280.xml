<abstract>
<p>The prorenin receptor [(P)RR] is upregulated in the diabetic kidney and has been implicated in the high glucose (HG)-induced overproduction of profibrotic molecules by mesangial cells (MCs), which is mediated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The regulation of (P)RR gene transcription and the mechanisms by which HG increases (P)RR gene expression are not fully understood. Because intracellular levels of angiotensin II (AngII) are increased in MCs stimulated with HG, we used this in vitro system to evaluate the possible role of AngII in (P)RR gene expression and function by comparing the effects of AT1 receptor blockers (losartan or candesartan) and (P)RR mRNA silencing (siRNA) in human MCs (HMCs) stimulated with HG. HG induced an increase in (P)RR and fibronectin expression and in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These effects were completely reversed by (P)RR siRNA and losartan but not by candesartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker that, in contrast to losartan, blocks AT1 receptor internalization). These results suggest that (P)RR gene activity may be controlled by intracellular AngII and that HG-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and fibronectin overproduction are primarily induced by (P)RR activation. This relationship between AngII and (P)RR may constitute an additional pathway of MC dysfunction in response to HG stimulation.</p>

<p>Diabetic nephropathy is a condition characterized by intrarenal activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), and high intracellular levels of AngII have been observed in mesangial cells (MCs) exposed to a high-glucose environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423280">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311423280">8</xref></sup> In addition, (P)RR expression is increased in the kidneys of diabetic animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311423280">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311423280">10</xref></sup> and in MCs stimulated with high concentrations of glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423280">11</xref></sup> However, the mechanisms by which a high-glucose environment interferes with (P)RR gene activity are not well understood. Because high glucose is a stimulus that results in increased Ang II levels and in upregulation of (P)RR, we used this condition to evaluate whether high levels of intracellular AngII interfere with (P)RR gene expression and to determine the contribution of each molecule to the overlapping effects of (P)RR and AngII, such as the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and fibronectin production. For this purpose, cultured human MCs were stimulated with a high concentration of glucose. The angiotensin-dependent effects were evaluated using AT1 receptor blocking by losartan, which blocks the intracellular AT1 receptors, or candesartan, which inhibits AT1 receptor internalization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423280">12</xref></sup> and the AngII-independent (P)RR effects were estimated using (P)RR mRNA silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA).</p>

<title>Mesangial cell culture</title>
<p>Immortalized human mesangial cells (HMCs) were provided by Dr Bernhard Banas (Nephrology Center, University of Munich, Germany). The cells were grown at 37°C in plastic flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (50 U/ml) and 2.6 g HEPES. The culture flasks were kept in a 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified environment at 37°C. At semi-confluence, the cells were exposed to a culture medium with no FBS for 24 h according to the following experimental groups: the control group (NG), which was cultured in DMEM containing a standard concentration of 10 mM D-glucose for 24 h; the high-glucose group (HG), which was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20 mM D-glucose (MERK SA Chemical Industries, Brazil); and the osmolarity control (mannitol) group, which was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20 mM mannitol for 24 h. The effect of blocking the AngII receptor AT1 was evaluated by adding 100 nM losartan (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) to the DMEM containing 10 mM or 30 mM glucose (NG+Los and HG+Los groups, respectively).</p>

<title>(P)RR silencing mRNA</title>
<p>(P)RR mRNA silencing was achieved using small interference RNA (siRNA) from the Stealth™ siRNA kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The siRNA sequences against (P)RR mRNA were designed and synthesized by Invitrogen (the sense strand was ccaaggaucauucuccugauuuaua, and the antisense strand was uauaaaucaggagaaugauccuugg). The HMCs were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 containing the siRNA oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Scrambled, non-targeting siRNAs were used as a negative control, and the β-actin sequence was used as a positive control. After confirming the efficiency of the siRNA (P)RR silencing, the cells were cultured in concentrations of 10 mM or 30 mM glucose for 24 h.</p>

<sec id="section5-1470320311423280">
<title>Real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>The mRNA expression levels of (P)RR, fibronectin, ERK2 and β-actin were estimated using the quantitative real-time RT-PCR technique. The total RNA was purified from the HMCs by the phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method using an appropriate kit (Trizol, Gibco BRL, Rockland, MD, USA), and the total RNA from the siRNA-transfected cells was isolated using the Illustra RNAspin Mini RNA Isolation Kit (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A volume of 2 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase (RQ1 RNase-free DNase, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to avoid genomic DNA contamination. The RNA pellet was resuspended in RNase-free water and was reverse transcribed into cDNA by the addition of a mixture containing 0.5 mg/ml of oligo-d(T), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and 200 U of the reverse transcriptase enzyme (SuperScript RT; Gibco BRL Rockland, MD, USA). The real-time PCR amplification was performed using the GeneAmp 5700 and ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA), using specific primers for each molecule as follows (forward and reverse, respectively): (P)RR, 5’ ggaagcgttatggggaagac 3’ and 5’ tcgcttgttttgcctcaagg 3’; fibronectin, 5’ tggtgacagttggtgccctg 3’ and 5’ tgtttggacacagccacagg 3’; ERK2, 5’ tcgagcaccaaccatcgagc 3’ and 5’ aaggcttgaggtcacggtgc 3’; and β-actin, 5’ cctctatgccaacacagtgc 3’ and 5’ acatctgctggaaggtggac 3’. The amplified products were monitored using the SYBR Green I intercalating dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), which exhibits higher fluorescence upon the binding of double-stranded DNA. The fluorescence for each cycle was quantitatively analyzed using the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). At the end of each PCR run, a melting curve was produced by increasing the temperature from 60°C to 95°C at a rate of 2°C/min, and the fluorescence was measured every 15 s. This technique provided verification of the presence of a single amplification product. The relative gene expression was calculated using the early PCR stage conditions, under which the amplification curve is logarithmic. The mRNA expression levels were normalized by β-actin, and the results were expressed as arbitrary units with the NG cells as the reference sample.</p>

<title>Protein expression</title>
<p>The protein expression levels were estimated by western blotting. The cells were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF and 44 mM o-phenanthroline (all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at -80°C until use. The protein concentration was determined by the Folin method (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). A volume of 50 μg of protein was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 4°C using a transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol. Non-specific binding was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in a pH 7.5 TBS buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 200 mM NaCl followed by washing in a TBS buffer at room temperature. The immunoblots were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary polyclonal antibodies: anti-human (P)RR (AsieSuisse Laboratories, Reno, NV, USA); anti-phosphorylated ERK against the threonine and tyrosine residues on ERK2 and anti-non-phosphorylated ERK against the same residues on ERK2 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA); anti-β-actin (Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK); and anti-fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). The membranes were rinsed with TBS-T (pH 7.5 Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) and then incubated at 4°C for 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). The specific protein bands were visualized using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), and the signal was recorded on Hyperfilm ECL X-ray film (Amersham Hyperfilm ECL; GE Healthcare Ltd, Japan). The optimally exposed films were digitally scanned and analyzed using an Imaging Densitometer (GS670, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and the Quantity One-GS710 software (Bio-Rad).</p>

<title>Determination of the AngII levels by ELISA</title>
<p>The AngII levels in the cell extracts and culture media were determined. The confluent cells were washed twice with cold PBS followed by the addition of 0.4 ml of the extraction buffer containing 20 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 µg/ml PMSF and 0.1 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were scraped in the extraction buffer and were centrifuged for 3–5 min in a microfuge to obtain the insoluble pellet fraction. The supernatants were used for the AngII measurements and for the protein content determination by the Folin method (Bio-Rad). The levels of AngII were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit that included avidin–streptavidin (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA, USA). The samples and standards were incubated with the anti-AngII antibody and biotinylated angiotensin II (B-AngII) in 96-well plates coated with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Protein A. After incubation, the unbound B-AngII was removed by washing, and the amount of bound B-AngII was determined by the streptavidin–HRP reaction using TMB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as substrates. The reaction was terminated with 2 N HCl, and the color intensity in each well was read at 450 nm using an ELISA microtiter plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA USA). The amount of AngII in each well was calculated from the standard curve and expressed per milligrams of cell protein.</p>

<title>(P)RR and AngII receptor distribution by immunofluorescence</title>
<p>All the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA, except as indicated. The cells were grown on LabTec® coverslips in a standard culture medium and were fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with PBS then treated with PBS containing 100 mM glycine (BioAgency Biotecnologia Ltda., São Paulo, SP, Brazil) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min then incubated overnight with primary antibodies against (P)RR (AsieSuisse Laboratories, Reno, NV, USA); AT1 or AT2 receptors (Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK). The antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% BSA at 4°C. The primary antibody was then washed out, and the cells were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 5% BSA) conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) for 1 h at room temperature (in a dark room) and then rinsed with PBS containing 0.5% BSA. To stain the nuclei, DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 5% BSA was added, and the cells were incubated for 15 min. The reagents were washed out, and the coverslips and slides were mounted with pH 9.0 glycerin/500 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 500 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (MERK SA Chemical Industries, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) containing 1% p-phenylenediamine to minimize quenching. The images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany) and were digitalized using a computer program (LSMImage Browser, Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany).</p>

<p>To evaluate the specific effects of (P)RR upregulation induced by HG, we transfected the HMCs with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against (P)RR. The mRNA silencing did not change the cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311423280">Figure 2A</xref>) and resulted in an ~80% inhibition of (P)RR mRNA expression in the control (NG) cells and in undetectable levels of the (P)RR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311423280">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311423280">2C</xref>). The biological effects of (P)RR stimulation and AngII were distinguished by comparing the results obtained with siRNA and losartan. The overexpression of fibronectin induced by HG was completely reversed by both the siRNA and losartan, with the siRNA strategy being more effective than the AT1 receptor blocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">Figure 3</xref>). HG did not significantly change the ERK1/2 mRNA or protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">3D</xref>), but it induced a significant rise in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in an increased p-ERK/ERK ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423280">3F</xref>).

<p>Because losartan suppressed (P)RR expression, we decided to determine whether exogenous AngII interferes with (P)RR gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated the NG-cultured MCs with 100 nM of AngII for 30 min or 24 h. Surprisingly, the addition of AngII to the culture medium did not change the (P)RR mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470320311423280">Figure 5A</xref>) in spite of the ability of this molecule to induce fibronectin expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470320311423280">Figure 5B</xref>. This result indicates that the cells were responsive to AngII. To determine whether this effect was due to intracellular AngII, we compared the effects of losartan with those of candesartan, which is an AT1 receptor blocker that inhibits AT1 internalization. The basal (P)RR expression detected in the MCs under standard glucose concentrations (in the NG group) was reduced by losartan but not by candesartan, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470320311423280">Figure 5C</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MC activation plays a central role in the glomerular sclerosis induced by diabetes. Intrarenal activation of the RAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311423280">13</xref></sup> and TGFβ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311423280">14</xref></sup> is the main mechanism of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Recent evidence suggests that (P)RR may play a key role in MC TGFβ1 production via an AngII-independent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311423280">5</xref></sup> involving the activation of the ERK1/2 protein kinases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311423280">15</xref></sup> In the present study, we confirmed previous results indicating that MCs exposed to a high-glucose environment exhibit increased local production of AngII,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423280">7</xref></sup> upregulated (P)RR expression, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423280">11</xref></sup> and increased fibronectin production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311423280">16</xref></sup> We also showed that the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and fibronectin overproduction induced by high glucose were decreased by both losartan and (P)RR siRNA, which distinguished between the (P)RR effects that are dependent on and those that are independent of AngII. In contrast to losartan, however, (P)RR siRNA also significantly reduced ERK mRNA and protein levels, resulting in undetectable levels of the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 in most of the samples treated with (P)RR siRNA. This result suggests that (P)RR plays a pivotal role in controlling both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ERK gene activity.</p>
<p>It is well established that (P)RR stimulation by renin and (pro)renin increases AngII formation on the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423280">17</xref></sup> However, we found that in spite of the upregulation of (P)RR, HG stimulation did not modify the AngII levels in the culture medium, suggesting that the synthesis of AngII on the cell surface may be not relevant in this in vitro model. Indeed, intracellular AngII was significantly elevated in the cells stimulated with a high concentration of glucose, a phenomenon that has been consistently shown in many cell types, including MCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423280">7</xref></sup> cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311423280">18</xref></sup> and fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311423280">19</xref></sup> The rise in intracellular AngII could be due to uptake from the extracellular space by internalization via AT1 receptor binding. However, the increased intracellular AngII induced by high glucose has also been attributed to intracellular synthesis due to an upregulation of the components of the RAS pathway rather than to an uptake of extracellular AngII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423280">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311423280">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311423280">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consistent with other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423280">20</xref></sup> our analysis of the distribution of cellular (P)RR showed a predominant localization in the cytoplasm, mainly in the perinuclear region. This result suggested that (P)RR has intracellular activity, including increasing AngII levels in HMCs stimulated by high glucose. Indeed, it has recently been shown that (P)RR mRNA silencing significantly attenuates AngII synthesis in HG-stimulated rat MCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423280">11</xref></sup> Correspondingly, we have previously demonstrated the presence of both the active and inactive forms of renin in rat and mouse MCs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423280">21</xref></sup> and a high-glucose environment causes a rise in the intracellular levels of both renin and prorenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423280">7</xref></sup> In the present study, moreover, we observed increased expression of the (pro)renin protein in the cell lysate. Collectively, these data allow us to suggest that under high-glucose stimulation, (P)RR can be intracellularly activated by binding to renin and prorenin, which contributes to both increased AngII synthesis and increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that losartan was as efficient as siRNA at suppressing (P)RR mRNA levels in both the NG and HG groups, suggesting that (P)RR gene activity may be strongly influenced by AngII through AT1 activation. To further investigate this possibility, we stimulated the cells with AngII, but it failed to induce (P)RR overexpression. This result suggests that the suppression effect observed with losartan may have been triggered by an intracellular pathway. In addition to the cell membrane, it has become clear that the AT1 receptor can also localize and bind AngII inside cells. In fact, we detected the AT1 receptor in the cytoplasm and in the nuclear membrane of the HMCs. In addition, it has been demonstrated that losartan can be delivered to internal cell compartments and block intracellular AT1 receptors by internalization of the AT1R–ligand complex or by crossing the cytoplasmic membrane by means of its hydrophobic character.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423280">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311423280">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320311423280">23</xref></sup> Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that losartan is able to block the intracellular interaction between AngII and the AT1 receptor. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of losartan with those of candesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker that, upon binding to the cell-surface AT1 receptors, inhibits receptor/ligand internalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423280">12</xref></sup> We found that the (P)RR expression levels were strongly reduced by losartan but not by candesartan, which is consistent with the hypothesis that AngII binding to intracellular AT1 receptors regulates (P)RR gene transcription. The influence of AngII on (P)RR gene transcription was recently demonstrated in vivo by Siragy and Huang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311423280">9</xref></sup> These authors showed that blocking the AT1 receptor with valsartan prevents increases in (P)RR mRNA and protein in the kidneys of diabetic rats.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that (P)RR gene transcription may be regulated by AngII in MCs. The impact of the AngII positive feedback mechanism on (P)RR expression requires further investigation, but we can consider some possible explanations for the suppressive effects of losartan on (P)RR. First, blocking the AT1 receptor reduces the oxidative stress and NF-κB stimulation induced by high glucose because both of these effects are known to increase (P)RR expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320311423280">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320311423280">25</xref></sup> Second, it has previously been demonstrated that renin suppresses (P)RR expression through the PLZF pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423280">20</xref></sup> Because RAS inhibitors cause a rise in renin and prorenin levels, it is possible that the increased production of renin during the AT1 receptor blockade downregulates (P)RR expression. These interactions would reduce the overstimulation of the (pro)renin receptor under RAS inhibition.</p>
<p>In summary, the results obtained in this present paper confirm that (P)RR is predominantly found in the cytoplasm of MCs in culture and that its expression is upregulated under high-glucose stimulation. In addition, we showed that this effect was completely reversed by losartan but not by candesartan, suggesting that intracellular AngII may regulate (P)RR gene expression via the AT1 receptor. Reducing the (P)RR expression by losartan and (P)RR siRNA reversed the increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and fibronectin synthesis induced by glucose. However, only the (P)RR siRNA suppressed ERK 1/2 gene transcription, suggesting that in addition to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, (P)RR also regulates ERK1/2 levels. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop between AngII and (P)RR.</p>
