<abstract>
<p>Background. Intervention fidelity is an increasingly important methodological concept in process evaluations. In this article, the authors investigated the intervention fidelity in a randomized controlled trial on excessive weight gain prevention in pregnancy. Method. A sample of 109 audiotaped counseling sessions, linked to 65 women in the intervention group of the New Life(style) trial, was drawn. The following criteria were quantitatively evaluated using a fidelity checklist: (a) reach, (b) dose, (c) adherence to study objectives, (d) adherence to underlying problem-solving treatment (PST) theory, and (e) counselor competence. Results. A total of 60.4% received all counseling sessions. The dose of intervention components was generally moderate (50.9% to 60.4%), and the dose of PST components was low (17.3%). Adherence to study objectives was moderate (64.2%) and adherence to PST theory was low (43.2%). The counselors sufficiently stimulated the participant to optimize lifestyle (54.2% of the sessions), provided positive feedback (50.5%), and left the initiative regarding problem solving to the participant (71%). One of the two counselors performed significantly better on all measured criteria (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Conclusions. Intervention fidelity in the New Life(style) trial was generally low to moderate. In future interventions, it is recommended to put more emphasis on counselor recruitment, training, and intervention protocol contents. Fellow researchers are encouraged to embed a process evaluation into all study stages, taking into account all essential process elements, and to link process outcomes to more distal, health outcomes.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>A process evaluation is important to establish a successful implementation of public health interventions, which are evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in a real-world environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912447190">Glasgow &amp; Emmons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912447190">Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). A process evaluation is considered to be even more important in “complex interventions” in RCTs that are not drugs or surgical procedures but have many potential active ingredients and are often difficult to implement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912447190">Campbell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912447190">Hawe, Shiell, &amp; Riley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912447190">Oakley, Strange, Bonell, Allen, &amp; Stephenson, 2006</xref>). These complex interventions often prove efficacious in RCTs but are less effective in practice. Conducting a process evaluation is indispensable, since it prevents researchers from misinterpreting results by telling whether the efficacy of an intervention was caused by the intervention itself or by external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912447190">Dzewaltowski, Estabrooks, &amp; Glasgow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912447190">Glasgow, Bull, Gillette, Klesges, &amp; Dzewaltowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912447190">Glasgow &amp; Emmons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Intervention fidelity is an important component of process evaluations and is defined as the extent to which an intervention is implemented as intended by the program developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912447190">Saunders, Evans, &amp; Joshi, 2005</xref>). An intervention meets fidelity requirements if each of its components is delivered in a similar way to all participants and if it is implemented according to the theory and objectives underlying the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912447190">Dumas, Lynch, Laughlin, Phillips, &amp; Prinz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912447190">Saunders et al., 2005</xref>). Frequently, no empirical evidence is available on what an intervention entailed and on the extent to which the participants were exposed to it, which makes it difficult to compare the effectiveness of different health interventions. What is more, an intervention with low fidelity can harm both internal and external validity of a study. In the absence of fidelity data, significant results may reflect either the effectiveness of the intervention or the influence of unknown variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). Rejecting a null hypothesis due to nonsignificant outcomes may reflect an actual lack of effectiveness or an unsuccessful program implementation (Type III error; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912447190">Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, &amp; Gottlieb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912447190">Brownson, Fielding, &amp; Maylahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). When external validity is lacking, this can lead either to rejecting effective interventions or to disseminating ineffective, nonreproducible, or even harmful interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912447190">Moncher &amp; Prinz, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the implementation of a complex intervention, intervention fidelity is an important concept and has a central role in process evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912447190">Bond, Evans, Salyers, Williams, &amp; Kim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912447190">Dusenbury, Brannigan, Falco, &amp; Hansen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912447190">Gearing et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912447190">Perepletchikova &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912447190">Glasgow et al. (1999)</xref> define implementation as one of the dimensions of his RE-AIM evaluation framework which includes <italic>r</italic>each, <italic>e</italic>fficacy/effectiveness, <italic>a</italic>doption, <italic>i</italic>mplementation, and <italic>m</italic>aintenance. This framework conceptualizes the evaluation of the translatability of an intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan and Steckler (2002)</xref> also include implementation among their key components of a process evaluation, which include context, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, implementation, and recruitment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, literature on process evaluations conducted in large behavioral change trials has grown. A distinction can be made between formative and summative process evaluations. Data from a formative evaluation on its setting, context, and participants’ opinions can be used to provide ongoing monitoring and quality assessment to maximize the performance of an intervention. Data from summative process evaluations can be used to provide a conclusive rating of the extent to which intended outcomes were achieved and whether the intervention was implemented as intended. Another summative purpose is to include level of implementation data in the outcome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912447190">Devaney &amp; Rossi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912447190">Helitzer, Yoon, Wallerstein, &amp; Garcia-Velarde, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>An example of a formative process evaluation was shown in the “Active by Choice Today” trial to enhance intrinsic motivation and behavioral skills for increasing long-term physical activity in underserved adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839912447190">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The process evaluation aimed at the improvement of dose and fidelity of implementation, as well as reach of the intervention to the participants at Year 1 to Year 3 of the implementation. Formative process data on these process elements were monitored each year. Significant changes were made to improve reach, fidelity, and dose, such as expanding staff training and reformatting the intervention manual. These efforts resulted in notable improvements in attendance, dose, and fidelity of intervention implementation. Other studies reported summative process evaluations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839912447190">Whittemore et al. (2010)</xref> evaluated the implementation of a lifestyle program in primary care by nurse practitioners. Process data on intervention fidelity obtained through surveys and questionnaires showed that face-to-face sessions were implemented with good success to adults at risk for type 2 diabetes. Together with process data on attendance and attrition, this evaluation showed that the intervention was feasible and acceptable and may improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>In this article, we illustrate a process evaluation of a counselling intervention in the New Life(style) study, that aims to optimize maternal weight development during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447190">Althuizen, van Poppel, Seidell, van der Wijden, &amp; van Mechelen, 2006</xref>). Intervention fidelity, following the criteria reach, dose, adherence, and counselor competence, was assessed, and recommendations for research and practice were formulated.</p>

<title>The New Life(style) Study</title>
<p>Women with a first-time pregnancy (<italic>n</italic> = 280) were recruited from midwife practices. Of all participants, 139 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and received a lifestyle intervention consisting of four face-to-face counseling sessions and one telephone call. In the control group, women received care as usual. Four of the 139 women withdrew immediately after randomization because they were not interested in receiving the intervention, and 7 of them were unreachable. The 128 remaining participants received five counseling sessions: four face-to-face sessions at 18, 22, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy and one session at 8 weeks postpartum by telephone. The main objectives of the New Life(style) study were to (a) inform women on evidence-based guidelines with regard to weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition during pregnancy; (b) stimulate an optimization of lifestyle, regarding physical activity and nutrition; (c) review the individual lifestyle of the participant and give positive feedback on it; and (d) make a plan to optimize lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447190">Althuizen et al., 2006</xref>). Two counselors with a background in physical activity or remedial education were responsible for the execution of all counseling sessions with participants in the intervention group. They were trained before the start of the study to provide individual feedback on the modules, according to a standardized counseling protocol. According to related literature, a pretrial training was performed with 10 pregnant women to become acquainted with the protocol and target group. The conversations were audiotaped so that they could be studied by the research team, consisting of an epidemiologist, a health scientist, a gynecologist, and the two counselors. It was checked whether the counselors adhered to the protocol, and problems the counselors ran across were discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447190">Althuizen et al., 2006</xref>). Sessions were provided according to the problem-solving treatment (PST). PST is an evaluated, practical psychological intervention method for helping people to gain a sense of control over their difficulties and is similar to the social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912447190">Mynors-Wallis, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912447190">2005</xref>). The main objectives according to the PST in this study were to (a) increase knowledge of the participant regarding physical activity and nutrition, (b) increase the participant’s capacity to define undesirable behavior, (c) teach the participant how to change undesirable behavior and find solutions to problems, (d) give positive feedback to underline positive behavior, and (e) leave the initiative with the participant regarding defining the problem, setting goals, and making a plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447190">Althuizen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912447190">Mynors-Wallis, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912447190">2005</xref>). To optimize physical activity, the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were taken into account, which promote 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity activity on 5 or all days of the week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912447190">Pate et al., 1995</xref>). Regarding nutrition, the counselor focused on optimizing energy intake, adjusting energy intake to physical activity, and taking away misconceptions about nutritional requirements during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Each counseling session was structured in a uniform way. The components of the intervention and corresponding stages of PST per session are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912447190">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A sample of the first four sessions was audiotaped randomly, which resulted in 220 audiotaped counseling sessions. From these, 152 audiotaped sessions were randomly selected for the assessment of the fidelity criteria: dose, adherence, and counselor competence. A session could only be completed appropriately following the study objectives and PST theory when a “problem” existed (the participant did not meet the weight gain, physical activity, or dietary guidelines or foresaw difficulties later in pregnancy). Since this was not the case in 43 of the 152 randomly audiotaped sessions, only the remaining 109 sessions (39 sessions 1, 28 sessions 2, 28 sessions 3 and 14 sessions 4) were used for data analysis. These audiotaped sessions were quantitatively evaluated by one trained assessor using a fidelity checklist.</p>

<title>Fidelity Criteria</title>
<p>No widely applicable standardized methodology exists for measuring the fidelity of a PST-based counseling intervention. Diverse fidelity criteria are defined in the literature. In general, the following fidelity criteria can be defined: (a) reach of an intervention: the degree to which the intended audience participated in the intervention, (b) dose: the extent to which all components are delivered, (c) adherence to the program: the extent to which implementation of particular activities and methods is consistent with the way in which the program is written, (d) counselor competence: the level of skill and judgment shown by the interventionist in delivering the intervention, (e) participant responsiveness and enactment: the extent to which the participant performs intervention-related skills in real life, and (f) program differentiation: the extent to which unique features of the program can be identified. Although it is recommended that all mentioned components are measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912447190">Dane &amp; Schneider, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912447190">Dusenbury et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912447190">Perepletchikova &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>), we considered the criteria: (a) reach of the intervention, (b) dose of the intervention, (c) adherence to study objectives, (d) adherence to the underlying PST theory, and (e) counselor competence, as relevant criteria in this fidelity study, thereby putting emphasis on the delivery of the intervention. Participant responsiveness to the intervention was not included, since no data on this component are available (yet). For a detailed description of how the criteria were operationalized, see the Outcome Measures section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912447190">
<title>Checklist</title>
<p>A checklist for scoring the aforementioned criteria of intervention fidelity was developed for all four counseling sessions. The checklist is a copy of the counseling protocol containing all intervention and PST components that should have been implemented during the counseling sessions, as is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912447190">Table 1</xref>. Sessions were scored by checking the <italic>presence</italic> (1) or <italic>absence</italic> (0) of the components. Not every counseling session contained exactly the same (number of) intervention components. Therefore, a checklist was developed for each session separately. In Session 1 for example, changes in physical activity before and during pregnancy were discussed, in contrast to the discussion of physical activity during maternity leave in Session 4. Universal items, such as those that were representative for underlying study objectives and PST theory and the skills of the counselors, recurred in every checklist.</p>
<p>In a pilot study, two assessors each scored six counseling sessions. Differences in scoring and the content of the items and skills were discussed. As a result, items were described more clearly, and scoring scales were adjusted or new items were added. A small handbook was created, serving as a guide for scoring each item.</p>
<p>The ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration were followed, and the trial was approved by the local ethical committee.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524839912447190">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1524839912447190">
<title>Reach</title>
<p>Reach was operationalized as the percentage of participants randomized in the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 139) that received all five counseling sessions. This percentage could be obtained directly from the study database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839912447190">
<title>Dose</title>
<p>The dose score per session is the sum of all actually delivered intervention and PST components. The intervention and PST components that should have been present are those listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912447190">Table 1</xref> and are 26 items for Session 1, 14 for Session 2, 17 for Session 3, and 21 for Session 4. Each component was scored as <italic>present</italic> (1) or <italic>absent</italic> (0). The outcome was reported as the percentage of a maximal dose and was calculated for each session by dividing the mean amount of present components by the maximum amount of components to be delivered. A separate PST dose score was calculated similarly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839912447190">
<title>Adherence</title>
<p>Adherence was determined with regard to underlying study objectives and adherence to PST theory, based on the main objectives of the study and PST. Adherence to underlying study objectives is high if implementation of the counseling session is consistent with the way the program is written according to underlying study objectives. If the intervention was implemented according to the PST theory, a high adherence to PST theory was achieved. Based on the defined objectives, a required amount of intervention and PST components was defined per session. For example, the study objectives were (a) Informing women on evidence-based guidelines with regard to weight gain, physical activity, and nutrition during pregnancy; (b) stimulating an optimization of lifestyle, regarding physical activity and nutrition; (c) reviewing individual lifestyle of the participant and giving positive feedback on it; and (d) making a plan to optimize lifestyle. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912447190">Table 1</xref>, it can be seen what components were required to be present in a counseling session in order to be considered as adherent to study objectives. The adherence score is the mean proportion of all required components and/or skills that were present. A counselor skill was considered as present when sufficiently used (see Counselor Competence section). The overall adherence is a combined score of the above-mentioned scores. PST adherence, study adherence, and overall adherence were reported as an overall mean percentage of a maximal adherence, if all components were delivered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839912447190">
<title>Counselor competence</title>
<p>Counselor competence was defined as the extent to which the counselor delivered the session following the prescribed level of skill for stimulating optimized lifestyle, giving positive feedback, and leaving the initiative to the participant. Three distinctive counselor skills were defined on a Likert-type scale (0 = <italic>not good</italic> to 4 = <italic>very good</italic>): (a) stimulating the optimization of participant’s lifestyle, (b) giving positive feedback on the participant’s lifestyle, and (c) leaving the initiative to the participant. If scored 0 or 1, the skill was defined as “insufficient” and &gt;2 was defined as “sufficient.” Counseling competence was reported as the overall percentage of “sufficient” counseling sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839912447190">
<title>Level of fidelity</title>
<p>For this study, a fidelity score of 80% to 100% (percentage of the components that are delivered as planned) indicates a high fidelity, 50% or less a low fidelity, and a fidelity score of 50% to 80% is interpreted as moderate. The defined levels of fidelity were loosely based on previous research. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912447190">Bartholomew (2006)</xref>, 70% fidelity is regarded as acceptable. We chose to formulate our level of moderate fidelity around this level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912447190">Bartholomew et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1524839912447190">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows. The main participant characteristics (age, ethnicity, and education) in the total intervention group and sample were compared at baseline using an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Measuring reach, dose, adherence, and counselor competence resulted in raw scores, that is, percentages of the maximum. On forehand, we hypothesized that there would be differences in scores between the two counselors. Therefore, for calculating the mean scores per item, cases were weighted according to the number of sessions analyzed per counselor. Differences between both counselors with regard to reach, dose, adherence, and counselor competence were tested using an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we intended to illustrate a summative process evaluation of a counseling intervention in the New Life(style) study, which aimed to optimize maternal weight development during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447190">Althuizen et al., 2006</xref>). Fidelity criteria reach, dose, adherence, and counselor competence were assessed.</p>
<p>Overall, findings suggested that the New Life(style) intervention reached a moderate portion of the participants in the intervention group, which can probably be explained by participants who had dropped out (<italic>n</italic> = 11) immediately after randomization because of loss of interest or being unreachable. Excluding them from data analysis resulted in a high reach (81.8%). What is more, the dose of intervention components was moderate during the first three counseling sessions and low during the fourth session. Regarding the PST components, a low percentage was delivered (17.3%) in all sessions, in particular regarding the problem definition component. Consequently, in those sessions, no goals were set and no plans were made, and the counseling session became more of a lifestyle-monitoring session instead of an active problem-solving session. The purpose was to remain active in problem solving during all sessions. Furthermore, the participant was rarely involved in “problem solving.” If a problem was defined and subsequent PST stages were completed, this was mainly initiated by the counselor and not the participant. Contrary to the moderate adherence to the study protocol, but in line with the low dose of delivered PST components, adherence to PST theory was low. Thereby, in nearly half of the sessions, the counselors had “sufficiently” stimulated the participant and provided feedback on lifestyle behavior. A low adherence to underlying counseling principles is in line with the following studies that have investigated the level of implementation of motivational interviewing in a counseling intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912447190">Bennett, Moore, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912447190">Bennett, Roberts, Vaughan, Gibbins, &amp; Rouse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912447190">Evangeli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912447190">Mitcheson, Bhavsar, &amp; McCambridge, 2009</xref>). Levels also proved to be insufficient despite a 2-day counselor training. Two other studies compared the implementation of motivational interviewing by trained counselors with a control group of untrained counselors. Motivational interviewing–trained counselors showed a significant higher sufficiency level compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912447190">Bennett, Roberts, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912447190">Spikman &amp; Aarsen, 2005</xref>). However, the implementation was still insufficient in the study of Spikman and Aarsen.</p>
<p>This study has limitations. For feasibility reasons and since emphasis was put on the delivery of the intervention, not all established fidelity criteria were measured. Therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn with regard to context, recruitment, and participant’s response to the intervention. However, these process elements might have influence on overall fidelity, and to draw a conclusion on intervention fidelity, it is recommended to include these two dimensions in future fidelity measurements. In addition, since fidelity was scored by one trained assessor, the scores might give a biased view of the actual fidelity.</p>
<p>This fidelity study also has implications for future research. Regarding the implementation of PST, further research should aim at confirming our results. Process evaluations, including a fidelity assessment, should play a central role in the design of new intervention studies, taking into account the following additional process elements: context, reach, dose delivered, dose received (including the participant’s response to the intervention), implementation, and recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447190">Linnan &amp; Steckler, 2002</xref>). Only by embedding a process evaluation in the developmental and piloting stage, as was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912447190">Saunders et al. (2005)</xref>, can it be optimally used for both formative and summative purposes: formative by providing ongoing monitoring and increasing the quality of the intervention, summative by rating the implementation of the intervention and including level of implementation in the outcome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912447190">Gearing et al., 2011</xref>). By doing this, future researchers should be able to determine whether high-fidelity counseling sessions in an intervention study actually have led to better outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912447190">Murawski et al. (2009)</xref> already showed that improvements in problem-solving skills were significantly associated with body weight change among women and that larger body weight reductions were linked to higher levels of intervention adherence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912447190">Streuling, Beyerlein, and von Kries (2010)</xref> showed that interventions based on physical activity and dietary counseling are effective in preventing gestational weight gain. Effects of the New Life(Style) intervention on weight gain should be interpreted in the context of the results of this study, as a lack of significant effects can probably be explained by a low to moderate intervention fidelity.</p>
<p>To optimize the implementation of this counseling intervention in practice, recommendations can be formulated. At first, careful attention should be paid to the recruitment of “adequate” counselors. Although estimating capabilities of potential counselors in advance seems challenging, specific competencies (e.g., problem-solving skills) could be identified by means of a short assessment, embedded in a job interview. Before the actual implementation of an intervention, a more extensive and thorough training should take place, focusing on specific PST skills. A more extensive counselor-specific training can minimize intercounselor variance, and monitoring counseling techniques throughout the intervention process can improve the constancy and fidelity of the implementation of the intervention. However, counselors also need to be flexible in their thinking in order to identify each participant’s individual needs and must be able to tailor the protocol to the participants. In addition, in these training sessions, emphasis should be put on specific difficulties in implementing PST, such as the counselor’s challenge to increase the participant’s capacity to independently define undesirable behavior. Apparently, among this specific subgroup of pregnant women, switching from monitoring pregnancy and lifestyle behaviors to actual problem definition and problem solving issues was difficult. Furthermore, the skill to be able increase the participant’s capacity to define undesirable behavior needs attention. Third, more effort should be put in the development of a theory-based intervention protocol and counselor skills manual, thereby focusing on the specific aforementioned shortcomings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The approach of this study provided a unique assessment of the intervention fidelity of a counseling intervention that aims to optimize maternal weight development during pregnancy. The intervention fidelity was low to moderate. Despite the presence of an intervention protocol and counselor training, a low percentage of intended counseling components was delivered and the participant was rarely involved in “problem solving.” In addition, counselor performance differed significantly. It is recommended to perform short skills assessments before counselor recruitment in order to tailor training contents to observed difficulties in implementing PST and to dedicate greater attention to the development of intervention protocols. Overall, fellow researchers are encouraged to embed a process evaluation into their study design, taking into account the essential process elements, and to link process outcomes to more distal, health outcomes.</p>
