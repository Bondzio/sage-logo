<abstract>
<p>While much research has investigated the persuasive effects of partisan cues on citizens’ evaluations of political messages, our knowledge regarding failed persuasion is limited. It remains particularly unclear whether failed elite attempts at persuasion simply leave citizens’ attitudes unchanged or whether such attempts at persuading one segment of the electorate can actually lead to a loss of support in others. This study therefore investigates partisan cues and the occurrence of <italic>contrast effects</italic>, i.e. when the presence of an elite cue induces citizens to shift their attitudes <italic>away</italic> from the viewpoint advocated in a persuasive message. Based on data from three experiments involving two different party leader cues, I demonstrate that partisan cues can trigger contrast effects among those perceiving the party leader in question as non-likeable and those who vote for a party which is politically opposed to the source. The implications of the findings are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An impressive body of research has demonstrated that cue-taking is one of the most fundamental mechanisms helping citizens form attitudes in the complex world of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810380093">Arceneaux, 2008</xref>: 139; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810380093">Campbell et al., 1960</xref>: 128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380093">Kam, 2005</xref>: 165; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810380093">Lau and Redlawsk, 2006</xref>: 232; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>; 186; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380093">Zaller, 1992</xref>). Political parties and their leaders structure democratic competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810380093">Katz, 1980</xref>: 1) and build policy reputations in the eyes of the electorate over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810380093">Arceneaux, 2008</xref>: 140). In public debate, partisan elite cues therefore provide citizens who may otherwise lack direct experience or knowledge of political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810380093">Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996</xref>) with central guidance about the implications of a persuasive message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810380093">Campbell et al., 1960</xref>: 128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380093">Zaller, 1992</xref>: 42). Accordingly, partisan cues constitute ‘shortcuts’ allowing citizens to make relatively well-grounded political judgments based on limited information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810380093">Downs, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380093">Lupia and McCubbins, 1998</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>Prior research on cue-taking has established that partisan source cues tend to enhance the approval of a given message or programme among the source’s political supporters in the electorate (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810380093">Cohen, 2003</xref>: 811–12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380093">Druckman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380093">Zaller, 1992</xref>). Such findings have accentuated the power of elite opinion leadership, and the potential strategic gains to be made by partisan elites, by putting down frequent markers in public debate over any issue or political problem.</p>
<p>However, while extant studies have demonstrated that partisan source cues can enhance the support for a given policy position among political supporters, research on failed elite persuasion has been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810380093">Abelson and Miller, 1967</xref>: 332–3; Taber and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380093">Lodge: 2006</xref>: 756; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810380093">Wagner, 2007</xref>: 1). In particular, we have a limited understanding of whether failed attempts at persuasion simply leave opinions unchanged or whether citizens also use partisan cues to go against elite opinion leadership: Is it always ‘cost-free’ for partisan elite representatives to sound off in public debate? Or can attempts at increasing policy approval in one segment of the electorate come at the expense of a loss of support in other segments? May citizens also use source cues to move their attitudes away from the viewpoint advocated in a persuasive message? Prior research leaves us with a limited understanding of these dynamics of cue-taking. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068810380093">Wegener et al. (2004</xref>: 19) summarize: ‘researchers have not generally asked questions about resistance that parallel the questions asked about persuasion’.</p>
<p>To advance our knowledge of cue-taking, this study therefore investigates <italic>contrast effects</italic>, i.e. when the presence of a partisan source cue induces citizens to shift their attitudes <italic>away</italic> from the viewpoint advocated in a persuasive message.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068810380093">1</xref>
</sup> Prior literature seems to assume that citizens will support messages from political elites who share their party affiliation or who they like but otherwise remain relatively unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810380093">Hartman and Weber, 2009</xref>: 16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380093">Zaller, 1992</xref>: 44). From this perspective, it should be ‘cost-free’ for elite representatives to sound off in public debate. However, based on derivations from two of the most influential psychological theories on cue-taking – motivated political reasoning and cue-taking as efficiency heuristic – I argue that partisan cues may also trigger contrast effects among political opponents. I investigate this basic prediction using two experimental studies of the effects of party leader cues on support for political viewpoints.</p>
<p>Across two different party leader cues, three viewpoints and two measures of political opposition, I find that the pattern of results supports the occurrence of contrast effects. Specifically, I show that party leader cues can elicit increased opposition to the viewpoint advocated in a political message among those voting for an opposing party and those who find the party leader non-likeable. Accordingly, the study emphasizes the capacity of citizens to go against elite directions and suggests that elite opinion leadership may indeed be more limited than indicated by prior studies.</p>

<title>Partisan cues and opinion formation</title>
<p>Political messages and viewpoints are rarely reported without reference to partisan sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380093">Druckman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 5). Political parties and their leaders play a structuring role in democratic competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810380093">Green et al., 2002</xref>: 205; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810380093">Katz, 1980</xref>: 1), and persistent media attention places partisan leaders as prominent agents in the public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810380093">Newman and Perloff, 2004</xref>: 28). Hence, Barack Obama’s speech at the Democratic Convention in 2008 reached one-quarter of all American households, only to be slightly surpassed by the ratings for John McCain’s acceptance speech at the Republican Convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380093">
<italic>New York Times</italic>, 2008a</xref>, b). Correspondingly, in the European context, in their extensive study of the election coverage (1990–2002) in the most widely read German newspaper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068810380093">Semetko and Schoenbach (2003</xref>: 7) found that the top candidates were mentioned in a substantial percentage of the political articles with a – hitherto – peak in 2002, where the incumbent Chancellor was an actor in 42 percent of the political stories, and the top opposition candidate was mentioned in 25 percent of the political articles; so partisan leaders are central sponsors of the political messages confronting citizens in public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Prior studies of the impact of partisan cues have demonstrated that citizens tend to endorse the viewpoints of like-minded partisan elites (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810380093">Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380093">Druckman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380093">Zaller, 1992</xref>). Hence, in an experimental study of the effect of group information on political attitudes, Cohen found that when participants had information available about the position of the party which they usually identified with, they assimilated their own attitudes to this position regardless of the content of the policy (2003: 819). Similarly, in a study of support for retention of California State Supreme Court Justices, Mondak found that governor source cues affected support for retention of the Supreme Court Justices so that respondents who approved of the appointing governors or shared their partisanship were more likely to support retention of the justices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>: 183–4). Finally, in a study of attitudes to food irradiation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380093">Kam (2005)</xref> presented participants with a news article either without partisan source information or with the Democrats proposing a ban and the Republicans opposing it (and vice versa). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380093">Kam (2005)</xref> found that when the party the participants identified with proposed the ban, they supported the ban more than the control group; likewise, when the opposing party proposed the ban, the participants were more against the ban than the control group was.</p>
<p>Yet, in her experiment, Kam provided the participants with the positions of <italic>both</italic> their ‘own’ party and the opposing party. From her research design it therefore remains inconclusive to what extent the subjects ‘toed the party line’ of their own party or simply went against the position of the opposing party. We are therefore left with limited knowledge of whether and under which circumstances partisan cues can trigger contrast effects. This is a critical limitation in our understanding of cue-taking, since it produces a potentially inflated impression of the scope of elite opinion leadership. The questions opened by Kam’s study (2005) therefore push the research agenda towards the subject of contrast effects. Indeed, attitudes may shift away from the viewpoint advocated in a political message if the partisan elite source is a distinct opponent.</p>

<sec id="section3-1354068810380093">
<title>When citizens go against elite directions</title>
<p>I argue that the expectation that partisan cues may trigger contrast effects can be derived as a clear prediction from two of the most influential theoretical approaches to the role of partisan cues in attitude formation, i.e. the literature on motivated political reasoning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810380093">Lodge and Taber, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380093">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380093">Taber and Lodge, 2006</xref>) and source cues as heuristic efficiency mechanisms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380093">Chaiken, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810380093">Downs, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The growing literature on motivated political reasoning asserts that when encountering a political message citizens are not motivated by accuracy goals alone, but also by partisan goals, which induces them to reason in defence of their political predispositions such as values and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380093">Taber and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 756). Along with group symbols and partisan labels, political leaders that people have evaluated in the past constitute positively or negatively charged predispositions, which motivates the processing of new information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380093">Lodge and Taber, 2005</xref>: 456). Specifically, citizens should therefore assess policies more positively when they come from partisan elites they support and identify with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380093">Lebo and Cassino, 2007</xref>: 722; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380093">Taber and Lodge, 2006</xref>: 756). Correspondingly, a policy endorsed by political elites which a given citizen is opposed to should lead him or her to evaluate the policy more negatively, or even argue against it, because the citizen will reason in defence of his predispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380093">Lebo and Cassino, 2007</xref>: 723; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810380093">Lodge and Taber, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the classical prediction derived by the theory of motivated reasoning has been that a partisan cue will increase support for a policy among citizens who identify with the partisan source. However, applied to the study of failed elite persuasion, the theory also leads to the expectation that a partisan cue will trigger opposition against a policy viewpoint among political opponents in the electorate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 10) as a complement to the traditional persuasive effect on political supporters.</p>
<p>The expectation that partisan source cues may incite some people to shift their attitudes away from the advocated viewpoint is also supported by theories of cues as efficiency mechanisms in citizens’ attitude formation: This line of research emphasizes that source cues constitute ‘shortcuts’ allowing citizens to form relatively well-grounded attitudes without deep message scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810380093">Downs, 1957</xref>: 233; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380093">Kam, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380093">Lupia and McCubbins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>) or profound knowledge of political abstractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380093">Brady and Sniderman, 1985</xref>). Source cues represent shortcuts because they allow citizens to rely on their ‘likes and dislikes of politically strategic groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380093">Brady and Sniderman, 1985</xref>: 1061). Specifically, the presence of a partisan cue allows citizens to transfer their judgment concerning the partisan representative to the viewpoint which he or she advocates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380093">Mondak, 1993</xref>: 188).</p>
<p>In the literature on partisan cues as efficiency mechanisms, this has led to the classical prediction that the stronger citizens like a partisan source, the more likely they will be to support the source’s viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068810380093">Sniderman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380093">Brady and Sniderman, 1985</xref>). Yet, applying these insights to the study of failed elite persuasion we should also expect that the stronger citizens dislike or oppose a partisan source, the stronger they will oppose the source’s viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810380093">Eagly and Chaiken, 1993</xref>: 12, 19), especially when they perceive the source as truthful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380093">Lupia and McCubbins, 1998</xref>: 62).</p>
<p>In sum, two of the most influential theories regarding the role of partisan cues in opinion formation lead to the expectation that a partisan cue can reduce support for the viewpoint advocated in a message among political opponents in the electorate. This prediction will be referred to as the <italic>contrast hypothesis.</italic> While this expectation is a relatively direct derivation of the theories, the current study is among the first to put it to targeted empirical test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354068810380093">
<title>Overview of studies and data</title>
<p>I test the contrast hypothesis with data from two studies embedded in a multiple pen-and-paper experiment conducted in February 2007. This research design enables me to explore the prediction across different categories of party leaders and issues and with two indicators of political opposition. The design therefore provides for a balanced test of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>In both studies, participants were instructed to read a short ‘extract from the political debate’. Each extract presented a message of roughly 60 words with a political viewpoint (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1354068810380093">Appendix A</xref>). The participants read the messages either with a party leader as the source of the viewpoint (treatment group) or without any source information (control group).</p>
<p>A diverse group of students from three general upper secondary schools, two business colleges and a regional vocational education centre were recruited for the experiment. The six upper secondary education institutions are from different parts of Denmark with varying degrees of urbanization and varying political preferences. Though the sample was not representative, the participants’ attitudinal characteristics displayed good variation and acceptable comparability to the Danish population on central background variables. (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1354068810380093">Appendix B</xref> compares the student sample with estimates for the Danish population.)</p>
<p>Sears’ findings (1986) have triggered widespread concerns that student samples might generate a biased impression of citizens’ susceptibility to elite communication. However, current studies have shown no differences in the susceptibility between student and non-student samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810380093">Miller and Krosnick, 2000</xref>: 313) or differences related to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810380093">Mayhorn et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the most central potential bias induced by the student sample in the current study is that party identification might be weaker because the students’ political identities remain in a formative stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380093">Kam, 2005</xref>: 176). Should this be the case, the choice of the student sample only generates a more conservative test of the contrast hypothesis, because the consequence would be that the partisan cue would have weaker significance.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<sec id="section6-1354068810380093">
<title>Design and measures</title>
<p>Central to the investigation of the contrast hypothesis was a research design maximizing the variation in the degree of party-political opposition between the party leader and the participants in the first study. Denmark has a multiparty system. At the time of the experiment, seven parties were seated in parliament. The Danish case therefore offers good opportunities for maximizing the variation in the degree of party-political opposition between the source and the receivers.</p>
<p>The issue chosen for Study 1 was the Cartoon Case. The Cartoon Crisis peaked in the spring of 2006 after a Danish newspaper, <italic>Jyllands-Posten</italic>, had published 12 controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. The issue has been highly salient in Danish public debate. The controversy centred on the application of freedom of speech (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810380093">Bille, 2007</xref>), but the issue is rooted in a broader discussion about immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810380093">Rynning and Schmidt, 2006</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>The partisan elite source chosen for Study 1 was Pia Kjærsgaard, leader of the Danish extreme right-wing party, the Danish People’s Party (DPP). The DPP advocates anti-immigration and is critical of the influence of Islam in Danish society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380093">Ignazi, 2006</xref>: 144). Since the 2001 parliamentary elections, when the DPP received 12.4 percent of the national vote and became the third largest party in the <italic>Folketing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810380093">Bille, 2002</xref>: 942), the DPP has been the parliamentary support party for the centre–right coalition government (the Liberals and the Conservatives). The Liberals and the Conservatives have also been relatively restrictive on the immigration issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810380093">Pedersen, 2005</xref>: 1103), though less so than the DPP. Finally, the centre–left opposition (the Social Liberal Party, Social Democrats, Socialist People’s Party, the Red-Green Alliance (all seated in parliament), the Centre Democrats and Christian Democrats (not seated in parliament at the time)) have been less restrictive on the immigration issue. Hence, the use of the extreme-right leader in the experiment maximizes the variation in the participants’ degree of party-political opposition to the source.</p>
<p>In Study 1, all participants read the same message with a ‘free speech’ viewpoint either without source information or with the extreme-right party leader as the source (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1354068810380093">Appendix A</xref>). The ‘free speech’ viewpoint was in line with the DPP’s general policy on the issue. The assignment of experimental conditions was randomized using block randomization. In line with the measurement applied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810380093">Kuklinski and Hurley (1994)</xref> and Mondak (1993), the participants in the treatment group and control group, respectively, were asked: ‘How much do you agree with [Pia Kjærsgaard’s / the] viewpoint?’ after they had read the viewpoint. Answers were measured on a seven-point scale (—3/completely disagree, +3/ completely agree).</p>
<p>Political opposition to the source was measured using two indicators: general party preference and perception of the party leader’s likeability. In Europe, political leaders have traditionally been perceived as an extended expression of the party on an equal footing with symbols and colours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380093">Stewart and Clarke, 1992</xref>: 448). However, candidate-centred marketing and increased media emphasis on political leaders can lead the public to place greater emphasis on their perception of the party leader as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810380093">Newman and Perloff, 2004</xref>: 28). To meet these developments, both general party preference and party leader likeability are therefore included in the study as measures of the participants’ degree of political opposition to the source.</p>
<p>Party preference was measured using the question: ‘If a <italic>Folketing</italic> election was held tomorrow and you could vote, which party would you vote for?’ Consistent with the structure of the general party competition and the debate on immigration issues presented above, each response was categorized in one of three groups: Participants who would vote for the DPP were categorized as Kjærsgaard supporters (9.7 percent). Participants voting for the centre-right parties were categorized as moderate political opponents (i.e. the Liberals and the Conservatives; 31 percent), and participants voting for the centre–left parties were categorized as distinct political opponents (i.e. Centre Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social Liberal Party, Social Democrats, Socialist People’s Party and the Red–Green Alliance; 37.8 percent). Participants who would not vote or did not indicate a party preference were excluded (21.4 percent).</p>
<p>The respondents’ global perception of Kjærgaard’s likeability was measured through an index composed of three items: The respondents were asked to rate how sympathetic, trustful and knowledgeable they perceived Kjærsgaard. Answers were measured on five-point scales (1/not at all all/5 very much) and summed in a global likeability index which was reduced to three general categories – likeable, mixed impression and non-likeable – in the analysis.</p>
<p>Prior studies of the conditioning effect of source likeability have used sources that were characterized as either likeable or non-likeable in a separate pre-test. The advantage of this procedure is that it eliminates endogeneity problems, where the participants could adjust their perception of the source according to their agreement with the viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380093">Druckman, 2001</xref>: 1047–8). However, this procedure does not allow for genuine conclusions at the individual level; in party politics, leaders are not unambiguously perceived as either likeable or non-likeable. Rather, the likeability of a given party leader varies in degrees according to <italic>who you ask</italic> in the electorate. To grasp the full dynamic in the conditioning effect of the likeability of the source on his or her capacity to influence different citizens’ attitudes, we must therefore complement prior research with measures of perceived source likeability at the individual level.</p>
<p>To minimize any problems of endogeneity, I placed the likeability question in a separate section on ‘Politics and Politicians’ at the end of the questionnaire and changed the layout of this section slightly. To further ensure that the likeability question was not perceived as a test of attitude consistency, all of the participants were asked to rate three party leaders on the items. Finally, it was also checked statistically after the data had been collected was that the average perception of Kjærsgaard’s likeability did not vary by experimental condition. No statistically significant difference was found (mean difference = 0.011, F = 0.367, <italic>p</italic> = 0.545).</p>

<p>Recapitulating the contrast hypothesis, a partisan source cue can be expected to decrease support for the viewpoint advocated in a message among political opponents. To support this prediction, the effect of the Kjærsgaard cue on support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint must be conditioned by the participants’ party preference and their perception of Kjærsgaard’s likeability. Moreover, it must also be demonstrated that the conditioning effect has the expected direction and generates a significant <italic>decrease</italic> in support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint among the receivers voting for an opposing party or finding Kjærsgaard non-likeable.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380093">Table 1</xref>, Model I thus reports the conditioning effect of party preference on the impact of the Kjærsgaard cue on support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint. Correspondingly, Model II shows the conditioning effect of the participants’ perception of Kjærsgaard’s likeability on the impact of the cue. Entries are unstandardized OLS regression coefficients, and tests are one-sided since the hypothesis is directional.</p>

<p>The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380093">Table 1</xref> are consistent with the contrast hypothesis: The results in Models I and II show that both the indicators of the participants’ political opposition to the extreme right-wing leader significantly moderate the effect of the Kjærsgaard cue on support for the viewpoint: In Model I, the results support the effect of the Kjærsgaard cue on participants who vote for the centre–right parties or the centre–left parties differing significantly from the effect on her ‘own’ voters from the DPP. Equally, the results in Model II indicate that the effect of the Kjærsgaard cue on support for the viewpoint also changes according to the perception of her likeability. To further clarify the implications of these conditioning effects, the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380093">Table 1</xref> are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">B</xref>.</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">Figure 1A</xref> shows the conditioning effect of party preference on the impact of the Kjærsgaard cue. The results support the fact that participants who vote for the DPP follow traditional predictions: Among these participants, average agreement with the ‘free speech’ viewpoint increases from 0.79 to 0.89 when the viewpoint is assigned to ‘their’ own party leader (<italic>p</italic> = 0.029). This effect is consistent with the classical expectation that citizens are disposed to follow messages from ‘like-minded’ partisan elites.</p>
<p>Concerning the participants voting for parties which traditionally oppose the extreme right-wing party on the immigration issue, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">Figure 1A</xref> show that among the participants voting for the centre–left and centre–right parties alike, support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint <italic>decreases</italic> significantly when the extreme right-wing leader is the source. Thus, among the participants voting for the centre–right parties, the average agreement with the viewpoint is reduced from 0.71 in the no-source condition to 0.65 when the Kjærsgaard cue is provided (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042). An even more pronounced contrast effect is observed among the centre–left voters. In this group, average support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint drops from 0.57 when no source information is provided to 0.39 when the extreme-right leader is shown as the source of the viewpoint (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000). Finally, an additional follow-up test (not reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380093">Table 1</xref>) shows that the decrease in support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint among participants who vote for the centre–left parties is significantly stronger than the decrease among participants voting for the centre–right parties (<italic>p</italic> = 0.022, one-sided test). Apparently, the contrast effect triggered by the extreme right-wing leader increases as the degree of party-political opposition between the extreme-right party leader and the receiver is enhanced.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the results of Model II (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380093">Table 1</xref>), which uses the participants’ perception of the (non)-likeability of the extreme-right party leader as the indicator of their political opposition to the source. The results are consistent with the contrast hypothesis and indicate that among the participants who find the extreme right-wing party leader non-likeable, the average support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint decreases from 0.61 in the control group to 0.36 when the viewpoint is assigned to the extreme right-wing party leader (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000). The participants holding a mixed perception of Kjærsgaard’s likeability also decrease their support for the viewpoint when the extreme right leader is the source (decrease = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015), but less than the respondents who perceive Kjærsgaard as non-likeable (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008, one-sided test).</p>
<p>Overall, the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380093">B</xref> thus consistently support the contrast hypothesis: When political opposition to the right-wing leader is measured in terms of an opposing party preference and in terms of global perceptions of the leader’s non-likeability, the Kjærsgaard cue incites participants who oppose the right-wing leader politically to move their attitudes away from the persuasive viewpoint.</p>

<sec id="section8-1354068810380093">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>I ran a second study to investigate the robustness of the findings when tested on a less controversial party leader and less heated political issues. The question opened by Study 1 was whether contrast effects are restricted to citizens’ reactions to controversial extreme-right leaders or if the basic mechanism can also be observed in responses to policy directions from less controversial political leaders on less heated issues. The purpose of Study 2 was to shed light on this question. Study 2 included two experiments and employed the same basic design as Study 1. Nonetheless, the source cue was changed from the extreme-right party leader to the Prime Minister, and the conflict level in the issues was reduced from high to moderate. In this manner, Study 2 creates a substantially harder test with which to replicate the findings from Study 1.</p>
<sec id="section9-1354068810380093">
<title>Design and measures</title>
<p>The focus in the second study was on the effect of the Danish PM and leader of the Liberals, Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, on support for a viewpoint advocating continued Danish participation in the war in Iraq (Experiment 1) and the introduction of an upper limit to social welfare benefit rates (Experiment 2). The viewpoints are reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1354068810380093">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p>Concerning the Iraq issue, the Danish PM’s decision to support the war was never met domestically by a unified Opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810380093">Hobolt and Klemmensen, 2003</xref>). Despite later attempts by the extreme-left parties to politicize the issue, the coalition government succeeded in keeping the topic relatively low on the agenda, and the war never became a major theme in the 2005 election (Pedersen, 2005: 1105). Thus, while Danish participation in the war in Iraq has certainly caused debate, it never developed into a domestic conflict issue comparable to the Cartoon Case.</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of social welfare benefit rates, the actual draft bill had been put forward by the government in 2002 and implemented in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810380093">Slothuus, 2008</xref>: 12). The Opposition had opposed the bill strongly, emphasizing that it would only create more poor people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810380093">Slothuus, 2008</xref>: 12). While the bill was disputed, the issue never turned into proper high politics. Both the Iraq issue and the welfare issue are therefore less heated than the issue applied in Study 1.</p>
<p>In both experiments, the PM was reported as the source of the viewpoint in the treatment group, while the control group read the same viewpoint without an explicit source. The assignment of experimental conditions was randomized through block randomization. After reading the viewpoint, the participants in the treatment condition and control group, respectively, were asked: ‘How much do you agree with [Anders Fogh Rasmussen’s / the] viewpoint?’ The answers were measured on a seven-point scale (—3/completely disagree, +3 completely agree).</p>
<p>As in Study 1, the participants’ degree of political opposition to the source was measured in terms of their general party preference and their perception of Rasmussen’s (non)-likeability. As in Study 1, global perception of the PM’s likeability was measured through an index composed of three items (sympathy, trustfulness and knowledge). Again, the global likeability index was trichotomized in three general categories – likeable, mixed impression and non-likeable – for the analysis. As in Study 1, it was checked statistically after the data had been collected that the perception of Rasmussen’s likeability did not vary by experimental condition in either the social welfare experiment or the Iraq experiment. No statistically significant differences were found (mean difference in likeability rating = 0.001, F = 0.003, <italic>p</italic> = 0.958 and —0.011, F = 0.261, <italic>p</italic> = 0.610).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068810380093">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The participants’ party preference was coded using the same question as in Study 1. The shift from the extreme-right party leader to the head of government in a multiparty system implies that the categorization of political supporters and opponents had to be adjusted. The head of government does not just represent ‘his own’ party. When the government consists of a coalition of parties, he is also the highest representative of the entire coalition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068810380093">Warwick, 1996</xref>: 473). When the head of government puts markers down in the public debate, partisan dividing lines can as a main rule be expected to follow coalition dividing lines. In the analysis, I therefore categorize Rasmussen’s political supporters and opponents along the main coalition dividing lines, with the participants voting for parties from the governing coalition as political supporters (i.e. those voting for the Liberals, the Conservatives and the DPP),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068810380093">4</xref>
</sup> and participants voting for the Opposition as political opponents (i.e. those voting for the Social Liberal Party, Social Democrats, Socialist People’s Party, the Red–Green Alliance, Centre Democrats and Christian Democrats).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1354068810380093">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To support the contrast hypothesis, the effect of the Rasmussen cue on support for the viewpoints should be moderated by the participants’ party preference and their perception of the PM’s likeability. Moreover, the conditioning effects should have the expected direction and elicit a significant decrease in support for the viewpoints among participants who find Rasmussen non-likeable or vote for an opposing party.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380093">Table 2</xref>, Model I thus shows the conditioning effect of the participants’ party preference on the impact of the Rasmussen cue on their support for the Iraq viewpoint and the welfare viewpoint.

<p>Entries are unstandardized OLS-regression coefficients (robust standard errors in parentheses). All variables vary in the range 0--1. Reference category for the party preference variable = the Opposition. Reference category for the source likeability variable = likeable. Reference category for the control variable = no party preference. Model 1 includes only respondents who indicated a party preference. All respondents who did not indicate any party preference were excluded from the analyses in Model I. All tests are one-sided.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As in Study 1, a preliminary randomization check was conducted. In none of the experiments did the randomization check reveal systematic differences between the treatment and control group on gender, age, political knowledge and left–right ideological self-placement. But in the welfare experiment a marginally significant difference in the proportion voting for the Opposition was detected on the party preference variable (potential proportion difference = 0.067, <italic>p</italic> = 0.066, two-sided test). A control for party preference was therefore included in the analysis of the conditioning effect of the perception of the PM’s likeability on both the Iraq issue and the welfare issue. To keep subjects with no party preference in the analysis and thus be able to observe the effect of likeability for a sample that was as diverse as possible, the control variable was coded in three categories: subjects voting for the opposition, the governing coalition and subjects without party preference. The results in Model II, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380093">Table 2</xref>, remain substantially identical if the control is excluded, but, by including it, evidence of the robustness of the results is increased.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380093">Table 2</xref> offer some support for the contrast hypothesis: The findings indicate that party preference moderates the effect of the Rasmussen cue on support for the welfare viewpoint and that perception of Rasmussen’s likeability moderates the impact of the PM cue on support for both the Iraq viewpoint and the welfare viewpoint. These results are consistent with the contrast hypothesis.</p>
<p>The conditioning effect of party preference on the impact of the Rasmussen cue on support for the welfare viewpoint is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2A</xref>, while the conditioning effects of the participants’ perception of Rasmussen’s likeability on the impact of the PM cue on support for the Iraq viewpoint and the welfare viewpoint are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">C</xref> (for the category of subjects expressing no party preference on the control variable).</p>
<p>The illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">C</xref> demonstrate that the substantial implications of the moderating effects are that the PM cue causes participants voting for the Opposition (welfare issue) or finding Rasmussen non-likeable (Iraq issue and welfare issue) to shift their attitudes significantly away from the viewpoints. Thus, on the Iraq issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2C</xref>), support for the viewpoint decreases by 0.12 among respondents finding Rasmussen non-likeable, when the PM is assigned as the source (<italic>p</italic> = 0.025). Equally, on the welfare issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">B</xref>), the respondents who either vote for the Opposition or perceive Rasmussen as non-likeable decrease their support for the viewpoint by 0.08 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and by 0.08 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.022) when the PM is the source. These observations also follow the contrast hypothesis.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380093">Table 2</xref> also show that on the Iraq issue the effect of the Rasmussen cue is not conditioned by party preference. This is not consistent with the contrast hypothesis. A plausible reason why party preference does not condition the impact of the Rasmussen cue on support for the Iraq viewpoint may be that it is a foreign policy issue where classical partisan divisions might be overthrown by a ‘rallying around the flag’. This explanation is supported by scholarly work emphasizing the lack of success of the left-wing parties in trying to politicize the Danish participation in the war (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810380093">Pedersen, 2005</xref>: 1105).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the pattern of response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">C</xref>, in line with Study 1, provides mixed directional support for the traditional expectation of assimilation effects: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380093">Figure 2A</xref>, support for the welfare viewpoint decreases 0.01 among respondents voting for the parties in the governing coalition, whereas the respondents perceiving the PM as likeable increase their support for the viewpoints by 0.02 (welfare issue) and by 0.05 (Iraq issue) when Rasmussen is assigned as the source. Yet, these changes are highly statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>To sum up: The results from the investigation of the contrast hypothesis in Study 2 replicate the findings in Study 1 for three of the four cases with a research design which made the test substantially harder by extending the focus of the study to the impact of a less controversial party leader cue on the receivers’ support for less heated political issues. Taken as a whole, the findings in Study 2 therefore support the occurrence of contrast effects but also indicate that the effects may be more limited when the object of study expands beyond controversial partisan leaders and heated high politics issues.</p>

<sec id="section11-1354068810380093">
<title>General discussion</title>
<p>Thus far, contrast effects have been relatively underexposed in research on cue-taking. Accordingly, it has remained unclear whether partisan elites can always put down markers in public debate ‘free of charge’ or whether attempts at persuasion targeted at one segment of the electorate are at the expense of a loss of policy support in other segments?</p>
<p>To advance our knowledge of these dynamics, the current study has been among the first to investigate contrast effects triggered by partisan elite cues. Study 1 consistently indicated that the Kjærsgaard cue elicited contrast effects among the participants who voted for the centre–right and centre–left parties, and the contrast effect was stronger for centre–left voters than for centre–right voters. Equally, the Kjærsgaard cue also reduced the support for the ‘free speech’ viewpoint among the participants who found the extreme-right party leader non-likeable. Moreover, the findings in Study 2 demonstrated that the PM cue could also reduce the support for the welfare and the Iraq viewpoints among receivers who voted for the Opposition or perceived him as non-likeable, but the effects were less consistent across issues and more subtle than in Study 1.</p>
<p>In a general perspective, the current study extends prior research on cue-taking by demonstrating that partisan cues may also trigger contrast effects in addition to the persuasive effects which are well documented in prior studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the pattern in the findings also has important suggestions for our understanding of the dynamics of contrast effects: The variation in the effects from Study 1 to Study 2 indicates that the type of party leader may affect the occurrence of the contrast effects. The results suggest that controversial partisan elite representatives face relatively clear political costs in some segments of the electorate when they put down markers in the public debate to gain support for their policy in other segments. This trade-off appears more conditional for less controversial elite partisans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the variation in the findings from Study 1 to Study 2 suggests that the nature of the issue may affect the occurrence of contrast effects. In particular, salient conflict issues on which partisan elites have opposing reputations might constitute a more favourable context for the occurrence of contrast effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 10): On this type of issue, partisan source information might bring about stronger political connotations, strongly inciting the citizen to repel viewpoints associated with political opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380093">Slothuus and de Vreese, 2009</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>In a democratic perspective, the current study accentuates the constraints on elite opinion leadership. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380093">Druckman (2001</xref>: 1061) argued that the biased attention to successful elite persuasion had nurtured an inflated perception of elite influence on public opinion. The current study corrects this bias by emphasizing that elite influence should not be perceived as unilateral manipulation and that citizens have the capacity to use partisan source cues to go against elite directions.</p>

<p>The way I define and apply the term ‘contrast effect’ is in line with prior political science and communication oriented studies; compare, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810380093">Hartman and Weber (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810380093">Chong and Druckman (2007</xref>: 640).</p>

<label>3.</label>
<p>These results are controlled for party preference because randomization had not been successful in making the experimental groups completely equal on this variable in Study 2. In Study 2, all analyses of the conditioning effect of likeability therefore include a control for party preference (see paragraph three in the ‘result’ section). If the control for party preference is removed, the differences in likeability ratings remain statistically insignificant across the experimental conditions.</p>

<p>The DPP was not formally part of the Rasmussen coalition government; instead, it has been a support party in a ‘tight-knit’ collaboration with the government since 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810380093">Bille, 2008</xref>: 958, 960).

<p>Originally, 706 participated in the two experiments. On collecting 60 percent of the data, however, the government changed its position and decided to pull the Danish troops out of Iraq. PM Rasmussen announced this decision under intense media coverage. Hence, the Iraqi viewpoint had been overtaken by political reality. The last 40 percent of the responses have therefore been excluded from the analyses of the Iraq experiment.</p>
