<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the community-based diabetes education project was to evaluate participants’ knowledge and use of healthy cooking practices as they relate to controlling diabetes. In addition, an attempt was made to ascertain whether participants’ self-reported blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1C changed as a result of the educational intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712470605">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Extension agents were trained statewide on principles of diabetes self-management education (DSME) and nutrition concepts for the programs <italic>Do Well, Be Well with Diabetes</italic> (DWBW) and <italic>Cooking Well with Diabetes</italic> (CWWD). Upon returning to their respective counties, trained extension agents established health coalitions for program delivery. In 86 counties, online data were collected on perceived knowledge and behaviors related to healthy cooking practice and were assessed before the start of the program (pretest; time 1), after the third lesson (posttest; time 2), and again after the fourth and final lesson (time 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712470605">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Most participants trained in DWBW joined cooking classes so the group already had some knowledge of food preparation techniques and had adopted many of the recommended practices, yet the program still had impact. Findings suggest an improvement in participants’ knowledge and self-reported behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712470605">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The CWWD program provided a short-term impact of knowledge gain, and the adoption of healthy cooking practices was observed among program participants. A pattern of healthy eating should lead to a reduction of blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1C. The relatively short time between pretest and posttest was not sufficient to realize and measure such reductions.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is an increasing health problem worldwide and nationally; in the state of Texas, type 2 diabetes affects some 2.26 million people, although only 1.8 million are diagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712470605">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712470605"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712470605">3</xref></sup> This debilitating disease costs individuals, employers, the health care system, and the state more than $12.5 billion yearly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712470605">1</xref></sup> Diabetes is not curable but is manageable. People can learn skills to effectively manage their blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712470605">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712470605">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712470605">5</xref></sup> However, education has not been readily available. The good news is that by following a treatment of meal planning, daily activities, blood glucose monitoring, and physician-prescribed medications, persons with diabetes can control their blood glucose levels to improve their overall health and prevent the onset of diabetes-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712470605">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712470605"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712470605">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, <italic>Do Well, Be Well with Diabetes</italic> (DWBW), a nutrition and self-care 9-lesson series, was created to help Texans manage their blood glucose levels; it was then pilot-tested by the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref></sup> The primary goal of this grassroots educational program is to improve blood glucose management. Initially, the self-reported blood glucose of persons with diabetes was 140 mg/dL (7.8 mm/L); it decreased to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mm/L) after 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref></sup> Controlling diabetic people’s blood glucose keeps their health care costs, health risks, quality of life, and productivity very close to those of nondiabetic people. Since 2003, 187 trained county educators through local health coalitions have conducted DWBW for improved disease management, achieving an estimated potential lifetime health care cost savings of 81 million dollars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service developed and implemented a second phase of DWBW, titled <italic>Cooking Well with Diabetes</italic> (CWWD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605">8</xref></sup> to reinforce the practical application of the DWBW series. By using creative techniques to teach nutrition concepts, extension educators introduced healthy behaviors in a fun and positive manner that helped motivate clients to change cooking behaviors. CWWD targeted those individuals who participated in the DWBW program. Approximately 90% of participants who enrolled in phase 2 of CWWD had never participated in cooking school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712470605">9</xref></sup> By giving demonstrations and providing information on diabetes, nutrition, and food safety, educators taught participants to prepare Texas-style foods with ethnic variations; to increase fiber and decrease fat, sugar, and sodium; and to control portions with the plate method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712470605">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Online data collection surveys for both programs provide averages for each knowledge question plus other information such as demographics and self-reported blood glucose levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712470605">9</xref></sup> The focus of this research is analysis of the CWWD data collected following pilot testing from 2005 to 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712470605">10</xref></sup> The primary program objective of this CWWD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712470605">9</xref></sup> study was to evaluate participants’ knowledge and use of healthy cooking practices in relation to controlling diabetes.

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design was incorporated to support and guide the implementation of this community-based diabetes education series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712470605">11</xref></sup> Multiple theoretical frameworks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712470605">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712470605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712470605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712470605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712470605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712470605"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712470605">17</xref></sup> shaped the development of the diabetes programming curricula. First, the DWBW program was developed to help people with type 2 diabetes acquire skills needed to manage the disease successfully.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605">7</xref></sup> Participants could then select phase 2 CWWD, which reinforced the practical application of the nutrition and self-care education series using creative techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712470605">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712470605">9</xref></sup> Leadership for both educational programs was provided by local extension agents. Extension agents were part of the US Cooperative Extension System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712470605">18</xref></sup> responsible for lay education from land-grant universities in each state. Most extension agents were trained in nutrition education and skilled in assisting people to implement changes recommended by their health professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721712470605">
<title>Role of Extension Agents</title>
<p>Texas extension agents participated in annual statewide training sessions via Centra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712470605">19</xref></sup> in both diabetes programs. Upon completing statewide training, extension agents returned to their counties to form health coalitions made up of diabetes educators, physicians, physician assistants, dietitians, nurses, podiatrists, pharmacists, clergy, home economists, and chefs to plan, implement, and evaluate the nutrition/self-care diabetes lessons and diabetes cooking school lessons. Since most agents are not medically trained health professionals, they were taught how to help clients manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical exercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Noteworthy were their organizational leadership skills in planning, implementing, and evaluating diabetes education using research-based nutrition/self-care resources available to qualified health coalition members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712470605">18</xref></sup> Prior approval and ongoing exempt status for both phases (DWBW/CWWD) were secured via the Texas A&amp;M University Institutional Review Board.</p>

<sec id="section8-0145721712470605">
<title>Development of Educational Programs</title>
<p>The development of educational programs allowed individuals with diabetes to manage their blood glucose levels and practice self-care and nutrition skills gained through diabetes self-management education (DSME) participation in the DWBW series delivered in 9 lessons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712470605">17</xref></sup> Class topics included (1) What Is Diabetes? (2) Nutrition—First Step to Diabetes Management, (3) One Diabetes Diet—No Longer the Sole Option, (4) Managing Your Blood Glucose, (5) Nutritional Labels, (6) Diabetes and Exercise, (7) For Good Measure at Home and Eating Out, (8) Diabetes Medicines, and (9) Preventing and Managing Complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605">7</xref></sup> The program was pilot tested in 2002 in 12 counties. Class resources included curricula consistent with the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712470605">20</xref></sup> along with PowerPoint presentations, videos, marketing materials, and an evaluation of the program. County agents were trained to organize local health professionals to help plan, market, and provide the program.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service developed CWWD to reinforce the practical application of DWBW series. After individuals completed the DWBW, they were invited to participate in the CWWD program to improve their cooking skills. Approximately 90% of those participating in CWWD had never participated in prior cooking schools. The CWWD program included a series of 4 lessons including topics like healthy recipes to cut fat, sugar, and sodium and increase fiber content of foods: (1) Carbohydrate Foods—Starch &amp; Dessert Recipes, (2) Making Recipes With Fat Better for You—Main Dish Recipes, (3) Double Pleasure Side Dishes: Reducing Sodium and Increasing Fiber—Side Dish Recipes, and (4) Diabetes Reunion: Celebrating Sensibly With Diabetes—Holiday Recipes.</p>
<p>A cookbook of Texas-style foods with tested diabetes recipes has been available since 2004. Some recipes include ethnic variations, whereas others use simple ingredients along with an adaptation of the plate method for portion control. Food safety tips were provided with each recipe for cooking school demonstrations. As an incentive to complete all 4 CWWD lessons, persons with diabetes were given a CWWD diabetes cookbook.</p>
<p>Participants were provided with brochures about DWBW through local health fairs, physicians’ offices, local county extension offices, and the news media. The program’s primary goal was to improve blood glucose management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605">7</xref></sup> Since 2003, 187 trained county educators through local health coalitions have conducted diabetes education programming for improved self-care, nutrition, and disease management, achieving an estimated potential lifetime health care cost savings of $81 million, thus reducing health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712470605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712470605">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712470605">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721712470605">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>Two questionnaires were used to collect data from participants at 3 points during the CWWD program. The first questionnaire was administered by extension agents to all participants as a pretest (time 1) before the start of the program (N = 2853). The second questionnaire was administered to participants after the third lesson as a posttest (time 2) and again as a final test (time 3) after the fourth and last lesson.</p>
<p>Common to both questionnaires, the outcome section asked participants about checking their blood glucose level, results of a hemoglobin A1C test, behaviors related to healthy food preparation and cooking, and knowledge related to healthy cooking practices to control diabetes. The pretest had an additional section that collected background information from participants including demographics, diabetes status and history, overall health status, meal plans and problems using them, and past participation in diabetes education programs. The final test had a few open-ended questions at the end to allow participants to include qualitative results (success stories) that provided insight into program results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721712470605">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>Five extension program specialists, including several nutrition specialists, reviewed the questionnaires for content validity. Agents in several counties reviewed the questionnaires for face validity. A pilot test was conducted in 12 counties to address implementation issues and uncover potential problems with the questionnaires. As a result of the pilot test, 2 sets of questions were modified to increase understandability and reduce survey burden on respondents. Items related to perceived knowledge (originally structured as a 4-point agreement scale) and behavior items related to healthy food preparation and cooking (originally structured as a 4-point frequency of behavior scale) were changed to a dichotomous scale (yes or no). Exploratory factor analysis on pretest data from the first year (2005) indicated that the perceived knowledge and behavior items factored on 2 separate scales and accounted for 64.2% of the variance.</p>
<p>The Kaiser-Meyer-Olin (KMO) measure verified sampling adequacy for the analysis; KMO = .945, which is “superb” according to Field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712470605">22</xref></sup> All but 1 item had KMO values above .9; the other had a KMO value of .625—all well above the acceptable limit of .5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712470605">22</xref></sup> Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of the perceived knowledge and behavior factors was .944 and .903, respectively. Two behavioral items, planning menus using the plate method and modifying recipes to increase the amount of fiber, did not load on either factor but were retained on the questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721712470605">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data collected online for CWWD surveys were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS-PC version 17.0, Inc., North Chicago, Illinois). Statistical significance for the study was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Effect size was used to report practical significance. Data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712470605">10</xref></sup> included difference of proportion to reveal any differences in perceived knowledge and self-reported behaviors, whereas repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) between retrospective pretests, posttests, and follow-up data was used to reveal any knowledge gain. Paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to measure any differences in A1C values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712470605">10</xref></sup> Repeated-measures ANOVA requires that the assumption of sphericity be met (ie, that variances for each set of scores are roughly equal). Mauchly’s test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712470605">22</xref></sup> was used to assess the assumption of sphericity. Greenhouse-Geisser correction ϵˆ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712470605">22</xref></sup> was used to correct for violations of the assumption.</p>

Pretest participants (n = 2853) were asked whether they or a member of their family had diabetes. Almost two-thirds (1855 participants, 65.8%) indicated that they had diabetes. Of those, 69.9% said they had had diabetes for at least 2 years. Regarding family, 72.1% of participants said they had at least 1 family member with diabetes. Regarding participants and families together, 2651 (92.9%) participants indicated that they or a member of their family had diabetes, whereas 1177 (41.3%) participants indicated that both they and at least 1 other member of their family had diabetes.</p>

<p>Most pretest participants (n = 2853) were in a direct position to implement what they learned from CWWD as shown by the frequency analysis of selective behavior variables. Roughly 9 of 10 said they bought (90.6%) and prepared (88.9%) the food eaten in the home. When asked about participating in diabetes education previously, more than half of pretest participants (54.7%) indicated that they attended DWBW. Although participation in DWBW prior to CWWD was not mandatory, CWWD was intended to support the knowledge gained in DWBW and provide improvement in healthy cooking skills. Just 289 participants (10.3%) had participated in another diabetes cooking school.</p>
<p>A majority of pretest participants (54.0%) were given a meal plan by their physician; the most common types were carbohydrate counting, diabetes food exchanges, and regular meals with no added sugar. Of these, 69.0% of participants indicated experiencing 1 or more problems in using the meal plan. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712470605">Table 2</xref>, participants experienced numerous problems in using diabetes meal plans, with no single reason standing out.

<title>Knowledge Gain (Pretest, Posttest, and Final Test)</title>
<p>Beyond self-perception, 6 multiple-choice questions on healthy cooking practices were included on both questionnaires as a test of knowledge, scored 0 to 100. Repeated-measures ANOVA between the pretest, posttests, and final knowledge scores was used to assess knowledge gain. Mauchly’s test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712470605">22</xref></sup> indicated that the assumption of sphericity was not met (Mauchly’s W = .881, <italic>P</italic> = .000). However, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction (.893) indicated only slight deviation from sphericity, and the Greenhouse-Geisser ϵˆ adjustment was applied to correct for the violation.</p>
<p>The lower portion of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712470605">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the repeated-measures ANOVA. Mean posttest and final test scores were significantly higher than the mean pretest score, indicating knowledge gain. Effect size (practical significance) was measured using η<sup>2</sup>. We found that η<sup>2</sup> was 0.214, representing a small effect: <italic>F</italic>

<title>Behavior (Pretest, Posttest, and Final Test)</title>
<p>Participants were asked about engaging in specific behaviors related to healthy cooking for those with diabetes. Questions were answered yes or no; changes in the percentage of participants answering in the affirmative on the final test compared with the pretest were examined using a difference of proportion test.</p>
<p>Results show that the program was effective in increasing participants’ use of healthy cooking practices to benefit people with diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721712470605">Table 4</xref>). On 8 of the 10 items queried, the percentage of participants engaging in the behaviors was significantly higher in the final test compared with the pretest (statistical significance). Changes in 2 behaviors, “using vegetable/olive oil instead of lard” and “using lower fat cooking methods instead of frying,” were not statistically significant. In terms of practical significance (effect size), program effects were small for 7 of the 8 behaviors. “Planning meals using the plate method” realized the most sizable effect (medium).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A creative diabetes education program was evaluated to assess participants’ knowledge and use of healthy cooking practices as related to controlling diabetes. The diabetes cooking school was designed to increase participants’ knowledge of healthy cooking practices as they relate to controlling diabetes, increase participants’ use of healthy cooking practices as they relate to controlling diabetes, and reduce participants’ blood glucose (A1C) levels with self-reported results. Success stories provided insight into other attributes of the program from the perspective of the participants.</p>
<p>The program was designed to have the short-term impacts of knowledge gain and adoption of healthy cooking practices. Longer term, all other things equal, a pattern of eating healthier in this way should lead to a reduction of blood sugar levels. The relatively short time between the pretest and final test may not be sufficient to realize and measure any such reductions.</p>
<sec id="section19-0145721712470605">
<title>Limitations and Research Implications</title>
<p>From 2005 to 2009, data were collected from participants at the first (n = 2853), third (n = 2064), and final (n = 1026) sessions. No data were collected at the second session and, unfortunately, attendance records for participants at the second session could not be linked with data collected from the other 3 sessions—thus precluding the calculation of mean number of sessions attended by participants.</p>
<p>The program design allowed for short-term measurement of knowledge gain and the adoption of healthy cooking practices. The original research design also called for the fourth lesson (and final test) to be given as a follow-up survey 6 months after the third lesson to measure longer term adoption of healthy cooking practices. However, extension agents in the pilot test found that by following that strategy they lost most of their audience after the third session. Shortening the time between the third and fourth lessons was successful in reducing participant attrition after the third lesson when compared with the pilot test. Unfortunately, the shortened time between pretest and final tests weakened our ability to make conclusions about knowledge retention and sustained adoption of healthy cooking practices longer term (ie, at least 6 months after the program’s conclusion).</p>
<p>Self-reported blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1C were another limitation. Only 67 participants had usable test results for both the self-reported pretest and the final test. One county health coalition nurse educator,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712470605">23</xref></sup> along with the team of medical providers with participant permission and prior approval from the institutional review board, collected and analyzed hemoglobin A1C level—a more objective measurement of program success and the ultimate goal of any diabetes cooking school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712470605">23</xref></sup> This small class of participants’ pre- and posteducational intervention A1C values (n = 13) were compared using a paired sample <italic>t</italic> test. The results revealed that posttest A1C values were significantly lower than the pretest A1C values. These results are encouraging and suggest that similar educational efforts with outside funding resources in communities may produce real changes in A1C values and serve as stronger evidence of program impact than self-reported results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712470605">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712470605">24</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section20-0145721712470605">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>With type 2 diabetes an increasing health problem, extension participants as well as the lay public will be seeking more information to help prepare more healthy recipes and make better lifestyle choices to control blood glucose levels. Collaborate with your state extension nutrition and health specialists and local county extension agents to share your support and medical expertise to keep diabetes programming efforts research-based and relevant to the targeted audiences. Working in these community diabetes programming efforts will increase participants’ awareness of diabetes educators and show them how to find invaluable resources in their communities.</p>
<p>Helping persons with diabetes to identify and overcome barriers to physician-prescribed diabetes meal plans, as shown in this research, is an obvious area of need. Almost 7 of 10 participants in this study who used a physician-prescribed diabetes meal plan (69.0%) experienced 1 or more problems using it. Opportunities exist for diabetes educators and dietitians to develop innovative ways to overcome these barriers with research-based diabetes programming resources such as found in both DWBW and CWWD extension programs.</p>
<p>Results indicate that the creative diabetes cooking school approach can affect knowledge gain and the adoption of more healthy cooking practices. Over a longer time period, this newly acquired pattern of eating a healthier diet should lead to improved blood glucose levels. Conducting diabetes cooking schools via community collaborations would certainly be beneficial for participants with diabetes and would help them learn to buy, prepare, and eat healthy food and make other recommended lifestyle choices.</p>
