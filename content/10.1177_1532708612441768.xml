<p>Iain Wilkinson is a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Kent. A great deal of his research concerns occasions where problems of suffering amount to forces of cultural innovation and social change. The theoretical dimension of this project involves a critical reappraisal and questioning of the history of sociology and privileged terms of sociological understanding. It also engages with an attempt to understand how contemporary terms of sociological inquiry are being refashioned by current research into the social dynamics of emotions, embodied experience, and the political economy of health. In a more policy-orientated and practical direction, his research aims to inform our understanding of the ways in which people’s collective imagination for the suffering of others has an incisive bearing upon moral, political, and institutional responses to human affliction and social need. His publications include <italic>Anxiety in a Risk Society</italic> (2001, Routledge), <italic>Suffering: A Sociological Introduction</italic> (2005, Polity), <italic>Risk Vulnerability and Everyday Life</italic> (2010, Routledge), and (forthcoming) <italic>A Passion for Society: Essays on Social Suffering</italic> (coauthored with Arthur Kleinman).</p>

<p>This article offers a critical appraisal of C. Wright Mills’s <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> with focus brought to how he sets his sociology into practice. It is designed as an invitation to further dialogue and debate over the methodology of this work. It reviews Mills’s attempt to create a “sociologized pragmatism” and analyzes the contribution of <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> to this project. It argues that the critical praxis that informs the development of research and writing on “social suffering” demonstrates an approach to social inquiry that moves both with and beyond Mills, particularly with regard to the task of cultivating social understanding from conflicts met in lived experience.</p>

<p>C. Wright Mills’s <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> may well be the most influential account of sociology produced since the Second World War. Most textbook introductions to the subject make approving references to Mills’s depiction of the “task” and “promise” of the sociological imagination as a means to convey the founding vision for their enterprise and to underscore its human value. His advocacy of sociology as the cultural means by which it is made possible for us to “grasp history and biography and the relations between the two within society” is celebrated as a core statement of vocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612441768">Mills, 1959</xref>, p. 6). The teaching of sociology is hereby taken to involve the cultivation of a “quality of mind” that delivers not only an enlightened self-understanding but also the moral wisdom by which we might take actions to oppose and reform the “structural contradictions” that threaten to overwhelm our lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532708612441768">Millar Bidwell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532708612441768">Ostrow, Hesser, &amp; Enos, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>On a closer reading there is a distinct irony in the movement to “canonize” <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic>, for it can also be read as a declaration of Mills’s antipathy toward most sociologists and their work. The larger part of the book is taken up with an angry denunciation of the major “tendencies” within academic sociology that serve to corrupt and compromise his ideal account of the discipline. He descries the “arid formalism” of sociological theories where “the splitting of concepts and their endless rearrangement becomes the central endeavour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532708612441768">Mills, 1959</xref>, p. 23). He further moves to express his contempt for a culture of “abstracted empiricism” that appears to be governed by purely administrative and economic considerations. Mills portrays empirical sociology as “methodologically inhibited” to a point where it has abandoned substantive questions relating to conditions of historical formation and the moral experience of social life. He aims to persuade his readers that most of what they are set to encounter as “sociology” has fallen prey to careerism, obscurantism, and the dictates of technocracy.</p>
<p>Mills scholars hold that he wrote <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> as a cry from the wilderness and that in this epic scene he was moving to cast himself as a lost prophet in a hostile land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612441768">Brewer, 2004</xref>). It is argued that Mills hankered after greatness, and while striving for recognition, revealed a bullying and abrasive character. During his brief career he made many enemies, and on some readings, <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> amounts to an outburst of rancorous ressentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612441768">Abbott, 2006</xref>). In this context it is largely portrayed as a work of anger, mourning, and disappointment, while the critical idealism featured in the opening account of “the promise” of sociology tends to be cast as a more incidental component of its design.</p>
<p>In most assessments of his life and work, however, it is with an emphasis brought to his critical style that Mills tends to be celebrated as a figure of lasting significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612441768">Eldridge, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532708612441768">Young, 2011</xref>). <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> is praised for the extent to which it served to clear a space for the emergence of a more critically motivated, ethically charged, and openly political brand of sociology. Mills is cast as providing sociologists with a classic statement of disciplinary purpose, particularly insofar as this is understood to be inspired by a yearning for progressive social change. With the publication of this work, he is held to have refurbished sociology with a new commitment to “critical activism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532708612441768">Solis-Gadea, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, the possibility of reading <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> as a guide to action has been held up for critical debate. It is argued that, more often than not, a declaration of identification with Mills is used more as a mere license for critique than as the opening for an inquiry into how to put critical sociology into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612441768">Calhoun &amp; VanAntwerpen, 2007</xref>, pp. 382-384). Questions relating to how to apply sociology to the practical task of making more humane forms of society are sidelined in a rush to occupy a position of moral judgment. In this regard, it is suggested that Mills’s achievement lies more in the advancement of a critical attitude than a distinct mode of practice and that, as far as the latter is concerned, little progress has been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612441768">Denzin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>This article is designed as a contribution to these debates. I argue that the critical praxis that informs the development of research and writing on problems of “social suffering” demonstrates an approach to the practice of social inquiry that moves both with and beyond Mills. I contend that, generally speaking, such work is more heavily committed than Mills ever was to attending to the lived experience of personal troubles and, further, that this provides grounds for a more sociologically troubled and potentially troubling debate over the social constitution of our humanity and what might yet be done to create more humane forms of society.</p>
<p>The first section reviews the methodological problems set by <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic>. Here I suggest that, in his attempt to devise a “sociologized pragmatism,” it appears that Mills’s concern to mobilize a critical discourse on modes of ideology and structures of power and inequality led him to neglect issues of practice in favor of an emphasis on critique. I then move to outline some of the ways in which current research and writing on problems of “social suffering” might be understood to be working to recover a more pragmatic tradition of social inquiry. At the same time as this remains deeply committed to Mills’s commitment to understanding “history and biography and the relations between the two in society,” it also moves to expose the moral frustrations that are an inevitable part of the struggle to apply tools of social understanding to documents of lived experience. In this context, I argue that the difficulty of making adequate sense of the experience of human suffering encompasses the category of “the social” and the conception of people as “social beings.” Research and writing on social suffering is always set to operate in a vexed relationship with the conventions of social science. It brings volume to the moral and intellectual tensions experienced under the recognition that symbolic resources fall woefully short of providing an adequate account of the brute force of suffering in human experience. Nevertheless, this provides opportunities for social insight. Research and writing on social suffering incorporates a critical praxis that involves audiences and/or readers in the aggravated tensions between, on the one hand, social suffering as a conflicted realm of moral experience, and on the other, the struggle to make this amenable to sociological understanding.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532708612441768">
<title>Mills and Pragmatism</title>
<p>It is frequently noted that Mills drew a great deal of inspiration from the “classic” problem-focused social theories of Karl Marx and Max Weber, but for the most part, it is only those acquainted with his earliest work that bring emphasis to the extent to which he aimed to develop a “sociologized pragmatism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612441768">Delanty &amp; Strydom, 2003</xref>, p. 284). As a student Mills was heavily influenced by the philosophy as well as the social and political thought of the classical period of American pragmatism, and above all, John Dewey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612441768">Horowitz, 1964</xref>). Like Dewey, he held that we should take conflicts met in experience as the ground for social inquiry, and further, was committed to the view that knowledge developed on this basis should be evaluated in terms of its power to inform action. At the same time, however, Mills held that Dewey was naïve when it came to understanding the workings of political and economic power in society (Mills, 1964; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532708612441768">Simich &amp; Tilman, 1978</xref>). On this account, it is important to appreciate the extent to which his interest in sociology was founded upon an attempt to address “a crisis in American pragmatism,” which he diagnosed in terms of a failure to pay adequate attention to the corrosive force of capitalist interests, bourgeois consumer culture, and impersonal bureaucratic procedure on the pursuit of democratic freedoms, individual creativity, and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532708612441768">West, 1989</xref>, pp. 124-138). Accordingly, Mills held that if pragmatism was to recover its vitality and relevance to public life, it needed to operate with a more theoretically sophisticated and critically motivated account of presiding <italic>structures</italic> of power and inequality in society.</p>
<p>On this understanding, one might approach Mills’s critical sociology as dedicated to the revitalization of pragmatism. It is, however, striking to note the extent to which this is now only taken up as a matter for analysis among intellectual biographers (Horowitz, 1985; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532708612441768">Summers, 2006</xref>; Tilman, 2004). More often than not, Mills is celebrated for the critical design and force of his narrative on society, while the manner of his involvement with classical traditions of pragmatism is not identified as holding any great importance for what we make of him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612441768">Chasin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532708612441768">Scimecca, 1976</xref>). In this judgment, one might well argue that commentators are remaining faithful to the general tone and balance of Mills’s writing, for, largely speaking, the engagement with pragmatism subsequently features as a more incidental or decorative component of his later work.</p>
<p>On this account, <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> is a prime example of his later tendency to pay mere lip service to the values and methods of pragmatism while advancing a form of critical commentary in a wholly abstract vein. Here Mills encourages sociologists to build their inquiries from the conflicted experience of personal troubles, but makes no reference to, and displays no effort to engage with, the <italic>praxis</italic>, that social researchers operating within these traditions deem necessary as a means to uncover and critically dwell upon the lived realities of local social worlds. Put simply, he makes no attempt to document the personal standpoints and expressed points of view of individuals in day-to-day life. As Norman Denzin complains,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Little men (and women, elsewhere called “darling little slaves” and “suburban queens”) are Mills’s foil. He purportedly speaks to their existential traps; the lack of meaning in their lives; their failed marriages; their unemployment; the woman’s nun-like, low paying job in white collar offices; their robot like work; their drug and alcohol abuse; the fraudulent inspiration literature and popular films they watch; and the horrible, ugly cities where they live. . . . But nowhere in the pages of his work(s) do these little people and their personal troubles speak. Mills speaks for them; or he quotes others who have written about them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612441768">Denzin, 1990</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Denzin argues that neither Mills, nor those who have followed in his wake, have provided an adequate demonstration of how a politically productive and practically relevant engagement might be fashioned between the critical discourse of sociology and personal upheavals met in social context. While some have followed Mills’s “hypocritical” practice of only venturing to broker with experience through the language of theory or the discourse of cultural élites, others (like Denzin) have been inclined to retreat from the attempt to sociologically theorize the world as a consequence of being immersed in the practice of ethnography. In this regard, Denzin is morally alarmed by what he perceives to be an inherent mismatch between the cultural grammar of conventional sociological theory and the particularities of people’s experience in everyday life. Albeit for different reasons, he shares in Hannah Arendt’s suspicion that, when brought to the level of public debate too much of the lived reality of social injustice and real-life conditions of despair is “explained away” by “highly efficient talk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612441768">Arendt, 1968</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>On this account while there is no doubting the importance of Mills as an advocate of critical sociology, we should be troubled by the extent to which this serves more as an encouragement to posture than as challenge to practice. The danger here is that we fail to grasp the scale of the task that is set for those who would venture to fashion a form of critical practice that is both sociologically enlightening and practically relevant. How might it be possible to bear moral witness to the perplexities of lived experience, <italic>and also</italic> set this within a sociologically meaningful frame that allows people to acquire a portion of the knowledge required to transform the conditions of their existence? Where is “the sociological imagination” that can deliver on its “promise”? How might social understanding be fashioned as a means to inspire the practices that sustain life and enable people to relate to one another on humane terms?</p>
<p>In what follows, I outline a possible approach to the task of answering these questions that gives privileged attention to the effort to bear witness to experiences of “social suffering.” I argue that current research and writing on social suffering marks a recovery of a classical pragmatic concern to attend to the most deeply conflicted components of human experience so as to make these the means to social understanding. In these settings, practices of knowledge production are inherently unstable; one is always liable to be left with a surplus of questions relating to the moral and semantic adequacy of the symbolic representation of social life <italic>in experience</italic>. It is argued that by courting such exacerbated difficulties of understanding we are presented with unique possibilities for attending to the human social situation as such.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532708612441768">
<title>The Experience of Suffering</title>
<p>It is widely recognized that within classical traditions of American pragmatism, “experience” is a paramount concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532708612441768">Kaag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532708612441768">Kloppenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532708612441768">MacGilvray, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532708612441768">Stuhr, 1997</xref>). Both William James and John Dewey hold that human beings are thoroughly enmeshed in and subject to their experience of the world. They further emphasize that experience involves far more than a mental capacity to be consciously aware of an external environment; rather, it is constituted within human relationships and social interactions that involve the entire person in all their corporeal being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612441768">Dewey, 1929</xref>). Experience takes place in the active production of social life. It involves people “knowing how” to respond to situations and in taking actions coordinated by moral commitments and investments of moral feeling.</p>
<p>Via an appeal to and under the guidance of experience, the early pragmatists aim to improvise an approach to thinking that is involved with real-life events and pressing human concerns. In this respect, they understand themselves to be working outside mainstream traditions of Western philosophy and social science. They reject the Cartesian and Lockean dualisms that divide thinkers into camps of rationalists and empiricists. Writers such as William James, John Dewey, and Jane Addams are also highly critical of the academic complacency of those who confine their pursuit of knowledge to the ivory tower. By contrast, they stress the importance of acquiring understanding through direct association with individuals in real-life contexts, and in this regard, they advise that we should always be prepared for experience to “boil over,” to reach beyond itself and to disclose new understandings of, and ways of relating toward, ourselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612441768">James, 1904</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612441768">1907</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent times, following the much-vaunted “linguistic turn” in western philosophy, academic debates over the role of experience in social inquiry have been mired in epistemological dispute. In this context, the pragmatic appeal to experience is often portrayed as no more than a methodological strategy, and further, one that conveys a great deal of hermeneutical naivety as well as a failure to grasp the full extent to which experience is made in and through language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612441768">Bernstein, 2010</xref>, pp. 125-152). Notwithstanding the fact that critics often fail to acknowledge that figures such as Dewey aim to attend to the ways in which language serves as a means to convey and shape experience, they also inclined to portray the focus on experience as a purely scholastic consideration, as though it were a mere intellectual quibble or matter of academic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532708612441768">Putnam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532708612441768">Shields, 2004</xref>). What tends to be lost here is recognition of both the passions that drive pragmatists to engage with experience and the pains that insistently <italic>demand</italic> this of them. The category of experience is thinned out and washed clean of all issues of human value and commitment, and more importantly, it tends to be disassociated from the sufferings borne by people in real-life situations.</p>
<p>It is striking to note the extent to which the founding texts of pragmatism, when underlining their concern for experience, also recognize this as a matter conceived under the trial of suffering. Ralph Waldo Emerson’s famous essay, <italic>Experience</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612441768">1842/1983</xref>), is a reflection on the grief he suffers following the death of his five-year-old son, and in particular, his utter despair for the numbing emptiness of feeling that besets him. In this context, it is under the torment of experiencing the need to be touched more deeply by his son’s loss that he is made to reflect on his broken state of humanity and the seeming impossibility of being reconciled to much of the experience that he is made subject to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612441768">Cameron, 1986</xref>). In a similar vein, Martin Jay notes that it is while mourning the loss of family ties and friendships, and suffering a series of personal crises that are “almost suicidal in intensity,” that William James is driven to make the task of attending to “experience” the key to understanding the human condition as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532708612441768">Jay, 2005</xref>, pp. 275-277).</p>
<p>There is no doubt in the minds of many commentators that the great burden of grief carried by James, along with that of many of his associates, was gathered through the experience of the American Civil War (Faust, 2009). Indeed, Louis Menand observes that the origins of pragmatism are rooted in traumatic experiences of violence, internecine conflict, and civil strife. In its classical forms, pragmatism marks an attempt to secure an alternative vision for social and political life in the aftermath of a series of social upheavals that signaled “not just the failure of democracy, but a failure of culture and of ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532708612441768">Menand, 2001</xref>, p. x). It is part of a desperate attempt to devise, propagate, and enact a way of life in which people can relate to one another on humane terms. In their shared concern for the practicality of ideas, the early pragmatists are all engaged in a painful struggle to devise an approach to critical thinking that makes a vital difference to how people live together in society.</p>
<p>In a famous essay addressed to <italic>The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612441768">1917/1960</xref>), written at a point where the First World War appeared to be dragging modern societies into a terminal state of conflict and decline, John Dewey is particularly concerned to underline the extent to which the pragmatic engagement with experience necessarily involves a struggle with and through human suffering. He writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What experience suggests about itself is a genuinely objective world which enters into the actions and sufferings of men and undergoes modifications through their responses. . . . Experience is primarily a process of undergoing: a process of standing something; of suffering and passion, of affection, in the literal sense of these words. . . . [it is] a matter of simultaneous doings and sufferings. . . . Philosophy recovers itself when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method, cultivated by philosophers, for dealing with the problems of men. . . . To enforce the fact that the emergence of imagination and thought is relative to the connection of the sufferings of men with their doings is of itself to illuminate those sufferings and to instruct those doings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612441768">Dewey, 1917/1960</xref>, pp. 23-67)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this emphasis to the fore, perhaps it is not surprising to note that both John Dewey and William James were inclined to regard Jane Addams’ book, <italic>Democracy and Social Ethics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612441768">1902/2002</xref>), as a seminal contribution to their critical cause, particularly insofar as it documents the potential for pragmatism to serve as a practical way of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612441768">Conway, 1971</xref>, p. 173; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612441768">Haddock Siegfried, 1999</xref>). Here Addams treats the seemingly inexorable “perplexities” of people living within some of the poorest districts of Chicago as both the grounds for moral deliberation and as a resource for social understanding. In this regard, she makes clear that within communities suffering conditions of material scarcity, broken family relationships, and pronounced experiences of political alienation, the struggle to forge ties of social sympathy is fraught with intellectual frustration and, more often than not, involves participants in a great deal of emotional distress. Emphasis is brought to the great difficulties of knowing how to live and what to do in social encounters where individuals are deeply divided by structures of class, “race,” gender, and age. Insofar as it is left purely as a matter for dry intellectual debate, it is assumed that the meaning of social life can never be grasped in terms of its human consequences; rather, this requires a deliberate courting of fellow-feeling and an <italic>active</italic> concern for the plight of others. Addams works under the conviction that social experience is inherently moral in form and consequence and to deny this is tantamount to forsaking the task of engaging with the most elemental facts of human life. She holds that it is only by our attendance to and participation within the moral dilemmas of social life that we may venture to understand its effects on people. Social insight is acquired by the quality of our association with others in real-life situations. In this respect, it is always highly contingent, partial, and caught in process. We should also anticipate that it is often the case that it can only be apprehended at a personal cost.</p>
<p>As a basic point of departure, it is important to recognize the extent to which the more recent “turn” to problems of “social suffering” also marks the <italic>recovery</italic> of a form of inquiry that takes the experience of human affliction as a guide to the process of social understanding. In this regard, some are readily prepared to acknowledge a strong affinity between the passions that fire their work and those of classical traditions of pragmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612441768">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>, p. 122; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532708612441768">Kleinman, 1999</xref>, p. 360). The focus on “social suffering” is linked with a move to devise a critical praxis that attends to social life as an inherently <italic>moral</italic> experience, that is, as an enactment of substantive values that hold great consequence for persons. In this context, a particular emphasis is also placed upon the pursuit of social knowledge as a practical means to improve the conditions of human life. As Loïc Wacquant puts it, such work marks a deliberate attempt to fashion a mode of social exploration that “falls at the intersection of social science, politics and civic ethics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612441768">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>, p. 200). The actions and forms of experience that result as a consequence of this endeavor are a key concern and are taken as the grounds on which to judge its worth.</p>
<p>The focus on problems of “social suffering” also incorporates the understanding that it is where people are set within extreme conditions of adversity and are made to experience events of great personal distress, that their (broken) humanity and basic human needs are exposed to view. It is recognized that the brute force of suffering in social life can be overwhelming and that it takes place as an assault upon the core elements of an individual’s subjectivity and personhood. In this regard, researchers operate under the resolution that, to make their work relevant to the experiences that painfully inhabit and cause harm to a person, they must be prepared to engage with the task of understanding how social life contributes to, and takes its course from, many vexed problems of suffering.</p>

<title>The Critical Praxis of Social Suffering</title>
<p>The concept of “social suffering” has been used for more than 200 years as a means to underline the social causes of human misery, but it is only since the final decade of the 20th-century that it has featured as a headline issue for social science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612441768">Bourdieu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612441768">Dejours, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612441768">Kleinman, Das, &amp; Lock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532708612441768">Renault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532708612441768">Wilkinson, 2005</xref>). In this setting, “social suffering” is a generic term of reference for the lived experience of deprivation, misery, pain, and loss. Social suffering is wholly negative and is part of any social event, social condition, or social process that brings harm to human life. Where problems of social suffering are identified as a major cause of injury and distress, then researchers aim to attend to the ways in which a person’s suffering is constituted through their experience of society and culture. A focus is placed upon the extent to which social worlds are inscribed upon the bodily experience of pain. Attention is brought to the moderating force of cultural meanings and the dynamics of social interaction upon people’s symptoms of distress.</p>
<p>The gathering of interest around the topic of social suffering has come from a number of directions and is invested with a considerable range of disciplinary, analytical, political, and practical concerns. Problems of social suffering are increasingly being taken up as key issues for debate in health research, in studies of poverty and social exclusion, in efforts to document “superfluous” populations living in “underdeveloped” societies, and in attempts to chart the cultural dynamics of the politics of pity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612441768">Charlesworth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532708612441768">Kleinman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612441768">Kleinman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532708612441768">Scheper-Hughes, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532708612441768">1998</xref>). It is striking to note, however, the extent to which researchers share in the conviction that, while working to document and categorize this experience, they are made to operate at the limits of their technical capacity for understanding. It is widely held that, when set to the task of charting the parameters of social suffering, conventional practices of knowledge production are placed under an inordinate strain and are frequently found wanting.</p>
<p>Some venture to explain such difficulties as resulting from the fact that they concern problems that are all at once physical, interpersonal, political, legal, and cultural. It is argued that highly technical categories operating within narrow fields of specialist inquiry are unsuited to give expression to the combined force of the multiple conditions that give rise to social suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532708612441768">Kleinman et al., 1997</xref>, p. ix). For the sake of arriving at a technically precise account of discrete aspects of a person’s complaint, the overall quality and consequences of their experience tends to be strained away or lost from view. For example, in the case of many debilitating health problems, it is observed that a great deal of suffering takes place not only in the struggle to bear the physical burden of deterioration, injury, and disease but also in the loss of social roles and identities that an individual experiences as they are immersed in the process of adapting to their reduced state. It involves both the immediate experience of bodily affliction and the painful work of recovering (or discovering) new terms on which to relate to oneself and others. Here a considerable part of the problem of giving due acknowledgment to or providing an adequate account of the social experience of suffering is held to reside in the extent to which it should be identified as always transgressing the bounds of formal representation. As <italic>experience</italic> it is made in the damage done to an entire person in both their corporeal and social being, and where this is disaggregated for refined analysis, then too much of its reality is obscured.</p>
<p>In addition to these problems of categorization, further frustrations are raised in connection with the attempt to convey the brute force of social suffering as <italic>moral experience</italic>. In this regard, by its orientation toward abstraction and in its pursuit of clear-cut points of principle, it is held that academic discourse fails to capture an adequate sense of the anguish borne by people as they navigate a course through real-life conditions of adversity. Following the attempt to record how individuals in desperate circumstances both embody and give voice to their pains and distress, researchers are left troubled by the extent to which their dedicated frames of reference and forensic terms of expression fail to capture the overwhelming significance of experiences that visit torment and destruction upon people’s lives. In this regard, Pierre Bourdieu goes so far as to argue that the cultural “distortion” that takes place here amounts to a form of “symbolic violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612441768">Bourdieu, 1999a</xref>, p. 608), for, by this, it often appears that yet more harm is done to individuals by languages that serve to deflect attention away from the most excruciating facts of their condition and its powers of control over them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532708612441768">Das, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>It is argued that researchers have a moral obligation to expose the painful contradictions, exacerbated frustrations, and confounded meanings of social suffering as it is met in experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612441768">Das, 2007</xref>). The task of social understanding should aim to expose situations and experiences that are, as Bourdieu puts it, “<italic>difficult to describe and think about”</italic> (original emphasis) (Bourdieu, 1999b, p. 3). It calls for a “perspectivism” that involves us in the problem of making sense of “the distress caused by clashing interests, orientations and lifestyles” (p. 3). Here the emphasis that is placed on the experience of social suffering as being inherently <italic>moral</italic> is intended to underline the extent to which it involves people in “limit situations” or “borderline experiences” from which there is no escape. When people are beset by problems of social suffering, the very possibility of knowing “how to live” and “what to do” is radically called into question. Individuals are brought under a painful compulsion to think beyond and act against what is happening to them, but what holds them “in suffering” is the terrifying absence of an adequate means to do this. In the most extreme forms of suffering, all that is good, rightful, purposeful, and conducive to humanity is withheld from people. Suffering is moral experience in the raw; it exposes people to an overwhelming need for moral direction and purpose. A great part of the human suffering is constituted in a desperate and often deeply injurious search to find a positive means to live through or beyond that which is experienced as wholly, and most painfully, negative in life.</p>
<p>Under this emphasis, research and writing on social suffering not only aims to expose the multiple ways in which suffering is constituted as a sociocultural and profoundly moral experience in people’s lives, but also thereby, to question how social life is documented and treated as an “object” for public debate. Considerable efforts are made to expose the reality of society both as an enactment of substantive values and in terms of its human effects. Attention is brought to how people are <italic>made to feel</italic> by and <italic>embody</italic> the social conditions they are subject to. Bodily experiences and people’s health conditions in every sense are approached as data that expose the moral character and force of society. In this context, the sociological positivism that treats matters of moral standpoint and human feeling as “pollutants” that corrupt the possibility of us arriving at an “objective” view on “the way things are” is held to impose unnecessary and potentially harmful limits on the bounds of social understanding. In studies of social suffering, the human situation is a paramount concern and most researchers aim to do all they can to allow this to be seen and heard.</p>
<p>The search for symbolic forms of culture to make known the pains borne by people in lived experience is also part of a project to refashion the instruments of social inquiry. Here researchers are brought into debate with the troubled history and politics of modern humanitarianism and its role within the awakening of social conscience. Under the recognition that an active imagination for the suffering of others and the cultivation of sympathy are essential to the process of social understanding, a critical focus is brought to the occasions where public debates over the bounds of social justice and conditions of social life are initiated and sustained via attempts to document, describe, and visualize people’s distress and pain. In this context, it is readily acknowledged that humanitarian culture may be appropriated for ideological ends and that “the passion of compassion” may serve to cloud political debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612441768">Arendt, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612441768">Fassin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612441768">Givoni, 2011</xref>). At the same time, however, it is held that courting such hazards remains a necessary and unavoidable part of the struggle to expose the human <italic>social</italic> condition as such. The disavowal of social life that takes place under the attempt to deny passion a place within the bounds of social inquiry is identified as the greater danger here. It should also be recognized, however, that this tends to leave researchers immersed in the difficulty of understanding how moral sentiment can (or should) be allied to social enlightenment. With a focus brought to problems of social suffering, the terms of social investigation are made laden with risk.</p>
<p>It is generally the case that, when brought to a focus on social suffering, we find researchers working in great tension, and sometimes in open conflict, with received traditions of inquiry and cultures of representation. Reports on the experience of social suffering tend to be accompanied by a move to critically question the cultural and political conditions under which it is made possible for us to relate to one another as <italic>social</italic> beings and, further, the possibility of realizing more humane conditions of society in broken worlds. In most instances, the critical praxis of research and writing on social suffering tends to be consciously geared to provoke readers into questioning the moral and political adequacy of their adopted practices of knowledge production. Such work is characterized by a deliberate attempt to highlight the instances where the cultural grammar and conventions of social science fall woefully short of providing adequate account of how social life matters to people. Indeed, it is held that such carefully crafted disruptions hold the potential to serve as a means to provoke readers to engage with the struggle for human-social understanding.</p>
<p>For example, in <italic>The Weight of the World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612441768">1999</xref>) Bourdieu and colleagues invite us to attend to the ways in which, when asked to explain the misery of their lives, individuals stumble over their words and frequently lapse into silence. They underline the ways in which social suffering often eludes formal analysis, for it inheres within a welter of daily experience that resists categorization in analytically precise terms. Such work aims to highlight the sociological importance of the everyday languages that are used to register the experience of harm, for among other things these are held to be etched by the social and cultural forces that constitute people’s distress (Bourdieu, 1999b). Accordingly, most of the text is devoted to documenting how people explain their situation <italic>in their own words</italic>.</p>
<p>This manner of working has been denounced by some as an impoverished form of social science that is inclined to make overblown claims for its value as a document of social life. For example, Angela McRobbie argues that Bourdieu and his colleagues are “compromised by their own methodologies of intimacy and empathy” on the grounds that these serve to crowd out their text with a “proliferation of voices” to a point where problems of sociological interpretation are treated as a sideline issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532708612441768">McRobbie, 2002</xref>, pp. 131-133). Beyond this, she contends that a great deal of their material is “sociologically banal” or “mere reportage of degrees of misfortune” and that the emotive tone in which it is cast serves more to encourage a response of apathy than one of outrage. McRobbie accuses Bourdieu of both exploiting his respondents for their grief and of investing too much hope in the possibility of using his interviews as a means to generate the social resources and political resolve to change people’s lives for the better (pp. 131-133).</p>
<p>It may well be the case that books such as <italic>The Weight of the World</italic> fall short of delivering the kind of “social pedagogy” that Bourdieu hopes for; however, opponents such as McRobbie duck the challenge that is hereby issued to academic sociology, that is, to reflect upon the ways in which its privileged methods of knowledge production are ill-suited to reveal how large numbers of people are made to experience their lives. McRobbie seems to be entirely unconcerned to tackle this matter. In her rush to denounce Bourdieu with the charge that he is caught up in a project of sociological bad faith, she fails to acknowledge that in his concluding essay on “Understanding,” Bourdieu himself moves to make clear that he has deliberately courted such accusations by taking “the risk of writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612441768">Bourdieu, 1999a</xref>, pp. 621-626). He aims to raise the issue of how the “sociological point of view” is made possible and, further, what kind of social understanding and apprehension of truth is thereby brought within our reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612441768">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>, p. 1992). The possibility that a great deal of sociology operates from a position of bad faith is precisely the issue that Bourdieu would raise up for debate. In this regard, he intends to provoke his readers into questioning how a substantial part of social life, particularly in terms of the ways it is enacted and experienced by individuals trapped in poverty, is blocked from view by the formality of sociological theories and methods.</p>
<p>Similarly, by documenting the expression of emotions such as “rage, sorrow, fright, pining, desire for goods, jealousy, and envy” among the poor of Punata, a valley town near to the city of Cochabamba in Bolivia, Maria Tapias aims to expose the ways in which social conflicts, material hardship, and “failed sociality” are embodied by mothers and how this in turn contributes to their ill health as well as that of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532708612441768">Tapias, 2006</xref>). By tracing the connection between the distress of high emotions and illnesses experienced by breastfeeding infants, she works to explain how economic conditions both infuse women’s bodies and cause damage to the mother–infant relationship. In this context, Tapias exposes the embodiment of politicoeconomic structures that give rise to social suffering both within people and in their most intimate associations with and commitments to others.</p>
<p>Here we are encouraged to move beyond a mere noting of the overall scale and distribution of social problems in technical terms so as to engage with apprehending how these take place in human experience. We are challenged to involve ourselves in the task of understanding how social life is encountered in experience, and further, how this is borne emotionally and made a moral reality. Of course, this is also accompanied by the danger that such “up close and personal” documents of life are left performing no more than an “ornamental function” in the wider reporting of social adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612441768">Das, 1995</xref>). It may even be the case that they serve more to enact a mere play on feeling than to inspire concerted actions on behalf of the pursuit of social justice. At the same time, however, there is also the possibility that they work to provoke critical debate over the moral adequacy of the forms and levels of social understanding that are available to us, and more importantly, the moral practices that result from this.</p>

<title>Conclusion: With and Beyond Mills</title>
<p>In almost every instance, research and writing on social suffering aims to document modes of interpersonal distress so as to present the human <italic>social</italic> condition and its harmful consequences for public debate. The pain and distress borne by people in their inner lives and immediate relationships with others are held to expose the moral textures of society. The experience of human suffering is taken as a setting in which people are painfully disposed to grasp the disciplinary force of powerful social structures upon their lives. In such contexts, social researchers are cast in the role of enabling a form of cultural understanding to take place whereby society is made an object for moral inquiry and political debate. In this respect, they operate within a tradition of social research that mobilizes a critical outlook that C. Wright Mills distinguished in terms of “the sociological imagination.”</p>
<p>It may be argued that <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> has always foundered on its vision and that what Mills achieved by way of critical posture was undermined by his failure to produce a viable model of methodological practice. A more charitable view holds that he was alert to this problem, but when writing this text had only just embarked on a new project to redefine the goals of social science. It is argued that as a point of departure Mills held that we should be striving to set in motion a “politics of culture” that works to shape reason and “modes of sensibility” so that people can be positioned to relate to their experience of the world with a new set of political coordinates and value orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532708612441768">Sawchuk, 2001</xref>). Although he never lived to see through the publication of his major work on <italic>The Cultural Apparatus</italic>, it is suggested that we should read <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> as an early attempt to provide a new cultural guide to experience, one that was designed to draw debate to the issue of how “the humanization of man in society” could be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532708612441768">Mills, 1963</xref>, p. 407). At the same time as Mills was convinced that the ability to critically analyze ourselves in social terms should be cultivated as “a common denominator of our general cultural life,” he had yet to arrive on a settled point of view on how this could be set into practice. He was from the outset, however, firmly committed to clearing a critical space for social researchers to question how their roles and activities might be fashioned to this end. In this sense, the methodological frustrations left in the wake of his writing <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> can be taken as a deliberate provocation on his part. The morality, politics, and practicability of social inquiry are precisely the issues that he would raise up for debate.</p>
<p>While working to address many contrasting types of social problem and with different audiences in mind, studies of social suffering tend to share in a common protest. It is argued that conventions of social research and favored modes of social documentation <italic>remain</italic> ill-equipped to convey how social life takes place in experience and, further, that there are many occasions where this failure serves to exacerbate problems human suffering. A collective failure to acknowledge and attend to what happens to people within the experience of social suffering is held to obstruct the possibility of initiating social practices to promote effective care for others.</p>
<p>It is the modes of critical praxis that emerge in response to this failure that I have profiled for further inquiry and debate here. In most instances, by venturing to document the experience of social suffering, researchers are made deeply troubled by the extent to which their script fails to capture an adequate sense of why and how life matters to people. While struggling to find words and images to convey the human social situation in contexts of extreme adversity, they also work to direct readers to the brute force of experiences <italic>beyond</italic> their text. Accordingly, writers such as Pierre Bourdieu would have us understand that his research and writing only goes so far as to motion us toward the realities of social experience. Reading sociology is a bystander exercise; it falls way short of providing us with an effective encounter with individuals in real-life contexts. Under the attempt to document experiences of social suffering, Bourdieu takes the further step of exposing us to the failings of his text. He deliberately works to bring volume to the destabilizing tensions that arise under the attempt to contain the lived meanings of human experience within the strictures of social science. In this regard, it is by having us dwell upon the extent to which the experience of social life eludes his sociology that, paradoxically, Bourdieu aims to make us more attentive toward its presence and force in people’s lives.</p>
<p>The effort made to involve people in coproducing authoritative scripts of social life is part of a critical praxis that not only aims to provide insight into how people respond to and feel about their social condition, but also, to subvert disciplinary conventions that, for the sake of formality, devalue human experience. Having us attend to how people convey their experience in their own words and having us take notice of how this is embodied is deemed vital both for seeing how “the social” is infused within people’s lives and for grasping how much more there is to social life than is captured by sociological writing.</p>
<p>In the struggle to provide an adequate account of the causes and consequences of human suffering, these tensions and discrepancies are aggravated to an extreme pitch. In this setting, the quest for social empathy and understanding involves far more than a mere plea for recognition; rather, it concerns a desperate search for concerted actions to deliver care, recovery, and healing. Here the “the sociological imagination” is not only cast in the role of enabling insight into the human <italic>social</italic> condition as such but is also caught up in a <italic>moral</italic> responsibility to attend to people’s social subjectivity and how this can be made to change. Indeed, moral engagement in all its real-life perplexities, compromises, and difficulties is held to be an indispensable component of the quest for social understanding.</p>
