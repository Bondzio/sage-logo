<abstract>
<p>This article presents preliminary findings from use of a novel computer program that implements an evidence-based psychological intervention to treat depression based on behavioral activation (BA) therapy. The program is titled “Building a Meaningful Life Through Behavioral Activation”. The findings derive from an open trial with moderate to severely depressed individuals (<italic>N</italic> = 15) in an Intention to Treat sample. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses revealed significant change over time on Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition (BDI-II) scores, Revised Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, and significant contribution to BDI-II score variance by participant age over time, change over time in negative automatic thoughts, and change over time in BA scores. Piecewise HLM analyses revealed that significant change over time was associated uniquely with active treatment and not during 3 weeks of baseline measurement. In addition to treatment-associated significant change on all dependent measures over time, effect sizes were in the moderate to large range. Limitations are small sample size, nonrandomized control, research-recruited patients instead of purely treatment-seeking patients, possible rating bias by independent assessors who had knowledge that participants had received active treatment in this open trial, and the influence of additional services received in the post acute-treatment phase by some participants could have contributed to maintenance of gains reported for that period.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Depression is recognized worldwide as a leading cause of disability and reduction of quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445512455051">Kessler et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0145445512455051">World Health Organization, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0145445512455051">2009</xref>). Yet, there are well-researched and effective treatments now in existence and under continuing development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512455051">Chambless et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512455051">Hollon &amp; Ponniah, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512455051">Hollon, Thase, &amp; Markowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0145445512455051">Sherbourne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0145445512455051">Wells et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0145445512455051">Westen &amp; Morrison, 2001</xref>). There remain insufficient and an inadequate distribution of trained professionals and other mental health resources to implement these interventions in a manner that is responsive to need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0145445512455051">Saxena, Thornicroft, Knapp, &amp; Whiteford, 2007</xref>). Due to the repeated observation that more than half of the cases of depression are first seen in primary care practices (PCPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0145445512455051">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0145445512455051">Williams et al., 1999</xref>), recent emphasis has been on the treatment of depression in these settings. Stepped care models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0145445512455051">Scogin, Hanson, &amp; Welsh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0145445512455051">Van Straten, Seekles, van’t Veer-Tazelaar, Beekman, &amp; Cuijpers, 2010</xref>), collaborative care models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512455051">Hunketer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512455051">Katon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0145445512455051">Simon, 2006</xref>), and care managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512455051">Dickinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0145445512455051">Nutting et al., 2008</xref>) are but a few of the options that have been explored as a partial solution to serving depressed individuals in PCP settings. Other options involve the use of nonspecialists in the delivery of depression therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512455051">Ekers, Richards, McMillan, Bland, &amp; Gilbody, 2011</xref>), use of telephone-assisted therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145445512455051">Ludman, Simon, Tutty, &amp; Von Korff, 2007</xref>), telehealth delivery of depression treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0145445512455051">Reed, McLaughlin, &amp; Milholland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0145445512455051">Swinton, Robinson, &amp; Bischoff, 2009</xref>), and computer-based and/or Internet delivery of depression intervention, although the latter have been less prominent in U.S. health care than in Europe and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145445512455051">Marks, Cavanagh, &amp; Gega, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0145445512455051">Proudfoot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0145445512455051">J. H. Wright, 2008</xref>). Still more recently, a single-session treatment model of depression treatment showed promise in depression treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512455051">Gawrysiak, Nicholas, &amp; Hopko, 2009</xref>). What is clear is that “the shortage of transportable, efficacious treatments is widely recognized to be an important factor among the multiple elements contributing to the challenges of adequate care for depressed patients” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512455051">Dimidjian, Barrera, Martell, Munoz, &amp; Lewinsohn, 2011</xref>, p. 3).</p>

<title>Current Project Development</title>
<p>In this article, we describe the outcomes from an initial open trial of a novel computer-based delivery of depression treatment utilizing behavioral activation (BA) therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512455051">Dimidjian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512455051">Hopko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson, Martell, &amp; Dimidjian, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512455051">Kanter, Santiago-Rivera, Rusch, Busch, &amp; West, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512455051">Lejuez, Hopko, &amp; Hopko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145445512455051">Martel, Addis, &amp; Jacobson, 2001</xref>). This project was the outgrowth of collaboration between local and state level health care policy makers, a private health care foundation, the technology offices of two academic institutions, a clinical research team with expertise in BA research, training, and therapy, along with production experts in videography, media design, and computer programming. It took place between 2005 and 2008. From a health policy perspective, there was recognition that the demand for depression treatment outstrips affordable, accessible, and evidence-based intervention. The clinician-research members of this collaboration put forth the proposition that a technological solution might assist in meeting the demand. This was based in part on the relative successful development of computerized interventions already existing in Europe and Australia (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512455051">Christensen, Griffiths, &amp; Jorm, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0145445512455051">Proudfoot et al., 2004</xref>). An early step taken by this group was to conduct a pilot study of an alternative computerized treatment for depression/anxiety that is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and developed in the United Kingdom. This was tested with a group of Medicaid eligible, public mental health clients in two Midwestern cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0145445512455051">Spates &amp; Ramesh, 2012</xref>). Selected barriers included the extensive emphasis on cognitive change, the cultural specific language idioms, and the extended time taken by this sample (low socioeconomic status [SES]) for session completion, and led the group to move ahead with development of a BA computer treatment program. The existing evidence supporting BA was strong enough in 2006 to warrant adoption of this approach, and an early meta-analytic review further supported this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0145445512455051">Spates, Pagoto, &amp; Kalata, 2006</xref>). Although there existed several models of BA at the time this decision was made, the project proceeded along lines consistent with prior research and clinical work by the clinician-research team members. In addition, a review of several contemporaneous treatment manuals and/or protocols informed selected features of the program’s content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512455051">Addis &amp; Martell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512455051">Cullen, Spates, Pagoto, &amp; Doran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512455051">Lejuez et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145445512455051">Martel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0145445512455051">Porter, Spates, &amp; Smitham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0145445512455051">T.

<title>Brief Review of BA Models</title>
<p>BA has been described as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>A structured, brief psychotherapeutic approach that aims to (a) increase engagement in adaptive activities (which often are those associated with the experience of pleasure or mastery), (b) decrease engagement in activities that maintain depression or increase risk for depression, and (c) solve problems that limit access to reward or that maintain or increase aversive control. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512455051">Dimidjian et al., 2011</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reader is referred, for slightly varying definitions, to citations in any of the referenced primary or meta-analytic investigations included in this article. The BA model has its roots in the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512455051">Lewinsohn (1974)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512455051">Ferster (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512455051">Beck (1967)</xref>, and others. In a pivotal dismantling study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al. (1996)</xref> demonstrated that BA was as effective as the full cognitive therapy (CT) protocol in alleviating symptoms of depression, and in changing maladaptive cognitions. Behavior therapy is one of three well-established treatments for depressive disorders. BA as a form of behavior therapy is a specific approach to treatment. Early versions of BA focused primarily on encouraging patients to engage in activities that were presumed to be pleasant, such as taking a walk or having dinner with a friend. A number of more nuanced, contemporary variations of BA have since developed, each of which brings some unique aspects, although most include a few common features (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2010</xref>, for a more detailed review of four variants of BA). First, all versions of BA include some type of scheduling of various daily activities that bear a functional relationship to the symptoms of depression. These activities are designed or selected to have a number of effects, including evoking a sense of mastery and/or pleasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>), disrupting patterns of avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>), regulating the daily routines of the individual in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>), and/or helping the individual to behave in a way that is more consistent with personal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512455051">Lejuez et al., 2001</xref>). Second, all versions of BA emphasize the importance of behaving with respect to scheduled and unscheduled daily activities, regardless of one’s mood or momentary desire to engage in these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>). BA is based on the premise that to feel differently, it is important to behave differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>). Most contemporary BA approaches also include supplemental protocol components that target specific symptom-maintaining or exacerbating factors for those seeking treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445512455051">Lewinsohn, Sullivan, &amp; Grosscup, 1980</xref>). Such components have included, among others, training in assertiveness, social skills, relaxation, time management, behavioral contracting, problem solving, goal setting, distraction from distressing thoughts, and implementation of graded task assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512455051">Lejuez et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445512455051">Lewinsohn et al., 1980</xref>). Although proponents of the various models emphasize commonalities and unique attributes, to date, no dismantling studies have examined the necessary and sufficient features to provide a sound empirical underpinning to distinguish the specific outcome effect(s) of these constituent elements. Yet, meta-analytic reviews clearly support the combined packages that comprise BA as a stand-alone efficacious intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512455051">Cuijpers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0145445512455051">Mazzucchelli et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145445512455051">
<title>The Evidence for BA</title>
<p>Although numerous smaller BA treatment outcome trials were conducted subsequent to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al. (1996)</xref> study, the next large-scale and well-executed investigation of the efficacy of BA was conducted by Dimidjian and colleagues in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512455051">2006</xref>. A total of 241 adults with major depressive disorder were randomized to one of four conditions: BA, CT, antidepressant medication (ADM), or pill placebo (PLA). The BA condition involved an expanded version of the BA protocol followed in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al. (1996)</xref> and included additional components to address avoidance behaviors, regularized routines, and rumination. The CT condition targeted behavioral dysfunction, situation-specific negative thinking and cognitive distortions, and underlying maladaptive cognitive schemas. The ADM condition entailed ADM administered under triple-blind conditions for the first 8 weeks of the study and single-blind conditions for the remaining 8 weeks of acute treatment. In this condition, participants saw a pharmacotherapist on a weekly basis for the first 4 weeks of treatment and then on a biweekly basis for the remainder of the acute-treatment phase. As with the ADM condition, the PLA condition entailed the use of a PLA administered under triple-blind conditions for the first 8 weeks of treatment. After 8 weeks, participants in the PLA condition were allowed to select any of the active treatments provided in the study. Of the 241 individuals randomized to treatment, 172 were treatment completers. The attrition rate was significantly higher in the ADM condition, in comparison with the BA and CT conditions. Significant symptom improvement among “low-severity” participants on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) was observed across all active treatment conditions, with no differences between groups. Among “high-severity” participants, BA and ADM significantly outperformed CT. Moreover, BA led to greater remission rates and lower attrition rates than ADM. Data from this study suggested that BA is a more efficacious treatment than CT for more severely depressed individuals. This was further supported in a reanalysis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512455051">Dimidjian et al. (2006)</xref> data conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512455051">Coffman, Martell, Dimidjian, Gallop, and Hollon (2007)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512455051">Coffman et al. (2007)</xref> examined data from a subset of individuals randomized to the CT condition who had an extreme nonresponse to CT. Common characteristics among these individuals included longstanding depression symptoms, significant functional impairment, and difficulties with primary support groups. Individuals with similar characteristics assigned to the BA condition did not experience this extreme nonresponse to BA therapy. To this end, BA may be particularly helpful for individuals who endorse severe levels of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Subsequent research confirmed these initial findings and established BA as a stand-alone efficacious treatment for depression. BA is thought to comprise a more efficient intervention and possibly a more parsimonious conceptual basis underpinning the efficacy of CT for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512455051">Jacobson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445512455051">Kanter, Callaghan, Landes, Busch, &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>). Indeed, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) vision statement of 2006 suggested BA as a promising and possibly more efficient intervention for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0145445512455051">NIMH, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although not available at the time of the decision to proceed with development of the present project, another recently well-executed, large-scale randomized control trial (RCT) of BA compared with problem solving therapy (PST) among cancer patients was completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512455051">Hopko et al., 2011</xref>). Both treatments showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in depression that were maintained over a 1-year posttreatment period.</p>

<sec id="section5-0145445512455051">
<title>Hypotheses of the Present Project</title>
<p>Findings from most of the investigations just cited and others, along with our own research and clinical experience, supported the effort at adapting BA for development as a computer-delivered intervention. We therefore developed “Building a Meaningful Life through Behavioral Activation” (BAML) to implement BA in an interactive computer program with rich video content that utilizes actual BA therapists, professional actors as patient exemplars, assigned out-of-session work, and weekly monitoring of depression symptoms. In this article, we present initial findings from an evaluation of this program with a community sample of depressed adults. We believe that as an initial examination of this novel BA delivery system, the open trial reflects an appropriately staged strategy as it preceded a currently ongoing RCT that was informed by findings from this pilot investigation. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that following (a) a 3-week stable baseline of measured depression symptoms, (b) BAML would be associated with a significant reduction of depression symptoms (measured by the Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition [BDI-II] and Revised Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [RHDRS]) during the acute 10-week treatment phase, (c) BAML acute-treatment effects would be maintained over a 6-month follow-up evaluation, and (d) process measures consisting of (decreases in) negative automatic thoughts and (increases in) activation (as measured by the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire [ATQ] and Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale–Activation subscale [BADS-AC], respectively) would account for significant variation in depression symptoms over time. All hypotheses were framed by previous empirical investigations of face-to-face delivery of BA therapy. The open trial was conducted between June 2009 and April 2011.</p>

<p>Of the 57 potential participants who contacted the project expressing interest, 32 declined participation before beginning treatment, 5 did not qualify due to BDI-II scores below criterion, 2 did not qualify due to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, 2 had an active substance abuse disorder, and 1 had an active psychotic disorder. In all, 15 qualified and were enrolled in the study. Of these 15 participants, 3 dropped out before completing Session 5, which is considered a minimum dose of BAML-delivered BA therapy. Completers were those who attended five sessions (<italic>n</italic> = 12) of BAML, and “maximal completers” were those who completed all 10 sessions (<italic>n</italic> = 8). “Completers” were exposed to content that included psychoeducation, the core BA principles, application of BA skills to daily activity monitoring, and the selection and scheduling of pleasant and values-driven activities as part of daily routine. They also received, at Session 5, a host-narrator-presented full review and knowledge test about previously presented program content. If they only completed the program up to Session 5, they were not exposed to a series of planned interactive mini-lessons provided by BAML in Sessions 6 to 10. Data from the 15 individuals who qualified are included in the Intention to Treat (ITT) analyses presented here. This 20% attrition rate compares with other recently reported BA-relevant treatment studies in the following fashion: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2010</xref>—40% attrition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512455051">Cullen et al., 2006</xref>—32% attrition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512455051">Pagoto et al., 2008</xref>—28% attrition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512455051">Dimidjian et al., 2006</xref>—16% attrition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0145445512455051">Proudfoot et al., 2004</xref>—46% attrition (Beating the Blues© Computer treatment); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512455051">Hopko et al., 2011</xref>—19%.

<title>Screening</title>
<p>Participants were included if they had a score of 18 or higher on the BDI-II across two pretreatment screenings over a 2-week interval. In addition, they met criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive or dysthymic disorder based on the results of a Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), and received a score of 10 or higher on the RHDRS. The SCID-I and the RHDRS were administered and scored by trained independent assessors during a second comprehensive screening at Week 2. SCID assessors were graduate level students in clinical psychology who had at least 2 years of supervised clinical experience and APA-approved curricular exposure in diagnosis and assessment as well as evidence-based interventions. They were specifically trained for this study by a fully licensed clinical psychologist using video, practice, and supervised administrations. In the present study, there was no attempt to evaluate the interrater reliability of the SCID administrations, although all administrations were supervised by licensed clinical psychologists with more than 35 years of experience with 25 years of that time utilizing and training doctoral students in the use of the SCID in both practice and research contexts. In addition, the fact that this was an open trial also means that SCID assessors knew that participants had been treated at the time of subsequent assessments, and this may have introduced a source of bias in the SCID as well as RHDRS ratings. We used 18 as the cutoff for the BDI-II to assure inclusion of potential participants at the upper end of mild and low end of moderate depression as per recommended classification for that inventory and to be sensitive to its margin of error in a way that favored inclusion. See below for a brief discussion of how this restriction on inclusion impacted reliability estimates for the present sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145445512455051">
<title>Exclusion</title>
<p>Potential participants were excluded if they met criteria for bipolar disorder (psychotic disorder, active substance abuse, self-reported previous diagnosis of mental retardation, and/or dementia during the pretreatment assessment phase of the study). Mental retardation was determined informally by a negative response to the inquiry, “Have you ever been diagnosed with mental retardation in your lifetime?” along with a judgment rendered based on the participant’s ability to read the informed consent satisfactorily, which was tailored to a sixth-grade reading level. In addition, potential participants were excluded if they currently received psychotherapy services for depression, if they became suicidal during any stage of treatment, or if they had been taking any antidepressants for less than 8 weeks. Participants were asked not to engage in psychotherapy as a condition for enrolling in the study. They were asked at each screening, at posttreatment, and at each follow-up assessment whether they engaged in any intervention (from a list of possibilities) for depression outside of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145445512455051">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>All assessment and treatment sessions were conducted in laboratory therapy rooms on the campus of a large Midwestern University. The rooms were equipped with a table on which was located a Lenovo© computer workstation with a Windows XP (SP3)© operating system, and a USB connected laser printer. The room contained an additional chair for use by the BAML supervisor when needed. The area was quiet and free of distraction, and a white noise generator was available if it was needed to mute any possible distracting outside noises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145445512455051">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>The treatment was a server or workstation-based interactive video computer program, titled <italic>Building a Meaningful Life through Behavioral Activation</italic> (BAML). All participant data collected by the program resided on the workstation to which it was input or on a local server. The substantive content of the computer program was developed by the senior author along with another BA expert (Dr. Amy Naugle) and in consultation with an expert consultant (Dr. Jenifer Cullen), all of whom had been trained, conducted research, contributed to the professional literature, and trained others in BA. In addition, the development team relied heavily on the contemporary treatment manuals by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145445512455051">Martel et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512455051">Addis and Martell (2004)</xref> as central organizing content for therapists, as well as BA protocol content from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512455051">Cullen et al.

Production was accomplished with a team consisting of video production experts and computer programmers aided by an instructional design consultant. The foci of the initial five sessions included psychoeducation about depression and depression treatment through the use of BA, values clarification and values-behavior consistency, functional assessment, in-session and homework assignments that focused on establishing an activity schedule, tracking behaviors daily, how behaviors affect mood, assignments pertaining to changing behaviors to reflect personal values, and information about practicing values-consistent behaviors such that they become routine. The program incorporated professional actors as patient exemplars who demonstrated selected features of both depression and BA therapy implementation. A hostess-narrator provided session learning objectives at the opening and session summaries at the end of each session, including a review of homework assignments provided by therapists during each treatment session. The program incorporated a session-by-session measure of depression symptoms that are charted for ease of progress visualization by participants during each session. Session 5 included a comprehensive assessment to evaluate whether participants had acquired sufficient knowledge to progress to the next five sessions or if remediation was warranted. Participants who completed Session 5 were deemed, by program design, to have achieved the basic core of BA therapy with the remaining sessions devoted mainly to unique applications to troubling situations that may have been present, as assessed during Session 5. The program utilized an algorithm that branched to earlier sessions when remedial learning objectives needed to be met based on scores obtained in Session 5. The remaining five sessions consisted of a series of interactive mini-lessons that exposed participants to instructions on specific skill sets such as how to increase adaptive or constructive activities, manage anger, communicate more effectively with others, engage in relaxation techniques, set and achieve goals, break down large tasks, achieve more routine and restful sleep patterns, and apply for jobs. Although most mini-lessons were drawn from typical BA content, several were added based on clinical experience of the developers in working with depressed individuals, that is, anger management and sleep hygiene. Mini-lessons were prioritized based on the comprehensive assessment of participant needs during Session 5. Those content areas showing greatest need based on item score sampling across all mini-lesson options (16 in total) were given highest priority and presented earlier and those with lower scores presented later. During assessment for mini-lesson assignment, participants responded to questions concerning the degree of applicability of multiple statements indicating present difficulties in content areas addressed by the full range of mini-lessons, as well as assessed for their knowledge concerning BA principles. During the version of BAML used in this research, participants could have been exposed to mini-lesson content that was not highly prioritized if they completed the full 10 sessions. Most highly prioritized content was presented by Session 8 on average. Future upgrades to the program will eliminate the need for participants to complete content that has very low prioritization. Summary information on session-by-session content can be obtained from the authors on request.</p>
<p>All sessions required active participation via interaction with the computer through response input to questions, assessments, and BA-content-related probes. BAML provided response contingent feedback based on participant input regarding their understanding of presented materials, homework completion, and apparent confusion during sessions, and under some conditions, staff intervention was prompted with further program progress delayed until the conclusion of such intervention, and the program was reactivated by the staff supervisor, that is, suicidal endorsement. Sessions were overseen by a trained BAML treatment supervisor, who, although not present in the room, was immediately accessible by participants whenever needed. BAML supervisors were graduate students in clinical or counseling psychology or trained senior undergraduate students in psychology. All staff supervisors were under supervision by a licensed clinical psychologist throughout the study.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Symptoms of depression were tracked throughout the present study through a variety of measures outside the depression scale incorporated within the computer program. The BDI-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512455051">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) was administered to participants during two pretreatment screening assessments 1-week apart, prior to each treatment session, and at all posttreatment assessment times (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). The BDI-II is a 21-item measure that assesses for symptoms of depression, comparable with the symptoms described in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The items are summed to yield a total score, with scores between 0 and 13 suggesting minimal levels of depression, 14 to 19 suggesting mild levels of depression, 20 to 28 suggesting moderate levels of depression, and 29 to 63 suggesting severe levels of depression. The BDI-II has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity and demonstrates moderately high correlations with the Revised Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (RHRSD), the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the SCL-90-R Depression subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512455051">Beck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0145445512455051">Steer, Ball, Ranieri, &amp; Beck, 1997</xref>). The BDI-II is the primary dependent measure reported in this article. The internal consistency for this measure was evaluated with Cronbach’s alpha and found to be .71 in the present investigation. Although within the acceptable range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0145445512455051">Nunnally, 1978</xref>), this alpha index is somewhat lower than is customary for many investigations that have used the BDI-II. Internal consistency reliability is sample dependent and, in the present study, was partially a function of the restricted range of scores imposed by our exclusion of participants who did not score at least 18 in the screening phase. This eliminated many items ratings (reduced heterogeneity), particularly those at the lower end of potential item ratings on the BDI-II. “Generally speaking, other things being equal, measurement reliability would be higher for a group that is heterogeneous with regard to the trait being measured than for another group that is more homogenous” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0145445512455051">Yin &amp; Fan, 2000</xref>, p. 205). In turn, the item variances were smaller, leading to the lower computed alpha coefficient. The reader is referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0145445512455051">Wiberg and Sundström (2009)</xref> for a general discussion of this issue, and to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0145445512455051">Yin and Fan (2000)</xref> for a specific treatment of range restriction and internal consistency as applied to the BDI-II. Applying a standard correction formula for range restricted internal consistency estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0145445512455051">Wiberg &amp; Sundström, 2009</xref>); for illustrative purposes, the adjusted reliability estimate for the present study is .88 for the BDI-II.</p>
<p>The SCID-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512455051">First, Gibbon, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref> is a semistructured interview used to diagnose major <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorders. The SCID-I was administered by an independent assessor during the second pretreatment assessment and during each posttreatment assessment. The SCID-I consists of six major modules, including mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, substance use disorders, and anxiety and other disorders. The reliability of the SCID has been adequately demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0145445512455051">Segal, Hersen, &amp; Van Hasselt, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The ATQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512455051">Hollon &amp; Kendall, 1980</xref>) is a self-report measure that assesses the frequency of common negative automatic thoughts over the course of the previous week. The ATQ was administered to participants as part of the second pretreatment assessment, prior to each treatment session, and as part of all posttreatment follow-up assessments. The ATQ consists of 30 items, for which participants are asked to use a 5-point, Likert-type scale to rate frequency of negative automatic thoughts. These items are then summed to yield a total score, with higher scores indicating more frequent occurrences of negative automatic thoughts. The ATQ demonstrates high internal reliability and a strong correlation with therapist ratings of depression and commonly utilized self-report measures of depression (e.g., BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512455051">Deardorff, Hopkins, &amp; Finch, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512455051">Dobson &amp; Breiter, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512455051">Harrell &amp; Ryon, 1983</xref>). Furthermore, the ATQ demonstrates a strong negative correlation with the BADS-Activation subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2007</xref>). The internal consistency of this measure was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha and found to be .88 in the present study.</p>
<p>The RHRSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0145445512455051">Warren, 1994</xref>) is a clinician-rating scale that is designed for completion after a clinical interview. It provides a quantitative measure of the clinician’s judgment of a patient’s depression symptom and the impact of these symptoms on the patient’s everyday functioning. It was completed by the independently trained assessors who lacked knowledge of the degree to which participants had participated in treatment, although they were aware that this work was in association with a depression treatment project. The RHRSD was completed after the second pretreatment assessment, and at each posttreatment and follow-up assessment. The RHRSD consists of 22 items, 17 of which are scored. Of these items, 9 are rated on a 5-point scale, from 0 to 4, and 8 of these items are rated on a 3-point scale, from 0 to 3. These scores are then summed to yield a total score. Scores below 6 suggest that the individual is in the nondepressed range. Scores between 7 and 17 suggest that the individual is experiencing mild levels of depression. Scores between 18 and 24 suggest that the individual is experiencing moderate levels of depression, and scores above 25 suggest that the individual is experiencing severe levels of depression. The RHRSD displayed adequate reliability (α = .79) in the original verification sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0145445512455051">Warren, 1994</xref>) and has a mean correlation of .67 with a wide variety of other measures of symptoms of depression, which demonstrates acceptable concurrent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512455051">Burnett, 1998</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha computed for this measure in the present study was .70. This alpha coefficient, like that for the BDI-II, is within the acceptable range, although lower than most reported coefficients for this measure in unrestricted samples. The same discussion applies here as above for the BDI-II.</p>
<p>The Quality of Life Scale (QoLS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512455051">Flanagan, 1978</xref>) is a self-report measure that assesses six areas related to quality of life, including material and physical well-being; relationships with other people; social, community, and civic activities; personal development and fulfillment; recreation; and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512455051">Burckhardt &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>). The QoLS was administered to participants as part of the second pretreatment assessment, during the posttreatment, and at each follow-up assessment. The QoLS consists of 16 items, each rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 7. The items are summed to yield a total score, with higher scores suggesting higher quality of life. The psychometric properties of the QoLS have been studied and suggest that it demonstrates adequate reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512455051">Burckhardt &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>). The internal consistency of this measure was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha and found to range between .82 and .92 across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512455051">Burckhardt &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The BADS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512455051">Kanter, Rusch, Busch, &amp; Sedivy, 2009</xref>) is a 25-item self-report scale developed to assess avoidance and activation behaviors comprising intervention targets in BA therapy for depression. Ratings on each item ranges from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>completely</italic>), with total scores between 0 and 175. Higher scores reflect greater overall levels of “activation.” The BADS also consists of four subscales: activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. BADS has shown strong psychometric properties across a variety of clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2009</xref>). The BADS was administered at each session in the present study during acute treatment and all follow-up evaluations. Internal consistency of this measure overall was .87 in the present study. The BADS-Activation subscale was of greatest interest in the present study.</p>
<p>Finally, the Consumer Satisfaction Survey consisted of a 23-item questionnaire, with response options ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), with higher scores representing greater degrees of consumer satisfaction. This measure was completed at posttreatment evaluation and was developed for this study but adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0145445512455051">McMurty and Hudson (2007</xref>; described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512455051">Fischer &amp; Corcoran, 2007</xref>). Its psychometric properties have not been studied as of this date.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Prospective participants called the Anxiety Disorders Laboratory telephone and left messages requesting to be contacted with further information regarding the present study. A research assistant returned the telephone calls and utilized a phone script to describe the research study. Those who indicated interest in participating were scheduled for an initial screening assessment. At this first pretreatment assessment, the BDI-II was administered to determine whether the person met criterion for inclusion with respect to depression symptomology. Those who qualified were scheduled for more extensive pretreatment evaluation 1 week later, including a retake of the BDI-II with a continuing score of at least 18 or higher, the SCID-I, and the RHDRS. Potential participants were informed at Pretreatment Assessment 2 if they qualified or not. Those who qualified were scheduled for the initial treatment session.</p>
<p>Participants began treatment 1 week after the second prescreening assessment. At each session, participants were greeted by a BAML supervisor, accompanied to the treatment room, and oriented to the computer workstation. They completed several paper-and-pencil assessments, including the BDI-II, the BADS, and the ATQ. Suicidality was monitored through a session-by-session check of the BDI-II–Item 9, and elevated suicide risk was managed according to a predetermined protocol that assured further staff evaluation and intervention if necessary. BAML treatment took place with the participant left alone in the therapy room to complete their session through interaction with the computer. Participants notified the BAML supervisor on completion of each session, who then reviewed a summary of the content of the session with them and provided them with a printed session summary sheet. Any questions were answered and participants were reminded to complete their homework. Another session for the following week was then scheduled.</p>
<p>After 10 weeks of treatment, participants returned to the clinic 1 week later to complete the first posttreatment follow-up assessment. On this visit, participants completed a BDI-II, the BADS, the ATQ, and the QoLS. In addition, a SCID-I interview was conducted, and the RHRSD was completed by the same independent assessor immediately based on the same interview. At this posttreatment assessment appointment, participants also completed a Consumer Satisfaction Survey and an Additional Services Form, which identified any supplementary interventions obtained since the BAML acute intervention. Participants were then asked to attend a 1-month follow-up assessment appointment where the same measures (except consumer satisfaction) were collected, and likewise for a 3- and 6-month follow-up assessment session.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section15-0145445512455051">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether BAML would lead, after a 3-week baseline of moderate level BDI-II symptom reports, to a significant reduction in elevation and slope of depressive symptoms over an acute-treatment phase of 10 weeks, and whether the effects would remain across the postintervention, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up assessments. Secondarily, we sought to examine the degree to which observed change in BDI-II scores could be explained by key process measures that included negative automatic thoughts (ATQ), and measured levels of activation (BADS-Activation). These latter process measures were not examined in the present report specifically for their meditational roles in accounting for change on the primary dependent variable, as has been discussed elsewhere, that is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512455051">Gaynor and Harris (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512455051">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>. That analysis must await a separate report. Before presenting the primary analyses, we first summarize data on sessions completed, adherence, demographics, previous, and concurrent treatments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0145445512455051">
<title>Session Time</title>
<p>Participants completed a mean number of 7.4 treatment sessions (range = 2-10; ITT). Sessions lasted an average of 45 min (standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) = 18.34 min) across the 10 sessions. Active supervision time per session of engaging with participants during treatment averaged 7.84 min (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.86 min). Session length and supervision time were measured for each session contact and averaged across sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0145445512455051">
<title>Adherence</title>
<p>Participants were assigned homework during each session, which consisted of completing daily activity logs on preprinted forms, identifying activities to be engaged in during subsequent weeks from a list of possible activities intended to prime selection of a designated number of personally relevant activities, and identifying values-consistent activities and noting consistency of engagement from week to week after Session 3. BAML recorded each week, based on self-report from the participant, whether all homework was completed, some homework was completed, or no homework was completed. This information was coded 1, 2, or 3, respectively, if all, some, or none was completed. Whenever “no homework completed” was reported, BAML required staff intervention to assist or permit the client to complete assigned tasks at that session before continuing. BAML probed with questions regarding homework completion when “all” or “some” were reported and required specific input in response to these probes, that is, <italic>when</italic> homework was completed (time of day), <italic>how difficult</italic> they found it to complete homework, and so on. Participants reported completing “all” homework 34% of the time, completed “some” homework 40% of the time, and reported completing “none” 36% of the time across all sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0145445512455051">
<title>Previous Treatment</title>
<p>Five participants (33%) reported no prior treatments for depression. Seven participants reported receiving medications, six participants reported receiving individual therapy, one participant reported participating in a support group, one participant reported receiving pastoral care, one participant reported being hospitalized, and one participant reported receiving an unspecified treatment for depression. Some individuals received multiple interventions and thus numbers do not sum to 100% of enrollees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0145445512455051">
<title>Concurrent Treatments</title>
<p>We obtained concurrent treatment information from each participant during screening, at posttest which took place 1 week following acute treatment, and at each follow-up assessment (1, 3, and 6 months) as to whether they had engaged in receipt of services from among a list of treatment options. At screening, 12 participants (80%) reported that they were not currently receiving any treatment for depression. One participant reported receiving medication, one participant reported an unspecified intervention, and one participant failed to report current treatments for depression. In both of the latter instances, participants denied receiving a disqualifying concurrent treatment, that is, psychotherapy for depression.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We first present summaries of findings along conventional lines for ease of visualization of outcomes in comparison with recent reports of BA evaluations in this and other journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512455051">Cullen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512455051">Hopko, Bell, Armento, Hunt, &amp; Lejuez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512455051">Pagoto et al., 2008</xref>) followed by our primary analyses using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).

<title>Effect Size and Reliable Change</title>
<p>For each dependent measure, effect size analyses were computed using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> with the untreated sample mean (pre) contrasted with the treated sample mean (post) and the pooled sample <italic>SD</italic> as the denominator (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512455051">Table 2</xref>). In addition, a reliable change index (RCI) was computed as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512455051">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref>. RCI analysis of the BDI-II, ATQ, and BAD-Activation are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512455051">Table 3</xref>. For all measures, the sample <italic>SD</italic> was calculated using the initial score obtained for that measure in the present sample, that is, BDI-II at Prescreen 1, and for other measures at Session 1. The reliability coefficients were obtained from studies designed to evaluate psychometric properties of the given measure and with uniformly larger sample sizes. In computing the RCI, we used the following values for reliability estimates from the indicated sources: BDI-II <italic>r</italic> = .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0145445512455051">Nezu, Nezu, McClure, &amp; Zwick, 2002</xref>), ATQ <italic>r</italic> = .94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512455051">Harrell &amp; Ryon, 1983</xref>), and BADS-Activation <italic>r</italic> = .87 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512455051">Kanter, Mulick, Busch, Berlin, and Martell, 2007</xref>). The proportion of participants for each measure who met the RCI threshold at post and at follow-up time periods, respectively, were .80 and .87 for the BDI-II, .67 and .73 for the ATQ, and .75 and .63 for the BADS-activation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445512455051">Figure 1</xref> provides a visual display of mean change in BDI-II scores over sessions from Screen 1 through 6-month follow-up.</p>

<title>Primary Analysis Plan</title>
<p>We utilized a HLM approach for the analysis of the primary dependent variable (BDI-II) and entered time, age, and gender, along with the process measures (ATQ and BADS-Activation) as covariates in subsequent HLM analyses to determine whether they explained increased proportions of variance on change in BDI-II scores. HLM as an approach to the analysis of repeated (longitudinal) measures has been recommended because of its capability to incorporate multiple times of measurement and accommodate missing data, while simultaneously examining (a) individual change over time in outcomes, including the average change and the individual variation around this average change; (b) reliability estimates of change in outcomes where the ratio of the “true” parameter variance to the total observed variance equals the reliability coefficient for the given measure; (c) the correlation between baseline and rate of change in outcomes; and (d) predictors of change in outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512455051">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0145445512455051">Shek &amp; Ma, 2011</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0145445512455051">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). In the HLM approach, the rate of change for the individual is believed to be more informative than with other procedures because the individual research participant serves as his or her own reference. HLM is considered hierarchical (or multi-leveled) in that it involves data that vary (are “nested”) in at least two levels: within individuals (Level 1) and between individuals (Level 2). In more classic applications of the model, these levels can extend to multiple sites of data collection, that is, organizations, and can therefore examine site allegiance and other effects related to outcome measurement, in addition to multiple planned intervention groupings, that is, multiple treatment comparisons or “levels” of the independent variable. At Level 1, each individual’s change is represented by a set of growth parameters referred to as intercept and slope. Both are estimated based on adjustments to “true score” by the addition of measurement error. Intercept refers to the entry status of participants at some designated time point along the measure being examined. Slope refers to the change over time (i.e., across assessment sessions) on the measure being examined. Timeframes can be arbitrarily set based on experimental importance (i.e., preintervention phase vs. acute-treatment phase vs. follow-up phase). At Level 2, these parameters become outcome variables to be explained by a set of individual-level attributes (i.e., participant age or gender). HLM is believed, therefore, to provide a more suitable framework for analyzing individual change. For a more detailed discussion of HLM and its applications, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512455051">Bryk and Raudenbush (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512455051">Raudenbush and Bryk (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0145445512455051">Singer and Willett (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>In analyzing the overall BDI-II change model, we examined linear and quadratic growth to characterize individual change. This was done because although the linear trend is the simplest to understand in a clinical context and it suggests that an individual’s scores vary up or down over time according to a function resembling a straight line, when enough repeated measures are collected in a given sample, it permits exploitation of the HLM approach to examine whether more complex models fit the data better. Second, a visual inspection of the present data, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512455051">Raudenbush and Bryk (2002)</xref>, indicated support for adopting the linear and quadratic model due to apparent differential rates of change across the three phases of the study (screening, acute treatment, and follow-up). Furthermore, residual analyses identified systematic nonlinear patterns in the data. The statistical program SPSS© Linear Mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512455051">IBM SPSS, 2011</xref>) was used to model the data, and followed closely the procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512455051">Leach, Barrett, and Morgan (2011)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0145445512455051">Shek and Ma (2011)</xref>. We used restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates in all analyses.</p>
<p>Although both intercept and slope were examined in the present analysis, greater interest was in the slope. The time variable was arranged first to provide an overview of change across all screening, experimental, and follow-up sessions of the study. This permitted an analysis of the rate of change across all sessions, analysis of attributes that explained variance in the overall BDI-II, and a graphic representation of the data, which assisted in determining whether the planned phase execution indeed matched the empirical outcomes in terms of elevation and slope of change across the three phases. The experimental hypotheses were expressed in terms of differential change rates across the three phases in the direction of stable or no change before treatment (screening), decreased scores over time during the acute phase of treatment, and no further change during the follow-up period on the primary dependent variable.</p>
<p>Next, the time variable was arranged such that the (a) intercept characterized participant outcomes between initial assessment or <italic>t</italic>-1 through the first treatment session or <italic>t</italic>-3, where the BDI-II score was collected weekly for three sessions before therapy was initiated, and yielded repeated measures of symptoms before beginning the acute-treatment phase; (b) to examine change during the acute phase of treatment using Treatment Session 2 or <italic>t</italic>-4 through Session 10 or <italic>t</italic>-12, and (c) to examine rate of change between the posttreatment assessment session or <italic>t</italic>-13 through the 6-month follow-up period or <italic>t</italic>-16. This approach to HLM has been called a piecewise HLM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512455051">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) because it models intercept and change across distinct temporal phases of experimental interest. “When an exploratory examination of the data suggests nonlinearity, one option is to break up the curvilinear growth trajectories into separate linear components” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0145445512455051">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>, p. 178). As indicated, temporal phases of change framed the principal hypotheses for the present investigation and, after inspection of the overall pattern of change, warranted addition of this piecewise approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0145445512455051">
<title>HLM Assumptions Tested</title>
<p>The HLM approach carries certain assumptions concerning independence of observation at the level above nesting, bivariate normality, linear relationships, and random residuals. These were checked and met for the present data set. Missing data were handled in the following analyses through linear interpolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512455051">Leach et al., 2011</xref>), although probability levels for all findings remained significant with or without inclusion of missing data. In our HLM analysis, all predictor variables were uncentered for each model tested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0145445512455051">
<title>Model 1: Unconditional Mean Model for BDI-II</title>
<p>Our HLM analyses followed a series of model-building steps. The first comprised an unconditional means model (Model 1) whereby no predictor was included. It served as a baseline model to examine individual variation in what would become an outcome variable in subsequent models provided this examination yielded variation that was statistically different from zero. Here we examined the mean of the outcome variable (BDI-II) and the amount of between-participants (random) variation that existed in the data, which confirmed that there was significant variation on the BDI-II. Computing the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), we found that .51 of the total variation in BDI-II scores was due to interindividual differences. Given the proportion of total variation is larger than .25, we concluded that the HLM modeling approach is suited to this data set better than the traditional ANOVA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0145445512455051">Shek &amp; Ma, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Model 2: Unconditional Linear Growth Curve Model for BDI-II</title>
<p>This model comprises a baseline growth curve model that examined individual variation in change over time, that is, how each person’s rate of change deviates from the true rate of change in the population. Unless there was statistically significant change over time, further model testing would not be considered. It differs from the previous unconditional mean model, which only examined the outcome variation between individuals, that is, difference between the observed mean value and the true mean of the population.</p>
<p>The significant values in both intercept and slope parameters indicated that the initial status and the linear growth rate (change trajectory) were not constant over time. Instead, there was a significant linear decrease in the BDI-II scores (based on output from the estimates of fixed effects table). The mean estimated initial status of 25.72 was accompanied by a decrease of .81 BDI-II points per assessment session across the 16 time points from screening Session 1 to the 6-month follow-up assessment. When this model was compared with Model 1, we found that a decline within individual residual variance of 30% was associated with the linear rate of change from 52.82 to 22.83 (<italic>p</italic> = .003). The correlation between the intercept and slope was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .337), which suggests that there was no difference between those scoring high versus those scoring low on initial BDI-II in terms of rate of change over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0145445512455051">
<title>Model 3: Quadratic Growth Curve Model (BDI-II)</title>
<p>Because individual growth trajectories are usually nonlinear over time, especially when a sufficient number of repeated assessments are conducted so that this nonlinear pattern can be detected, and because the visual inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445512455051">Figure 1</xref> reveals the appearance of differential slope across sessions on the BDI-II scores, an additional higher order polynomial model was tested. This was done to examine whether the rate of change accelerated or decelerated over time rather than simply changed. We tested the quadratic growth rate of change using “Time-squared,” (Time_Sq) by adding this quadratic parameter to the previous model (Model 2). The results, based on estimates for covariance and fixed effects, revealed that each growth parameter was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 in each case), indicating that there was significant between-participant variation in the initial status or intercept, as well as linear and quadratic time trajectories. The estimate for initial status at Screening 1 on the BDI-II was 30.40 (β = 30.40, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The significant linear effect for the BDI-II has a negative sign, which indicates that the rate of linear growth decreased over time. The significant quadratic effect was positive (β or Time_Sq = .092) revealing that at a specific point, the rate of growth showed a slight increase over time. This expected deceleration was found after assessment Session 12—computed from output values in the estimates for fixed effects such that −2.38/2(.092) = 12.92. Compared with the linear change trajectory, the rate of quadratic growth or the value for Time_Sq was small (−2.38 vs. .092). Based on this, the BDI-II decreased at the beginning, but this trend slowed down in later sessions.</p>
<p>Although the quadratic model improved the model fit over the linear model when all 16 sessions constituted the time parameter, both linear and quadratic growth curve parameters were retained in the subsequent models for reasons discussed earlier concerning our interest in a piecewise HLM approach later. The quadratic model indicates that the potential of curvature trajectories fit the full data set better when all sessions were considered. We did not pursue higher order polynomial modeling of time due to the increased complexity required for sensible interpretation.</p>

<sec id="section28-0145445512455051">
<title>Model 4: Adding Predictors of BDI-II Change</title>
<p>To test the predictor effect on the shape of the individual growth trajectories, we entered participants’ age and examined it as a random covariate to explore any interindividual differences in change over time. It examined whether age was a predictor of the intercept, linear, or quadratic parameters.</p>
<p>Based on the output from this step, we found that age alone was not a significant predictor of BDI-II change under either the linear or quadratic functions of time (<italic>p</italic> = .23 for both). Nonetheless, we found that the interaction of “age with time” (linear) and Time_Sq (quadratic) were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in both cases) indicating that the interaction of time and age did predict change on the BDI-II. Comparing the residual estimates from the output from Model 3 with the present model, we found that the interactions of age with the linear and quadratic forms of time accounted for an additional 6% of variance between individuals.</p>
<p>Through this series of steps, we found that the linear and quadratic effects of time, ATQ and its interaction with time, the interaction of time with activation, and the interaction of age and time all accounted for significant proportions of variance in the overall BDI-II scores and thus were important predictors. The respecified model that included these predictors explained significantly more variance than did the unconditional model that included no covariates, and the model that included only the time covariate.</p>
<p>In terms of model fit, a likelihood ratio chi-square indicated that the change in “−2 restricted log likelihood” of 893.01 (<italic>df</italic> = 7), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, for the comparison of the respecified model to the unconditional model with no covariates was significant; likewise, it was significant for the comparison of the final model to the model that included only time as the covariate, “−2 restricted log likelihood” of 732.25 (<italic>df</italic> = 6), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145445512455051">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0145445512455051">5</xref> present the parameter estimates for fixed and random effects for the respecified model. Taken together, all information criteria indicate improved fit of the conditional model with all values being lower than in the initially tested models, using “smaller is better” criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512455051">Leach et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Piecewise HLM for BDI-II</title>
<p>Because we established that the rate of change accelerated between initial assessment across treatment sessions but then decelerated at just after Session 12, and because our research hypotheses predicted not only this rate of slowed change during the follow-up period (Phase 3), but a similar absence of change from initial assessment across the pretreatment screening phase, we proceeded to model change over these three distinct phases of the experiment. To do so, we arranged time as appropriate to pretreatment, acute-treatment, and posttreatment phases. We then examined whether there was significant variation during each to warrant further analysis. This modeling essentially repeated steps presented in the overall BDI-II analysis, but conducted by phase. Using this piecewise approach, we examined change more precisely in accordance the experimental hypotheses. We summarize the findings without tabular support in the interest of space.</p>
<p>A piecewise change model that assessed change during screening (Piece 1), during acute treatment (Piece 2), and during follow-up (Piece 3) was fitted to the data using REML estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512455051">Leach et al., 2011</xref>). The Level 1 model that best approximated the data included both fixed and random effects for change during Pieces 1, 2 and 3 consistent with the hypotheses of the study. The slopes for each piece suggested that there was no significant BDI-II depression symptom change during Piece 1, followed by significant linear change (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and an acceleration of rate of change (quadratic; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) during the acute-treatment phase, and no further significant change during the follow-up period (for linear time <italic>p</italic> = .36, and quadratic function <italic>p</italic> = .34). The significant random effect indicates that additional variables could be added to the Level 2 model.</p>
<p>As a result of progressive model-building steps, we found that the (a) interaction of age and time, (b) age and Time_Sq, (c) ATQ, (d) ATQ with time, and (e) activation with time best accounted for observed effects on BDI-II symptom reports during the acute phase of treatment. Based on these findings, the model was respecified using these variables as predictors for Piece 2. This model fit the data in accounting for the greatest proportion of residual variance, and a likelihood chi-square indicated that the change in −2 restricted log likelihood of 492.096 (<italic>df</italic> = 6) was significant, <italic>p</italic> = .01. As in the overall model of BDI-II change, age alone and gender did not significantly improve the model fit.</p>
<p>We did not conduct the HLM analysis with the RHDRS due to the design only having pre- and postobservations (waves) during the acute-treatment phase. Experts have strongly argued against attempts at modeling change where only pre–post data are available because it forces a linear relationship to any modeling effort. Moreover, it defeats the concept of accurately modeling growth or change with multiwave data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0145445512455051">Speer &amp; Greenbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0145445512455051">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). However, we presented customary findings from paired <italic>t</italic> tests and effect size for the RHDRS and other dependent measures, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512455051">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Consumer Satisfaction and Additional Post-BAML Services</title>
<p>BAML-treated participants reported an average consumer satisfaction score of 3.96 (out of 5 possible) with a range from 2.67 to 5. During the interval between the posttreatment assessment and 6-month follow-up evaluation, six BAML-treated participants reported additional treatment oriented services. Four of these reported multiple services. Collectively, the services included pastoral care, individual therapy, medication, group therapy, case management, partial hospitalization, support group, or other unspecified service. The modal services sought were partial hospitalization and hospitalization among these six participants. The fact that additional services were received should caution conclusions regarding the long-term effects of BAML as they obviously confound any interpretation that follow-up functioning levels were attributable exclusively to acute treatment provided in this study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study consisted of a preliminary outcome evaluation of a computerized BA treatment for depression. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a computerized delivery of BA therapy for depressed individuals, although several computer-based and web accessible CBT treatments exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512455051">Christensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0145445512455051">Proudfoot et al., 2004</xref>). It was hypothesized that following a stable baseline or moderate to severe depression, the computerized BA treatment would lead to significant decreases in symptoms of depression during the acute-treatment phase, and that these gains would be maintained through 6-month follow-up. This hypothesis was supported. In addition, it was found that age of participants interacted with time in accounting for a significant amount of variance in rate of change in BDI-II scores across sessions during the acute phase of treatment. Older individuals improved at a faster rate. One possibility is that the learning curve for older individuals vis-à-vis the skill sets taught by BAML was considerably less for older than for younger individuals. Whereas older persons might more typically have had life experience with scheduling activities, rising to personal challenges (e.g., dealing with momentarily challenging aversive events), and so on, younger individuals may have had fewer such life experiences and thus relied on the program for new learning to a greater extent as a guide than as a prompt. Another hypothesis is that the patient exemplars were selected from middle-age theater instructors at a Midwestern University and were scripted to model lifestyle issues and solutions more appropriate to older rather than younger persons, thereby making it easier for older participants to relate. Finally, those participants older than 40 years of age scored substantially higher with respect to household income. The small sample size and the absence of a posttreatment interview that specifically addressed this issue render these notions somewhat speculative at this time. In the final analysis, we found that the (a) interaction of age and time, (b) age and Time_Sq, (c) ATQ, (d) ATQ with time, and (e) activation with time best accounted for observed effects on BDI-II symptom reports, and collectively accounted for approximately 75% of variance when examined in relation to the initial unconditional model.</p>
<p>The results of this study provide preliminary, although incomplete, evidence for the efficacy of the BAML computerized treatment for depression. Observed effects on the BDI-II following a 3-week stable baseline of depression scores proved to be statistically and clinically significant in the ITT sample. Furthermore, BAML was associated with significant improvements in participants’ quality of life that maintained through the 6-month follow-up evaluation.</p>
<sec id="section32-0145445512455051">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study has several limitations. First, it was an open trial rather than a true experiment. As such no causal conclusions can be drawn despite the apparent positive impact revealed by the data summarized here. That must await further study through a RCT that is underway at present. Another limitation on generality of findings is associated with our use of research-recruited participants versus treatment seekers. Therefore, the present findings pertain to participants who self-selected into the study with knowledge that they would be treated using the computer program. This self-selection process could be associated with sample characteristics that differ from treatment-seeking patients in routine practice.</p>
<p>Small sample size is another inherent limitation of the present pilot investigation. As a preliminary investigation, however, the sample was as large as is customary in other evaluations of novel interventions or applications of established interventions to new populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512455051">Abbass, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512455051">Deacon &amp; Abramowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512455051">Kanter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512455051">Pagoto et al., 2008</xref>). The results encourage further study of this novel delivery system for BA therapy.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that possible rater bias cannot be ruled out with respect to the SCID-IV and RHDRS interviews as the assessors had knowledge that participants were involved in a treatment outcome study. Finally, the fact that a minority of participants reported receiving additional services during the follow-up phase limits inferences that measured outcomes during that phase were attributable exclusively to the computerized treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The cost-benefits of effective depression care have been documented in several well-conducted investigation in terms of economic productivity, disability adjusted life years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512455051">Greenberg, Stiglin, Finkelstein, &amp; Berndt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512455051">Lecrubier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0145445512455051">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and via impact on acute and chronic health conditions, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512455051">Pagoto et al. (2008)</xref>. Yet, the distribution of professional resources hampers access to treatment. It was this observation that gave rise to the professional collaboration that initiated development of this program by local and state health care policy makers, the clinician-research team, and technology offices of two academic institutions. The computerized depression treatment described here was found to be helpful in the reduction in depression symptoms, both statistically and clinically. The reductions were maintained through 6-month follow-up evaluation. Participants reported high satisfaction with the program. Session length and the degree of supervision time required were well within acceptable limits by nondoctoral level staff trained to supervise the BAML program. We propose that BAML may offer a needed extension of an evidence-based treatment for depression given the poorly distributed behavioral health resources, especially in primary care. It may have benefits as well as in stepped care, and care manager models. It may also prove helpful in increasingly available home-visitor models where depressed individuals are targeted for intervention, that is, geriatric populations, postpartum depressed parents at risk of child abuse and neglect, and in Veterans Administration home visit services. It may offer a conveniently deliverable approach that can be used alone or in concert with medications, and through employee assistance programs where depression is known to negatively affect productivity. BAML and related computer-based treatments might also assist in the reduction of waitlisted patients who could benefit from more immediate service, as well as provide a quasi-“warm handoff” at the point of care, replacing often stigmatizing referral to traditional mental health services. These are some of the potential applications of this type of technology if warranted by continuing efficacy and effectiveness studies.</p>
