<p><italic>Business for the Common Good</italic> has been published by the US part of IVP as a volume in their Christian Worldview Integration Series. Readers who assume that American evangelicals are invariably right-wing may expect this book to be an uncritical affirmation of the capitalist status quo. But that is very far from being the case. The authors are seasoned collaborators and men of pedigree. Kenman Wong is Professor of Business Ethics at Seattle Pacific University and Scott Rae is Professor of Christian Ethics at Biola University. In 1996 they combined to publish <italic>Beyond Integrity</italic>, an invaluable compendium of Judaeo-Christian writings on business ethics. This latest book is a worthy successor, giving them opportunity to present their own views as distinct from compiling other people’s.</p>
<p>Wong and Rae write as critical friends of business, concerned both to support and challenge people who work in the commercial sphere. The book is ‘not primarily an apologetic work aimed to defend business against its detractors, nor is it a work that only serves to attack. Rather, we will affirm parts of business <italic>and</italic> call for the reform and transformation of others’ (p. 36). The word ‘transformation’, which is becoming increasingly fashionable in Christian business circles, is indeed pivotal. The central theme of the book is that business is ‘a calling to serve the common good through transformational service’ (p. 33). They genuinely believe—as I do—that it is possible to pursue this Christian ideal despite the fact that we live and work in a broken world characterised by tight margins, fierce competition and short-term investor pressures.</p>
<p>Wong and Rae provide indicators as to how this might be done, offering an attractive cocktail of biblical insights laced with business examples through ten soundly structured chapters. Chapter 1 outlines a theology of work under the title ‘Your Work is an Altar’. They argue that biblically, we work to support ourselves, take care of our families and relatives, care for those in need, support the church and its work, and provide a platform to live out our faith. There is plenty of solid food for thought here, even though—as with most theologies of work—the redeeming significance of Christ’s life, death and resurrection for the workplace gets little mention. The authors proceed to depict ‘The Shape of a Calling in Business’ in chapter 2. This goes to the heart of their Christian vision for the marketplace. If it is to be a partner in God’s mission, business ‘must continually act in ways that contribute to human flourishing. Products and services should primarily improve the lives of users and the broader community’ (p. 76). Wong and Rae call for a repurposing at an institutional level. The traditional purpose and philosophy of profit maximisation and the emerging alternative of balancing stakeholder interests both fall short. ‘Rightly understood, transformational service for the common good can provide such a guiding narrative’ (p. 78). This includes motivation for people strategically called to work in and help change imperfect sectors of business.</p>
<p>The next two chapters possess a more personal orientation. Chapter 3 shows how business can contribute to spiritual formation and character growth, not least through coping with adversity. It includes some fascinating observations on the biblical injunctions to ‘number our days’ and ‘redeem the time’. Chapter 4 offers counsel on ‘Wealth, Success and Ambition’, urging that the Bible has two primary criteria for measuring success, excellence and faithfulness. Unfortunately, the force of this chapter is diminished at its conclusion by a series of True/False juxtapositions about biblical teaching which is less well nuanced than the main text.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 engages with business and the global economy. They take Walmart as an instructive case study for opening up issues about global sourcing. Wong and Rae reveal a welcome and—among some of their compatriots—all too rare capacity to transcend national perspectives. The observe that some critics of globalisation focus too narrowly on American interests such as job losses; the fact that people in developing countries have increasing employment opportunities with prospects for rising wages should be viewed positively. They emphasise that in our roles as employees, investors, customers and citizens, we all make choices that contribute to the shape of globalisation.</p>
<p>In the light of their strong emphasis on transformation, it is interesting that in chapter 7, on leadership and management, the authors recognise that the fad for transformational leadership, which was popular in the 1990s, did encourage some leaders with a tendency to delude themselves and manipulate others. They favour a blend of transformational and servant leadership, with a strong dose of humility thrown in. Chapter 8 offers that rare thing, a well-argued Christian defence of marketing where genuine efforts are made by an organisation to build authentic relationships with its customers.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 explores the contentious subject of Stewardship and Sustainability. The admit that, in a US context, environmental considerations are primarily viewed as constraints that need to be worked around, but they see business opportunities in ‘green’ products, though government intervention is needed to create a ‘correct mix’ of incentives and make the risks borne by business more reasonable. The final chapter, 10, breaks welcome new ground by identifying ‘Emerging Directions in Business’, alternative models such as social enterprise, micro-finance, business as mission and base-of-the pyramid business. These fit well into the authors’ underlying vision of business as transformational business for the common good, though they rightly warn that none of these models are an automatic panacea and, in a fallen world, each can be subverted by unscrupulous practitioners.</p>
<p>Since this review appears in a journal on ethics readers may wonder whether explicitly ethical issues are addressed in this book. The answer is yes, though in the sense of offering an overarching story or narrative by which to live rather than a treatment of complex ethical dilemmas. ‘We would much prefer … that this book be seen as a philosophy, or, loosely speaking, a theology of business that is built on a faithful presentation of a Christian worldview’ (p. 37). However, chapter 6 (which, alert readers may have noticed, was missing in my earlier treatment) engages more directly with ‘Ethics in the Workplace’. This chapter begins with a series of case studies, warns against compartmentalisation (sadly evident in two high-profile Christians, Kenneth Lay of Enron and Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom) and perceptively identifies ways in which companies socialise employees into accepting less than honourable practices (‘everyone else is doing it’; ‘it’s not that simple’, etc.). They set out a process for ethical decision-making: gather the facts; identify the ethical issue; clarify the values and virtues involved; ask what the alternatives are; weigh values; and consider consequences.</p>
<p>I must confess to finding this check-list a little disappointing, not least because it is undeveloped and distinctly thin regarding Christian content. Nevertheless, the authors come across as trustworthy ethical practitioners if not particularly sophisticated theoreticians. <italic>Business for the Common Good</italic> is certainly an ideal book to put into the hand of any aspiring young Christian wanting to find his or her way in the business world and remain an authentic disciple of Jesus. I commend it warmly.</p>
