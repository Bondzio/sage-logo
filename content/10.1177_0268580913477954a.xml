<p>Laura Adams’s complex and engaging work, <italic>The Spectacular State: Culture and National Identity in Uzbekistan</italic>, describes the planning and production of giant holiday spectacles in Uzbekistan. All states use ritual to shape and control the meanings of national symbols, says Adams, but a ‘spectacular state’ uses ritual and expressive culture ‘as one of the <italic>primary</italic> means of communication with the citizenry’ (p. 96, emphasis in original). Adams studies the holiday spectacles commemorating Independence Day (1 September) and Navro’z (21 March, a holiday marking the beginning of spring). These spectacles are million-dollar-plus extravaganzas modeled after the Olympic Games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and they involve thousands of dancers, musicians, actors, set designers, and others. The live shows are exclusive events, attended by a few thousand elite guests and broadcast on national television (most citizens turn the television on to the correct channel, but do not watch the broadcast closely, Adams finds). Adams’s focus is less on reception and political impact than on what the festivals mean to those who produce them. In order to understand this, she attends planning meetings and rehearsals leading up to the spectacles, interviews the artists responsible for writing and directing them, and analyzes the taped broadcasts.</p>
<p>Adams’s information primarily comes from ‘cultural elites’, those ‘who received higher education in the arts or cultural studies and who were employed professionally in the arts or culture’ (p. 15). Like the Soviet Union in the past, Uzbekistan lacks a vibrant private-sector art scene. Instead, most representatives of the cultural elite are employed by the Ministry of Culture (Adams’s informants are shocked when she admits the United States does not have a Ministry of Culture), which may be why Adams never seems to be comfortable calling her informants ‘artists’. Although involvement in the production of holiday spectacles offers these culture producers perks such as monetary bonuses and the chance to hobnob with top officials, Adams discovers them to be, for the most part, less than enthusiastic about the responsibility. Her informants often complain about the time and stress of involvement but worry that not participating will limit their professional advancement. She also discovers, however, that they were excited about the chance offered by the festivals to shape how Uzbek citizens think about national identity and to present Uzbek culture to the world.</p>
<p>A central concern of the book is how members of the Uzbek cultural elite respond to the Soviet legacy of cultural control. Most of the individuals Adams spent time with came of age long before independence and chaffed under the heavy-handed Soviet management of their work. Although they complain about the new regime too, they are happy to have entered an era when Uzbek culture is celebrated rather than subjected to Russian cultural imperialism. If the cultural elite use the festivals as a way to revitalize Uzbek culture after decades of Soviet denigration, Adams finds that they preserved many of the cultural distortions committed by the Soviets, under a regime she calls the ‘internationalization’ of culture. Internationalization implies reifying and modifying local culture forms in order to make them accord with Russian, European, and global standards of high culture. An example that illustrates this process is the way the Soviet cultural elite studied local Uzbek dance forms, formalized and codified them, and then created dance troupes, modeled after Russian ballet and folk groups, to perform these constructed dances.</p>
<p>Adams admits that her interpretation of the festivals differs from that of her informants. If her informants described the festivals as displays of spontaneity, authenticity, and inclusivity, to her they look contrived, ideological, and exclusive. If her informants celebrate the ‘depoliticization’ of holiday celebrations since independence, Adams argues that what they have lost in socialist propaganda they make up for with nationalist ideology, what Adams calls ‘postcolonial civic nationalism’. This nationalist ideology claims to revitalize Uzbek culture, appeal to all citizens of a multi-ethnic Uzbekistan, and assert Uzbekistan’s place as ‘an equal in the global community’ (p. 99).</p>
<p>Adams finds the culture producers’ focus on imagined audiences- domestic and international- to be a bit disingenuous, considering that the spectacles are not broadcast much beyond Uzbekistan (the only international response Adams mentions is from embassies within Uzbekistan) and even within Uzbekistan, few citizens pay attention to them, describing them as ‘boring and a waste of money’ (p. 174). At a practical level, the producers have to focus less on pleasing a popular audience than on pleasing the elite critics and bureaucrats who vet the spectacles in pre-performance reviews. The most compelling analyses in the book focus on the relationship between the cultural elite and political elite. The culture producers answer to highly placed political officials, including the members of Orgkom, the ‘state organization committee for the production of holidays’ (which includes the prime minister), as well as other elites who come to the review performances. These individuals approve the final scripts and attend preview performances, at which point they make last minute changes and cuts. This is a frustrating process for the festival producers, who often see hours of painstaking preparation dismissed because of a technocrat’s ideological whim. One of the most provocative conclusions Adams offers is that rather than struggle against these forces of censorship, culture producers find satisfaction in working with them, even striving for positive recognition from the political elite. She concludes that although many studies assume artists working under totalitarian regimes live in a state of struggle or alienation, this is not true in Uzbekistan. Judging from the cultural elite she worked with, ‘there can be pleasure in complicity, enjoyment in passivity’ (p. 187). At the final performances, these two groups, which have now become collaborators, experience ‘collective effervescence’ as they watch their creation come to life (p. 187).</p>
<p>One weakness of the book is that Adams spends a lot of energy exploring theories of power and not enough considering theories of culture and art. She frames the book as a story of controlling meaning. Early on, she states that expressive culture is a form of ‘communication and control’ (p. 4) and that spectacular states are those in which ‘politics is conducted on a symbolic level, promoting the state’s domination over the shared meaning of concepts such as heritage and progress’ (p. 5), but she can say little about what these symbols mean to the citizenry, much less how they serve the regime. Her most brilliant analyses are about cultural negotiation and cultural change. She is particularly skilled at making sense of how the Soviet regime affected regional cultural traditions. Rather than focus on theories of power, then, she could have explored literature on art and the aesthetic and extended her study to forms of artistic expression beyond the holiday spectacles. Another shortcoming is that Adams never clarifies what she means by ‘culture’. At times in the book I understood ‘propaganda’; at other times, I understood ‘art’. Few words have meant so many things to so many people. In a book that takes culture as the object of study, it would be useful to have at least a definition (but ideally a genealogy) of what the term means in different disciplines, and how Adams situates her use of the term in this scholarship.</p>
<p>Adams did most of her research in 1995 and 1996, a pivotal period in Uzbekistan’s history. Karimov’s regime had not yet become the authoritarian and repressive one it is today, but was busy consolidating its power and trying to define a coherent national identity. The holiday spectacles were one site in which this negotiation took place. Beginning around 1999 and especially after 2005, however, the regime became more repressive, relying on surveillance and violence to govern. Adams does not explain these changes but notes that despite these political shifts, the mass spectacles have changed little since independence. This suggests their political importance, if it ever existed, has now eroded. In her later research trips, she sensed that the producers were getting tired of the repetitive exercise of producing the festivals, and were starting to burn out because of the limits placed on their creative expression. As a careful and honest record of an important site of cultural production and a pivotal moment in Central Asian history, Adams’s work is required reading for anyone with an interest in modern Central Asian expressive culture and the continuing legacy of the Soviet era.</p>
