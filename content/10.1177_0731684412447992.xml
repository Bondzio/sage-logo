<p>Nowadays, polymer-based fiber composites are extensively used in many application areas such as construction, aerospace, automobile, etc. due to their superior properties. Because of recent issues like rising costs of petroleum-based polymer composites and their negative impact on environment and sustainable development, natural fiber reinforced green composites have found a niche in the global market. Light to lighter weight requirement and strict environmental rules and regulations have led to the development of green composites. A number of innovative works are reported on natural fiber based bio-composites in the direction of enhancing their properties and making them eligible in diverse engineering applications. Every day, new bio-fibers with biopolymers are introduced to meet the specific needs of today’s competitive market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412447992">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412447992">5</xref></sup> More attention has been paid to the use of biodegradable polymers and natural fibers because of (a) increasing awareness to eco-friendly environment; (b) enhancing the use of renewable materials and reducing the dependency on petroleum products; (c) increased flexibility; (d) possibility of thermal recycling; and (e) friendly processing and no health hazards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412447992">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412447992">8</xref></sup> Thermoplastic polymer composites are becoming popular and showing potential in many structural applications due to the advancement and improvements in polymer industry.</p>
<p>Recently, natural fiber reinforced bio-composites have been used as automotive parts due to their good mechanical properties and light weight. Now, many components of automobiles are fabricated using natural fiber based composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412447992">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412447992">12</xref></sup> Polylactic acid (PLA), a corn derived, fully biodegradable polymer based natural fiber green composite, is becoming popular in existing areas of application, especially in exterior and interior components of automobiles. Though PLA is biodegradable and provides good esthetics and has good mechanical properties and easy processability, it is brittle in nature which limits its application in various areas. This limitation can be overcome to an extent by the incorporation of fibers and fillers to neat polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412447992">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412447992">15</xref></sup> Nayak and Mohanty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412447992">8</xref></sup> showed that tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact strength increased by an optimum value at 15% (sisal) and 15% (glass fiber) loading in polypropylene (PP) reinforced with short sisal and glass fiber hybrid composites in the presence of 2% maleic anhydride grafted PP as a coupling agent. Huda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412447992">1</xref></sup> reported a significant improvement in the flexural and impact strengths of PLA/RNCF/talc hybrid (RNCF, recycled newspaper cellulose fibers) composites. The hybrid composites showed improved flexural strength of 132 MPa and flexural modulus of 15.3 GPa, while the unhybridized PLA/RNCF based composites exhibited flexural strength and modulus values of 77 MPa and 6.7 GPa, respectively. Xiao-Yun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412447992">14</xref></sup> fabricated PLA/flax composites by the hot-pressing method and concluded that tensile and bending properties of the composite demonstrated the best strength at flax volume fraction of 35%. Many researchers have studied the partially biodegradable composites using different types of natural fibers with synthetic thermoplastics and green composites having a combination of natural fibers with biopolymers. In most of the studies, natural fibers have been used in randomly oriented, short-fiber form using extrusion and/or injection molding process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412447992">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412447992">19</xref></sup> Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412447992">17</xref></sup> developed bamboo fiber filled PP composites by melt compounding and injection molding and found that tensile modulus, impact resistance, and creep improved as fiber loading increased. Kalam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412447992">18</xref></sup> showed that tensile and flexural properties were enhanced with the addition of pulverized oil palm fruit bunch (OPFB) powder in PP and further increased with the increase of OPFB size, whereas elongation at break and impact strength decreased with increase in OPFB size. Randomly oriented natural fiber mat has also been incorporated in many studies using hand lay-up method, hot compression, and film stacking (modified lay-up/press molding) methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412447992">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412447992">21</xref></sup> Khan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412447992">21</xref></sup> reported a significant improvement in mechanical properties of phosphate based degradable fiber reinforced PP unidirectional composites fabricated by compression molding. Few studies are available in which the natural fiber has been used in a unidirectional or bidirectional fabric form. As woven fabrics offer high strength and stiffness, these have been used in various structural applications, aerospace, defense, and automotive parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412447992">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412447992">23</xref></sup> Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412447992">22</xref></sup> developed denim fabric reinforced PLA composites using a hand lay-up method and evaluated the impact and tensile properties of the composites. Results showed that the three-layer denim-reinforced composite showed the best results among all specimens, and its impact strength, tensile strength, and tensile modulus were measured to be 82 J/m, 75.76 MPa, and 4.65 GPa, respectively.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to investigate how PLA will behave in respect to its mechanical properties when incorporated with woven natural fiber mats. In this study, a new class of green composites using three different types of natural fiber (sisal, nettle, and <italic>Grewia optiva</italic>) reinforced with PLA have been developed using the film-stacking method. For comparison purposes, PP-based composites have also been developed using the same fiber mats and the same processing technique because PP-based composites are extensively used in commercial applications. Mechanical properties (tensile, compressive, flexural, and impact strengths) are evaluated with the standard test procedures. The morphology of the surface was analyzed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p>

<p>All specimens were fabricated by hot compression using the film-stacking technique. Fiber weight fraction was kept constant to 20% for each type of composite. Fibers used in this study are in a plain weave form. Four layers of woven fibers were incorporated in each type of composite. To ensure that all the absorbed moisture was removed, all types of woven fibers and polymer pellets were dried in an oven at 80°C for 4 h before composite processing. PLA and PP pellets were converted into PLA and PP films of 1 mm thickness by compression molding machine at a temperature of 170°C. Initially, 0.4 MPa of pressure was applied for a contact time of 4 min. Thereafter, pressure was increased to 3 MPa at the constant temperature for another 2 min. The films were then allowed to cool under pressure, and finally, the films were removed at 80°C. For each type of composite (PLA- and PP-based composites), woven fiber layer and polymer films were stacked alternatively in a metallic mold. At the top and bottom, Teflon sheets (2 mm in thickness) were used to avoid sticking of the films to the metallic plates. The whole assembly was hot pressed at a temperature of 180°C at a high pressure of 4 MPa for 8 min. The pressure was subsequently increased to 6 MPa for 2 min, and then, the composite was cooled under pressure. Composite laminates were removed from the mold when the temperature reached 80°C. The thickness of the prepared composite was 4 mm. Laminates were stored in a desiccator until further use to avoid moisture absorption.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0731684412447992"><title>Tensile test</title>
<p>Experimental results of tensile strength, modulus and elongation at break for the PLA- and the PP-based composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412447992">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412447992">3</xref>, respectively. Results show that incorporation of natural fiber mats has improved the tensile properties of neat PLA and PP for each type of composite. The tensile strength of neat PLA was recorded as 39.18 MPa. From the results, it can be observed that sisal fiber reinforced composites showed higher tensile strength for both type of matrices as compared to other type of fiber reinforcement. PLA/sisal composite laminates showed the highest tensile strength of 80.6 MPa and PP/sisal composites achieved a tensile strength of 58.6 MPa. PLA/nettle and PLA/<italic>G. optiva</italic> composites showed an increased tensile strength of 50.32 and 73.9 MPa, respectively, which are higher than the tensile strength of neat PLA. PP/nettle composite showed a minimum tensile strength of 30.95 MPa, followed by PP/<italic>G. optiva</italic> (39.64 MPa), which are higher than the tensile strength of neat PP (25 MPa). Pure PLA and pure PP showed a Young’s modulus of 3.02 and 1.44 GPa, respectively. A slight increase in the Young’s modulus of all types of PLA-based composites was observed, whereas PP-based composites showed a relatively higher increase. This implies that stiffness of the developed composites has improved due to the incorporation of natural fibers to polymer matrix. Young’s modulus of the fiber mat reinforced composite is directly related to the mat structure, its type, content, and physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of natural fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412447992">28</xref></sup> The increase in tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at break of PLA-based bio-composites is also supported by various studies available in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412447992">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412447992">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731684412447992">32</xref></sup> Percentage elongation at break of neat PLA (3.98%) and neat PP (more than 25%) shows quite a different behavior, because PP is ductile than PLA polymer which is brittle in nature. After incorporation of natural fibers, both types of polymer composites showed a similar behavior. PP/nettle composite achieved a maximum percentage elongation of 6.98% at break followed by PP/sisal (5.21%) and PP/<italic>G. optiva</italic> (4.42%). Percentage elongation at break of the developed PLA-based composite is higher as compared to PLA only (3.98%). Among the PLA-based composites, PLA/<italic>G. optiva</italic> composite showed the maximum increase in percentage elongation of 5.74% at break, followed by PLA/nettle, which has 4.63% elongation at break. PLA/sisal composite showed the minimum elongation of 3.42% at break. This shows that brittleness was reduced due to incorporation of natural fibers to PLA, which is a favorable improvement as high brittleness of PLA polymer limits its application. Tensile characteristics of the fibers are mainly shaped by the fibril angle of the natural fibers which in turn affects the elongation at break of the composite. Fibers with a small fibril angle have a lower elongation at break as compared to natural fibers with a higher fibril angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731684412447992">33</xref></sup> Tensile strength is governed by fiber–matrix interfacial characteristics as researchers have reported that poor tensile strength of bio-composites is mainly due to poor fiber–matrix adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731684412447992">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731684412447992">37</xref></sup> During tensile testing, it was observed that the PLA-based composites fractured showing brittle failure and a clear chatter sound was produced, whereas PP-based composites showed a fair amount of longitudinal extension in specimens before failure. As far as fracture mechanism is concerned for tensile testing, it has been reported that matrix failure occurred first, followed by natural fiber failure through fiber fracture, pullout, etc. as matrix cracks were observed first before composite failure occurred. As soon as cracks are initiated, these start propagating in the matrix very quickly and cause bulk failure as shear stress is concentrated at the fiber–matrix interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731684412447992">38</xref></sup> The natural fibers are supposed to act as barriers to delay the fracture process of the composite, and therefore, risk of sudden failure of composite can be minimized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731684412447992">39</xref></sup>

<p>SEM images of fractured composite are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412447992">Figure 4</xref> which gives an idea about the failure mechanism of the fabricated composite under tensile loading. It was observed from the SEM micrographs that matrix cracking, fiber fracture, and fiber pullout occur in the composite during tensile testing. For better tensile behavior, a most favorable interfacial bonding is necessary. The level of adhesion, favorable bonding characteristics, and fiber pullout are some of the parameters that govern the tensile properties of bio-composites. It is clear that there is better wetting of sisal fibers with PLA and PP than nettle and <italic>G. optiva</italic> fibers. It is due to the variation in surface roughness of different natural fibers. Sisal fibers were relatively rougher than other fibers used in this study. Bax and Mussig<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731684412447992">36</xref></sup> reported the SEM images of the fractured surface of PLA/cordenka and PLA/flax green composites which showed pulled out fibers and surface of the pulled out fibers was clean. Similar observations are also noted in this study. Surface characteristics of natural fibers may be one of the governing factors for this.

<p>Pure PLA and Pure PP showed a compressive strength of 56 and 28 MPa, respectively. PLA/sisal composites achieved a maximum strength of 83.34 MPa in compression, followed by PLA/<italic>G. optiva</italic> (77.08 MPa) and PLA/nettle composites (76.39 MPa). A similar trend was observed with PP-based composites. PP/nettle composite showed the minimum compressive strength of 33.1 MPa, whereas PP/sisal composite achieved a compressive strength of 44.12 MPa. Compressive strength of PP/<italic>G. optiva</italic> composite was 40 MPa, which is close to strength of PP/sisal composite. SEM analysis shows that debonding was the dominating mechanism observed in the fractured surfaces of the specimens. Improvement in compressive strength of polymer matrix due to natural fiber reinforcement is also supported by earlier studies. It can be observed from the SEM images that in case of sisal fiber/PLA composites, there is a minimum amount of buckling, bending, and kinking of fibers. This indicates that sisal fibers form a strong interfacial bond with the PLA matrix and the resultant composite takes a more compressive load in unison. This was clearly observed by a clean fractured surface showing the cross section of the sisal fibers encapsulated in the PLA matrix. Moreover, a high degree of bending and buckling was observed in other types of developed composites. Improvement in compressive strength of bio-composites was also reported earlier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731684412447992">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731684412447992">43</xref></sup> which showed that compressive strength greatly depends upon size and type of natural fibers.</p>

<p>The outcome of flexural strength and flexural modulus of the developed composites showed a significant increase in the values as compared to their respective neat polymer resins.

PLA/sisal composite reported the highest flexural strength of 249.8 MPa with a flexural modulus of 9.75 GPa, which are much higher than the neat PLA having flexural strength and modulus of 104.4 MPa and 3.79 GPa, respectively.

Minimum flexural strength of 55.5 MPa was reported by PP/nettle composite with a modulus of 2.46 GPa, which were higher than that of neat PP showing flexural strength and modulus of 35.9 MPa and 0.987 GPa, respectively. Among the PP-based composites, PP/sisal showed the maximum flexural strength of 119.9 MPa with a modulus of 2.61 GPa, whereas PP/<italic>G. optiva</italic> gained a maximum flexural modulus of 3.09 GPa with a strength of 65.8 MPa. SEM micrographs of fractured surfaces during flexural testing are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412447992">Figure 9</xref>. SEM images show that fiber bundle fracture, debonding, and cracks are observed on the fractured surface of the composite. SEM images clearly show lesser fiber–matrix debonding in PLA-based composites than that of PP-based composites, which indicates the better performance of PLA-based composites. For good flexural strength, a most favorable bonding level is necessary. The flexural properties of bio-composites are mainly influenced by the interfacial characteristics between the fibers and the matrix. The increase in flexural properties of natural fiber composites in this study is also supported by the previous findings. The flexural strength significantly depends upon optimal percentage reinforcement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731684412447992">44</xref></sup> treatment of fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412447992">1</xref></sup> and processing technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731684412447992">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731684412447992">46</xref></sup> used for fabrication of bio-composites.

<p>Unnotched Charpy impact strength of PLA- and PP-based composites were evaluated and it was observed that PLA/sisal composite showed a substantial increase in impact strength. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412447992">Figure 10</xref> shows the impact strength results of the developed composites. PLA/nettle composite observed a decreased impact strength of 20 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>, but PLA/<italic>G. optiva</italic> composite showed an increased impact strength of 40 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> as compared to 27 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> of neat PLA. Impact strength of pure PP was around 140 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>. No specimen of pure PP was completely broken into two parts after impact loading. However, impact strength of PP-based composites was lower than that of pure PP. PP/sisal composite showed a maximum impact strength of 106.06 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> among the PP-based composites. PP/nettle and PP/<italic>G. optiva</italic> composite have almost similar impact strengths of 15.15 and 20 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>. SEM images of fractured surface are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412447992">Figure 11</xref>. From the SEM micrographs, it is clear that matrix cracking, debonding, and fiber pullout govern the failure mechanism of the composites during impact testing. During impact testing, PLA-based composite specimens were broken completely into two parts which corroborates the brittle nature of PLA matrix. SEM images also show sharper fractured matrix surface than the PP-based composites. All PP-based composites have an impact strength lower than that of PP. PLA/nettle composite also reported decreased impact strength as compared to neat PLA. Reduction in impact strength is also supported by previous studies. Wan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731684412447992">47</xref></sup> reported that unnotched impact strength of PLA/carbon fiber composites increased due to fiber incorporation of up to 30% volume fraction of fibers. Plackett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731684412447992">32</xref></sup> reported that impact resistance as measured by an unnotched izod test does not increase in PLA/jute (40 wt%) composite. It was reported that the unnotched impact resistance of the thermoplastic-based natural fiber composites generally show a decreasing trend. The reason probably may be the addition of fibers that creates regions of stress concentration which require less energy to initiate a crack. Huda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412447992">13</xref></sup> studied the impact properties of PLA/kenaf fiber bio-composites with silane treatments of fibers and concluded that composites showed a decrease in impact strength as compared to neat PLA matrix.

<p>In this study, natural fiber (nettle, <italic>G. optiva</italic>, and sisal fibers) reinforced PLA and PP polymer matrix based composites were developed. Mechanical properties were evaluated and morphology of the failed specimens of the developed composite was studied using SEM.</p>
<p>The following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation.
<list id="list1-0731684412447992" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Natural fiber reinforced thermoplastic based bio-composites have been developed successfully using compression molding through the film-stacking procedure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The tensile testing results show that the tensile properties of the composites have improved due to the incorporation of natural fibers to both types of polymers. Tensile strength and Young’s modulus of PLA-based bio-composites were higher than that of PP-based bio-composites. Percentage elongation at break of PP was much decreased due to incorporation of natural fibers. But, percentage elongation at break for PLA increased due to fiber reinforcement, which implies that brittleness of PLA has been reduced due to fiber incorporation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compressive strength of the developed composites improved as compared to neat polymers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The improvement in tensile and compressive properties of composites suggests that the applied load is uniformly transferred and distributed over the natural fibers and hence increases the overall load-carrying capacity of the composites.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was also an improvement in the flexural properties of the fabricated composites. The flexural modulus of the composite observed a significant increase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A noteworthy improvement in the flexural properties of the composites is the indication of the good fiber–matrix interfacial characteristics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>PP-based composites observed a decrease in impact strength due to fiber reinforcement. PLA/nettle composite showed decreased impact strength as compared to PLA alone. The reasons behind the reduction of impact strength may be the development of stress concentration region around the natural fiber bundles due to which less energy is required to initiate the cracks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The morphological study of the fractured surfaces by different mechanical testings as observed by SEM analysis showed that fiber fracture, fiber pullout, matrix cracking, matrix breakage, fiber breakage, and debonding are the governing mechanisms resulting in failure of fibrous composites.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In this study, untreated fibers have been used for composite fabrication. But, the effect of surface treatment on various mechanical properties of the composites may be undertaken as a part of a future investigation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It can be concluded that PLA based, fully biodegradable green composites may be used in many applications where currently PP-based composites are in fashion, which are petroleum-based synthetic polymer composites.</p></list-item>
