<p><italic>Background</italic>: Hypomagnesemia in patients with eating disorders is poorly characterized, particularly among adolescents. <italic>Methods</italic>: To determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia (Mg ≤1.7 mg/dL) and clinical characteristics of adolescents hospitalized with a <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-diagnosed eating disorder who developed hypomagnesemia, a retrospective chart review was conducted on all adolescents aged 10–21 years with an eating disorder were hospitalized at a tertiary care children’s hospital from 2007 to 2010. Patients were refed orally with standard nutrition and high-energy liquid supplements. Serum magnesium and phosphorus were obtained on admission, every 24–48 hours for the first week, and thereafter as clinically indicated. Clinical characteristics of patients with hypomagnesemia were compared with those of individuals with normal magnesium levels and those with hypophosphatemia. <italic>Results</italic>: Eighty-six of 541 eligible participants (15.9%) developed hypomagnesemia. Forty (47%) with hypomagnesemia admitted to purging in the year before admission, with 88% purging during the prior month. Compared with those with normal serum magnesium levels, patients with hypomagnesemia were older (<italic>P</italic> = .0001), ill longer (<italic>P</italic> = .001), more likely to be purging (<italic>P</italic> = .04), and more likely to have an alkaline urine (<italic>P</italic> = .01). They did not differ in eating disorder diagnosis, BMI, or other electrolyte disturbances. Hypomagnesemia developed 4.9 ± 5.5 days after refeeding was initiated, significantly later than the onset of hypophosphatemia, 0.95 ± 2.6 days (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). <italic>Conclusions</italic>: Hypomagnesemia is prevalent in adolescents hospitalized for an eating disorder and is associated with purging and alkaline urine. Hypomagnesemia develops later in the course of refeeding than hypophosphatemia. Magnesium levels should continue to be monitored after the more immediate risk of hypophosphatemia has passed, especially in those with alkaline urine.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The refeeding syndrome refers to the metabolic and clinical changes, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neuromuscular, hematologic, and gastrointestinal complications, that occur during nutrition rehabilitation of a malnourished patient. Patients at risk include those with anorexia nervosa (AN), chronic malnutrition, inflammatory bowel disease, marasmus or kwashiorkor, those underfed or fasting for at least 10–14 days, and those with morbid obesity with rapid weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612446799">1</xref></sup> Patients at particular risk are those suffering from severe malnutrition (&lt;70% ideal body weight [IBW]), those with weight loss exceeding 10% during a 2-month period, and those undergoing prolonged fasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612446799">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612446799"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612446799">4</xref></sup> Concern about the development of the refeeding syndrome is a frequent reason for hospitalization in patients with AN. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence defined guidelines for identifying adult patients at high risk for developing refeeding problems. These guidelines include patients with at least 1 of the following criteria: body mass index (BMI) &lt;16 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, unintentional weight loss &gt;15% within the prior 3–6 months, little or no nutrition intake for more than 10 days, and/or low levels of potassium, phosphate, or magnesium prior to feeding. High-risk patients also include those with 2 or more of the following criteria: BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, unintentional weight loss &gt;10% within the past 3–6 months, little or no nutrition intake for more than 5 days, or a history of alcohol abuse or drugs, including insulin, chemotherapy, antacids, or diuretics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612446799">5</xref></sup> Children and adolescents can become medically compromised much sooner than adults because of reduced nutrition reserves and increased metabolic demands. In high-risk patients, existing guidelines recommend refeeding within a closely monitored environment where serum electrolytes, phosphorus, and magnesium can be carefully monitored.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612446799">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612446799"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612446799">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fluid shifts and electrolyte abnormalities that may occur include volume overload, edema, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Although hypophosphatemia during refeeding has been well described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612446799">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612446799">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612446799"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612446799"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612446799">12</xref></sup> the characteristics of individuals who develop hypomagnesemia during refeeding have not been well elucidated. Hypophosphatemia is known to occur in those with severe malnutrition, and the phosphorus nadir usually occurs in the first week of refeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612446799">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612446799">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612446799">12</xref></sup> Although some have suggested that the expression of hypomagnesemia overlaps with that of hypophosphatemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612446799">13</xref></sup> clinically, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia often do not occur in the same group of patients.</p>
<p>Our primary aim was to determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia and the characteristics of patients who develop hypomagnesemia among adolescents with eating disorders hospitalized for medical instability. We hypothesized that, compared with those who do not develop hypomagnesemia, patients with hypomagnesemia would be more likely to be purging and to be diagnosed with bulimia nervosa (BN) or anorexia nervosa (AN) binge-purge subtype. Our secondary aim was to examine the differences between those who develop hypomagnesemia and those who develop hypophosphatemia. We hypothesized that, compared with those who develop hypophosphatemia alone, those who develop hypomagnesemia alone would be more likely to be of higher percentage IBW, to be purging, to develop the electrolyte abnormality later in the phase of refeeding, and to require supplementation for a greater number of days.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0884533612446799">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital inpatient eating disorders unit from January 2007 to December 2010 was performed. The Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE) Cohort Discovery Tool was used to electronically query and build a clinical database from the electronic patient data warehouse. Criteria for admission to the unit include severe malnutrition (&lt;75% IBW), dehydration, vital sign instability (heart rate, &lt;50 beats/min during the day or 45 beats/min at night; hypotension, &lt;90/45 mm Hg; hypothermia, &lt;96°F; orthostatic changes in pulse and blood pressure), electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, and acute food refusal, according to published national guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612446799">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533612446799">
<title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
<p>Eligible participants were adolescents aged 10–21 years who met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th edition (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) diagnostic criteria for AN, BN, or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612446799">14</xref></sup> The diagnosis of an eating disorder was made at presentation by a child psychiatrist. For patients readmitted during the 4-year study, only the first admission was included. Patients not diagnosed with an eating disorder or admitted for less than 48 hours were excluded. The protocol was reviewed by the Stanford University Human Subjects Research Committee. A waiver of informed consent and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant waiver of individual authorization were granted. All data collection protocols were approved by the Stanford University institutional review board (IRB).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0884533612446799">
<title>Protocol for Refeeding and Monitoring of Electrolytes on Our Unit</title>
<p>Refeeding was initiated with 3 meals and 2 snacks served on a tray and supervised by a staff member during the meal and for 1 hour afterwards. Patients were usually started on 1400 kcal/d depending on their 24-hour diet recall on the day prior to admission. Prescribed calories were increased by approximately 200 kcal every 24–48 hours. High-calorie liquid supplement drinks were provided to those patients who refused meals or snacks. In a minority of cases, where patients were either refusing to eat at all or were unable to achieve adequate calories by the oral route, nasogastric feeding was used in addition to oral food. Serum chemistries, including magnesium and phosphorus, were drawn on admission and thereafter at 6 am every 24–48 hours for the first week and afterward as clinically indicated. If abnormal, magnesium was supplemented as magnesium amino acids chelate (133 mg elemental Mg per tablet), 1–2 tablets 3 times a day by mouth. Supplementation was provided only when magnesium levels were ≤1.7 mg/dL. For hypophosphatemia, supplementation was administered with sodium potassium phosphate 250 mg per packet (8 mmol phosphorus, 7.1 mEq potassium), 1–2 packets 3 times a day by mouth. A prophylactic dose of phosphorus was not given. Some clinicians chose to supplement when the phosphorus ranged between 3.1 and 3.5 mEq/L in the face of severe malnutrition or when phosphorus levels were rapidly declining. Abnormal magnesium and phosphorus tests were repeated daily until they normalized.</p>

<sec id="section6-0884533612446799">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>STRIDE was used to extract demographic factors (age, race, ethnicity, and gender), anthropometric measures (height and weight at admission and discharge), serum electrolyte levels, and urine pH. Data for urine pH were available only from July 2009 through December 2010. Hypomagnesemia was defined as a serum magnesium ≤1.7 mg/dL, and hypophosphatemia was defined as a serum phosphorus ≤3.0 mg/dL. The presence or absence of hypokalemia (≤3.5 mEq/L), hypochloremia (≤97 mEq/L), and hypocalcemia (≤8.6 mg/dL) was also queried via STRIDE. To qualify as having one of these deficiencies, the subthreshold value needed to be measured at least once. For those who developed hypomagnesemia or hypophosphatemia, the hospital day at onset of low electrolyte was recorded.</p>
<p>Chart review was used to document reported weight loss, duration of illness, presence of purging (defined as patient admission of self-induced vomiting, misuse of diuretics or laxatives, or misuse of insulin at least once) in the year prior to admission, medications prescribed before and during hospitalization, <italic>DSM-IV</italic> eating disorder diagnosis, number of days magnesium or phosphorus was prescribed, 24-hour dietary recall on the day prior to admission, and prescribed caloric intake on the first day of hospitalization and 1 day prior to development of hypomagnesemia or hypophosphatemia.</p>
<p>Rate of weight loss was determined by dividing the difference between the maximum reported weight and current weight by the months since maximum weight. BMI was calculated using the following formula: BMI = weight (kg) divided by height (m)2. Median BMI, the 50th percentile BMI for exact age, was determined using the sex-specific 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI-for-age growth charts for children and adolescents aged 2–20 years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts">http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts</ext-link>). Percent IBW was calculated at admission and discharge by dividing the admission and discharge BMI by the median BMI and multiplying by 100. One of the investigators, a registered dietitian, reviewed the recorded 24-hour diet recall for caloric intake, obtained by the dietitian in an interview with the patient. The ESHA (Elizabeth Stewart Hands and Associates) food service suite was used by the dietitian as an adjunct to calculate the 24-hour diet recall.</p>

<sec id="section7-0884533612446799">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Results were analyzed using χ<sup>2</sup> testing for categorical data, Student <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparison of multiple groups with Tukey post hoc testing. For continuous variables, the Levene test was used for equality of variance. When significant differences in variance were detected, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate those variables most strongly associated with hypomagnesemia and was performed in a forward stepwise manner. All variables with a probability of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 were entered into the model. Significance was established at a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; .05. Data are reported as percentages or mean ± SD. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 612 records were reviewed. Seventy-one participants were excluded for the following reasons: age &lt;10 or &gt;21 years (n = 26), admitted for a reason other than an eating disorder (n = 36), and admitted for &lt;48 hours (n = 9). A total of 541 participants met eligibility criteria. All participants were refed orally. Fifteen (2.8%) received nasogastric feeding in addition to oral nutrition.</p>
<p>The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of those patients who developed hypomagnesemia are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612446799">Table 1</xref>. Eighty-six of the 541 eligible patients (15.9%) developed hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia developed an average of 4.9 days after admission (range, 0–34 days). Forty patients (47%) with hypomagnesemia admitted to purging at least once in the year before admission. Of the 40, 35 (88%) admitted to purging at least once within the prior month (27 vomiting, 2 laxatives without vomiting, 1 insulin withholding in a diabetic, and 5 both vomiting and using laxatives). Sixty-two percent of those with hypomagnesemia had alkaline urine during admission. Compared with those with normal serum magnesium levels, patients who developed hypomagnesemia were significantly older (<italic>P</italic> = .0001), had a longer duration of illness (<italic>P</italic> = .001), were more likely to be purging (<italic>P</italic> = .04), and were more likely to have alkaline urine (<italic>P</italic> = .01). In logistic regression analyses, hypomagnesemia was most likely to be associated with alkaline urine (<italic>P</italic> = .002; Exp(B), 2.190; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.321–3.633) followed by age (<italic>P</italic> = .04; Exp(B), 1.240; 95% CI, 1.012–1.520). Addition of race, amount of weight loss, duration of illness, and a history of purging did not significantly add to the model. A significantly higher proportion of patients with hypomagnesemia developed hypocalcemia (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) and hypophosphatemia (<italic>P</italic> = .03) during admission than did patients with normal magnesium. There was no relationship between the development of hypomagnesemia and the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Four of 86 patients with hypomagnesemia were using PPIs compared with 49 of 455 patients without hypomagnesemia (<italic>P</italic> = .11). There was a difference in the proportion of black patients who developed low serum magnesium levels, but the total number of black patients in the entire sample was small. Patients with hypomagnesemia did not differ significantly from those with normal magnesium levels in eating disorder diagnosis, BMI, or other electrolyte deficiencies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the largest to describe the prevalence and characteristics associated with hypomagnesemia in individuals with eating disorders, and it is the first to describe hypomagnesemia in adolescents with eating disorders. Our findings demonstrate that hypomagnesemia is prevalent in adolescents with eating disorders hospitalized for medical instability. This study also suggests that the subpopulation that develops hypomagnesemia during refeeding has characteristics unique from those who do not and from those who develop hypophosphatemia.</p>
<p>Consistent with our original hypothesis, hypomagnesemia was associated with purging, although not necessarily with a diagnosis of BN or AN binge-purge subtype. One of the reasons for this finding is that patients can purge without necessarily meeting the frequency or duration thresholds necessary for the diagnosis of BN. Our findings indicate that a history of purging may be a more sensitive indicator of hypomagnesemia than a psychiatric diagnosis with purging criteria. The finding of a high urine pH associated with hypomagnesemia has not previously been described and is consistent with the clinical history of purging. Elevations in urine pH have been shown to be most associated with self-reported vomiting and with the diagnosis of BN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612446799">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612446799">16</xref></sup> Our study suggests that the finding of alkaline urine should raise clinical suspicion of underlying hypomagnesemia.</p>
<p>Hypomagnesemia has recently been described with the use of PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612446799">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612446799"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612446799">19</xref></sup> These medications are sometimes prescribed for patients with eating disorders who are purging. We studied young patients with short-term use of PPIs in contrast to the reported cases of adults with chronic use of PPIs and found no relationship between the use of PPIs and hypomagnesemia.</p>
<p>In our study, hypomagnesemia was found to be associated with increased age, black race, and other electrolyte abnormalities, including hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia. The small number of black patients in our population limits the ability to make any conclusions regarding race and hypomagnesemia. The increased prevalence of hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia in older patients is likely related to the fact that older patients lost more weight and were more likely to purge than younger patients. We found that, in contrast to hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia occurs relatively late in the process of refeeding.</p>
<p>Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation in the body and is important for cardiac and neurologic function. Intake comes largely from the ingestion of leafy green vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish. Hypomagnesemia can be caused by reduced dietary intake, increased requirements during nutrition rehabilitation, and loss via the gastrointestinal and renal tracts.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only 3 prior studies, all conducted in adults, have examined hypomagnesemia in a series of patients with eating disorders. Hall et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612446799">20</xref></sup> found the incidence of hypomagnesemia in adults admitted to an eating disorder unit to be 25%, and 19 of the 41 patients with hypomagnesemia (46%) had BN. In a prospective study of 24 patients with BN, 5 (21%) developed hypomagnesemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612446799">21</xref></sup> Birmingham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612446799">22</xref></sup> identified hypomagnesemia in 30 of 50 patients with AN, but only 16% had low magnesium levels on admission. In the remainder, serum magnesium levels dropped as late as the third week of refeeding. In the adolescent literature, only a few isolated case reports exist. Palla and Litt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612446799">23</xref></sup> described a single patient who developed tetany associated with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. In that patient, the serum magnesium level was normal on admission but dropped on day 2 of hospitalization after intravenous fluids were initiated. Davidson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612446799">24</xref></sup> described a 15-year-old girl with AN who developed heart failure secondary to hypomagnesemia.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above studies, the major strength of our study is the large number of participants and the focus on the adolescent age group. Limitations of our study include the retrospective design with important missing data (eg, urine pH was available only for a subgroup of patients) and the lack of uniformity of supplementation of magnesium and phosphorus by our providers. In the present study, 3.0 was chosen as the cutoff point for hypophosphatemia, but half of the patients with phosphorus ranging from 3.1–3.5 (75 patients) were also supplemented with phosphorus. It is possible that the supplementation of phosphorus in patients with normal phosphorus levels may have influenced the development of hypomagnesemia.</p>
<p>There are several important clinical implications of this study. Hypomagnesemia is prevalent in adolescents undergoing refeeding, regardless of eating disorder diagnosis, and should be monitored for appropriately. It should especially be suspected when a patient is purging or develops alkaline urine. Hypomagnesemia should continue to be monitored later in the course of refeeding because it occurs later than hypophosphatemia, on average 5 days but as late as 34 days after refeeding has been initiated.</p>
