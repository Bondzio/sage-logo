<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on the efforts of an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) based in Sweden. KtK (Kvinna till Kvinna) partners with local women’s organizations in postconflict societies to carry out “peace work.” Drawing upon postcolonial feminist theory and field work, the authors explore how KtK strives to practice reflexivity in its relationships with partners. Through these organizing practices, women who have been marginalized before, during, and after conflict struggle together to resist misrepresentations, reclaim spaces for political action, and reconfigure the meanings of sustainability by focusing on long-term networking and relationships. The authors’ analysis points to the struggles and opportunities of international organizing driven by feminist ideals and goals for peace and reconstruction.</p>

<p>There are two recent trends in organizational communication scholarship that have received much attention through academic debate in journal forums and conference platforms on the future of the discipline. The first is the need to globalize the field in terms of organizations studied, research contexts, and theories developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318911415607">Ganesh, Zoller, &amp; Cheney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318911415607">Stohl, 1993</xref>). The focus on globalizing the field resonates with calls to focus on international organizations such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and others in the civil society sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911415607">Dempsey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318911415607">Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318911415607">Stohl &amp; Stohl, 2005</xref>). Such organizations have grown in numbers and impact in recent years, as government resources shift and shrink and others organize to provide services, humanitarian aid, and development initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318911415607">Ganesh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318911415607">Lewis, 2005</xref>). Scholars continue to grapple with developing frameworks to analyze the complexities of transnational organizing, and the civil society sector is one area that provides ample opportunities to do this.</p>
<p>A second and related trend is an ongoing discussion of postcolonial theory and the project of “decolonizing” the field of organizational communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911415607">Broadfoot and Munshi (2007)</xref> argued for the need to engage in postcolonial reflexivity to understand how our field continuously reproduces and legitimizes hegemonic colonial discourses and practices. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318911415607">Shome (1996)</xref>, they provided a reflexive account of their own experiences of marginalization within academia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318911415607">Mumby and Stohl (2007)</xref> explicitly called for organizational scholars to engage with postcolonial thinking on an empirical level to shed new and different insights into lived organizational experiences. In other words, what possibilities does postcolonial theory open not only for critiquing the exclusionary practices of our field but also for understanding the transformative potential (and consequences) of organizing?</p>
<p>Given these two trends, it makes sense to explore the possibilities of applying postcolonial theory in studies of transnational organizing. Thus far, organizational scholars have turned to feminist theorizing to investigate alternative rationalities as organizing resources in hybrid organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911415607">Ashcraft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911415607">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911415607">Buzzanell, 1994</xref>). Feminist theorists have also been vocal in arguing that patriarchal forms of oppression drive much international development activity and subjugate the stories, experiences, and truths of women’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318911415607">Handrahan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318911415607">Marchand &amp; Parpart, 1995</xref>). These critiques have been invaluable in unmasking the persistence of colonial and patriarchal discourse in social change and development initiatives. Yet attempts to draw upon the intersecting emancipatory impulses of postcolonial and feminist ideologies to explore <italic>actual</italic> organizing practices remain scarce.</p>
<p>We contribute to this ongoing conversation in two substantial ways. First, we articulate a postcolonial feminist orientation that draws upon scholarly voices and viewpoints lingering in the shadows of organizational communication scholarship. We specifically turn to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318911415607">Narayan (1997)</xref> who provides an understanding of knowledge production in a postcolonial world as inherently discursive and political. Therefore, we are able to make connections between postcolonial theories and critical strands of organizational communication. Second, we use this framework to explore the work of an international women’s NGO, Kvinna till Kvinna (KtK), to understand how their peace-building work strives to be inclusive of marginalized Others. KtK is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and has been in operation since 1993. Their primary focus is partnering with women’s organizations in postconflict areas, which started in the former Yugoslavia and has since expanded to the Caucasus and Middle East. We explore how KtK and partners create spaces for women to organize for peace on their own terms. Through these organizing practices, women who have been marginalized before, during, and after conflict struggle with voice and representation, engage in spatial politics, and try to reconfigure sustainability by focusing on long-term networking and relationships. Our analysis points to the struggles and opportunities of international organizing driven by feminist ideals and goals for peace and reconstruction. We begin by developing our theoretical framework, followed by an explanation of our research practices, and then a presentation and discussion of findings.</p>
<sec id="section1-0893318911415607">
<title>Postcolonial Threads in Organizational Analysis</title>
<p>In recent years, communication scholars have shown increasing interest in exploring alternative logics and rationalities that have not traditionally been recognized as central to organizational practice or theory (Ashcraft, 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911415607">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911415607">Broadfoot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318911415607">Harter, Leeman, Norander, Young, &amp; Rawlins, 2008</xref>). These works have challenged scholars to consider new organizational forms such as hybrid organizations and to focus on aesthetic and emotional dimensions of organizing, gendered organizing, and the complexities of voice and plurality. Although these commitments have had significant impact in shaping the way we think about the constraining and enabling nature of organizing, the breadth and depth of incorporating alternative forms of knowledge production in empirical analyses remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318911415607">Mumby &amp; Stohl, 2007</xref>). Amid this acknowledgment of the lack of diverse contexts, voices, and theories engaged in the field, there has been growing interest in postcolonial theory as a viable framework for deepening the contextualization and sociohistorical understanding of organizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911415607">Broadfoot &amp; Munshi, 2007</xref>). To date, there have been few examples of empirical analyses in organizational communication that use a postcolonial framework. One exception to this is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318911415607">Prasad’s (2003)</xref> anthology wherein scholars employ postcolonial theory to critique the colonial roots of organization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318911415607">Cooke, 2003</xref>) and provide alternative readings of organizational control and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911415607">Banerjee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318911415607">Mir, Mir, &amp; Upadhyaya, 2003</xref>). These works point toward untapped potential for integrating postcolonial theories in empirical work, but there are two significant challenges with adopting a postcolonial framework that merit further discussion.</p>
<p>First, postcolonial theory is not a unitary theory, nor does it represent a homogenous group of scholarly voices. A tension that runs across postcolonial work is the focus on ideological critique of colonial and postcolonial processes versus actual practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318911415607">Prasad (2003)</xref> argued that though postcolonial theory has the potential to account for the mutuality of material and symbolic realms, in practice, discourse has received much greater attention. The challenge, then, is to employ a postcolonial framework in ways that move beyond ideological and institutional critique to thoughtful analysis that enables us to think differently about organizing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318911415607">Mumby &amp; Stohl, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A second challenge is the delineation of sites of postcoloniality. In other words, who can rightfully use postcolonial theory and to which contexts can it be applied? We believe that the strength of a postcolonial perspective for organizational analysis is the opportunity it affords us to engage and learn from difference (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318911415607">Grimes &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). However, it is important to note that much postcolonial work justifies the use of a postcolonial framework by centering (and rightfully so) traditional colonizer–colonized relationships. Our work differs in that we draw upon the heuristic potential of postcolonial feminism to help explain how KtK enacts partnerships across multiple borders and thereby struggles to create more inclusive peace. For this study, we focus mostly on KtK’s work in the postsocialist countries of the former Yugoslavia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318911415607">Gal and Kligman (2000)</xref> pointed out that the East–West discourse that has characterized the relationships between Western and East Central Europe shares much in common with colonial relations across the globe. Those native to the region are assumed to have knowledge of only that region, whereas Westerners are assumed to have the ability to theorize about the social progress of postsocialist regions in general. These discourses are enacted by transnational organizations in different ways as they intervene in the politics of rebuilding countries that were formerly communist and helping them “transition”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0893318911415607">1</xref></sup> to democracy. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318911415607">Prasad (2003)</xref> that in order to understand the locally situated nature of these relationships it is imperative to recognize “that different countries and societies are <italic>not</italic> postcolonial <italic>in the same way</italic>” (p. 28, italics in original). As such, we draw upon the postcolonial feminist work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318911415607">Uma Narayan (1997)</xref>, who argues that postcoloniality is a political stance that recognizes the present neocolonial world order as unjust and in need of continued decolonization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0893318911415607">
<title>A Postcolonial Perspective</title>
<p>We argue that the scarcity of empirical postcolonial work is due in part to the wide diversity of perspectives within postcolonial theory and the rather limited range of those perspectives that have been taken up thus far in communication. The value of such canonical work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318911415607">Said (1978)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911415607">Bhabha (1994)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318911415607">Spivak (1987)</xref> notwithstanding, we turn our attention to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318911415607">Narayan (1997)</xref>, whose postcolonial feminist philosophy focuses attention on how persons from different cultures encounter each other in and through historical discourses of colonization. In so doing, Narayan identified a problem that sits at the heart of transnational organizing that is driven by feminist principles of social change and goals for empowerment. In order truly to engage difference across borders, nationalities, and cultures, organizations must actively practice reflexivity. Narayan articulated specific practices of postcolonial reflexivity—a postcolonial stance—as a way to understand how cross-border relationships can open new discursive spaces to include marginalized Others without devaluing the sociohistorical circumstances that have allowed for one group to be in a position to “empower” another.</p>
<p>Narayan’s primary assertion is that postcoloniality is a relationship between “Westerners” and “Non-Westerners” that is enacted in discourses and practices. Narayan argued that in order to understand these relationships, we need to attend not only to the practices of exclusion of mainstream Western analyses and international aid efforts but also to the practices of inclusion. These practices are often positioned as noble attempts to engage difference but can result, instead, in reproducing a colonialist stance that fails to engage the complexities of culture and identity. Specifically, a colonialist stance is reproduced when actors (a) fail to contextualize relationships historically, thereby discursively erasing history; (b) ignore the politics of specificity that encompass the intersections of gender, race, class, religion, and so on; and (c) either overlook the legacies of colonization or render it a process of the past. The effect of such a stance continuously positions Non-Western feminists as objects of rescue rather than as collaborators in resisting neocolonial discourses that dominate such transnational relationships.</p>
<p>Narayan also acknowledged the pitfalls involved in engaging in cross-border relationships that are motivated by intentions to rectify the exclusion of others in Western thinking. She argued that concerns about diversity, multiculturalism, and inclusion limit and define roles that cultural Others are allowed to inhabit. For example, the emissary position constructs cultural Others as ambassadors of all that is good and rich about their culture and Westerners as uncritically appreciative. This position forecloses opportunities to reflect on social, political, and material circumstances in the name of respecting other cultures. The mirror position also seeks to learn about the Other, but it puts the cultural Others in a position to allow for Westerners merely to reflect back on themselves. This position is problematic, even if that reflection involves critical self-awareness. For example, much critical work on development acknowledges the ways in which Western development agendas are misguided and what the West can learn. This practice “takes up all available discursive space” (p. 140) and thereby reduces the problem only to global agenda setting rather than taking seriously the local institutions and social contexts that also contribute to development problems. Finally, relationships can also involve the prescription of an “authentic insider” position for women from other cultures. This is problematic in that insiders are often denied the possibility of critiquing cultures other than their own, and it also calls into question the power that allows for Westerners to demand difference from others (e.g., conferring the status of authenticity upon another). Transnational organizations engaged in feminist and social change advocacy, then, must work to understand the contradictions involved in their communicative labor of reproducing Non-Western subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911415607">Dempsey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Through Narayan’s discourse-centered view of postcolonialism, we can conceive of postcolonial theory as a way to contextualize and make sense of transnational relationships. NGOs, from this perspective, can be understood as historically produced discourses and practices embedded within shifting cultural spaces. For example, in global feminist discourses about conflict, peace, and development, there is active debate about the similarities between the systems of control in modern international regimes and historically oppressive colonial relationships. Some NGOs are positioned within such discourses as further examples of the reaches of Western imperialism and, therefore, a part of the ongoing neocolonial process of progress and capitalistic development. Other NGOs, particularly those considered to be grassroots, have been heralded for their effectiveness at empowering local populations through participatory practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318911415607">Papa, Singhal, &amp; Papa, 2005</xref>, chronicle several such organizations). Providing a critical perspective on organizations that empower the “grassroots,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911415607">Dempsey (2009)</xref> aptly argued that NGOs often contribute to discursive closure on local politics and practices by accepting and promoting the unquestioned virtue of the local vís-a-vís the global. Through an empirical study of a transnational advocacy NGO, Dempsey illustrated that such representations of the grassroots, no matter how well intentioned, can obscure the politics involved in constructing local subjects and spaces and actually deny voice to those who do not fit a romanticized ideal (similar to Narayan’s arguments above). Therefore, we extend theorizing about transnational NGOs by arguing that some organizations, such as KtK, actively struggle with the politics of working with and representing “local” women while remaining aware of their own position within the Western development regime. We argue that such boundary-spanning work is accomplished through ongoing <italic>reflexivity</italic> throughout KtK’s organizing processes.</p>
<sec id="section3-0893318911415607">
<title>Postcolonial Reflexivity and Organizing</title>
<p>The potential of Narayan’s work to inform and expand organizational analysis is made evident when connections to feminist and organizational theorizing are drawn. First, postcolonial feminists and communication scholars have expressed a common interest in organizations as central locations for knowledge production. Postcolonial feminists have argued for recognition of how knowledge is both systematically legitimized and devalued through the human choices about focal issues and problems that frame inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318911415607">Harding, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318911415607">Spivak, 1987</xref>). Moreover, engaging in postcolonial reflexivity involves not only problematizing dominant knowledge structures but also reclaiming subjugated knowledges. Reclamation, though, becomes stunted when we remain anchored in a colonialist stance confining us to dominant discourses.</p>
<p>Critical and feminist communication scholars, in particular, are concerned with revealing hidden power in organizations and how certain interests are privileged over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911415607">Ashcraft &amp; Mumby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911415607">Buzzanell, 1994</xref>). More recently, scholars have argued for a more nuanced conception of power than one that merely equates power with domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911415607">Dixon, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318911415607">Foucault, 1994</xref>). Rather than viewing power and resistance as dualistic forces in organizational life that are manifest in relationships between oppressors and oppressed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318911415607">Fleming and Spicer (2008)</xref> argued that we ought to embrace the concept of struggle. Struggle implies more dynamic organizational relationships wherein power flows between members. Postcolonial theory, and in particular the concept of <italic>postcolonial reflexivity</italic>, allows us to evolve further our understanding of power by moving beyond domination/resistance and colonizer/colonized to the ongoing struggles in organizational relationships wherein inequities pervade but members willingly participate in such relationships and power ebbs and flows across boundaries (i.e., from donor to beneficiary). This is especially pertinent in organizations that actively strive to reflect on their practices and relationships that are situated in these global/local spaces of struggle.</p>
<p>To highlight the efficacy of incorporating postcolonial theorizing into organizational analysis and the struggles facing organizations that strive to be actively reflexive in practice, we turn to KtK, an NGO engaged in empowering women in postconflict areas. KtK articulates a feminist mission in its slogan “Women’s Empowerment Projects” and it embodies many of the tensions found in feminist bureaucratic forms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911415607">Ashcraft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911415607">2006</xref>). Like many organizations in the civil society sector, it struggles to maintain its mission amid growth and increased pressures of accountability based on “handy, bottom-line measures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318911415607">Lewis, 2005</xref>, p. 251). These tensions are further complicated by the crossing of multiple borders to partner with women who are cultural Others. KtK struggles to position itself as a unique NGO that advocates for women in the international community while at the same time resisting the imperialistic tendencies that characterize larger institutions such as the UN and USAID. They recognize their power and position in relation to their partners but strive to collaborate in ways that allow for reciprocity of knowledge and power and for transformation to occur.</p>
<p>This is challenging work, and our goal is not to uphold KtK as an idealistic form that embraces postcolonial reflexivity. Rather, we put forward a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in a transnational organization that seeks to demonstrate the links between supporting women at a grassroots level and sustainable peace. We use <italic>postcolonial reflexivity</italic> as an analytical concept that helps us understand the situatedness of KtK’s partner relationships and the practices they engender. Members actively struggle with how to position themselves in relation to the women in postconflict areas as they seek to create an organization that does development work differently. As such, our work was guided by the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0893318911415607" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How do the organizing practices of KtK and partners mobilize local culture and knowledge?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: How does KtK practice reflexivity in partner relationships?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Because KtK’s feminist agenda is articulated overtly in its mission, we became interested in how KtK’s feminist sensibilities are lived in organizing practices. Although they do not invoke the language of “postcolonial feminism,” KtK’s communicative practices embody postcolonial reflexivity in several ways. First, they seek out and develop partnerships with women’s organizations to prevent the further marginalization of women’s interests, needs, and contributions to the peace process. The knowledge and experiences these women have of conflict and their efforts in building sustainable peace traditionally are ignored and/or subjugated to hegemonic master narratives of war. Second, as an international NGO, KtK strives to include a diversity of voices in the networks it helps create. These networks are not without challenges as cultures fragmented by conflict are brought together. Sustainable peace serves as a unifying goal that allows for diverse perspectives on past events but at the same time demands that participants collaborate in creating a shared future. Third, the organizing practices of KtK and partners allow for women to create space for alternative subject positions and the emergence of contingent alliances. Based on ethnographic fieldwork (detailed below), we explore how the practices, discourses, and organizational artifacts of KtK and partners enact feminist and postcolonial reflexivity in carrying out “peace work.”</p>

<title>Research Design and Practices</title>
<p>In this project, reflexivity is both a process investigated in the organizational practices of KtK and part of the research process and outcomes. As feminist researchers employing a postcolonial framework, we have actively struggled with both how to practice and represent reflexivity in our writing. We challenged ourselves to think beyond reflexivity as reflecting upon and stating one’s own positionality as a researcher in relation to informants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318911415607">Wasserfall, 1997</xref>). Although acknowledging one’s own stance and identity as a researcher is an important contextualization and thought exercise on power and difference, to emphasize this as the hallmark of reflexive research runs the risk of reproducing a colonialist stance that constantly brings the focus back to the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318911415607">Narayan, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>To that end, we acknowledge that our position as White, Western women working in the United States has been an important source of privilege throughout the research process. Throughout the project, the authors frequently discussed interpretations that were taking shape across the different phases of fieldwork and how our privileged positions influenced those interpretations. Privilege and authority are inevitable difficulties for feminist researchers, and though we could more thoroughly deconstruct our authority in this space, we have chosen instead to focus on how issues of gender, culture, and power are central to the work of Kvinna till Kvinna. Instead of equalizing relationships or erasing authority, our reflexive research practices led to learning opportunities about ourselves as researchers and our interdependence with our participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318911415607">Wasserfall, 1997</xref>). We have attempted, within the confines of a journal article, to represent our own reflexive practices through a text that that is nonexploitative, that is inclusive of diverse others, and that brings attention to how a feminist postcolonial perspective can be used in organizational communication research. We argue that these are creative moves toward decolonizing the field. However, we would be remiss to hold this work up as <italic>the</italic> postcolonial ideal and to overstate its potential to disrupt marginalizing practices and the neocolonial order that dominates Western academic work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911415607">Broadfoot &amp; Munshi, 2007</xref>). This manuscript represents, instead, one decolonizing strategy that gives voice “to alternative histories and creative resistance strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911415607">Fanon, 1967</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318911415607">Grimes &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>, p. 503). In this section, we first provide an overview of Kvinna till Kvinna and then briefly describe the various methods used to gather and analyze data.</p>
<sec id="section5-0893318911415607">
<title>Overview of Kvinna till Kvinna</title>
<p>KtK is a nonprofit organization begun in 1993. The three founding women were activists in different Swedish peace organizations motivated to support women in conflict in the former Yugoslavia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0893318911415607">2</xref></sup> To date, two of the three founding members work with the organization and serve in leadership positions. The headquarter office in Stockholm houses approximately 25 employees and the organization is overseen by an 11 member Board of Directors and a Secretary General. Since its inception, KtK’s main source of funding has been the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), the national foreign aid agency of Sweden. SIDA channels aid through organizations such as KtK who are working in regions and on initiatives of priority established by the Swedish government. KtK applies for funding from SIDA and reports annually on their projects. In 2005, KtK underwent a major reorganization, necessitated by its tremendous growth and success, to structure its work along three major activities: communication, administration, and field operations. The communication department is responsible for creating reports and organizing media events to raise awareness about the needs of women in postconflict areas. The department of field operations is comprised of six different field teams spread throughout the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, and Israel/Palestine regions. Each team consists of a <italic>home coordinator</italic> based in Stockholm and one to two <italic>field coordinators</italic> located in the field. The administrative staff provides support to the other two departments in addition to conducting fundraising.</p>

<title>Kvinna till Kvinna</title>
<p>In addition to exploring the mission and goals of Kvinna till Kvinna, our work focused on the enactment of partnerships in the field. To that end, the fieldwork included study in the Balkan region, where KtK has had long-term partnerships with numerous women’s organizations as well as new partnerships and several that are in the process of being phased out. The first author spent considerable time with the home and field coordinators for the Balkan region as well as with the entire field operations, communication, and administration teams in Stockholm. All of the KtK employees were women with Swedish citizenship and, with the exception of one field coordinator who started working during the time of field work, all were White. At least two of the members of the field operations team brought with them personal connections (i.e., familial ties) to the regions in which they worked. Although members of KtK ranged in age from mid-20s to 50s, the field operations team was predominately made up of women younger than 40.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0893318911415607">
<title>Partner organizations</title>
<p>The first author met with partner organizations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo and with leaders of partner organizations from Abkhazia and Lebanon when they visited Stockholm. Partner organizations to KtK varied widely in terms of purpose and membership. Part of KtK’s mission is to provide support based on local needs rather than on a fixed development agenda, but those needs must still fit into the broad framework of peace and women’s empowerment. Many partner organizations were working to fulfill multiple local needs, such as access to women’s health care, hotlines for domestic violence, and job training and education for women. Others had a more specific focus, such as developing a women’s arts festival in Sarajevo, creating relationships between women from Serbia and women from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or working with an especially marginalized group of women such as the Ashkali culture in Kosovo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0893318911415607">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods of Inquiry</title>
<sec id="section10-0893318911415607">
<title>Participant observation</title>
<p>Observation was a primary method of discourse collection in the various phases of fieldwork that took place over an 18-month period. During the first phase, contact was made via email, phone, and face to face with the then Secretary General of KtK in efforts to negotiate access. Over a period of 5 months, the first author engaged in rapport building with the organization through email and telephone conversations, met in Stockholm with various members on several occasions, and immersed herself in the ongoing narrative of the organization via publications, the organization’s website, and public discourse. During the next 4 months, she was engaged in intense field study as she observed their daily workings first in Stockholm, then across the Balkans, and again in Stockholm. The remaining months involved continued conversations with KtK to engage in informal member checking about themes and patterns emerging in the analysis. The first author spent a total of 375 hours engaged in participant observation that resulted in 150 pages of typed field notes. Of those hours, approximately 190 were spent in Kvinna till Kvinna’s field operations observing partnerships in practice. From the start of the research, both authors met to discuss field notes, emerging themes, an ideas for proceeding in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0893318911415607">
<title>In-depth interviews</title>
<p>31 total interviews were conducted while in the field, 22 of which were with KtK members and 9 of which were with partner organization members. Based on the view that in-depth interviewing is a “partnership on a conversational research journey” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318911415607">Miller &amp; Crabtree, 2004</xref>, p. 185), a semistructured interview approach was adopted. Interviews ranged in length from 30 to 120 min, and a protocol of open-ended questions was used to help generate initial conversations. Transcription of the interviews resulted in 680 pages of text.</p>

<sec id="section12-0893318911415607">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Postcolonial scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318911415607">Smith (1999)</xref> argued that research is a site of struggle wherein imperial tendencies emerge in the collection, classification, and representation of knowledge. To that end, the authors frequently discussed interpretations that were taking shape across the phases of fieldwork. Feminist and postcolonial scholars have challenged the traditional incantation in much qualitative and interpretive analysis that themes emerge on their own and that data speak for itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911415607">Clarke, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the authors sought ways “to address head-on the inconsistencies, irregularities, and downright messiness of the empirical world—not scrub it clean and dress it up” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911415607">Clarke, 2005</xref>, p. 15).</p>
<p>To that end, we engaged in rigorous analysis that was informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911415607">Alvesson and Sköldberg’s (2000)</xref> conception of reflexive methodology and the feminist and postcolonial philosophies that framed the research. Alvesson and Sköldberg have provided an alternative to grounded theory for doing interpretive analysis that allows for the integration of ideological critique (i.e., postcolonial and feminist theories). Following this model, four levels of interpretation gave rise to this analysis. The first level involved interaction with the empirical material through reading and rereading fieldnotes, interview transcripts, and organizational documents. To keep track of the vast amount of data, NVivo was used to catalog all discourse collected. The second level, interpretation, involved identifying initial themes, comparing and contrasting them to one another, and creating numerous free nodes in NVivo to categorize emergent themes. The third level, critical interpretation, relied on reflections about power relations and ideologies evident throughout the discourse. Postcolonial feminist theory sensitized us to pay attention to privileged and subjugated voices, rationalities, and knowledge-producing resources. These interpretations were checked with participants during interviews and observations. Eventually, these critical interpretations allowed for themes to be further refined and reduced. Finally, the fourth level of interpretation involved ongoing reflection about our text production and language use. This level of reflection involved particular struggles with authority as they tried to adhere to disciplinary norms of representation of data. For example, many of the participants in this project gave interviews in English, which was a second or third language for the majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0893318911415607">4</xref></sup> Making decisions about how to present the participant’s own words was difficult in that the authors were cautious not to change any of the participant’s words for clarity but were also aware of the risks of representing the women involved as inarticulate or unintelligible. We have engaged this struggle in this manuscript by carefully choosing interview excerpts and integrating the first author’s field notes. This does not erase or make equal authority in this text, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911415607">Ellingson (2009)</xref> stated, “How to represent the truths we generate remains an open question” (p. 1). We hope that our representation of this struggle encourages others to address more explicitly these issues as we seek to globalize and diversify the field of organizational communication.</p>
<p>In the end, our goal is not to offer a fixed account of KtK nor of the women working for peace in postconflict areas. Our goal is to put forward viable and plausible insights that demonstrate a strong connection between theory and practice. We hope to spark conversations that continue to question and critique how inequalities are reproduced and foster our ability to imagine how they might be otherwise.</p>

<title>Mobilizing Local Culture and Knowledge</title>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Our work is “peace work,” and we want to show the links between supporting women and peace and democracy. This is one of our major goals now, to make visible this connection between rebuilding the country and democracy. We know that this is true, but in practice it is a different matter. When it’s time to implement—the money is always for the men and for military build-up. (Kerstin, Interview)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The first research question asks how KtK and partners mobilize local culture and knowledge in their peace-building work. KtK strives to include marginalized Others in the peace process and at the same time to translate for the international community how peace building that includes women is more sustainable than when women are not included. Kvinna till Kvinna believes that the key to fostering long-term development is to allow for local groups to define their needs and to own the process of fulfilling those needs, an idea that was often referred to as the KtK “method.” These partnerships are characterized by open dialogue, long-term relationships, and an emphasis on creating inclusive peace. As such, women (re)gain ownership of interpreting their own needs and are empowered to construct a future that fosters creative acts of resistance and reclamation. Partnerships, though, are also characterized by struggles for women from different nations, cultures, and religions to define their relationships to one another. Our findings show that the stakeholders in KtK are engaged in struggles for representation, struggles for space, and struggles for sustainability. Across these struggles, reflexivity is a practice by which members strive to make sense of their work, their organizations, and their personal and collective political convictions.</p>
<sec id="section14-0893318911415607">
<title>Struggles for Representation</title>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I sit with Katarina (KtK) at a meeting at SIDA in Stockholm on development in Bosnia Herzegovina. A woman from Bosnia Herzegovina is brought the mic and stands up “not to ask a question—but to make some clarifications.” It is clear she is very offended. Her first point is that throughout the presentation, they have referred to the country as Bosnia instead of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and she says that this is very offensive. Second, the information on corruption has been exaggerated, and she has many examples to refute the anecdotes given by the speaker on this point. The speaker, an economist, responds to the first point by saying that she is right, but he is so used to speaking in English with the work on Bosnia and Herzegovina and in English people only say “Bosnia” so he’s picked up this bad habit. To the second point, he answers that of course corruption is going to vary depending on region and local politics, and so on. I’m watching the Bosnian woman as he’s answering and she’s making comments to the women next to her and shaking her head in what looks like disgust. I think this is a welcome shake-up to what has been a rather stodgy presentation. The next morning, I see Katarina in the kitchen and I ask her what she thought about the seminar yesterday. She says that it was ok; she wasn’t particularly impressed because the information was so general—especially for people who have worked in the area for a long time. I ask her what she thought about the woman from Bosnia and whether it is common to get such a reaction in seminars like this. She immediately says she thought it was good, it needed to be said, and it felt as if here were a bunch of Swedes sitting in a room talking about a country in a rather imperialistic way, so it was good to have her voice. But it’s also the case that people from BIH who left during the war and haven’t really lived there since don’t necessarily know the situation that well either. They have a fixed picture in their head of how it is and don’t realize all the changes that continue to take place. (Field notes)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Struggles to represent women (and men) in postconflict areas in ways that speak their lived realities is a salient feature of KtK’s work. These struggles, though, are not just to include unquestioningly the voice of the Other. Instead, KtK resists Narayan’s position of “emissary” and tries to understand the potentials and flaws of partners “on the ground” by forming long-term partnerships and having a physical presence through field offices in the regions in which they work. Katarina, who was working in Stockholm, was the home coordinator for Bosnia-Herzegovina and had spent several years living there as the field coordinator. By structuring their organization around consistent presence in the field, KtK fosters engagement with partners in ways that allow for both support and questions to become norms within the relationship.</p>
<p>Numerous partner organizations expressed that one of the aspects that made KtK unique was that they truly listened to the needs of partners. As Lepa, the leader of Autonomous Women’s Network in Belgrade explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The other thing that we like about Kvinna is that there is collaboration. This is not an easy thing to do, having power and trying to collaborate. But equality is a value even if we know we’re not equal. But we are all responsible to women citizens—that is the final equality, that we have similar accountability. . . . You can tell them what you think should be changed.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Adapting to the needs of partners and achieving collaboration is a relational accomplishment that embodies feminist ideals of a cooperative work ethic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911415607">Buzzanell, 1994</xref>). Although partners in general discussed KtK as being one of the only “truly feminist donors,” there are difficulties and disappointments with trying to remain answerable and responsive to partners.</p>
<p>For example, at a networking meeting in Sarajevo, the field coordinators, Johanna and Ristin, together with the home coordinator Katarina, held an open-forum discussion with the partner organizations.</p>
<p>The second question from a partner has to do with reporting procedures and auditing. KtK has recently changed their system from auditing all of the financial reports for each partner themselves to hiring an outside auditor. Several partners talk about the stress of being audited, how they were treated with suspicion, and the auditors were even looking in closets. There is concern among the participants that “activism is lost” with the constant reporting and about their public image as an organization that is constantly audited. Ristin, Johanna, and Katarina take a few minutes to discuss this in Swedish before responding.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Johanna:</speaker>
<p>Paying for local auditors to go through receipts is the only sustainable system. Instead of us going through receipts, when there are experts locally. In Stockholm we have an audit every second month—we have to meet certain “International Standards.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ristin:</speaker>
<p>Last year there was a mistake, they weren’t happy—no one was happy—with the first audit. So with the money they had left over for the year, they hired a different company to do a second audit—but this should not be the norm in the future.</p>
<p>Nuna [interrupts and is visibly upset]: This is an issue of trust, and it makes us upset. You don’t trust—and that’s hard for us.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ristin:</speaker>
<p>From now on there will be audits only on the final reports. We need to get away from “we know each other well”—this process needs to be completely detached from personal relations—otherwise people are suspicious of what we do with Swedish taxpayer’s money. They think, “You know them so well, you don’t control what they do.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Johanna:</speaker>
<p>We’re really sorry; it’s partly our fault, what happened last year. We’re also slightly inexperienced at finding good auditors.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ristin:</speaker>
<p>So this should be a help for both of us, going through this process together. (Field notes)</p>
</speech>
<p>In this episode, KtK allowed themselves to be answerable to their partners on difficult issues of trust and reciprocity within their partnerships. This included admitting mistakes and empathizing with the stress of undergoing an audit. Allowing beneficiaries to question the practices of donors is not common procedure in the NGO world, and KtK sees this as an important part of enacting their feminist philosophy. However, they also invoke the notion of accountability to Swedish taxpayers to assert their authority (or lack thereof) in their ability to change auditing rules. Ristin, who was flustered after this exchange, remarked, “Knowing each other well had nothing to do with it; we need to move beyond that.” Personal relationships between KtK members and partners intersect and, at times, clash with the demands of organizational growth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318911415607">Lewis, 2005</xref>), and KtK and partners struggle to redefine who they are in relation to one another. One way they have tried to mediate these tensions is to use audits and other reporting procedures as opportunities to teach developing organizations about how to survive and grow in the world of international funding.</p>
<p>For example, each partner organization is required to file interim reports twice a year with KtK as well as an annual proposal on projects for which it would like support in the coming year. KtK models this process on their own procedures for reporting to SIDA, their primary source of funding. As Christina, a field coordinator in Belgrade explained, “We use the reports as a method, to also teach skills in how to evaluate your organization, not just to report.” Reports are representations of women and their organizations and often such cultural artifacts are reductionist in that they symbolize all that the organizations stand for and are narrowly defined within the donor’s standard “template” for communicating. KtK tries to reenvision such reports as both process and product and one in which both parties are deeply invested (for a counterexample, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911415607">Dempsey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Approaching mundane activities such as report filing as learning opportunities fosters respect for engaging partnerships while at the same time adhering to bureaucratic procedures inherent in NGO life. Across the field offices, coordinators meet with partners before, during, and after the process of writing reports and proposals to discuss with them how to make improvements and to make sure they have a clear understanding of the planned projects. Each partner, though, is unique in its need for this type of mentoring. For example, Christina shared her perspective on working with Bona Fide, a women’s organization in Plijevlja, Montenegro, prior to meeting with them to discuss their interim report:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Overall I am happy with it and I will not ask them to change anything, but I will ask a few questions of clarification. I think they did a really good job; they have not yet learned to speak in “the NGO language,” which I think is good because it makes their report more real.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Learning to speak the “NGO language” is part of what KtK aims to teach through the reporting practices. As Eva, a founder of KtK explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>They [partners] think we have become more bureaucratic and that they have to spend more time. And I actually think that’s okay. Because that will be the reality for them, as it is for us. . . . This is the reality of being an NGO.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although KtK strives to resist the typical request for proposal procedures that further marginalize the voices and needs of women by filtering them through Western agendas, their practices of teaching the NGO language also reinforces the hegemony of Western logics in doing development work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0893318911415607">
<title>Struggles for Space</title>
<p>KtK has been keenly aware of the importance of space and place in supporting women’s empowerment. The preface to their report, <italic>To Make Room for Changes: Peace Strategies for Women in Bosnia and Herzegovina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318911415607">Thomasson, 2006</xref>), reads,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>After ten years of cooperation with the women of Bosnia and Herzegovina we now wish to highlight the strategies they are using to win back a normal life and prevent a new war from breaking out. It is striking that the key element in their work is access to space. (p. 5)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As feminist activists and scholars have remarked across time, space is integral to the ability to think and act politically (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0893318911415607">Woolf, 1929/1991</xref>). A closer look at KtK’s practices reveals a more complex understanding of how space, place, and displacement are gendered enactments of cultural power and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318911415607">Shome, 2003</xref>). The phrase “making room for change” highlights KtK’s mindset of entering into the political space of gender relations in postconflict areas. As Eva, an organizational founder, explained in discussing the above-mentioned report,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Some women would rather die than say they were feminists. And there were women who were very outspokenly not political. But what they were doing was political. . . . The spaces that were created for safety, out of that came a lot of politics.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By helping to carve out physical and discursive spaces for women, KtK accomplishes, in part, Narayan’s vision of a postcolonial ethics wherein border crossings (i.e., across nation-states, cultures, feminist movements) are undertaken with the understanding that the meanings of these spaces and the politics created are not superimposed on women.</p>
<p>KtK was founded out of protest to the lack of space for women’s needs and voices in the postconflict landscape. As Kerstin, another founder, explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Our work is “peace work” and we want to show the links between supporting women and peace and democracy. . . . We know that this is true, but in practice . . . the money is always for the men and for military build up.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As an example of how they protest both material and political gender inequities in doing such work, Eva explained KtK’s early efforts to advocate for the needs of women in humanitarian aid supply convoys:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We were so laughed at in the beginning. We found out that women needed underwear. Women who flee take clothes for their children, not for themselves. Women also needed sanitary towels. We were told it was not economical because they take up too much space with too little weight. I still don’t really understand that logic. We argued for this and we were laughed at. But today they are included more in aid. It’s not only us, but we had something to do with it.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>KtK challenges the gendered nature of postconflict spaces that are defined and administered based on patriarchal logics that interpret humanitarian aid such that the unique needs of women are rendered less urgent, even laughable. KtK’s first project, which marked the beginning of the organization, was a “parcel project” wherein they coordinated efforts within Sweden to mail packages to women in Bosnia-Herzegovina containing hygienic products, underwear, and other items not delivered through traditional channels. Eva also shared her personal experience with delivering unorthodox aid packages to Croatia: “Condoms—I carried thousands of them in my suitcase and had to say they were for personal use, for a two week trip [Laughter]. You learn to lie.”</p>
<p>Since those initial efforts, KtK has carved a niche for itself in the civil society sector not as a humanitarian aid organization, but as one focused on long-term presence in postconflict areas that supports women’s efforts at achieving inclusive peace. One result of this focus has been the creation of a communication department that focuses on advocacy for women, based on the needs and experiences defined by partners, within the international community. This advocacy work involves contesting the allocation of women to the private sphere in the discourse of peace and development efforts. Mainstream media ingrains visions and narratives of women as victims and/or survivors in our heads to the extent that any space for alternative subjectivities must be consciously articulated and reclaimed. Isabelle discussed KtK’s strategy of creating alternative media spaces for women in conflict on the basis of stories of women in their partner organizations:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Women are not just victims, they are actors. . . . We don’t want to shy away from the fact that women also participate in the conflict. But women are seldom put in the role to talk as an expert. . . . There are no other roles for women other than refugees and rape victims.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By drawing attention to stories not often told through international media outlets, KtK aims to claim space for diverse women to be both seen and heard. This work is informed through their work in the field, and though voices are being funneled to a certain extent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911415607">Broadfoot &amp; Munshi, 2007</xref>), it would be remiss to deny the unique boundary-spanning role that KtK plays in providing access to an international audience that some partner organizations would not otherwise have.</p>
<p>KtK also works with partners to reconfigure spaces defined by oppressive circumstances as places where social connections are fostered and potentials for change emerge. In Kosovo Polje, a municipality southwest of the capital city Pristina in Kosovo, there is a Serb enclave where community members have remained living in containers provided by the UN since the war. Ruka Ruci is a partner organization based in Kosovo Polje, and as Lea, the field coordinator in Pristina, explained, “It is a very depressed and depressing place. However, Ruka Ruci . . . has the largest and nicest container in the neighborhood.” The women of Ruka Ruci, and their neighbors in the area of Kosovo Polje, have been displaced from their homes and are living in large metal storage containers as a result of the 1999 conflict in Kosovo. The containers were set up as a form of aid and support and it is not hard to see the indignity and difficulty associated with such conditions. Although the space is not officially regulated by the military or the UN, clearly there are discursive practices at work that keep people from venturing out of this isolated area. These “geographies of exclusion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0893318911415607">Sibley, 1995</xref>) are bound up with notions of difference and identity as the national and ethnic identities of “Serbian” and “Kosovar/Albanian” construct the discursive borders surrounding Kosovo Polje. Just as these borders gain significance in representations of space (e.g., leaving the area is dangerous if you are a Serb), the spatial practice of moving people into containers structures and reinforces their social isolation (akin to the ghettoization of poverty-stricken neighborhoods in the United States). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318911415607">Foucault (1980)</xref>, though, usefully reminded us of our complicity in constructing and abiding such systems of control. Ida (KtK fieldworker in Kosovo) spoke to this when she expressed her frustration with women in the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica who refused to attend a meeting in Pristina despite her offer to escort them personally.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>They were afraid to come because they had seen news reports that Albanian soldiers were on the streets in Pristina grabbing anyone who they thought was Serbian. . . . Serbian people here are being used for political gain, when in the end Serbia does not provide any real support for these people.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ability of KtK to break structures of isolation and oppression and create a space for women of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds to come together is limited by political and nationalist agendas that thrive on social division rather than integration.</p>
<p>In analyzing spatial politics of inclusion and exclusion that characterize the organizing practices of KtK and partners, we must also consider the circumstances that allow for KtK to engage so freely in such border crossings. We have pointed out that one of the unique features of KtK’s organizing structure is their long-term presence in the field through the operation of field offices. This sets the organization apart from other similar organizations in that they develop and maintain close relationships with partner organizations, features that partners repeatedly highlighted as positive about working with KtK. However, a field coordinator’s position is always temporary and many of the women transfer from a field position to a “home” position as life circumstances change. Maria, a field coordinator in the Caucasus for 3 and a ½ years who had just returned to the Stockholm office to take over the position of home coordinator for Kosovo and Macedonia, shared her experience.</p>
<p>

<p>As Swedish citizens, the women of KtK are able to make choices about work and home life that are not available to the women with whom they work. To be able to let a postconflict region “go” is a luxury, as is the ability freely to find work. Johanna, a field coordinator preparing to leave Sarajevo, explained her circumstances: “I’m going home, mainly because of my pregnancy. . . . I’m on leave from my other job.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0893318911415607">5</xref></sup> And so I do have some options. . . .” The ability of KtK as a whole and field coordinators as individuals to enter and exit postconflict areas in Eastern Europe at will are a result of historical geopolitical relationships that have positioned Sweden as a wealthy Western European nation that has remained free of violent conflict in recent history and has avoided socialist rule. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318911415607">Mindry (2001)</xref> argued that understanding how nongovernmental organizations carry out their work and the conditions that enable them to do so is important, but less understood is why they choose to participate in relationships with women in disparate locations. In so doing, organizations are contributing to a “politics of virtue” that inevitably shapes the ways in which women relate to each other in and through organizations. In KtK, there was active acknowledgment of the spatial politics that positioned them as an organization and individual actors in a place of privilege. These positions call into question the ability to change such relationships on a global scale. For example, though local spaces are reconfigured and international media spaces are made more inclusive, is there “room” to shift the dynamics of civil society such that knowledge from partner organizations could flow to donors?</p>
<p>The limitations of shifting spatial politics notwithstanding, we point toward the reflexive practices that permeate KtK in their border-crossing work. Before, during, and after they enter a postconflict region, they engage in a process of asking questions: Are we needed here? Why are we needed here? And what did we do while we were there? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318911415607">Narayan (1997)</xref> argued, the answer is not to disengage from the difficult work of transnational relationships. Instead, we ought to do it in ways that leave open possibilities for relationships to be configured in emergent ways, without predetermination of women’s positions vis-à-vis each other.</p>

<disp-quote><p>“We don’t believe in creating a network, but we believe in networking.” (Eva, KtK)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of the major roles that KtK plays in postconflict regions is networking by linking organizations to each other and mobilizing resources needed for them to share experience, exchange knowledge, offer support, and strategize about how to further the goals of women’s movements and peace initiatives. KtK is not concerned as much with creating a formal network, but rather they are more interested in <italic>networking</italic>, a dynamic interactive process. Networking by KtK and partners creates an open, collective space where empowerment, participation, movement, and the circulation of knowledges emerge as both products of networking and as significant parts of the process itself. This focus mirrors a similar move by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318911415607">Flanagin, Stohl, and Bimber (2006)</xref>, who argued that collective action is primarily a communicative phenomenon that attunes us to what people do and how they communicate rather than on the organizational structure (i.e., network).</p>
<p>Information becomes empowering for these women as it expands the choices they are able to make about control over their own bodies, political views, and the ability to change their lives. Information exchange through networking in this case involves specific embodied acts of coming together physically in time and space—specific <italic>moments</italic> of empowerment. In particular, KtK helps coordinate network meetings that range from thematically based seminars, to “open-space” meetings, to study-trips to Stockholm. This embodied dimension is important, especially in postconflict areas when the opportunity to travel outside of a conflict zone is in itself emancipatory. MaryAnn, field coordinator for Israel and Palestine explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Last year, we were working very hard on strengthening our role as a networking—supporting networking things, and networking between the organizations. And I think that the two major meetings that we arranged showed that there’s an incredible demand for this. And because of all the restrictions on movement and the difficulties for partners to meet with each other, that’s something that we can actually work much more on.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although much important work in communication on the network as an organizational form has emphasized its capacity for handling emerging technologies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318911415607">DeSanctis &amp; Fulk, 1999</xref>), KtK provides a counterexample as to why <italic>networking</italic> extends beyond impersonal and institutional modes of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318911415607">Flanagin, Stohl, &amp; Bimber, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318911415607">Dempsey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another way to understand networking is to examine how it fits with KtK’s strategy of maintaining a long-term perspective in its work. Networking cultivates knowledge and experience that remains after formal funding relationships have ended. For example, during the first author’s fieldwork, KtK was planning to phase out in the Balkan region (with the exception of Kosovo). This was discussed openly in meetings with partners, and partners were asked to provide ideas about how to make the withdrawal successful. Karin, a field coordinator in Serbia and Montenegro, asked the following of a partner organization in Montenegro: “We would like to get feedback from you about the next year [final year] of support. We will continue to work with the four organizations in Montenegro, but is there something bigger we can do? Like, for an example, organize an international meeting, a networking meeting?” These types of joint actions will hopefully lead to a strengthened women’s movement that can draw upon the network for information, energy, and support even after KtK no longer formally operates in the country. This aspect of networking—that it can be a responsible approach to sustainable development and capacity building—has been overlooked in theorizing about the benefits of such an organizational structure. A commitment to sustainability along with respect for local knowledges are at the core of why KtK links organizations to one another and provides the conditions and resources for their own strategies of resistance to emerge.</p>
<p>KtK has been successful in their networking strategies (e.g., a strong network remains in Croatia, even though KtK has withdrawn from the country) in part because of their willingness to <italic>decenter</italic> themselves in the process. Eva touched on this when she talked about a recent network meeting for the Caucasus region: “In the end, we can come up with topics, but a theme is less important than giving them the opportunity to meet.” KtK is a vital link, a boundary spanner, for women’s organizations in the areas where they work. However, the way they enact networking embodies feminist ideals of both cooperative enactment and egalitarianism in that they recognize their role in relationship to their partners. This suggests that the process of networking is more important than the end product of creating a network and that leaving behind the conditions for further networking is one way to diminish the size of a network “hole” that disables the process upon their withdrawal.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The peace-building process is difficult and contradictory for fractured societies. Women historically have faced marginalization in postconflict society as international stakeholders compete to fill the leadership vacuum created during conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318911415607">Handrahan, 2004</xref>). Even so, their peace-building activities can have substantial impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318911415607">Mazurana, Raven-Roberts, &amp; Parpart, 2005</xref>). We offer a meaningful account of such activities as facilitated by KtK, a Swedish-based transnational NGO that sets itself apart from other aid organizations by arguing that women are not only victims of war—they are invaluable resources for building and maintaining peace. By partnering with local women’s organizations and mobilizing resources so women may define their futures on their terms, KtK challenges institutionalized ways of doing development. From a postcolonial standpoint, we explored how KtK works with partner organizations to create spaces where alternative rationalities can flourish. The importance of such work in creating sustainable peace is evident in the ways in which acts of representing women, reclaiming space, and networking serve to build relationships and restore a sense of community among those who are devastated by violent conflict and then not included in official peace processes.</p>
<p>There are several theoretical implications connected to our findings. First, this study demonstrates how a postcolonial feminist framework can be integrated usefully into communication research about transformative resistance in global contexts and postconflict regions. To date, this body of theory has remained outside the margins of empirical work in communication (though there are several important examples of using postcolonial theories in critiquing the field; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911415607">Broadfoot &amp; Munshi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318911415607">Shome, 1996</xref>). We believe this study offers an entry point for communication scholars to engage postcolonial feminist theory as a viable framework for understanding the discursive practices of NGOs and other organizations focused on social justice issues. As we have shown through this analysis, a postcolonial feminist framework allows for focus on understanding resistance at a macro level in terms of how organizations are positioned within international civil society while at the same time allowing for attention on the micro-level indigenous voices and stories that actively create alternative futures.</p>
<p>This study also contributes to more nuanced understandings of power. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911415607">Dixon (2007)</xref> pointed out, it is important to dislodge our equation of power with domination within organizations to understand how relationships marked by inequities endure in voluntary form and can be transformative. Certainly the relationships between KtK and partners are not equal, but through consistent and engaged reflexivity in those relationships, power is exercised by both parties in efforts to transform the way that donors and beneficiaries accomplish their goals. Moreover, reflexivity is a means by which KtK makes sense of its reason for organizing in relation to the needs of women in postconflict areas. In this way, our analysis also builds on and extends the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911415607">Dempsey (2009)</xref> by conceptualizing reflexivity as a process whereby NGOs can critically engage the contradictions involved in transnational advocacy.</p>
<p>There are limitations, though, to the extent to which postcolonial feminist theory can account for and explain not only active voices but also the silences that inevitably remain. We have wrestled with the limitations of this framework on two significant levels. First, the analysis of KtK and the work they do to mobilize indigenous knowledge and empower women in postconflict societies could also be critiqued from a postcolonial perspective. The organization has come into being as a result of specific sociohistorical relationships that have afforded Sweden a position of political security and economic wealth in the current Western world. However, we argue that a postcolonial feminist framework can be applied to different contexts in different ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318911415607">Prasad, 2003</xref>). This analysis focuses on the ways in which KtK enables resistance even as members reflexively struggle with how to engage women in postconflict areas ethically without forcing upon them Western feminist ideals. Second, our analysis points toward the empowering nature of KtK’s work, but a postcolonial feminist orientation also attunes our attention to those voices that are not found in the partnerships and networks that KtK helps create. One way to build on this particular research would be to analyze the decision-making process surrounding partnerships and networking. We are cautious, though, to hold any organization up to a postcolonial feminist ideal type that transcends the need for ongoing struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911415607">Ashcraft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911415607">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There is still work to be done in using postcolonial theory to understand the complexities of transnational organizing. For example, many postcolonial accounts of transnational development work take a Marxist critical approach—arguing, rightfully, that capitalism and Western economic dominance cannot be overlooked. There is a tendency with these approaches to devalue the transformative potential in international alliances because of the inequality of power relations. By contrast, many accounts of participatory practices in organizing tend to celebrate the potential of feminist practices without engaging the realities of global-local organizing. Keeping these two tendencies of wanting to understand organizing practices and maintain awareness of power relations in play with one another is difficult and demanding. We can remain both hopeful and skeptical about the potentialities (and limits) of transnational organizing by (a) starting with the practices of an actual community (organization), and (b) committing to understanding both <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> such a community organizes the way that it does. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318911415607">Rathgeber (1995)</xref> that “a truly postmodern feminist approach to development would recognize and build upon the reality of these diverging views rather than denigrating the efforts of development agencies as either inherently conservative and self-serving or excessively bureaucratic” (p. 212).</p>
<p>As such, we argue that postcolonial feminist theories are informing departure points for understanding <italic>how</italic> organizations like KtK do development and peace work. To interrogate <italic>why</italic> is to engage head on questions of Self and Other, difference and solidarity, individual and society, universal and particular. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318911415607">Mindry (2001)</xref> termed this type of discourse a “politics of virtue” that shapes the ways in which women relate to each other in and through organizations. “The kinds of historically significant, transnational moralizing discourses have remained largely unexamined in the literature on women, nongovernmental organizations and development” (p. 1189). These are challenging questions, but they open the possibility for a more contextualized understanding of global organizations and of the civil society sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318911415607">Lewis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, there are important practical implications of this study. Most noticeably, sustainability is a buzzword in development work and underpins much of the discourse surrounding the negative consequences of resource dependency. The concern is that society’s, and an organization’s, motivation for becoming self-sufficient will be undermined by long-term support. From Kvinna till Kvinna, we learn that a long-term commitment to supporting organizations financially and in their own development does not equal dependency. On the contrary, their experience in the Balkans provides evidence that a long-term and holistic perspective can build capacities that foster independence and “ownership of the process” when they exit an area. Key to this is allowing for needs to be determined by the local organizations.</p>
<p>Second, the issues and concerns raised by partners and KtK point to the need for greater focus by the international community on the complexities of the “postconflict” period in general and, more specifically, to the needs of marginalized communities during postconflict. Twelve years after the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, women (and men) are still struggling to rebuild their lives and recreate infrastructures that support access to health care, education, and legal services. Many women expressed frustration at local government policies and agents that do not adhere to internationally codified standards of gender equality. This problem is exacerbated as responsibility for supporting such infrastructures is shifted to local offices as donors leave the area. Meeting postconflict needs and reconstruction goals is often measured from a macroperspective that foregrounds economic markers and other societal-level indicators (i.e., crime). This perspective obscures micro-level social factors of reconstruction where women are most likely to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318911415607">Nguyen-Gillham, 1999</xref>). International responses and policies with regard to postconflict issues must prioritize macro- <italic>and</italic> micro-level needs in order for women to become full participants in reconstruction.</p>
