<p>Today we call Low Sunday, carrying a hint of anti-climax, as if all our energies were exhausted following the high festival of Easter. Yet this is not the ‘First Sunday <italic>after</italic> Easter’ but the ‘Second Sunday <italic>of</italic> Easter’ when our Alleluias redouble and resound. Once this Sunday was known as ‘Quasimodo Sunday’, not after Victor Hugo’s character (the other way round, in fact) but from the introductory chant for the day, ‘Quasi modo geneti, infantes’ from 1 Peter: ‘Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk’. The gospel chant, though, was <italic>Laudes Salvatori</italic>. Some say ‘Low’ derives from that. ‘Sing praises to the Saviour’. That’s better, for we do this no less today than at the Resurrection’s dawn.</p>
<p>On this Sunday, the gospel reading is set not for one year out of three but every single year. It is a passage which not only gives us John’s particular take on Pentecost – the Holy Spirit bestowed in Jesus’ own breath and issuing in the power to forgive sins – but the unforgettable Doubting Thomas, whose story reassures us that asking questions about our faith is acceptable and indeed part of our growth to maturity in Christ. But he renders also another service. It is in his act of touching the wounds of Christ that the church is left in no doubt that the Christ who was raised was the same Christ that was crucified, ‘the stone the builders rejected’ of today’s psalm. Now why is that so important?</p>
<p>A scholarly book causing a twitter at the moment in the theological blogosphere claims that it wasn’t until several generations had passed that the church finally focused its preaching on the resurrection. Until then, the Passion predominated. It is something of a shock to find that what seems so central to us was not immediately understood. It is a warning against even today insisting that all is now settled in conduct and beliefs – and indeed to assume that all truth will be found in the mainstream church. For according to patristics scholar Markus Vinzent the person who brought the church back to the preaching of a Christ <italic>crucified and raised</italic> was a notorious heretic, a second century Thomas. Marcion was a well-to-do shipping magnate, a man of high organisational ability who started a chain of rival churches across the empire. Today he’d be executive president of Marcion Ministries perhaps, and a star on the God slot. Although Marcion rejected the whole of the Old Testament and three of the Gospels, he much admired the letters of St Paul, now yesterday’s man. The new introductions he wrote to the letters engaged people again with what was meant when Paul said: ‘If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain’. In the course of the furious debates that ensued was recovered the missing link between the risen body and the crucified body, the insight that resurrection was not about <underline>escaping</underline> from mortality, sin and suffering but <underline>dealing</underline> with it. Cross and empty tomb were part of the same truth. The resurrection did not deny the body and all that bodily humanity is heir to, but affirmed that there was always a way through. The wounds were resurrected too, as Thomas found.</p>
<p>Every so often you come across a book that you do not just read but which moves in with you. Ronald Ferguson’s study of the writer George Mackay Brown is subtitled, ‘The Wound and the Gift’. It explores the life of the Orcadian novelist and poet, particularly his spiritual life, including his abandonment of the Presbyterianism of his childhood to become a Roman Catholic. The wounds of the title were the tuberculosis which dogged his life, his tendency to alcoholism, his feeling of alienation from his community, his preference for the world of the sagas to the modern day’s distortion – as he saw it – by technology, and the disgust he often expressed at his own life. Yet out of this troubled personality came one of Scotland’s major writers whose resonant language, as someone put it, enlarges our sense of what a sad and joyful and wondrous business it is, this being alive.</p>
<p>Ferguson asks: are wounds necessary to make an artist? The private lives of novelists, composers, members of rock bands so often seem disastrous. Does creativity have to be tied to suffering? Or is it that pain is part of human life; artists train themselves to be more attentive, see more in a circumstance, can identify the positive in the negative, although it may mean embracing loneliness to bring reconciliation to others. Actor Keira Knightley at 27 says in an interview: ‘As life goes on you pick up wounds, and for an actor it’s terribly important to have those wounds to draw on’.</p>
<p>Mackay Brown wrote about the ordinary life of the people round about, the hard lives they knew, the woundedness of their existence. To these wounds he brought not just the gift of words but the gift of Easter faith. As his friend the composer Peter Maxwell Davies put it, in his work the patterns of the agricultural and the fishing year are married with the Christian Year, and the simplest actions – feeding cattle or going out to set creels – become rituals which have enormous significance. Thus was the truth of the resurrection faith identified as proven within ordinary, secular life, and, what is more, using the most ordinary, the most wounded, of words.</p>
<p>The recent BBC radio series, <italic>The Listening Project</italic>, brought together pairs from the same family to have in the studio conversations they might avoid round the kitchen table. These poignant, ‘private’ discussions reveal much and varied woundedness: the grandfather revealing how he used to go to a quiet wood longing for the continuous telephone bell of his tinnitus at last to fall silent in nature’s stillness, the husband and wife haltingly discussing the increasing onset of Alzheimer’s and how they will deal with it, the mother asking her 10 year old son if his restrictive and dangerous congenital heart condition makes him fearful of death, the British father speaking to his son about finding him as a baby in a Saigon orphanage.</p>
<p>The conversations also show how gifts are found at the heart of wounds: the bereaved Irish Protestant woman able to explain to her daughter that if you hold bitterness in your heart it destroys you; the son releasing his father from his fear of leaving others at his death to deal with a loss he felt obliged to carry alone; the woman feeling guilt at her father’s leaving them many years ago being told at last by her mother: You are the best thing in the world. Here also in these programmes, people name their wounds, free each other from burdens, reach for hope.</p>
<p>It was said of George Mackay Brown that he took the traumas of ordinary life, found in them fragments to make altars, and made harvest meals out of crumbs of love and grace. Rowan Williams said: ‘God’s sovereignty is the open door in the heart of every situation’. Is this not part of the Easter message: that it is the very ordinary pains and losses of life, big or small, that are yeasted for resurrection. To be part of the body of Christ, the church, and all that it entails in terms of rituals, story, images, but above all the companions it provides for the way, particularly places us within this possibility.</p>
<p>In 1944, the Allies led by the Royal Horse Artillery, moving north through Italy, came upon the town of Borgo San Sepolcro. To the commanding officer, who had orders to bombard what was thought to be an enemy stronghold, the name was familiar, and it suddenly came back to him that this was the home of what Aldous Huxley had called the best ainting in the world, Christ rising from the sepulchre. Silencing the guns he went on reconnaissance. The painting was saved. Trees, hillside, in the foreground a tumble of sleeping guards in front of a tomb, and climbing from it the figure of Christ, bathed in light, his pink robe drooping to show the wound in his side. But above all one is arrested by the eyes, gazing directly at the viewer with imperturbable gravity. One critic said: ‘The eyes that meet ours have the authority of complete knowledge, the eyes of one who knows it all – the bright world lost by suffering, death, and hell now restored as the kingdom over which he rules for ever’.</p>
<p>Created around 1464 by local artist Piero della Francesca, this remarkable work is not found in any of the usual locations – in a cathedral, around a church altar, among the frescoes illuminating a monastic cloister – but is painted directly on to the wall in a room of the local town hall. Over this secular place of business and justice, where fortunes and reputations were made or lost, relationships forged or broken, forgiveness granted or withheld, gazes Christ wounded – and risen.</p>
