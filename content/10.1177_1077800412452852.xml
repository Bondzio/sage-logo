<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the fact that most people feel that they have always been “the same person” represents an intrinsic phenomenon of subjective experience in introspection and consciousness in life (it is not just a peculiarity of the memory of the human species as it appears from an “objective” point of view). We summarize this phenomenon by saying the individual feels herself to be a “single consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood on.” Portraits based on interviews tend to try to give impressions of the participant’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’” at the time of the interviews. We suggest that this “single consciousness-and-‘I’” represents a new, extremely powerful way of understanding subjectivity.</p>

<title>Introduction/Summary</title>
<p>This article focuses on a single “phenomenon,” viz., that most people feel that they have been “the same person” from childhood on. Even when great changes occur in one’s life, one will talk about one’s feelings and subjective experience, and about oneself before and after the change, but one is always the same person. What is so unusual about this is that this seems to imply a kind oneness in the person (in her subjective experience or more accurately in her consciousness) over time, almost as if there is something in her that stays the same. For example, one feels that one remembers significant experiences in the past and how one felt then. “I still basically remember <italic>today</italic> the feeling and how I was then.” One feels one has always been the same person with a single continuous consciousness and the same “I” ever since one can remember. “Of course there have been many changes in my feelings, attitudes, perspective, awareness, and so forth since then, but I feel I am more or less aware of these.” We will say that typically, a person feels that she is a “single consciousness-and-‘I’” (or a single consciousness-<italic>cum</italic> ‘I’, or a single <italic>continuous</italic> consciousness-and-‘I’) and that in fact she has been “the same” consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood on. So in this article we take this “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” as a completely independent entity—an independent existent, a reality and an object of study in its own right. Actually, some kind of tacit understanding and acceptance of the “phenomenon/entity” of a single-consciousness-and-‘I’ that is in some way “the same from childhood on” seems to be shared by almost all members of the society-at-large. So the aim of this article is to explore this “phenomenon/entity” in the context of in-depth interviews and as part of ordinary experience, and to draw attention to its absolutely fundamental importance in several directions.</p>
<p>The present article is the third article addressing consciousness in the study of human life and experience based on research using the participant-as-ally essentialist portraiture approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452852">Witz, Goodwin, Hart, &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>). The first of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz, Lee, &amp; Huang, 2010</xref>) tried to understand the inner consciousness related to “higher aspects” (moral-ethical and metaphysical convictions, etc.) in a person’s life. The second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>) addressed methodological issues related to intersubjectivity and gaining a deeper understanding of consciousness in a person. So on the one hand the present article represents an effort to conceive of the whole of a person’s subjectivity (subjective world, etc.) as it appears from her point of view. On the other hand, a “single consciousness-and-‘I’” is an attempt to give a universal characterization of human subjective experience in any culture in a way that is relatively free from Western presuppositions. In the last section of the article (“Larger Issues”), we briefly indicate why we believe it is important to try to form a conception of subjectivity in this manner.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077800412452852">
<title>Outline of the article</title>
<p>The phenomenon of “a single consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood to old age” involves many familiar, taken-for-granted aspects (elements, “assumptions”). We begin the discussion purely at a level of subjective experience and introspection (in the section “A ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .”). For example, a woman in her early 30s remembers earlier periods in her life where the experience at that time is still somehow part of how she feels and is today (an example of “seeing the past in the present,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>). She remembers her feelings, the attitudes she had, the overall state she was in (her consciousness) at the time; she remembers experiencing larger insights, inner expansion, and becoming a larger self. Here the question is, how are these kinds of memories possible since she is now so much more mature, and so forth? Is it that the self or “I” as the subject of the experience really did not or does not change? Is it that the totality of one’s condition contains an unchanging aspect or element? How would either of these be possible? The next two sections (“Consciousness of Self-Evolution” and “The Pervasive Consciousness . . .”) continue in a similar vein, but deal with much larger aspects in one’s self understanding that play a prominent role in one’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” The section “The ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .” brings in the “objective” point of view. Here we distinguish between the person’s “consciousness-and-‘I’” in conversations at a particular period of time and the “single consciousness-and-‘I’” that she thinks she is in every period of her life. To a considerable extent a person’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’” can be an object of research because portraits based on interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452852">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2001</xref>) tend to try to give impressions of a larger portion of the participant’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’” at the time of the interviews. In more developed studies, it is quite clear that aspects from childhood, for example, that play a role now at the time of the interviews may have been present already years earlier but would probably have played a much less (or much more) significant role then than they do now (the section “The ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .”). And longitudinal studies sometimes show that a self-understanding caught in a portrait at a particular time continues to unfold but has assumed a more essential, pervasive form (also the section “The ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .”).</p>
<p>Obviously, all an individual ever experiences is her own “consciousness-and-‘I’,” and all she sees and understands is from within herself as a “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” In spite of this, an individual’s subjectivity is usually treated only in terms of how that individual differs in her attitudes, feelings, and internal ways of being from typical or otherwise assumed to be well-known social-cultural attitudes, feelings, and ways of being. The conception of a “single consciousness-and-‘I’” is an effort to see the individual’s subjective reality entirely as a reality of its own, as consciousness indivisibly combined with “I,” neither formulated in terms of variations from a culture nor formulated using the conceptual tools and presuppositions of Western culture. In the West, it is very difficult to think about subjective experience and consciousness without Western assumptions about consciousness, for example, consciousness and memory are effects of physical phenomena in the body and nervous system, and without having these embedded in some kind of “objective” framework of space and time (which likewise reflects Western suppositions). The arguments in the sections “A ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .,” “Consciousness of Self-Evolution,” and “The Pervasive Consciousness . . .” for a “single consciousness-and-‘I’” are based only on individual subjective experience, and on very general understandings that are likely to be found in one form or another in almost every culture, in order to gain an understanding of human nature that is independent of cultural notions. Cultural knowledge and society all arise within the individual’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” And the same is true for whatever inner self-development the individual is engaged in, even enlightenment. Buddha talks both about his experiences “while I was a Bodhisattva” and how he “won freedom from bonds” and “won Nirvana,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800412452852">1</xref></sup> and so forth.</p>

<title>A “Single Consciousness-and-‘I’”—Remembering Significant Experiences and Times of One’s Life</title>
<p>How do we begin to indicate such a vast thing as “being the same “consciousness-and-‘I’ ever since one can remember”? There are many aspects involved in this. In this and the next two sections we focus only on three that we often encounter in our qualitative research projects and that give us pause for thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800412452852">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section4-1077800412452852">
<title>Remembering learning French with a small group of high school friends</title>
<p>Even when a person just thinks of an experience she has had in the past, she may feel that <italic>she</italic> (referring to “herself now”) had that experience <italic>because</italic> she remembers the feeling, the consciousness <italic>she</italic> had then, the state <italic>she was in</italic> at that time. To show there is something unusual in this, we take a concrete example from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz (2006)</xref>. Susan was a young woman in her early 30s and an English as a second language (ESL) instructor at a University. She was interviewed by one of the senior author’s students, Miss Rosa M. Rosas, for a class project. The two women were friends and Miss Rosas wanted to find out how the subject matter that a teacher taught—here ESL—figured in the teacher’s larger self, her general nature as a person, or who she was in terms of her values and ideals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz (2006)</xref> gives four quotes from the first interview which “was mostly devoted to . . . how Susan related to language. How did she feel about language, how did she get into studying other languages and teaching ESL, what was it that attracted her in language and teaching language, and so on” (p. 251). (This and the following quotes in this section are all from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>). For the first quote Miss Rosas asked “what fascinated you about language” and Susan responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>[1] It is kind of special. . . . In high school there was a small group of us who <italic>wanted to keep studying</italic> French. It was kind of <italic>cool</italic>. It was just our little group and we were just learning it. <italic>We were the ones excited about it</italic> and <italic>we could speak to each other in French</italic>, and then, I also like to read in another language. I found it really fun and challenging to, say, to read a story, and, say, “Oh wow, I understood,” you know. “I can read the story and it’s not in English.” Uhm, so I thought it was fun and exciting. (Susan, tape 1: 8). (p. 251)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This has to be taken in the context of the interview. Susan knew that the object of the interview was to help her friend understand how it was that she got into teaching language, which she loves, and she evidently responds to Miss Rosa’s “what fascinated you . . .”: learning French in high school with several of her friends was indeed “fascinating.” And we are immediately in the mysteries (or shall we say, in the woods) of “one single consciousness-and-‘I’.”</p>
<p>Her relation to language, she says, was “special”; it started in high school with an experience that was equally “special.” And she proceeds to almost “relive the experience.” But of course she does not “relive it” in detail (an hour a week for a semester, whatever); rather she relives the spirit, the atmosphere, the consciousness in this period. She obviously enjoys reliving it, “relishes” it, related to but different from the way she did then. One can hear it in the nuances, the wording of phrases, and the way the phrases are said (“[we] <italic>wanted to keep studying</italic> French,” “<italic>It was cool,” “We [in our small group] were the ones excited about it</italic>,” “<italic>we could speak to each other in French</italic>”). It is as if she is still the high school girl with her clique of girlfriends trying to say sentences in French, keenly aware of and enjoying “operating in” and “walking around in” the other culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>But how can we now hear the high school girl when she is a very mature woman in her early 30s? (Or how is it that there is this high school girl in her now?) How is it that we hear “There is a joy and quintessential feeling of being in the group and doing French that must go back to that period” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>, p. 252)? Actually, the nuances in the passage that we hear now all <italic>relate</italic> to the original experience: they express and highlight the magic that went on in weeks and months back then; they convey the essential consciousness; they are not “replays” of what went on, not “exact memories.” But, all that is obviously from the point of view of her “consciousness-and-‘I’” now, today. The whole supposed “memory” (or what is often called “a memory”) is an essential expression of the present “consciousness-and-‘I’” “of what went on then,” “attuned” precisely to the significance it has for the person she feels herself to be today (at the time of the interviews): she is explaining how language came to mean to her what it does today. In addition, it is modulated for appropriateness as a response at this point in the conversation.</p>
<p>So in general the point is that the person I feel I am today (in this current period in my life, say early fall of 2011) is subtly in unity with all my memories of my experiences in the past, my present state of consciousness is some sense a oneness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800412452852">3</xref></sup> And the same was true at the time when I had the experience then. How is it that I feel with conviction “I am the same person as the person I was then,” or that I can still “feel how I felt then?” The feeling of self or “I” is in unity with consciousness in a natural way, and the fact that I feel today I am the same person as then is a genuine phenomenon that suggests that a human being’s subjectivity being conceived of as “a single-consciousness-and-‘I’” is epistemologically and existentially primary over all “constructions” of culture and society such as language, memory, and so forth. This way of formulating the problem is suggested by and resonates with Sai Baba’s writings and discourses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412452852">Witz, in press</xref>). For example, Sai Baba teaches that “everything is Consciousness,” where “Consciousness” (<italic>Caitanya</italic>) includes the consciousness in enlightenment, union with God, as well as the states of waking, dream, and sleep, and he often points out that although a person goes through childhood, adulthood, and old age, she remains the same person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800412452852">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Susan’s experience in Korea: “Reliving the growth of her self in Korea.”</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz (2006)</xref> quotes four passages from Susan regarding how her attitudes and feelings connected with language evolved. We skip the second excerpt which concerned a few brief comments on her one year stay in France between her high school graduation and college and go directly to excerpt [3], about her experience in Korea after she graduated from college. In college Susan majored in English. After graduating she worked two and a half years doing research for a professor and then went to Korea to teach English for a year. When Miss Rosas asks her what language means to her, she brings up her experience in Korea to illustrate.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[2] (Susan:) Uhm, I think, well, it’s actually <italic>an opening</italic>. If you are learning second languages—like [if] I meet a Korean person for the first time, I can <italic>impress them with</italic> my Korean. <italic>We have more to talk about</italic>, because even if my Korean is not really, not that good we still have more to talk about in English, because <italic>I have had this experience</italic> of trying to learn Korean . . . so it’s <italic>a way of getting to know people</italic>. Actually <italic>it’s a bridge</italic> between you and other people even if you don’t speak it very well. Anybody you meet, even if you [just] say “hello, nice to meet you” in their language they are like, usually <italic>they are happy. they are like, “Oh wow</italic>, you made the effort to learn . . .” . . . and <italic>I felt the same way</italic> about English when I was overseas. Like when people would go out of their way to speak to me in English even if they didn’t have very much. You know, that was <italic>their way of being friendly</italic>, and so <italic>I thought that was cool. A friendly thing</italic> to be able to talk to somebody in their own language. (Susan, 1: 8). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>, p. 254)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At first blush, this seems to be just another example of “bringing up a memory,” similar to [1] above. But there are some significant differences. The whole passage is extraordinarily reflective. Susan is almost palpably reaching deeply into herself, into her current “consciousness-and-‘I’” to give Miss Rosas a feeling for what language means to her now, for everything in the answer has to come from within her. Compared to [1], the scope of awareness is much wider and the awareness itself has a different character.</p>
<p>She is talking about the feelings of both herself and of the people she is meeting and talking to. But above all, she is not simply describing an overall state as in [1]. Part of “the memory” is “experience of insight,” of becoming aware of and coming to embrace, encompass, include in herself the others’ feelings and reactions. One can almost hear her still feel the inner expansion both of her self (her “I”) and of her consciousness/awareness. It is as if she is re-experiencing this expansion and this becoming aware of people’s feelings in communication situations at a higher level. In one sense these are memories, and as such part of her today. On the other hand, these are also the convictions and feelings she has today, they are part of what language means to her today—they are part of her “consciousness-and-‘I’” today even though she is not the same person, the same “I” she was then. She is not the woman in her mid-20s who was at that time still trying to find a clear direction in her life. The experience then of seeing in language an “opening” to a larger “way of being” in communication situations was the beginning of seeing such a direction. For when she came back from Korea, she completed a masters’ degree in ESL and since then has taught ESL to foreign students from the university for about five years. But, “feeling language to be an opening between people” is still “part of her” (is still something she totally identifies with) today.</p>

<title>Consciousness of Self-Evolution</title>
<p>Reading between the lines in [2] one sees that the “expansion of consciousness and self” that Susan seems to have been experiencing in Korea was heralding a larger inspiration involving language and communication among human beings that may have played a significant role in her life since then. This is abundantly confirmed by an additional passage ([3] below) where she talks about her teaching ESL today (at the time of the interviews).</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[3] Miss Rosas (after [1] and a couple minutes of further conversation:)</speaker>
<p>Is teaching another language fun the same way that you learned French?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Susan:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I am sure. As a teacher it’s . . . sort of on a bigger scale. . . . (explains she is talking to students collectively, not individually) . . . I think the most fun thing is to listen to my students speak, and to encourage them. Mostly, just to hear what they have to say and hear them communicating in English and to be impressed by what they do and pull out and accomplish. So that to me is really fun and exciting, to hear them speaking and just to have a good environment in class where students feel like they can get questions [answered] whenever they want, and come up to me after class and ask . . . “can you help me use the pay phone.” . . . (Susan tape 1:8-9). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>, p. 255)</p>
</speech>
<p>Miss Rosas, still under the impact of [1], merely asks her whether teaching language is still fun for her today as it was in high school and Susan responds with the whole very detailed [3]!</p>
<sec id="section7-1077800412452852">
<title>Further growth in what language means to her</title>
<p>We see some of the same things that we saw in [2] in the previous section, only now they seem to be more noticeable and striking. <italic>She is sure</italic> it is as much fun as then, but look what is most fun today that however compares with the fun of French then: “the most fun thing is to listen to my students speak, and to encourage them”! In high school and in France, the fun was all herself speaking French, and in Korea it was her speaking the other’s language, Korean. Now when she is teaching ESL at the university, “the most fun thing is to listen to my students speak and to encourage them”—not to speak herself exclusively, and not to listen to them master another language like English. This is not for its own sake, but is rather combined with “encouraging them.” <italic>She knows</italic> that the fun that this last passage [3] suggests for her today is connected with the fun <italic>she felt</italic> with these other things when younger learning French and Korean. This example of “judging sameness and continuity of me feeling” goes beyond the examples in the last section. Listening to her speak in the rest of the excerpt, the other things that are fun to her now, “. . . just to hear what they have to say . . . hear them communicating in English . . . to be impressed by what they do and pull out and accomplish. . . . just to have a good environment in class where students feel like they can get questions [answered]” all show a little of the same consciousness of experiencing greater awareness as we saw in the last section.</p>

<sec id="section8-1077800412452852">
<title>Susan’s awareness-understanding of her evolution in [1], [2] and [3] (or her “self-understanding” indicated in these passages) is a significant aspect of her “single consciousness-and-‘I’” today</title>
<p>Now while in [2] there was just a memory of experience (language as an “opening”) that is still part of her today, [3] suggests that the inspiration that can be heard in the overall tone, and so forth, in [2] has evolved into a much larger aspect, and the awareness and understanding of this evolution is very much part of her “consciousness-and-‘I’” today. The new passage [3] enables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz (2006)</xref> to argue that the three passages [1], [2], and [3] and the way they came up during the interview (they are all rather unexpectedly fully developed, rather elaborate responses to simple questions) show the evolution in Susan of a single moral-ethical ideal, dedication, and commitment—all three in one. For us here the point is not Susan’s evolution in some objective sense, however, but the fact that she is completely aware of this evolution, that she regards it as the evolution of herself, of herself as a person, and that she feels that there has been a continuity in her inner feelings about language along these lines since her year in Korea. Similarly, her experiences in high school are also part of this evolution. Normally one would say that [1], [2], and [3] together represent part of her current “self-understanding.”</p>
<p>Obviously, implicit in the completely natural, spontaneous, and unquestioning conviction regarding the three passages is a sizeable single consciousness-<italic>cum</italic>-self-conviction that includes maybe hundreds of details connecting then and now. The same topic “what has language come to mean to me” might come up many times talking with friends. One can imagine her going back to her feelings and memories from these periods and, creatively, give other examples expressing the same conviction-self-understanding and feelings in this area. Similarly, the inspiration that can be felt in [2], to make the effort to speak in the other’s native language even if one makes mistakes, to make the other (if only for a moment) more comfortable, this feeling for the other, appears in excerpt [3] expanded into an overall attitude in her. The entire focus in [3] is concern not just for their English but for them making their way speaking English here in this to them foreign country, trying to encourage them in their enterprise (“appreciating them,” “enhancing them”).</p>
<p>So the “self-understanding” indicated in [1], [2], and [3] is not just a set of “memories” and “beliefs,” not just a set of “narratives” and feelings “about” herself. It is not just a “perspective,” but a specific consciousness, experienced as an indivisible whole, that she might get into on many different occasions (in a conversation, listening to a talk at a meeting) and savor for many seconds or minutes. This consciousness is a unity (oneness) of herself-being and conscious-conviction-about-herself. Obviously this kind of larger understanding of oneself goes quite a bit beyond simply having memories of oneself and of oneself feeling things in particular situations, as in the last section. It implies a larger awareness of one’s relationship to a well-known arena in life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800412452852">4</xref></sup> Of course we have to distinguish the individual’s subjective state and expression in the interview—her “consciousness-and-‘I’” there—from the “single consciousness-and-‘I’” she believes herself to be at the time of the interviews, which is a “part” of the whole phenomenon/subjective reality of “a single consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood on.” But there is little doubt that Susan’s self-understandings in [1], [2], and [3] are all part of the latter. There is never any question that she feels she is today the same person she was in high school, in France, and in Korea.</p>

<title>The Pervasive Consciousness Felt With a Higher Aspect Is Part of How One Feels Oneself to Be a “Single Consciousness-and-‘I’”</title>
<p>There is still something in Susan’s understanding of her own experience and her self represented by excerpts [1], [2], and [3] that we have so far not taken into account and which, in our view, appears ultimately as the most important. This is the fact that many of the things Susan says in [2] and [3] have moral-ethical and spiritual connotations and that in fact [1], [2], and [3] together explain how it is that teaching ESL in the university has become for her a pervasive moral-spiritual activity. Imagine, for example, we regard her talking in these excerpts mostly as talking about how good she was with languages and how much she enjoyed them and that certain experiences made her realize that there were a whole career and social opportunities for her in that direction. Then this could still be her enthusiastic self-understanding, and all the things we said about her understanding herself in the last two sections above would still be true. But this would be ignoring the many indications of genuine moral-ethical or spiritual inspiration, and moral involvement and fulfillment. With the overtones in [3] of unassuming, unselfish dedication to her students today, of serving them, the three excerpts together take on a much larger importance. Susan is here not just talking about why Language is interesting and fun, she is talking about how Language is for her a vehicle for actualizing “higher” moral-ethical or metaphysical value (principle, ideal) and commitments in her life, what in portraits developed using the essentialist philosophy are called “higher aspects” in the participant, that is, higher moral, social, and religious or spiritual values, principles, and commitments, which serve as vehicles for inner development in a person’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Higher aspects are found in more than half of the portraits and individual case studies developed using essentialist portraiture principles and are of singular importance in human life. A simple example of a “higher aspect in a person” is John, a junior in college in chemistry, saying “Science is more the study of truth, the absolute truth of how things work.” He realized this in high school chemistry, and now he was studying to become a high school chemistry teacher to teach chemistry with this perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2010</xref>). In other words, “absolute truth of how things work” has become to him a “higher ideal,” and “Chemistry is trying to get at the absolute truth of how things work” has become for him the vehicle to develop an understanding of this truth and to share this with his students. Witz et al. discussed the nature of “higher aspects” particularly in cases where a complex of “higher aspects” has unfolded (developed) in the person to the point where it is a single dominant aspect in many domains of her life (family, job, social life, other roles in society, etc.). One of their main examples is Caroline, a high school science teacher (the original portrait is in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452852">Lee, 2006</xref>). When Ms. Lee asked her to tell more about her “faith,” she responded, “God is to me like breathing,” and then elaborated,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s very personal but it’s also, it’s my job as a Christian to reflect my faith and to reflect my God to everybody else. That’s my job. Okay? I do it while I’m being a teacher. [Being] a teacher is not my primary responsibility. My primary responsibility is to live the way I’ve been instructed to live. Do what I am supposed to do. That’s my first job. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2010</xref>, p. 399)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For cases of this kind, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz et al. (2010)</xref> argue that as the person develops and gets older, the higher aspect in her evolves into a single “subtle pervasive inner consciousness” in which all the particular experiences and realizations that played a role in its development have vanished, but which is nevertheless manifest (is present and implicitly participates) in innumerable behaviors in innumerable situations in the person’s daily living. This consciousness is experienced as “pervasive,” “pervasive in herself,” “present” (and “felt”) innumerable times; she feels all kinds of subtle things and insights connected with it (in the classroom, taking care of and being with her family, etc.), and it is “a single thing,” across different occasions. Actually such a “subtle pervasive consciousness” associated with a higher aspect like John’s “absolute truth of how things work” in situations when he talks about science and truth, even though it is not pervasive, is in many other domains.</p>
<p>It seems that the “subtle pervasive consciousness associated with a higher aspect” represents a particular, particularly important way of feeling one is a “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” For example, a natural way for John to describe himself as a person might be to say that he studying chemistry and that he wants to be a high school chemistry teacher to show his students “how things really work.” For Caroline, one can argue from the full portrait in Lee’s dissertation that she is feeling herself to be the pervasive consciousness-and-‘I’ that is her “faith.” More generally these examples suggest that in general, individuals who try to actualize higher aspects in their life tend to experience themselves as a more “unified” “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” Excerpts [2] and [3] suggest that Susan’s understanding of language and her actualizing this understanding in her teaching and other social situations represents a higher aspect in her that plays a significant role in her understanding of herself as a “a single consciousness-and-‘I’.” In fact it turns out that she is a deeply committed Christian and this higher aspect is part of and in unity with that.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077800412452852">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>The “<italic>Single</italic> Consciousness-and-‘I’” Portrayed in Portraits</title>
<p>In general, portraits a la <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452852">Lawrence-Lightfoot and Davis (1997)</xref> tend to give impressions of some portion of the participant’s “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” at the time of the interviews or observations. In the last three sections, we used excerpts from research using the “Participant as Ally—Essentialist Portraiture” philosophy and methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452852">Witz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">2010</xref>) because in this approach the very aim is to give a sense of the participant’s “feeling, consciousness, state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452852">Witz et al., 2001</xref>), and thus of her present “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” Virtually all aspects of the interview philosophy, and the various kinds of the efforts used to try to become aware of deeper aspects in significant passages (as, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>) that show how the participant feels, sees things, and is inspired, and so forth, represent efforts to become directly aware of her “consciousness-and-‘I’” at the time of the interviews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077800412452852">6</xref></sup> And the portrait as a whole fashioned on this basis is then supposed to communicate something of that individual’s whole “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077800412452852">7</xref></sup> at the time of the interviews, reaching back in her personal history. Obviously these portraits require a lot more “objective information” to complement the participant’s account—external conditions and events are mentioned whenever relevant so that the reader is aware of them. But every effort is made to have the individual’s “subjective expressions” appear as much as possible as she thinks she experienced them and experiences them now, free from investigator ideas of any “influence” that putative external conditions may have had on the participant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077800412452852">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, published portraits and portraits in dissertations and other documents do not usually give an idea of a participant’s <italic>whole</italic> “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’,” only of a part of it that is connected with the current research topic (e.g., “how it is that I became a great math teacher”). In addition, in essentialist portraits the image given by the portrait as a whole is necessarily combined with the larger perspective of the researcher-portraitist and the latter’s own moral or other deeper commitment to both the topic and to truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412452852">Witz, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800412452852">2008</xref>). But although written portraits are thus quite limited representations, they do show an individual’s “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” in a concrete form as a coherent and unified phenomenon-entity, available for discussion to other researchers and the general reader. It is in this way that a “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” can be an object of study across individuals and specific contexts.</p>
<p>Finally we should emphasize that in our experience, the Ally—Essentialist Portraiture approach suggests that actually every person exemplifies the phenomenon of a “single consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood on.” Every human being can be considered a completely unified subjectivity, living every moment in her subjective world, and constantly understanding herself in new ways from childhood on. And by following scrupulously the principles of the approach (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>), the portrait almost automatically gives some idea of the participant’s “single consciousness-and-‘I’,” although the latter may not be as beautifully unified, with participants as beautifully aware, and so forth, as the examples in the last three sections. For example, Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452852">Kuchinke (2005)</xref>, adapting a model in J. Martin’s (1992) <italic>Cultures in organizations: Three perspectives</italic>, distinguishes three perspectives of the self at work. First, theories “written from an integration perspective,” which “emphasize unity, harmony, and consistency of the person and his or her relationship to work,” where “an overriding sense of direction or purpose is described,” all exemplifying Martin’s emphasis on “consciousness, autonomy, free will and self-control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452852">Kuchinke 2005</xref>, pp. 145-146). Second, “differentiation perspectives of self and work,” which “admits to the discussion the existence of multiple aspects of the self and arrays of priorities and goals,” as well as “divergent interests, life goals and social roles,” “negotiation, compromise, and choice . . . [and] inconsistencies, conflict [among these] . . .” (Kuchinke, p. 147). And third, “the fragmentation perspective,” which removes the “however tenuous” “level of unity” among the multiple aspects of the self assumed by differentiation perspectives and focuses “instead on flux, multiplicity of meaning, discontinuity and lack of simplicity and predictability of the self” (Kuchinke, p. 148). This last perspective is said to be represented in several postmodern theories of the self at work. Obviously the examples in the sections “A ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .,” “Consciousness of Self-Evolution,” and “The Pervasive Consciousness . . .” above all illustrate an integration perspective. But our experience in the Ally-Essentialist Portraiture approach suggests overwhelmingly that even if it seems that participants and the culture of the organization they are in might at first glance be described using a differentiation or even fragmentation perspective, the portrait will show a “single consciousness-and-‘I’.” That is, if one puts away one’s own categories and truly listens to how the participant in her subjective world sees herself (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>), the portrait will show a self-understanding, a “single consciousness-and-‘I’,” that has an incredible consistency (unity), that involves <italic>some</italic> higher aspects (although perhaps not as beautifully, deeply, and pervasively developed as in Susan, Caroline, etc.) and that exemplifies the “phenomenon” of a single consciousness-and-‘I’” from childhood on. (It is simply a fact that higher aspects in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452852">Witz et al. (2010)</xref> occur fused with all kinds of other motivations—self-centered profit, status and position in the organization, relationships, Religious Fundamentalism, etc.). We think of the “single consciousness-and-‘I’” from childhood on as a completely universal phenomenon that characterizes human beings in every culture (even nonliterate), regardless whether the language has a subject-verb-object structure (which favors “I”). (Of course all this needs to be carefully investigated!)</p>
<sec id="section11-1077800412452852">
<title>Changes in a person’s “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” in time</title>
<p>Typically, significant events in life get thought about innumerable times and, in the course of time, their significance for the participant is constantly transformed. Typically also, quite a bit of this transformation still shows at different times in the interviews. We illustrate this with an example from Bae’s (2008) dissertation. Bae interviewed 17 young adults aged 17 to 25 who had dropped out of high school earlier but who were now trying to get more education (a GED or a high school diploma) to talk about their experience dropping out. One of her participants was a 19-year-old African American female, Maggie. When Maggie was two years old, she was in a car crash where she almost died and she still has scars from it today. Of the actual event, and the actual experience of the car crash at age two is presumably buried, she is unlikely to have many conscious memories of it, but in her childhood it must have played a big role in her mind and feelings. In the first interview Maggie had mentioned casually that she thought she was “just blessed to be here” (Bae, p. 80). When Bae asked her about this in the second interview, she explained. She “was raised in the church,” and it seems there was often talk that she must have survived the car crash for a reason. “And while I was in church, I got baptized in the seventh grade. And it was a great experience because I felt like maybe I was supposed to be here for a reason” (all quotes from Excerpt 5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452852">Witz &amp; Bae, 2011</xref>). In her sophomore year in High School her mother “was incarcerated, went to jail” and she and her two siblings moved in with her grandmother. “We was in a one-bedroom apartment. It was rough on her because all her kids were grown, and now, all of a sudden, she got all three of her grandchildren.” They moved to a two-bedroom apartment. She had not gotten along well with her mother, and with her grandmother she “really didn’t get along either. Because I’m just like my mom; I’m stubborn. I don’t like to listen. I like to do my own thing. So, it’s like I just had to go out into the world before I got grown, and see what the world was like” ([4] in Bae, p. 87), and she decided to move in with friends and leave school. A couple years later, when she was 18, her uncle who had been her trusted friend since childhood suddenly died. Two weeks after the funeral it “hit her” that he was gone and that awakened her to the fact that she had to take care of herself and do what she had to. She “was raised in the church, so it’s like I know what I need to do, the value of the church, about God, and His born son, and why He gave His life . . .,” (Excerpt 5 in Witz &amp; Bae, same as Bae, 2008, p. 87). It seemed as if all the good seeds from her early upbringing in church came out. Now she felt “I needed to respect myself. I needed to respect my mom, even though we don’t get along. I wanted to get to know my family more, because you never know,” and so forth. (Bae, p. 87).</p>
<p>Now at age 19, when she is back trying to get her GED, she remembers her decision to leave school this way:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[4] Maggie:</speaker>
<p>. . . Well, living with my grandmother that goes to church everyday, goes to Bible study, goes to choir rehearsal, has a good job and has her own car and her own house, it’s like, “okay, I want to be like that one day.” Maybe not yet . . . And I was like, okay, my grandmother did this good, [inaudible] and my mom did that [inaudible]. So, maybe I need to go to see the world, not as in the atmosphere of the world, but how things work and how the job works and how renting and owning. Oh, my goodness! It is crazy. I was like, okay. I ran away [after a year]. I ran to a friend’s house. And I was partying and going out and being around people I’ve never been around before.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>You were so . . . I mean that’s not like you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Maggie:</speaker>
<p>Exactly. I used to be the type of person that stayed with the church and went to choir practice. And went to a Bible study. I did a little partying, but not a lot. And once I got around other people—you get influenced quickly. You want to be in the <italic>in crowd</italic>. You want to be popular. You want to do everything that they’re doing because if they’re popular, then you’re gonna be popular with them. So, I was just like, “Okay, let me try this out.” It was crazy . . . (Bae, 2nd interview, p.8)</p>
</speech>
<p>The portrait as a whole shows the portion of Maggie’s whole “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” connected with her dropping out very much from her <italic>present</italic> point of view. If she had told Bae her story a few years earlier while she was “partying and going out,” and so forth, the childhood “memories” of the car crash, of “growing up in church,” and even of “knowing what she had to do” would presumably have been there but she might have never mentioned them because they would have had little significance for her at that time. But now they are a very strong part of her self-understanding. Then she might also have said that she needed to “go see the world,” but the way she talks about it in excerpt [4] above suggests that now it has a different meaning than it might have had then: Maybe I need to go to see the world, not as in the atmosphere of the world [which may have been the big factor then], but [to go see] how things work and how the job works and how renting and owning. At the same time there is no question she is the same person then as now.</p>

<title>The “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” in longitudinal studies</title>
<p>Presumably every qualitative researcher who writes portraits has been inspired by Lawrence-Lightfoot’s discussion of a painting made 25 years earlier when she was a young woman: “In the portrait of the young woman for example I could see myself at twenty five but I could also see my ancestors and the children in my future. . . . [The portrait] is still a vital document of who I am (and who I may become) even if it no longer looks like me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452852">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>, p. 4). However, studies in which the researcher meets a participant from an earlier study and tries to see how the “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” of hers in the portrait he had developed then has unfolded since are almost nonexistent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077800412452852">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following example is from a study of a former high school teacher that Goodwin interviewed in 1997 for his dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452852">Goodwin, 1999</xref>) and whom he was able to interview again in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412452852">Goodwin, 2012</xref>). In the 1999 study Goodwin interviewed and developed in-depth portraits of four teachers to get a fuller understanding of their combined personal and professional growth. One of his participants was Beth, a high school Social Studies teacher. The follow-up interview with her (FI) in 2011 focused on her life course since 1997 and her deeper motivations and values related to her educational work. First is a brief sketch of some aspects of Beth as they appear in her portrait in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452852">Goodwin (1999)</xref> and then a description of how these aspects have been unfolding as this appeared in the follow-up interview.</p>
<p>Beth grew up in a small town with a younger sister in a loving family. In college she went into a 5-year program to earn a master’s in secondary education-social studies and started teaching in the St. Louis metropolitan area. The 1999 portrait evokes a completely amazing picture of a unity of teaching and larger life, reflecting an equally amazing inner unity in her. For example, when speaking about what she wants for her students:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[5] Beth:</speaker>
<p>. . . So, I try to remind them of the, the, enjoy, that life can be enjoyable (light laugh) if you just, care and, be happy about it, and, instead of being</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>G:</speaker>
<p>(interrupts:) So you are really giving a lot of yourself. (B: Um-hm, yes I do) Not just, not just taking a teaching stance, (B: Um-hm) or a teaching role, but this is you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Beth:</speaker>
<p>(quickly, very firm:) Right, this is what I do, this is my (with a slight self-consciousness laugh) whole life, this is my person, its all (voice begins to soften:) culminated into one, and, (in normal voice:) and I can’t separate it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452852">Goodwin, 1999</xref>, p. 212)</p>
</speech>
<p>Much of this reflected her upbringing in her family as well as her Christian faith. Her parents were always “wise about what they made me think” to examine her actions and to care; she “was always cared about” and she just saw “in [her] parents that [she] wanted to help people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452852">Goodwin, 1999</xref>, p. 205). She “didn’t know there was a choice not to [care]” until she left home and went to college (Goodwin, p. 223). The “negativity” she experienced there as well as her experience when she started teaching, however, only strengthened her “caring base.” Her awareness of unity and of her students as whole persons, like her, became central to her teaching. It meant building “the foundation of caring” in her classroom, to “try to give them each “the feeling that, you know, they’re cared about here, and that they can care about each other” (p. 229), and be “appreciated” for their uniqueness (p. 210). Understanding and being in touch with individual student “uniqueness” was central to her students being able to learn.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[6] Beth:</speaker>
<p>. . . so I think that’s what I try to instill in my students [that Beth cares about their learning], that they can come and talk to me about whatever they want, ahm, but my first goal is that they learn, that they learn about themselves, and that they can learn to express themselves, and, ahm, whether they like me or not, that’s not important. But when they leave my class I want them to feel like they’ve learned enough that they are better citizens than they were when they came in, just because they are more in touch, more in touch with themselves. (Goodwin, p. 209)</p>
</speech>
<p>There is strength and certainty in her voice. She has no doubt that caring for her students, and the welfare of humanity more generally, is right. She is focused on students “learn[ing] about themselves” and getting “more in touch with themselves.” She opens herself to them; they can talk to her “about whatever they want.” She envelops her students with care so they can better see who they are.</p>
<p>Now, 14 years later, Beth is married, has two young children. She had continued teaching for 10 more years, but while still teaching went to get a second master’s degree, in counseling, and is currently in her fourth year as a high school counselor. She explained her shift to counseling by the fact that when she was teaching, she was also counseling: “I was counseling in the classroom and after school and before school. Kids would come and hang out and so I was somebody they felt they could come to and talk about problems” (FI). “Mastering the curriculum” as a teacher became “secondary to what I was doing (counseling her students)” and she felt perhaps she could “get some better training” to enhance her helping skills. When Goodwin asked her about her deeper motivations related to her now being more able to advocate “for the kids” as a counselor she responded,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[7] Beth:</speaker>
<p>. . . again, my motivation is that I want the best for these kids. And, part of that is my own personal belief system. . . . (talks about currently working with a depressed and suicidal student to help him to feel better about himself.) . . . I want them to be at peace . . . and feel like they are doing what they are meant to do . . . or “be comfortable with who you are, advocate for yourself, get help when feeling this way,” making sure they know how to care about others and themselves. (about 18 minutes into the follow-up interview)</p>
</speech>
<p>Obviously, this represents a natural continuation of her direction fourteen years earlier. But there is a new element: the use of the term “peace”: thinking about the suicidal boy reminds her she wants her students “to be at peace.” Goodwin felt the term touched exactly what he had tried to grasp and put in words in the original portrait. To him it was unmistakable (although checking later showed “peace” had not been part of the portrait write-up.) and he responded, “One thing I struggled with, tried to understand, was, when we talked in the past, was your level of comfort, peace with yourself . . . you seem to be all together “ (FI). Beth laughed when she heard “being all together,” and Goodwin reframed his question in terms of “inner peace of a sort, harmony, a depth (Beth: Right) that keeps you together.” (FI)</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[8] Beth:</speaker>
<p>. . . (describes more about her Christianity and family background) . . . Just that background of knowing that I always had a family to go home to that was going to accept me no matter what I did or whether I was together or completely falling apart. There was that, that peace in my own life that I had that family to go to and too, with my religious beliefs that Christ was going to be there for me and love me no matter what.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>G:</speaker>
<p>You can see that in the students you are working with or the others, (Beth: Yeah.) You can see the spiritual aspect?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Beth:</speaker>
<p>Right, right. You can definitely tell when kids aren’t at peace with whatever their religious background is. There’s still a whole emotional social side to kids that affect everything they do. Obviously, I work in a public school so I’m not really allowed to push my beliefs on anybody, but in the whole sense of that, the kids sense,</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>G:</speaker>
<p>(interrupts.) They must feel that . . . . (elaborates, Beth agrees)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Beth:</speaker>
<p>(thoughtfully) I hope they feel that. You know, I think some people do. . . . I have always been, very much, tried to share that love that comes from within me, ahm, to other people without it being based on what they believe or where they come from. Ahm, just to give them a sense of, “people do care about you and just because you don’t have the family base that I have, you know you are always welcome here, you’re always welcome to come back and see me, or say ‘Hi.’ I am always going to care about you no matter what you do.” And, I think kids do sense that about me. (FI)</p>

<p>There is a whole new more subtle, deeper level of self understanding and understanding others. It seems she has become aware that the extraordinary the-whole-room-filling selfless caring that she already had at the time of the 1999 portrait reflects the very unusual level of love in her family (a family that “was going to accept me no matter what I did or whether I was together or completely falling apart” seems very rare). And the question in the conversation [8] for both her and Goodwin is to what extent this is recognized by the students (“And, I think the kids do sense that about me.”). There is no question that the original 1999 portrait “is still a vital document of who I am (and who I may become) even if it no longer looks like me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452852">Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>, p. 4). And the excerpts show some of the unfolding of the “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” at that time to the “single-consciousness-and-‘I’” she is today.</p>

<title>Larger Issues</title>
<p>In the sections “A ‘Single Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .” and “Consciousness of Self-Evolution” we discussed our subject in terms of subjective individual experience only, without any detailed reference to the external world. In the section, “The Pervasive Consciousness . . .” we used the notion of the “pervasive inner consciousness associated with a higher aspect,” which appears in many more in-depth essentialist portraits; this presupposes some cultural knowledge of the external circumstances of the individual’s life but only at a very general level. Only in the section “The ‘<italic>Single</italic> Consciousness-and-‘I’ . . .” did we start to monitor the use of an objective frame of reference by investigator and participant. All this was deliberate: we tried to develop the conception of a “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” as a single “realm of consciousness only,” to emphasize that in a sense it has as much or even more “reality” as the usual conceptions of individual, society, the world, and cosmos cultivated in a culture or implicit in public discourse. An individual’s “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” is the actuality that encompasses her constant direct experience her whole life long. We are motivated to develop this conception in this manner because we believe it provides a new, extremely powerful starting point for addressing various fundamental larger issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077800412452852">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section14-1077800412452852">
<title>A truer and more respectful understanding of a person’s own experience and understanding of herself, and thus a truer understanding of her as a whole person</title>
<p>First, a “single consciousness-and-‘I’ from childhood on” as a representation of “the way a human being subjectively is” seems needed to address the whole problem of understanding human beings in their own terms, in terms of their experience in their subjective world during the day, and in the ways they subjectively understand themselves. This is the area that is typically dealt with in terms of “the kind of person the other is inside,” “self,” “identity,” intellectual, social, moral, spiritual development and growth, and “transcendence,” and the “existential condition” of the human being. Issues in these areas are the bread and butter of portraiture. One question we pose to our research participants in innumerable ways is “how is it that you have become the kind of such and such person that you are today?” (e.g., “how is it that you, who are now in your forties, after so many years of family life and working different jobs, have just become a middle school teacher,” Brown, 2011). Typically the answer is always one of a particular personality, with particular traits and abilities, and with a “consciousness-and-‘I’” that can be heard in many significant passages, constantly combining with external conditions and events (perceived by the participant in a certain way) to yield further “consciousness-and-‘I’.” And the picture of (the development of) self and of the person as a whole that emerges is one of a “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’,” <italic>within</italic> which her “consciousness-and-‘I’” constantly and cumulatively transforms in a stream of putative external conditions, events, and influences, with the person always seeing everything with her own eyes and aware of many aspects and continuities in her self and in her being. There is never any doubt that the current “consciousness-and-‘I’” is all the time the same person. It is in this way that the researcher begins to see and understand the realities of the higher aspects in the individual and how it is that she became and is that way. A teacher says “I really feel that in my teaching I have been able to actualize my goals for what I can do for the kids.” “I have become a better person,” and so forth. All the depths that exist in a person can be seen in the “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” she thinks she is.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077800412452852">
<title>A starting point for examining culture, society, worldview, knowledge, consciousness</title>
<p>But apart from more truly understanding the other person and deeper aspects of her life (higher aspects), we are also motivated by other more general issues. In an obvious sense there exists for the individual only her own constant consciousness and self, her own constant subjective experience and subjective world, and nothing else. It is customary to conceive of and describe this “subjective side of human existence” in terms of “subjective experience” of things, or of how things were at certain period in life, “awareness of” certain things, facts, states of affairs, “subjective states” one may be in for a time, and so forth. But in this kind of approach the understanding of subjectivity is fragmented and limited, and the human being is above all only understood subjectively by means references to a putative outside situation, (i.e., a situation assumed to be “commonly understood” by the reader); in ordinary discourse, references to “the real world” or stereotypic subjective experience; or in qualitative research, by references to an outside situation as understood by the researcher, and so forth.</p>
<p>We have been articulating the individual’s “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” as a single existent and as a whole—an entity of “consciousness-and-‘I’” only but which one nevertheless can come to “know” (maybe with a lot of effort) —in order to be able to address still more fundamental issues. For example, Cooley’s “Principle of Sympathetic Introspection” can be read as saying that it is possible for any person to assimilate another’s “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” to some extent into her own regardless of language and culture, regardless of whether she has a severe disability, and regardless whether the other is in any other way exceptional. (cf. “In this way he is more or less able to understand—always by introspection—children, idiots, criminals, rich and poor, conservative and radical—any phase of human nature not wholly alien to his own. . . .,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412452852">Cooley, 1909/1956</xref>, p. 7). We hope to be able eventually to suggest that merely speaking with another and understanding her intended meaning involves some “common” (“collective” or “group”) consciousness (or is it common “consciousness-and-‘I’”?). The oneness of the “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” reaches back at least to early childhood when the child learns to speak her first few words. And shared consciousness seems to be the basis of the “primary groups” of family <italic>a la</italic> Cooley (we would say “primary group consciousness”). Obviously this leads to a completely different, new understanding of human existence.</p>
<p>As another example, consider the fact that cultures differ in subtle but pervasive and profound ways in the exact way a person feels herself part of the physical or of the social world in which she lives. For example, there is the “modern Western consciousness” of a modern person who feels that she and all human beings are moving and living in a single common physical space-and-time (with space three dimensional and time linear forwards and backwards), which corresponds to an “objective Reality” of the physical world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077800412452852">9</xref></sup> This contrasts with say the consciousness in traditional American Indian or Australian Aboriginal culture. At this point, all attempts to understand the nature of the human being, of the world and existence, seem to be in the thrall of such subtle pervasive cultural conceptions. By starting with the conception of a “<italic>single</italic>-consciousness-and-‘I’” of the individual, it is possible to go beyond this condition.</p>

<p>As another example, the question “what is there for the individual after death?” is (at least not immediately) a question about an objective external world. Answers to this question may arise in the individual as part of her cultural or religious world view, but see Buddha’s statement that he “won the utmost security from bonds, Nirvana,” “deathlessness.” And still he said “when I was still a Bodhisttva . . .” He was still the same person, the same “I,” as before his enlightenment (Buddha in the Majjhima Nikaya, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412452852">Horner (1959/2004)</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>Similarly the epistemologically and existentially primary role of “I” or “Self” is articulated in the Upanishads and Vedanta as the Atma, and is at the heart of Sai Baba’s teaching. E.g., “the ‘I’ [experienced in ordinary life] has no basis in the body. It has to recognize its link with the Primary Source” (Discourse, October 9, 1997, “Discovering the Atma,” <italic>Sathya Sai Speaks</italic> v. 30, p. 235).</p></fn>

<p>Also a large subject. Developing a portrait involves the coordination of four types of understanding: the understanding that the investigator or portraitist gets from deeply listening to significant passages (or reflection on records of significant observations); the major images and understandings she creates and articulates in the portrait; the participant’s understanding that has to acknowledge the whole that the portrait communicates; and the reader’s understanding when she reads the portrait that has to recognize the investigator’s understanding that she is trying to communicate. The first two are part of the “consciousness-and-‘I’” of the investigator, the second part of the “consciousness-and-‘I’” of the participant, and the fourth part of the “consciousness-and-‘I’” of the reader.</p></fn>

<p>This particular whole “subtle and pervasive consciousness” is a modern development, starting with Copernicus and Galileo. Cf., “In the 19th and 20th century the expression “objective Reality” is used with a fundamentally changed meaning. . . . (It does not refer anymore to the Kantian-type notion . . .) . . . It denotes the Reality of objects outside consciousness.” Entry “Realitaet, formale/objective II” by J.
