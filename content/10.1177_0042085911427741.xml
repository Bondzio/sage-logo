<abstract>
<p>This instrumental case study reviews the 1994-2004 period of state financial oversight in East St. Louis, Illinois School District 189, with a secondary review of the initial years of NCLB implementation. Although the oversight panel’s fiscal management did generate financial stability, case findings indicate that its accountability processes did not result in sustained improvements in student achievement indicators despite anticipated links between the two in the panel’s reporting. Furthermore, the oversight process operated as a hierarchical structure without identification of cultural implications. Attention to culture and subsidiarity are indicated for future state–district partnerships oriented toward urban educational reform.</p>

<p>As scholars who prepare preservice teachers entering contemporary classrooms and who educate candidates for school administration, we are consistently reminded of the discord among educators and policy makers in defining “quality” education. Some argue that quality public schooling is primarily vocational education which prepares students for workforce readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085911427741">The Conference Board, Inc., The Partnership for 21st Century Skills, Corporate Voices for Working Families, &amp; The Society for Human Resource Management, 2006</xref>), whereas others argue that public schooling is a democratic process that prepares students for civic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427741">Carlson &amp; Gause, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427741">Gutmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427741">hooks, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911427741">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427741">Marshall &amp; Oliva, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911427741">McLaren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085911427741">Slattery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911427741">Spring, 2006</xref>). Amid these contested ideological definitions of quality public education, national, state, and local stakeholders are currently expected to frame public education using the accountability discourse that comes from and is generated by No Child Left Behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085911427741">NCLB, 2001</xref>) legislation. Following its signing in January 2002, this legislation has been hailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085911427741">Wanker and Christie (2005)</xref> as the “most comprehensive and systemic education reform passed by Congress in the last 40 years” (p. 57), by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427741">McDermott and Jensen (2005)</xref> as the “greatest extension to date of Federal authority over public school governance” (p. 39) and as the “most significant revision of federal education policy in decades” (p. 19).</p>
<p>As we are educational researchers who have followed the evolution of NCLB since its inception, we are particularly interested in ways that the preexisting accountability discourse which structured the federal legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085911427741">Skrla &amp; Scheurich, 2004</xref>) interacts with both educational governance and student achievement indicators. In other words, while the accountability discourse expresses an orientation toward raising student achievement, it simultaneously engages in questions of structuring and restructuring district and school governance. The connections between student academic achievement and governance are particularly important for urban schools because urban schools disproportionately serve students of color and low-income students who historically have not performed equal to their White or economically secure counterparts on standardized achievement tests. Consequently, urban schools face particular scrutiny from policy makers, administrators, and parents who equate academic success with high test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911427741">Fuller &amp; Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427741">Skrla, Scheurich, Johnson, &amp; Koschoreck, 2001</xref>). It is especially important, therefore, that researchers study these intersections of accountability, student achievement, and educational governance within urban contexts.</p>
<p>This case study examines the East St. Louis, Illinois, School District 189 during the years 1994-2006. It gives particular attention to accountability initiatives during the decade of state mandated financial oversight of the district (1994-2004) as well as the initial 4 years of NCLB implementation (2002-2006). In identifying East St. Louis as an urban school district, we resist the deficit paradigm which equates “urban students” with “at-risk students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427741">Adams &amp; Adams, 2004</xref>) and instead focus our inquiry on ways that educational accountability has been constructed and implemented in relation to the specific circumstances of this economically depressed, postindustrial community. The East St. Louis School District is a particularly important case study for three reasons: (a) state oversight occurred prior to and after the enactment of NCLB legislation, and, consequently, provides a historicized context for understanding accountability; (b) the forced appointment of the oversight panel incited intense discussion and resistance from local school board members who claimed that state oversight disenfranchised local citizens; and (c) the subsequent debate which centered on the “culture” of the district’s governance structure engenders questions about how culture is considered or ignored in accountability processes. This case study analysis complicates the notion of culture introduced by the financial oversight panel in its reporting, which focused on organizational dynamics within the district (personal communication, Robert Oakes, September 22, 2005), by extending the concept to include the political identities, positionalities, and histories of the community and geographic place from which the school district is constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427741">East St. Louis Oversight Panel, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911427741">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911427741">2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0042085911427741">
<title>Historical Context of East St. Louis</title>
<p>East St. Louis, which is located in Illinois and adjacent to St. Louis, Missouri, began as a center for Mississippi river trade, railroad activity, and westward expansion. During the early 20th century, when thousands of rural Black farmers migrated from the south, the community became an increasingly complex multiethnic city with residents who claimed African, Native, German, French, English, Spanish, and Czech heritages. With such ethnic and racial diversity, the city developed a unique identity predicated on collaboration and conflict and marked by tension between individual and collective identities.</p>
<p>In 1920, at the height of economic activity in East St. Louis, the city produced more aluminum than any other city in the world, was the nation’s second most active railroad center, and was the nation’s top manufacturer of roofing material. However, as these industries declined nationwide, the East St. Louis economic base suffered. The 1960s were characterized by a period of “white flight” in which White residents and businesses left the city in significant numbers. As industry employed a significant portion of the city’s residents, industry downsizing and plant closures in the 1970s and 1980s also forced may people to seek employment and residency elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911427741">Lumpkin, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427741">Kozol (1991)</xref> documented extensive fiscal and capital deterioration in the school district, highlighting the negative influence of such on meaningful and successful education. Today, East St. Louis is a city that has hundreds of abandoned and burned-out buildings. There is little commercial activity left in the community, with the exception of the gambling boat <italic>Casino Queen</italic>, and the area has become one of the most economically depressed municipalities in the Midwest. Despite a disproportionately high poverty rate and failing economic physical infrastructure, there remains a resilient and vocal activist community committed to urban renewal in East St. Louis. Many of these efforts have been organized in relation to hope for educational opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427741">Roseboro, O’Malley, &amp; Hunt, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the course of the 12 years represented in this study, the city’s population declined significantly. In 1994, there were 40,944 residents. By 2000, that number had dropped to 31,542, and by 2005, only 29,843 residents remained in the city. In the 1990s alone, the population declined by approximately 23% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427741">IDcide, 2008</xref>). The current residents in East St. Louis are 97.7% African American. Approximately 72.1% are high school graduates with only 11.8% holding college degrees. Thirty-eight percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line, and the median household income is US$21,393 (so full # = $21,393), which falls significantly below the Illinois median of US$53,974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085911427741">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In context, the decline of East St. Louis’s economic infrastructure reflects what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427741">Baker and Foote (2006)</xref> describe as more complicated spatial processes of the post–Civil Rights era in that “white flight” to suburban areas left inner-city school districts with concentrated populations of racial minority and poor students. With increased home construction and the availability of land in the suburbs, wealthier White families sought “refuge” in the suburbs and, as a result, inner-city school districts developed “magnet schools” with the hope that such schools would entice more affluent Whites back to urban centers. Baker and Foote add,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With the advent of neoliberal restructuring policies in the 1980s, these patterns of suburban development, urban decline, White and bright flight, and magnet responses were overlaid with a new regime of public policies that came with America’s entry into a more competitive, market-based, flexible, and globalized economy . . . No Child Left Behind legislation leaves the charter and corporate school strategies waiting in the wings for public schools that fail to meet prescribed standards (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). Meanwhile, outside the market, schools with parents and students who have little economic or <italic>cultural capacity</italic> [emphasis added] to choose are subjected to “enforced localization” (Bauman, 1998; Hargreaves, 2003), where failure is given zero tolerance and everyone’s performance is relentlessly measured, managed, and monitored through the spatial and political strategy of homogenization and standardization. (p. 99)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427741">Baker and Foote’s (2006)</xref> analysis embeds in the economic and policy discourse of urban school reform the idea of cultural capital, a theoretical metaphor which connects the personal enactment of culture with the structural processes of capitalism. This linkage suggests that school reform ought to be analyzed through constructs of cultural relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427741">Gay, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Delineating the Case: State Oversight in District 189 as an Accountability Enactment</title>
<p>By <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427741">1994</xref>, the year the state appointed a financial oversight panel in District 189, East St. Louis lacked the economic infrastructure to adequately support its public schools. State Superintendent of Education Joseph Spagnolo certified the district as being in financial distress and appointed a financial oversight panel to investigate and resolve the district’s budgetary problems. The basis for this charge and subsequent appointment of the financial oversight panel stemmed from Article 1B of the 1994 Illinois School Code, which states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A fundamental goal of the people of the State, as expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened. A sound financial structure is essential to the continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational and cultural interests that the public schools remain in operation. (105 ILCS 5/1B-2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the time, District 189 was approaching a projected budgetary shortfall of US$2 million. According to Gary Ey, the chief financial officer for the Illinois State Board of Education during the oversight period (1994-2004), the State Board had been monitoring East St. Louis District 189 very closely since 1988 (personal communication, Gary Ey, May 8, 2006). Ey stated that the district had millions of dollars in non-interest-bearing checking accounts prior to state oversight, the Illinois State Board of Education continually received calls from vendors that had not been paid in a timely manner, or at all, by District 189, and there were indications that insurance premiums were being paid on individuals that had either left the employment of the district or who were deceased.</p>
<p>The extent of the district’s financial problems and their effect on instruction is evident in a suit filed by parents against the district in 1995 during the initial years of state oversight. The suit cited specific instances of building dilapidation, textbook shortages, and teacher shortages and argued that such instances signify the absence of “quality”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085911427741">1</xref></sup> education in District 189. This particular suit charged that the state was not providing, as it was constitutionally bound to do, a “safe,” and “minimally adequate” education. In its decision, the Illinois Supreme Court stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The complaint alleges that “most” of the District’s 31 school buildings are in “wretched disrepair.” The plaintiffs cite numerous examples of unsafe conditions in the schools which, they contend, are the result of the Districts’ defendants’ neglect, including: fire hazards; chronic flooding; structural flaws, such as falling plaster and cracked walls and roofs; malfunctioning heating systems; unsanitary restrooms; rooms sealed off due to the presence of asbestos; broken windows; burnt-out light bulbs; non-working water fountains; the presence of cockroaches and rats; and cold, non-nutritious lunches in the cafeterias . . . The plaintiffs’ complaint also charges that, because of the District defendant’s neglect and mismanagement, the students in the District are provided with meager instructional equipment, unsupervised, disengaged, and uncertified teachers, and systemic staffing deficiencies which resulted in some classrooms being without teachers at times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911427741"><italic>Lewis E. v. Spagnolo</italic>, 1999</xref>, p. 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The court determined that the legislative body needed to define “minimally adequate” and “that what constitutes a ‘high quality’ education cannot be ascertained by any judicially discoverable or manageable standards and that the constitution provides no principled basis for a judicial definition of ‘high quality’” (p. 3). Until the Illinois legislative body defined “minimally adequate” or “high-quality” education, the court could not rule that students in East St. Louis were not receiving such.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficits identified by state officials and parents, as well as their perceived connection to student achievement, reflect the District 189 conditions documented and vividly portrayed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427741">Kozol (1991)</xref> in <italic>Savage Inequalities</italic>. A growing momentum to address the district’s fiscal management followed Kozol’s publication, the imposition of a state oversight panel, and the parents’ suit. With the imposition of the financial oversight panel, the district began to define “quality” education using fiscal terms. The 10-year financial oversight process therefore is marked by a continued foregrounding of fiscal management in relation to student achievement and advancing educational quality, until the imposition of NCLB requirements in 2002.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework: Public Education, Fiscal Management, and Student Achievement</title>
<p>Since the publication of the Coleman Report in 1966 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427741">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>), educational researchers and policy makers have questioned the link between district finances and student academic achievement. Coleman’s <italic>Equality of Educational Opportunity Study</italic>, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, had two major findings, “1. School resources, including school facilities, curriculum, and teacher quality, do not show statistically significant effects on student achievement, and 2. The most significant effect on student achievement was the background characteristics of other students, or peer effects” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085911427741">Wong &amp; Nicotera, 2004</xref>, p. 130). The Coleman Report, which sampled 600,000 students, 60,000 teachers, and 3,100 schools, came on the heels of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and sought to determine which resources might be the most effective in improving instruction. While the methodology in the Coleman study has been critiqued (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911427741">Bowles &amp; Levine, 1968</xref>), the study has shaped U.S. educational policy and research since its publication and has resulted in the broad contention that “there is no immediate evident correlation between conventional measures of education inputs, such as expenditures per pupil and teacher salaries, and educational outputs, such as average scores on standardized tests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427741">LeFevre, 2004</xref>, p. 4). Coleman’s study, if analyzed in historical context, provides a basis for understanding the evolution of research which attempts to make connections between school funding and student academic achievement.</p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085911427741">Wong and Nicotera (2004)</xref> analyze the Coleman study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427741">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>) in parallel to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427741"><italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> (1954)</xref> decision. They argue that the <italic>Brown</italic> decision came out of an implication from the view that equality meant much more than equality of material resources. Wong and Nicotera add</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Brown</italic> made it clear that the notion of equal educational opportunities transcends a listing of school resources. In turn, the USOE [United States Office of Education] had the chance to use the survey to probe deeper into the meaning of equal educational opportunities. (p. 127)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the <italic>Brown</italic> decision asserted that poor-quality education stemmed, in part, from inadequate resources, <italic>Brown’s</italic> legacy also supported an emergent policy assumption that although fiscal resources do influence educational success, providing equal material resources does not guarantee the same educational quality.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427741">McUsic (2004)</xref> puts forth a complex legal analysis of <italic>Brown</italic> and the implications it has on school financing in urban districts. He maintains that even if it were possible to equalize funding across districts, noting that state legislatures, district financing patterns, and emphasis on local property taxes currently prevent it from being so, doing such would not yield the same educational results in those districts. According to McUsic, “school finance lawsuits generally focus on the problems of poor, urban districts because inadequate schooling is generally a localized, urban problem” (p. 1350). As these districts spend a disproportionate amount of money on special education and bilingual services as well as providing resources for migrant students and students with serious health problems, McUsic says, “funding a straightforward academic program that compares well with the programs of affluent schools can be prohibitively expensive” (p. 1352).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042085911427741">2</xref></sup> While money may not equalize educational opportunities, making services available to children does require money. To say that money does not matter does not adequately capture the relationship between resource allocation, fiscal management, and education.</p>
<p>There are a few specific examples of positive effects of resources on student academic achievement. Coleman acknowledged that differences in facilities did affect achievement for Black students and there was some, albeit small, connection between characteristics of the teacher (e.g., family education level, education, vocabulary) and student academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085911427741">Wong &amp; Nicotera, 2004</xref>). According to the American Legislative Council, the organization responsible for producing the <italic>Report Card on American Education: A State by State Analysis 1983-1984 to 2003-2004</italic>, lower pupil-to-teacher ratios, fewer students per school, and a lower percentage of the state’s total budget received from the federal government have a positive impact on educational achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427741">LeFevre, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Other educational researchers have complicated the discussion of the relationship between school financing and student academic achievement by emphasizing the impact resources have on the school environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042085911427741">Wenglinsky (1997)</xref> suggests that the ways in which resources are allocated within schools does matter. His theoretical premise begins with the hypothesis that per-pupil expenditures relate to class size, that smaller classes lead to more cohesive social environments, and that “cohesive social environments are positively related to students’ achievement above and beyond students’ social backgrounds. In this way, the economic resources of schools are associated with students’ achievement” (p. 221). The issue, for many researchers, is not one of financing but, rather, is one of fiscal management and how disparities in that management adversely affect schools with high populations of minority students and/or low-income students.</p>
<p>In linking these disparities specifically to urban districts with high populations of minority students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911427741">Books (2005)</xref> says tensions between local districts and state and federal agencies often stem from disparities in school funding and school conditions. She contends that there are “gross disparities” in school funding and that they are not “random, but rather patterned, predictable, and consequential” (p. 27). Citing McUsic (1999), Books quotes, “Despite a great deal of rhetoric about the general failure of the public school system, the problem of inadequate schooling is more often not a statewide, but a local, overwhelmingly urban problem” and the problem persists because “no state has yet been willing to fund poor urban schools at a level that would (after discounting costs for special needs) finance a straightforward education curriculum at the same level enjoyed by the average suburban schools” (p. 29). Elliott (1998) also points to the importance of resource allocation to student academic achievement and concludes that “hiring high quality teachers” and “helping those teachers use the most effective strategies in their math and science classrooms” are specifically related to the allocation of school resources (p. 240). Her study, although limited to math and science classrooms, suggests that money matters and that, more specifically, it does affect student learning.</p>
<p>What seems most important to student academic achievement, however, is not necessarily the amount of money/resources a school or district commands but rather the management of those resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427741">Gamoran, Secada, and Marrett (2000)</xref> extend the discussion to challenge the input–output model which some researchers used to connect school financing/resources to student academic achievement. They argue,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What goes on inside the school—the production process itself—is not observed. If the production process were straightforward and predictable, the input-output production function would be a sensible way to study the impact of school resources. Yet the process of teaching and learning is complex and not fully routinized. Input–output studies do not reveal much about the effects of schools because so much depends on <italic>how the resources are used</italic> [emphasis added], and the use of resources is not included in the usual production function. (pp. 38-39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This emphasis on the allocation of resources stands as a critical point of departure for the finance–academic achievement debate, which generally agrees that it is significantly easier to improve district-level finances and management practices than it is to effect positive change in student achievement indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427741">Seder, 2000</xref>). Using the idea of fiscal management to theoretically frame this study of the interplay between accountability, governance, and student achievement in East St. Louis, we must also then examine the governance structure of the district and the structure created within the oversight panel model because such structures affected the allocation of resources and/or exchange of money within the district.</p>

<sec id="section4-0042085911427741">
<title>Educational Governance</title>
<p>In an effort to comply with NCLB mandates, state officials are assuming greater responsibility in local district operations. State officials argue that their increased fiscal responsibilities for local districts warrant more state involvement in the academic operations of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427741">Mintrop, 2004</xref>). Whereas state officials maintain that they have a vested interest in ensuring that all children receive quality education, local district officials argue that education has historically been a local responsibility and that increased state control reduces teacher and administrator autonomy. The effects of governance structure on quality of education are disputed, to say the least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911427741">Barr &amp; Dreeben, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427741">Gamoran et al., 2000</xref>). The decisions made by school administrators affect the instructional decisions made by teachers which then, in turn, affect student learning. Ultimately, however, the direct impact that resource allocation has on curricular decisions remains in question despite the rationale of path analysis which suggests that the resources flow seamlessly from school to classroom to instructional group to student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911427741">Barr &amp; Dreeben, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The amount of time and resources spent on curriculum does not universally, automatically, or naturally improve student learning. In this respect, then, the connections between resource allocation, or fiscal management, and student achievement are not consistently logical or apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427741">Gamoran et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427741">Anyon (2005)</xref> extends this discussion of fiscal management by advocating educational policy alignment understood as a fit among neighborhood, family, and student needs. Anyon’s alignment contrasts traditional notions of policy congruence among state, district, and school bureaucracies and instead reorients educational policy to include financing neighborhood jobs, living wages, integrated housing, and similar issues. In this way, accountability becomes reconceptualized as “a public undertaking, centrally involving families, communities, and students, in consultation with district and government officials” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427741">Anyon, 2005</xref>, pp. 199-200). This model emphasizes the question of “who can decide what is best for students?” and critiques the hierarchical processes that remove decision making from local constituents.</p>
<p>Although not readily identified by policy makers as a component of conceptualization and implementation, state oversight of school districts follows an observable and patterned raced and classed dynamic reflective of the “patterned, predictable, and consequential” disparities that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911427741">Books (2005</xref>, p. 27) ascribes to school funding. Simply put, urban districts with a majority African American and/or Hispanic population and which evidence a high poverty rate are more likely to be taken over by states than their counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427741">Seder’s (2000)</xref> policy study of state accountability interventions for fiscal and academic stability, for example, identifies a number of districts that have been taken over by states. Our own analysis of the most recent U.S. Census Bureau demographics for the service area of many of these districts, curiously absent from Seder’s analysis, and several additional districts demonstrates this pattern (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085911427741">Table 1</xref>). In the identified districts, at least one out of every five persons lives below the poverty line (excepting Jersey City, which is 18.6%) and a majority of the population is African American and/or Hispanic (excepting the Kentucky and West Virginia districts), and in six of the districts the primary language spoken at home is a language other than English. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427741">Nelson and Guerra (2007)</xref> highlight that raced, classed, and linguistic differences reveal distinct cultural processes, and those cultures vary in significant ways “including communication style, power distribution, role expectations, and identity development” (p. 60). Following from this, we conclude that culture is a significant dimension that must be incorporated within analysis of state oversight interventions.</p>

The analysis relied on 71 primary source documents, including State Board of Education Meeting Minutes, Oversight Panel Reports, Illinois State Board News Articles, the Illinois School Code, and Court Opinions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042085911427741">Table A1</xref> in the appendix for a document list). When coding texts, the following key words and phrases were identified as primary codes: (a) budget and oversight process, (b) student academic achievement, and (c) culture. With implicit phrases, we recorded specific interpretations and, in those interpretations, specified the relationship(s) between the phrase and the primary code to which it corresponded. All texts were read multiple times to categorize quotes, to specify the relationships between phrases from the documents and our primary codes, and to establish a working conceptual framework for analyzing the data.</p>
<p>From the primary codes, we developed a question-based framework to analyze the data. Translating our three primary codes (budget and oversight process, student academic achievement, and culture) into questions to guide our analysis and conceptualization of the data, we asked, (a) how did state financial oversight improve fiscal management in East St. Louis, (b) how did the measurable indicators of student academic achievement change over the 10-year period of financial oversight, and (c) how did questions of culture emerge during both the oversight process and the researchers’ data interpretation? Although generalization is an unavoidable aspect of case study research, the purpose of this case report is to represent the case of oversight and accountability in East St. Louis School District 189 in a manner that both addresses this particularized experience and also allows implications to be drawn for other cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427741">Stake, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section7-0042085911427741">
<title>The Budget and Oversight Process: School Financing in District 189</title>
<p>Illinois schools are funded through a combination of local property taxes, state funding, and federal funding. Article 10, Section 1 of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois asserts that “the State has the primary responsibility for funding the system of public education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911427741">Illinois State Constitution, n.d.</xref>). Over the years, the Illinois Legislature has interpreted “primary responsibility” to mean at least 51% funding by the state. In actual fact, the percentage of state funding varies greatly, depending on the local property tax contribution. Individual Illinois school districts may receive significantly more or less than 51% of their funding from the state. In addition to the local property tax contribution, the other major factor driving the amount of a district’s funding from the state is student attendance. The average daily attendance of a school district, multiplied by a per-pupil designated amount by the state, gives a district its designated general state aid entitlement.</p>
<p>As East St. Louis generates a very low local contribution of tax dollars, the district depends heavily on state and federal funding. Even though the school district has historically had one of the highest school tax rates in St. Clair County, this rate yields a relatively low level of funding from local sources. In November 2000, the financial oversight panel reported to the Illinois State Board of Education that 89% of District 189 revenue was received from state and federal sources and only 11% of district funding came from local sources that year. This proportion of local funding was fairly typical during the years of state financial oversight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427741">Illinois State Board of Education, 2002</xref>, p. 1). The State Board of Education, over the course of its 10-year intervention in East St. Louis, worked from a theoretical premise that improving district finances would yield positive student achievement outcomes.</p>
<p>By October 19, 2000, the State Board reported on a presentation from Zanele Sibanda, the director of education and public policy for Chicago United. Sibanda stressed to the board that “regarding teacher quality, research has been very clear that high quality instruction impacts student outcomes, and that impact is even more important for students of color in urban centers” (p. 1). At that same meeting, Mary Ellen Abell reported that the Illinois State Advisory Council on the Education of Children with disabilities hoped to “see the state and federal government develop a better funding plan, so that the special education students throughout the state can be better educated” (p. 1). Finally, at the meeting, the board discussed funding an induction and mentoring program whose purpose would be to retain highly qualified teachers in high-needs districts. The board’s understanding of the link between finances and student academic achievement was predicated on the assumption that increased funding would allow districts to vary and improve instructional programs and to hire and retain competent professionals to teach.</p>
<p>When beginning its work, the oversight panel,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042085911427741">3</xref></sup> in an effort to combat what it perceived as waste and inefficiency in the management of the district’s finances, attempted to operate exclusively from a monetary perspective. Under their direction, the district’s financial health improved dramatically over the 10-year period from a deficit of US$1,665,928 in 1994 to a surplus of US$20,106,612 in 2004, with a high of US$23,114,760 in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911427741">Illinois State Board of Education, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042085911427741">4</xref></sup> Financial oversight led to improvements in several areas, identified by one of the financial oversight panel members, as (a) the panel forced the district to live within its budget; (b) the panel’s fiscal strategies provided resources to make school buildings livable; and (c) the panel required the district to upgrade its textbooks. When asked the same question, the former chief financial officer of the Illinois State Board of Education (personal communication, Gary Ey, May 8, 2006) remarked that the panel had resolved the financial difficulties of the board and that the oversight process had improved the lives of the students of East St. Louis District 189.</p>
<p>Although the Coleman Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427741">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>) clearly articulated no significant connection between school finances and student academic achievement, the Illinois financial oversight process operated with the presumption that such a correlation does exist. By March 16, 2006, the State Board of Education had “begun linking the academic and financial accountability systems by asking for achievement information on districts that have been certified as being in financial difficulty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427741">Illinois State Board of Education, 2006</xref>, p. 3). The plenary business meeting minutes also indicate that the state superintendent “has also appointed a Special Assistant in East St. Louis to link school improvement, financial, and other aspects of the district’s operation” (p. 3). The State Board members also contended that, in the future, they would consider establishing a formal method of linking fiscal and academic oversight panels. Although Illinois eventually established an oversight process which formally linked academic and fiscal operations, East St. Louis oversight continued under its original “fiscal only” format.</p>

<title>Student Academic Achievement in District 189</title>
<p>Although the financial situation certainly stabilized for East St. Louis District 189 between 1994 and 2004, student performance on state standardized tests remained below state averages during the course of the 10-year oversight period and beyond, inclusive of the early years of NCLB implementation. This study examined District 189 student results on the ISAT and PSAE examinations through the first 4 years of NCLB, which also overlapped the final years of the oversight panel’s mandate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085911427741">Table 2</xref>) and also reviewed attendance, truancy, and graduation rates over the life of the oversight process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042085911427741">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The data indicate that there is no consistent and sustained increase in the district’s attendance, truancy, and graduation rates. Attendance is an important variable to consider in relation to student academic achievement in so much as it equates with instructional time lost. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427741">Roby (2004)</xref>, students’ time spent in school effects their performance on state standardized tests. In addition, other researchers have noted the negative effect that truancy has on students’ graduation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085911427741">Robins &amp; Ratcliff, 1978</xref>) and employment opportunities later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427741">Donnelly, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>On the surface, therefore, this East St. Louis case substantiates assumptions that improvement in finances has little effect on student achievement. What is most striking in this case study is that, despite the improvement in the district’s finances, the percentage of the district’s students meeting standards on state assessments remains dramatically lower than state averages, the attendance rate actually decreased slightly, and the graduation rate decreased substantially.</p>

<sec id="section9-0042085911427741">
<title>Oversight Process, District Governance, and Culture</title>
<p>Assertions that the state intervention was purely fiscal and not conceptually related to student performance ring hollow in that the oversight panel’s own reports indicate a direct role in the overall governance of the district, inclusive of an attempted use of the power of the purse to force a change in superintendents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427741">Roseboro, O’Malley, &amp; Hunt 2006</xref>) and a clear orientation toward addressing student achievement. The annual oversight panel report to the state superintendent in 2000, for example, asserts financial solvency and highlight academic troubles in “one of the lowest performing school districts in the State” and link these to the absence of a “well-run educational program” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427741">East St. Louis Oversight Panel, 2000</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>In its 2002 report to the state supertendent, the panel makes explicit the perceived link between its fiscal management mandate and the overall governance and educative dimensions of the district by calling on the governor and the State Board of Education to change the basic structures of district governance, claiming that “it is <bold>clear</bold> to the Panel that the District cannot excel academically with the current form of local governance [emphasis in original]” (p. 8). The same report identifies the central problem as the “culture of the district” which has been “more concerned about providing jobs for local political associates and less concerned about improving the learning environment and academic performance of the students” (p. 2). In general, the panel’s use of the word <italic>culture</italic> refers to organizational dynamics between the school board and other district administrators rather than shared raced, classed, and social identities of the local community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042085911427741">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aspects of the panel’s reports that do attend to these dimensions of culture tend to proceed from a deficit orientation which can be problematic. The 2000 Annual Report, for example, states “the District receives 89% of its revenues form [sic] state and federal sources . . . the minority percentage is among the highest in any large urban district. The school population requires many special services and unique approaches to the teaching program” (p. 1). While “special” and “unique” services clearly have positive and negative connotations, the panel’s failure to further explicate why the district’s population requires “many special and unique services” leaves this statement open to interpretation and could imply that poor minority children automatically need “special services.” Without contextualizing this within historical and sociocultural dynamics, the panel creates an instant dichotomy of “normative” and “aberrant” and leaves open the possibility that readers interpret the district’s students as belonging to the latter group.</p>
<p>Because the panel and local school board members’ understanding of governance differed—the school board argued for local control while the panel pushed for increased state control—they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal battles. The March 19-20, 2003 report from the State Board noted that the East St. Louis Financial Oversight Panel “had requested an increase in their annual budget of over $145,000 to $1.2 million to pay legal fees . . .” (p. 1). Such expenses garnered intense scrutiny from local stakeholders and media who questioned the additional financial costs incurred by the district because of legal fees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911427741">Aguilar (2004)</xref> adds,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The East St. Louis Financial Oversight Panel acted within its power when it told the East St. Louis School Board that it couldn’t hire the architect it wanted, the state appellate court of Mt. Vernon has ruled . . . the board spent nearly US$500,000 in legal fees to fight the panel’s refusal to approve a contract between the school district and architect firm Kennedy and Associates Inc. of St. Louis. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Funding legal battles which ensue directly from governance restructuring in a district already in financial distress seems, at least in part, counterintuitive. Yet the board and the panel rationalized these expenses from differing, and equally plausible, perspectives. On one hand, the school board, when it challenged the powers of the panel in court, acted within its legal rights as the elected representatives of the district. The panel, on the other hand, acting in the interests of the state, believed that their actions would improve the financial solvency of the district. Both groups believed that they were acting in the best interest of children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042085911427741">6</xref></sup> In either case, the persistent legal conflicts between the board and panel over the 10-year period of oversight demanded additional financial resources, resources which could have been used to hire quality teachers, reduce class size, or conduct capital improvements. In addition, the extent of these conflicts and repeated recourse to the legal system to effect resolution establish the incapacity of the oversight panel and local school board to form a substantively collaborative working relationship.</p>
<p>Similarly to what is evidenced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427741">Seder’s (2000)</xref> policy report, our analysis of the East St. Louis oversight period reveals that focused attention to raced and classed dimensions of culture are essentially absent from the panel’s interpretations. This is particularly striking in a district that is 97.7% African American with a 28.0% poverty rate and appears to divorce a community’s sociocultural identity and context from questions of educational reform. The oversight panel’s role as agent of a predominately White and economically secure state legislative and policy apparatus, regardless of the actual raced and socioeconomic positionality of the panel’s members, points to the need to foster cultural proficiency in the panel’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427741">Nelson &amp; Guerra, 2007</xref>). Put differently, omission of constructive and direct attention to raced and classed cultural difference between state government and this local community, complemented by deficit assumptions expressed by the panel based on these identity markers and the power dynamics inherent within mandated oversight, likely complicated opportunities for substantive collaboration as well as limited the capacity of the oversight process to effect fiscal management and other governance processes capable of supporting student achievement. Although cultural proficiency would not itself be a guarantor of successful fiscal and educational interventions, it is a significant factor in understanding how communication styles, power distribution, role expectations, and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427741">Nelson &amp; Guerra, 2007</xref>) influence educational reform processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042085911427741">Urrieta (2004)</xref> considers the policy implications for reconceptualizing accountability with an attunement to cultural dimensions. He argues that, rather than ignore culture in accountability processes, we look at accountability</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>through an anti-essentialist lens and by implementing programs of cultural immersion for educators at the (1) classroom, (2) local community, and (3) trans/cultural or transnational community level, the current oppressive understanding of high-stakes accountability can change to become transformative. (p. 212)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This model, based on the theoretical premises of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911427741">Freire (1998)</xref>, reenvisions accountability cognizant of the inequities created by dominant power structures and, in doing so, hopes to “re-humanize” accountability and to “allow local communities the opportunity to see themselves as active participants in society, committed to social change” (p. 212). For us, Urrieta’s charge illuminated what was most troubling about the state intervention processes in East St. Louis—it questioned local participants’ leadership capabilities by identifying them as deficient. We do not argue that this was the intent of the State Board of Education. It was, perhaps, an unintended consequence created by the board’s failure to distinguish between the cultural practices of the district which affected its governance processes and the cultural practices of the State Board which affected its oversight processes.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Within the sociocultural context of East St. Louis, therefore, there is a particular urgency that accrues to the panel’s recommendation that the governor and state leadership further restrict local governance of the district, a practically quintessential and sacred characteristic of “American” education. Enacted within the absence of a visible, collaborative engagement with this community in its raced, classed, and cultural identities, the panel’s recommendation almost necessarily elicits questions about who is permitted to participate in American democracy, to what extent, and by whose decision. This clearly volatile terrain becomes another vantage point from which one might understand the tensions that developed between the panel and the board and, in part, why the intervention did not consistently improve student attendance, truancy, graduation rates, as well as student scores on state tests across more than a full decade. The issue is a complicated one that warrants additional study using both quantitative and qualitative methods.</p>
<p>Inherent within the oversight model enacted by the State of Illinois is the expectation that hierarchical macro-level interventions positively influence student achievement. Increasingly, data generated through accountability processes suggest that this assumption ought to be problematized and understood in more complex ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911427741">Carnoy, Elmore, and Siskin (2003)</xref>, for example, distinguish between external and internal accountability. External accountability comes from “without” or, in more specific terms, is different than what the school district would define from within. Internal accountability encompasses the “shared norms, values, expectations, structures, and processes that determine the relationship between individual actions and collective results in schools” (pp. 197-198). In defining its identity from within, a district is better positioned to develop a clear vision for academic expectations of students, collective responsibilities of faculty, and organizational responsibilities for administrators. Internal and external accountability operate in tandem, and, at times, they conflict. What is important for us, in this study, is that Carnoy et al. reconceptualize accountability as the intersection of different and, at times, competing spheres of influence—(a) individual’s sense of responsibility in school communities, (b) school communities’ collective expectations, and (c) formal and informal accountability systems.</p>
<p>States such as Illinois enacting reform initiatives in urban districts with a majority of the student population consisting of students of color and/or low-income families might consider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911427741">Carnoy et al.’s (2003)</xref> internal and external dynamics as influenced by and indicative of race, class, and culture. In East St. Louis, neither state-mandated financial oversight nor federally mandated accountability have produced meaningful advances in student achievement through 2006. Recent research findings suggest that, following implementation of NCLB, gains states had been making in closing achievement gaps slowed in mathematics and disappeared in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427741">Fuller, Wright, Geisicki, &amp; Kang, 2007</xref>). In light of the inability of states to erase the achievement gap between students of color and White students, we argue that accountability measures cannot be color or class blind. Put differently, educational policy must actively engage the raced, classed, and cultural identities of the communities involved in educational reform efforts as collaborators and agents of the reform sought.</p>
<p>In addition, we believe that undoing dependence on hierarchical governance models would benefit urban districts with high populations of minority students and students in poverty because such structures further diminish their ability and that of their parents, faculty, and administrators to exercise power in meaningful ways. We argue that accountability processes should begin embracing the principle of subsidiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427741">Mason &amp; Randell, 1995</xref>), which proposes that decisions which may be made effectively at a lower organizational level ought not to be made at a higher level. Subsidiarity reconfigures reform planning as heterarchic rather than hierarchic and as democratic rather than authoritarian. Put differently, understanding that historically in the U.S. local voters have significant responsibility for overseeing school governance, the appropriate response to actual or perceived leadership problems is not the disenfranchisement of local citizens but rather an enhanced involvement with, and participation of, those very citizens.</p>
<p>In current policy practice, the notion of actively taking educational reform issues to local communities rather than consolidating authority within state structures is clearly counterintuitive. However, amid mounting evidence of a relative impotence to federal and state accountability initiatives in urban environments, a new accountability discourse is called for, framed by democratic participation, cultural proficiency, and the practice of subsidiarity. In such a model, state and federal government remains intimately involved in educational policy and reform but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427741">Anyon (2005)</xref> has proposed, in consultative and collaborative roles in relation to families, communities, and schools. Simultaneously, educational policy reoriented as a “public undertaking” emerging from communities’ “urgent realities” must be designed and implemented in conjunction with health care, housing, economic, legal, employment, and other policy initiatives coordinated “for neighborhood revitalization for low income residents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427741">Anyon, 2005</xref>, p. 199). Thus, the policy turn from concentration within bureaucratic structures toward renewed collaborative engagement with local governance necessarily involves diverse communities in their historical and cultural positionalities as collaborators in addressing cross-sector needs. For East St. Louis and similar urban contexts, such a local–state collaborative ought to draw on expertise and knowledge of both levels to address systemic cross-sector issues, enhance democratic engagement within the local community, and secure the educational and social resources necessary to support student achievement. Although demanding in scope, a collaborative and culturally proficient integrated reform model offers promise that is clearly absent in the fragmented models of a decade of fiscal oversight or a lengthy period of test-driven accountability documented in East St. Louis, Illinois School District 189.</p>
