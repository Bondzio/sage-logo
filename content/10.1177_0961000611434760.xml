<abstract>
<p>This study explores the application of digitisation in the context of public library local studies services. Since there has been limited previous research on digitisation and local studies collections, this research makes an important contribution in profiling the current situation, and highlighting the extent to which progress is limited in the digitisation of valuable local studies collections. A two-phased approach was adopted, including a website analysis, and semi-structured interviews with 12 local studies librarians and three other key informants. Findings indicate that the local studies services have established a limited online presence, and have used digitisation to some extent to promote and improve accessibility to their collections. All interviewees appreciated the potential of digitisation, but digitisation has not been adopted as a major strategy for preservation, due to lack of funding, and concerns about the longevity of digital records.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Local studies services in public libraries in the UK are regarded as having an important role in collecting and preserving documents and other artifacts that constitute parts of local and national heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>). Preservation is concerned with the storage and/or use of an artifact in a way that prevents damage or degradation, and that enables the item to last as long as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611434760">Deegan and Tanner, 2006</xref>). Digitisation is one way of both preserving and providing access to fragile documents. Certainly, at the level of nationally important records and heritage there has been significant investment in digitisation, in order to make documents accessible to scholars and other interested parties via the Internet. However, the extent of progress with the digitisation of local studies collections is less visible.</p>
<p>Given the paucity of previous research into digitisation of local studies collections, the research reported in this article seeks to explore the use of digitisation in support of both access and preservation in a group of public libraries in a major region of the UK, Greater Manchester. This group includes a range of different types and sizes of libraries, with different funding regimes, and as such their practices are likely to be mirrored in general terms in other parts of the UK. More specifically the objectives of this research are to:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611434760" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>explore the extent to which digitisation has been adopted and the characteristics of that adoption;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>develop an understanding of the factors that influence digitisation, and expectations of key informants as to future developments.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This article begins with a literature review that discusses local studies services and their roles, digitisation of local studies resources, and users and communities. This is followed by an outline of the research approach and methodology including website analysis and interviews with local studies librarians. The Findings section, then, summarises the key findings from the research, whilst the Discussion and Conclusion section reflects on the findings in the light of previous research and commentary. Finally, recommendations for practice and further research are offered.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<sec id="section3-0961000611434760">
<title>Local studies services and their roles</title>
<p>There have been various discussions concerning the nature of local studies and its relation to local history, and indeed the link between local studies collections in public libraries, and collections of other mainly historical resources in archives and records offices. However, the focus of this article is local studies collections in public libraries, and hence we adopt the definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434760">Dewe (2002</xref>: 13), in <italic>Local Studies Collection Management</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>For librarians, ‘local studies’ is seen as inclusive of local history and so the local collection should support studies that look at the historical past, both distant and recent, or at current concerns in the community, such as local environmental issues, or plans for the future development of a locality – matters of interest to a wide audience.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434760">Dewe (2002)</xref> recognizes that local studies is not simply about an archive, but also extends to offering a service to anyone who might be interested. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid (2003)</xref> elaborates on the community role of local studies libraries, and suggests that they ‘exist in order to recognise the social, economic and cultural activities and achievements of the local community, (p. 26). Accordingly, the role of the local studies library can be viewed as developing, preserving, and providing access to a collection of local material which is focused on its community yet may appeal to a much wider audience.</p>
<p>In recent years, local studies services have grown in popularity due to increased interest in lifelong learning, and the growth in popular television programmes such as ‘Heir Hunters’ and ‘Who Do You Think You Are?’ as well as website resources such as Find My Past and Ancestry. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434760">Dixon (2001)</xref> observes, local material is of great and permanent value as material for local history, but it is also an indispensable repository for family history material. Local studies services, then, may have a pivotal role in the modern public library, and it is therefore important that this aspect of the public library service takes every opportunity to enhance the use of its services, its reputation for relevance and accessibility of its resources, its engagement and communication with users and communities, and the expertise and competence of its staff. In this, it is important that local studies collections respond to changes in the way in which people access and consume information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434760">Byamugisha 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434760">Gorman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0961000611434760">
<title>Digitisation of local studies collections</title>
<p>Digitisation of local studies collections is conducted for two different, but related objectives: to preserve rare and fragile documents; and/or to make those documents more accessible to a wider range of users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434760">Astle and Muir, 2002</xref>). Much of the discussion around digitisation in the context of local studies has focused on its role in relation to the first of these objectives, preservation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434760">Gorman (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611434760">Deegan and Tanner (2006)</xref> highlight problems regarding rapidly changing technology and the danger of digital documents becoming obsolete in the format that they are ‘born’ into. Gorman also recognises the problems surrounding cataloguing these new objects, as well as the expense of creating and maintaining digital archives and their associated metadata. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434760">Kalusopa and Zulu (2009)</xref> also document the risk of ‘technological obsolescence’ in relation to digital collections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434760">Byamugisha (2010)</xref>, reporting on digitisation in Uganda, comments on another issue that has wide applicability, which is that digitisation is often implemented as a short-term project rather than as a long-term strategy. Furthermore, when considering the costs of even a short-term digitisation project, it is clear that a long-term strategy would require significant funding, and could therefore only be sustainable if it was viewed as a central strand of public library strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434760">Byamugisha, 2010</xref>). The issue of funding was also identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434760">Astle and Muir (2002)</xref> in their study of the experiences of UK public libraries with digitisation projects. They also noted that although access had been significantly increased, the range of material that had been digitised was very narrow, and driven more by copyright restrictions than by user demand. Despite these problems the imperative for digitisation remains strong.</p>
<p>Whilst only a few studies have examined digitisation of local studies collections, those that have been conducted demonstrate the potential for the local studies service in the digital age and how the Internet is being used to disseminate public library and local studies information, and also share content with other collections or organisations, creating a network of connections and improving the overall value of the library service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434760">Barry and Tedd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434760">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434760">Barry and Tedd (2008)</xref> studied the ways in which public libraries in Ireland were beginning to digitise their local studies collections, and the effect of the current emphasis from the Government on digitisation policy within all libraries, not just public library local studies collections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611434760">Sveum (2009)</xref> suggests that projects involving digitisation, and in the context of his research, wikis, could be a good opportunity for local studies librarians to utilise and share their expert knowledge with a wider audience. It would seem that local studies services have considerable potential to contribute to the vision of the public library as a ‘network of community knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434760">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0961000611434760">
<title>Users and community</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid (2003)</xref> local studies enjoy the patronage of a wide user base, from school children to retired people. Further, there is evidence to suggest that as the public library has evolved, so has the popularity and acceptance of local studies as an important part of the modern public library service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434760">Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434760">Winterbotham and Crosby, 1998</xref>). Local studies research is important to people as it is a way of connecting through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434760">Yakel, 2004</xref>). Research by Yakel suggests that people seek information regarding their personal or local history for a variety of reasons including information seeking as part of a project or process, and finding connections with other relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434760">Yakel (2004)</xref> also suggests that finding ancestors in the past is part of developing a person’s own identity in the present.</p>
<p>According to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611434760">Boyns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611434760">Duff and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434760">Yakel, 2004</xref>), a large proportion of the users who access local information repositories such as local studies, archives, and records offices are genealogists and family or local historians. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611434760">Boyns (1999)</xref> documented the use of records repositories by family historians and noted a lack of discussion and detailed research relating to the user and user needs in this area despite the popularity of this type of repository usage. Although texts have been published that provide information for local studies services on how to nurture their users and provide a high quality service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434760">Dewe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434760">Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434760">Winterbotham and Crosby, 1998</xref>), the corpus of guidance and research on the use and users of local studies collections remains small.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0961000611434760">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Local studies collections are an important aspect of the modern public library service, and in the light of increasing interest in local and family history it is important that every opportunity is taken to provide an engaging service and wide access to resources. However, research and commentary on how local studies services are developing and could develop their services to accommodate users and communities in the digital age is limited. There is scope for further research in this area.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section8-0961000611434760">
<title>Approach and context</title>
<p>A two-stage mixed methods methodology was adopted in order to explore digitisation of local studies collections. The first stage, preliminary stage, was a website analysis to achieve a profile of the visibility of various local studies resources through the library website. The second stage involved semi-structured interviews with local studies librarians and selected other key informants; this stage explored the extent and nature of digitisation of local studies resources, and associated policies and activities, specifically in the areas of promotion and funding, community, and audiences.</p>
<p>The study focused on the local studies services in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The selection of these public libraries for this study was both purposive and convenient. The public library authorities included in the study were those associated with: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, and Wigan. The only other authority in the region, Salford, was unable to participate due a key staff vacancy at the time of the research. These libraries vary considerably in the size of their local studies collections, budgets, and the size of the community that they seek to serve. On the other hand, communities across the Greater Manchester area have a shared heritage. All areas saw rapid development from rural to industrial communities in the 18th and 19th centuries. This gave rise to rapid expansion in populations with its concomitant social challenges and changes, coupled with considerable technological innovation, business growth, and economic development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0961000611434760">
<title>Preliminary stage: Website analysis</title>
<p>Website analysis was used as a tool to determine to what extent web resources were being used by different libraries in the Greater Manchester area. This informed the interview process, because the interviewer was already aware of the services offered by the specific libraries, and also allowed exploration of any issues that the website analysis had highlighted.</p>
<p>The website analysis used website evaluation criteria based on previously developed criteria from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434760">Barry and Tedd (2008)</xref> and was informed by other literature regarding libraries and the Web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid 2003</xref>). Because the focus of Barry and Tedd’s study was relatively similar to the focus of this study, their evaluative criteria used were deemed to be relevant and acceptable and were adapted for this smaller-scale study.</p>
<p>The website analysis consisted of a negative or affirmative checklist which covered four key themes: accessibility, in terms of the local studies web page usability; the aesthetics of the sites; the content of the sites including information for users such as contacts and resources; and the use of digitisation and Web 2.0 tools in the context of image collections, multimedia, and online catalogues. All 40 criteria were applied to all nine websites to avoid subjectivity. To ensure a standardised, consistent approach, data gathered from the websites was collected over a very short period of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0961000611434760">
<title>Main stage: Interviews</title>
<p>The second and main stage of the study involved semi-structured interviews. The limited previous research into the digitisation of local studies collections in public libraries suggests that an inductive and exploratory approach to this research is appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611434760">Saunders et al., 2003</xref>). Interviews were classed as semi-structured as the investigative nature of the study merited a format that would be conducive to producing the best answers from the respondents by working with them on an informal basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434760">Bryman and Bell, 2003</xref>). Therefore, although all interviews were based on the same interview schedule, the order in which topics were varied. Further, the questions were open-ended thus not limiting the respondent’s/interviewee’s choice of answers and within each main topic the interviewer made use of cues and prompts to help to gather a richer data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434760">Creswell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The interview was divided into four sections, influenced by the topics discussed in the previous literature review and previous research projects. The primary category for questioning was concerned with digitisation and the digital age; this was supported by subsequent categories on promotion and funding, community, and audiences. For details of the questions see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0961000611434760">Appendix 1</xref>. The interview schedule was piloted informally. Care was taken to identify key respondents, and to approach them in a professional manner, such that all targeted key informants agreed to participate. Interviews were conducted in the participants’ offices or other convenient quiet locations in the library. The interviews were digitally recorded. This method was selected because it enables the researcher to take part in the conversation in a natural way, whilst generating a complete record of the interview. All interviews were transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted; this analysis was guided, but not constrained by, the topics in the schedule. An inductive approach to coding was employed for the thematic analysis in order to avoid ‘rigidity and premature closure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434760">Lapadat, 2009</xref>: 926).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0961000611434760">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>This section first summarises the key findings from the first stage, the website analysis, and then reports in more detail on the insights gained from the interviews in the second stage of the research.</p>
<sec id="section12-0961000611434760">
<title>Website analysis</title>
<p>Forty criteria were used to offer a preliminary profile of the web presence of local studies collections in public libraries. The key results from this analysis are presented here based on the following categories: accessibility, content, aesthetics, and digitisation and Web2.0.</p>
<sec id="section13-0961000611434760">
<title>Accessibility</title>
<p>All libraries had a Web presence, and most (6) showed clear links to the library web pages from the council home page. In addition, most (6) had easy links from the library home page to local studies information. A range of other aspects of the library and local studies websites were also evaluated, including organization, search, and accessibility for disabled users. Overall, all websites examined were deemed to have achieved a high standard in regard to this range of website design and navigation features. The local studies resources on all of the websites had a clearly stated purpose as to the service they provided and could be described as ranging from basic informational to more advanced interactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434760">Reid, 2003</xref>) in terms of their appearance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0961000611434760">
<title>Content</title>
<p>A number of aspects of the content of the web page were checked. In all cases the local studies web pages gave a clear indication of what information was available to users; the information was suited to the local studies service’s main audience of family and local history researchers, and the content provided was high quality. All except one website stated a clear purpose, for example a paragraph stating what the local studies service did, and what users might hope to find on the web pages linking from the main page. Results were less impressive, however, in terms of clearly showing when content had been updated, with only 5 websites displaying dates to show when the local studies pages were last updated. Furthermore, with regards to promoting local studies events through the website, the picture was also patchy with only 5 websites showing evidence of promoting their events online. Overall, information on the content of the local studies collections was good and relevant to those looking to research their local and family history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0961000611434760">
<title>Aesthetics</title>
<p>In terms of aesthetics, if the council website was basic in its appearance then the library web pages followed suit. In 6 cases the home page for the council website was deemed to be unattractive, although all of the sites analysed had a consistent design throughout and clear branding on every page.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0961000611434760">
<title>Digitisation and Web 2.0</title>
<p>All of the local studies pages showed evidence of digitisation of local studies resources, variously through the provision of digital collections of images (7) and/or tagging and descriptions (8). One library had also made available seven e-books that discuss the history of the area and a blog, and another had used RSS feeds. Most (8) encouraged users to participate through their website, variously, volunteering to help with digitisation, joining groups on Facebook, commenting on the library’s blog, and donating photographs. Most (8) also provided access to their collection via an online catalogue and 6 showed good promotion of the local studies collections online (largely through the image archives) as well as evidence of bibliographies to aid site users wishing to research their past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0961000611434760">
<title>Summary of website analysis</title>
<p>Local studies web pages are part of the local council website. All local studies collections had a Web presence, but the ease with which those pages can be accessed, and the services provided online varied considerably between libraries. Some libraries offer a wider range of content than others, and some are making use of Web2.0 tools to encourage users to contribute in various ways to the development of local studies collections and services.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0961000611434760">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>This section reports on the interview findings, in relation to the four main topics that formed the focus for the interview discussions: digitisation, promotion and funding, community engagement, and audience. These were all important aspects relating to the local studies services as determined by the literature review, pertaining to how digital services are being used and how they are viewed by the local studies services.</p>
<sec id="section19-0961000611434760">
<title>Digitisation</title>
<p>All interviewees had a good understanding of digitisation as a concept in relation to their own collections. Opinions varied on the purpose of digitisation in the local studies library context. Digitisation was viewed largely as a tool for broadening access and promoting resources, rather than a sustainable form of preservation, with some describing their digitised collections as a ‘shop front’ to their in-house collection. The local studies services varied on what they had digitised; for example, Bury’s librarian stated on the subject of their digital resources that the only items that they had digitised were their photograph collection, but described it as ‘…something that’s got universal appeal. It’s instant local history for people’. Rochdale had similarly digitised their photograph collection through a Heritage Lottery Fund project, ‘because they’re iconic. When people look at them online they get a lot of memories from them’.</p>
<p>In every instance, digitisation had been undertaken to some degree as part of a funded project to digitise a collection of images for their website, in order to promote their collection. The process of digitisation was often in a transitory state, libraries either being in the process of digitising collection items or having conducted a digitisation project at some time in the past. One librarian stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>We do have some information currently available online, but we want to increase that. We were actually part of a project a number of years ago where we scanned a certain number of important local history books so they’re available online. So you can search that. But that was again special funding, so we’ve not developed that much.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This desire to develop their digitisation programmes to encompass more resources and reach a wider audience was echoed by many respondents, but most also commented on the absence of financial resources to enable progress:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ideally, yes, I’d love as much to be digitised as possible – it does give greater access and I don’t have a problem at all with that … And I do think it makes access to collections so much easier, over a wider area. Obviously it’s not just people from this borough who’d benefit from that … So I’ve no problem with that at all but the money side is a big nightmare. That is the biggest barrier.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, despite general awareness of the value of further digitisation and creating a web presence, a number of concerns were expressed. One interviewee reflected on the long-term sustainability of digitisation as a means of preservation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Technology is moving so fast that you say, well, save them in certain document formats … But then later on down the line you’ve got to convert that into the next format, and that format’s got to be deemed as having a bit of longevity. You’ve got to be one step ahead of the game really. It’s an ideal solution at the moment but like everything it’s going to become obsolete.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The idea of rapidly changing developments in technology was a concern and it was inferred that there were certain expectations surrounding digitisation, and in turn a certain amount of reticence to adapt completely with more digital content. Some interviewees expressed wariness regarding the management of raised levels of user expectations when resources are digitised:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the other hand, I think people have a raised expectation of everything to be digitised. Some people think you can digitise everything and throw the originals away, which is something to be avoided at all costs because digitisation is only a means of enhancing access it’s not a replacement by any means at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One interviewee went further and commented on how access to resources in digital form might lead to users relying entirely on those resources:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think people are missing out by relying on the digital – because it’s taking away research skills from people. People don’t either want to or haven’t got the patience to actually think about using other resources like books. So that’s a great challenge for the future – to make sure our resources don’t become redundant through changing attitudes towards resources.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was clear that opinions are mixed but progressive towards digitisation. The librarians interviewed had strong opinions that the main purposes for digitisation were, first, to improve access, and to act as a hook to get visitors into the local studies library, and second, the preservation of the original documents.</p>
<p>The findings for this section showed a considerable level of consistency across all of the library workers interviewed and suggested that although librarians wanted to include more digital content in their services to the public, they were constrained and frustrated by lack of financial resources, had concerns over the long-term sustainability of digital documents and challenged by what was expected of them by their users.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0961000611434760">
<title>Promotion and funding</title>
<p>In general, there was plenty of evidence that librarians were proactive in promoting their collections, and did this through an integrated programme of marketing and public relations activities. As was evident from the website analysis, all of the libraries had a Web presence as part of the local council website. In relation to funding, this was difficult to secure and often dependent on an overall audience-based outcome such as what the project was going to add to the library community as a whole rather than digitising for the sake of utilising technology. Typically, they recognized the value of such a presence for promoting and providing some level of access to their resources. One librarian said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh we’re very keen on using the web as a means of letting people know what facilities we have. In fact it’s one of the most popular parts of the city council website – our bit of the libraries website. So for the images we’re getting something like sixty thousand visits a month. It’s incredible.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Two interviewees, however, had some reservations concerning the limitations of having a Web presence that was part of the local council website:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are ham strung, and you’ll probably find this with a lot of local authorities, ham strung by corporate branding and corporate website structures so we can’t be as flexible as we’d like to be.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Web presence was one component in a wider programme of marketing and outreach activities that most libraries engaged in. Some libraries held events to cultivate interest, especially to attract new visitors, and those who held events were particularly keen to engage potential users from non-user groups by hosting talks from those groups who were not library users:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have events. X History Club. It’s my creation – a series of talks, we have prestigious speakers and we target non-user groups. We’ve had talks from the gay community, the Muslim community, football fans. . .</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others produced information packs on family and local history containing useful bibliographies and tips on how to get started with research. One librarian wrote a column in the local newspaper each week, discussing a different image from the online collection. It was clear that the local studies libraries in this study worked hard to promote their services as a whole, through both online and traditional non-digital means.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0961000611434760">
<title>Community engagement</title>
<p>Interviewees were keen to point out that the community makes the library and it is in the library’s best interests to provide a service that aligns as far as possible with what the users need and expect:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh we definitely want people to get involved. We have a bit on the image archive if you look … if people have any photographs they want to donate or lend to us to add to the collection … we’re always looking for those. It’s mostly volunteers doing the inputting of the images so it is community based.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Contributing to the local studies collection is obviously a reciprocal arrangement. The very essence of the collection relies on material from the local area, and users feel a sense of inclusion as they have personally donated something to the collection that will be preserved for future generations. One interviewee summarised succinctly:
<disp-quote>
<p>Community involvement will allow for the survival of local government services such as Local Studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This sentiment suggests just how very important this aspect of the local studies service actually is. The subject of partnerships was also broached in this section of the interviews. Many of the librarians were involved in partnerships or informal collaborations with other local studies librarians:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have good relationships with our local counterparts in other authorities because … you can’t survive without talking to your local colleagues.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many also participated in a partnership or collaboration with the local archives service, often in relation to the digitisation of photograph collections. An overall picture of a Greater Manchester network was apparent, suggesting that a staff- and patron-based community was very important to the life of the local studies library.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0961000611434760">
<title>Audience for digital resources</title>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the interviewees had little input in deciding how use of their online resources was monitored. This tended to lead to a situation in which libraries had only limited information on the users of these resources. All of the libraries had access to web statistics to measure user levels on the website; they were able to discover what keyword searches visitors were using to reach the website and find out which web pages were being visited most. However, in relation to the digital image archives it was apparently difficult to differentiate between how many times visitors had been to a page and how many times they had clicked on an image to view it.</p>
<p>None of the libraries interviewed used registration for the website services such as the online digitised collections. Because the websites were part of the respective council domains, the library services had less input in deciding how users were monitored in terms of page counts and deciding whether to register users for services. However, although the number of visitors to the local studies web pages could be monitored, some of the librarians were more concerned with the quality of the visits to the collections:
<disp-quote>
<p>You can’t measure the quality of the visit. What about the actual outcome?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There was some recognition that there were some differences between the audiences for the digital and analogue (print) material available through the local studies service, which, it was suggested, was age related as: ‘Older people often prefer to use original resources’. There was also an acceptance that not all people, in the context of digital resources, had Internet access or were computer literate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well there are people who still don’t use the web, so maybe there are differences because people don’t want to access stuff online.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This was coupled with an awareness of the particular experience of seeing and touching the ‘original’ document, especially when it was personally relevant to that particular information seeker.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0961000611434760">
<title>Summary of interviews</title>
<p>The interviews confirmed that all local studies collections had a website presence, and in general they provide some access to digital resources through this presence, as well as other tools such as OPACs to provide an indication of ‘original’ documents. Librarians very much viewed digital resources as a taster to entice users to come in and use other resources – in other words they were seen as a having a pivotal role in promoting the local studies service. On the other hand, there were a number of frustrations associated with the Web presence belonging to part of the local council website, which ranged from the quality and branding of the website to the availability of appropriate measures to enable librarians to profile their online users. Librarians saw the Web presence and digitised materials as part of a portfolio of promotional and public relations activities, and, alongside this, they were particularly committed to the central importance of community engagement in ensuring that collections were live and vibrant.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This research in many senses confirms findings from previous research into the digitisation of local studies collections, but given the limited previous research, it also provides additional insights.</p>
<p>Libraries in this study had all engaged in some digitisation projects, but in common with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434760">Astle and Muir, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434760">Byamugisha, 2010</xref>) these were short-term projects focusing on a narrow range of materials. Funding was viewed as a significant barrier to further digitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434760">Astle and Muir, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434760">Byamugisha, 2010</xref>). Most librarians would welcome further digitisation of their resources to improve access, although some were concerned that too easy access to digital resources might discourage users from taking the time and effort to explore the much richer non-digital collection. Limited digitisation was seen as encouraging users to make visits to the local studies library. Whilst a multi-channel service is arguably the best way forward, there is considerable scope for the development of a more fully fledged online service providing access to an appropriate and targeted range of unique local studies resources.</p>
<p>In common with many other commentators, librarians expressed concerns about the value of preservation for digitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434760">Gorman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434760">Kalusopa and Zulu, 2009</xref>). This emerges partly from the limited scope of current digitisation projects, but is also grounded in significant ongoing concerns regarding the permanence and sustainability of digital media in the face of technology change.</p>
<p>Others have commented on the potential of digtisation of local studies collections to improve the overall value of the library service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434760">Barry and Tedd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434760">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>). These librarians were particularly enthusiastic about the value of digitised resources, accessible through their website, in enhancing their ‘shop window’, promoting a positive and up-to-date image of the service, and encouraging visits to the local studies pages on the council website. Through this process the limited digitised resources were being used for ‘access’, but not just to provide access to those resources, but also draw users and community members into the wider non-digital local studies collection. Local studies web pages were generally accessible with an appropriate level of content, but there was some variability depending on the local council Web conventions and practices.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>These findings are specific to the libraries in Greater Manchester that participated in this study. Nevertheless, the alignment of some of the key findings of this study with those of previous researchers gives confidence that to varying extents the findings of this study may have some resonances in other geographical locations. We therefore conclude this article with some recommendations that relate to local studies collections in general.</p>
<sec id="section26-0961000611434760">
<title>Recommendations for practitioners and policy makers</title>
<list id="list2-0961000611434760" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>There is a real need for libraries and their local councils to prioritise, especially in difficult funding regimes, the development of local studies services, and to seek, through a strategy involving collaboration, sponsorship, and other initiatives, to support the further digitisation of resources in local studies collections as the basis for a more extended online local studies presence;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attention could usefully be directed towards exploring the tensions between the use of digitisation for access and preservation in different contexts. In particular, librarians and policymakers need further evidence and stronger convictions that digital technologies are suitable for long-term preservation. In this context, there is scope for working with and learning from other types of organizations with responsibility for maintaining archives and developing sustainable digital repositories;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Amongst the interviewees there is recognition of the value of limited digital resources in promoting awareness of their collections, but there is scope for developing the Web presence of these resources further, with a view to both building a stronger promotional presence, as well as capitalising on opportunities for generating revenue through offering images for sale and other digital services;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Local studies librarians and policymakers need to develop more systematic means for evaluating in an integrated way the use of their resources, and to develop a more fully informed understanding of their key user groups and their expectations and information-seeking behaviours;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Given that local studies collections ‘belong’ to the community of those who have some association with a place, librarians need to have an identified strategy for embedding themselves in and leading that community in its engagement with its heritage. Web2.0 technologies offer some opportunities for forging links and facilitating communication, but they must be integrated into a wider and multi-faceted community engagement strategy.</p></list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="section27-0961000611434760">
<title>Recommendations for researchers</title>
<list id="list3-0961000611434760" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The first, and general recommendation to researchers, must be to urge that more researchers, in both the library and information sciences, and in other disciplines such as history, and cultural studies, make appropriate contributions to a better understanding of local studies resources and the means through which they can be exploited;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is an opportunity through monitoring local studies websites, to undertake a longitudinal study of developments in the digitisation of local studies resources, and their accessibility to various groups of users and potential users and communities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Further studies to update the profile and information behaviours of the users of local study resources, including academic researchers, children undertaking projects, and those seeking to understand their families and heritage would not only develop knowledge of information behaviour in the digital age, but also act as evidence to inform policy, strategy, and practice.</p></list-item>
