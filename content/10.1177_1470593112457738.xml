<abstract>
<p>In this paper we take a cultural perspective to understand the success of Simon Cowell’s <italic>X Factor</italic> TV talent show and its various brand extensions which, we suggest, epitomize the new marketing priorities of the media convergence era. We seek insights not from formal theories of marketing management but in the myth and magic of Cowell’s enchanted TV presence as the mystical authority, the trickster figure, conducting a mass-mediated experience of Turner’s (1969) ‘existential liminality’. Detached from formal rites of passage, this simulation of liminal ritual, temporarily and symbolically, subverts formal social barriers and opens up for the contestants the possibility of transformed identity. We suggest that <italic>X Factor</italic> viewers partake both vicariously and actually in this marketized experience of existential liminality. We review literary as well as anthropological antecedents of the media role Cowell personifies and we critique and extend previous applications of Turner’s work in marketing and consumption to suggest a wider resonance beyond the exemplar of <italic>X Factor</italic> in a range of ordinary, as well as extraordinary, consumption phenomena.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mr Simon Cowell is arguably the quintessential experiential marketer in the Western world with his stable of numerous TV formats and million-selling artists. His UK TV talent show, and now international franchise, <italic>X Factor</italic>, is remarkable not only for the seamless way it leverages its brand and integrates revenue-generating touch-points across media platforms, but also for the attention it receives as a cultural phenomenon. Academics have commented on the way it satisfies a human need for community and for sensational entertainments, and stimulates the desire to engage with universal narratives of human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457738">Day, 2010</xref>). <italic>X Factor</italic> also displays elements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112457738">Bakhtin’s (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457738">1984</xref>) theory of carnival with its irreverence and mockery of pretension, its bold populism and its juxtaposition of the ‘high’ of being a star and being ‘somebody’, and the low of being a rejected ‘nobody’.</p>
<p>We suggest, however, that while the cultural perspective in general offers more penetrating insights into the appeal of the <italic>X Factor</italic> brand than any conventional management theory, anthropologist Victor Turner’s (1965) notion of existential liminality may offer the richest analytical scheme, given the analogies between the show and ritual rites of passage. These include, among other things, the imposition of strict rules and procedures marking the contestants’ progress; the absolute authority of the judges, and the delegated authority of the audience; the ways in which the story arcs of the show juxtapose reversals of fortune, from anonymity and adversity to TV stardom; the humility with which the contestants are expected to endure the judges’ public criticism; and, most notably, the presence of Cowell’s trickster figure orchestrating the entire effect (notwithstanding Gary Barlow’s ability to act up in the part in the 2011 series).</p>
<p>
<italic>X Factor </italic>appears to be premised on a need not only for the kind of social connection seen in other media rituals, such as royal weddings and funerals, but also for a deeper engagement with a sense of the possibility of transformation. Turner’s ideas have been applied in consumer research to generate insights into the appeal of ‘extraordinary’ consumption phenomena such as white water rafting and extreme mountaineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457738">Tumbat and Belk, 2011</xref>). We suggest that they also have a wider resonance in the marketing of ‘ordinary’ and mass mediated consumer experiences.</p>
<p>We will begin by outlining the <italic>X Factor</italic> TV show format before reprising Turner’s theories of liminal ritual in order to clearly ground our subsequent analysis. We then offer a discussion of previous research into marketing success, followed by an account of the complex marketing effort underpinning the game-changing scale of Cowell’s triumph with his <italic>X Factor</italic> franchise. Finally, we analyse <italic>X Factor</italic> as an example of the marketization of existential liminality, taking in the crucial role Cowell hit upon as a composite of the mythical trickster/shaman figure in literature and anthropology. Our aim, overall, is to offer an explanation from cultural anthropology of <italic>X Factor’s</italic> huge appeal, and in so doing to hint at analogous processes underlying other brand marketing and consumption phenomena.</p>
<sec id="section2-1470593112457738">
<title>The X-Factor process</title>
<p>By way of a brief introduction to this (now worldwide) entertainment phenomenon, <italic>X Factor</italic> is not just a TV singing talent show but a new paradigm in TV talent shows. British TV has a long tradition of popular Saturday night talent shows, notably <italic>Opportunity Knocks</italic> in the 1970s and <italic>New Faces</italic> a decade later. Both shook a tub of saccharine over the traditional British pub ‘open mic’ format where anyone can get up and sing, and took it to mass TV audiences. What Cowell has done is to put dramatic light and shade, story arcs galore, and massive production budgets into this cheesy old genre. <italic>X Factor</italic> is, by some distance, the biggest show on UK television in terms of viewing figures, advertising revenue and media coverage. Simon Cowell owns the format and the <italic>X Factor</italic> brand, and his company has a major share in the production of the show and its many spin-off activities, from TV shows about the show (<italic>Xtra Factor</italic>), to the <italic>X Factor</italic> magazine, live performances in major venues, and internet downloads of the artists’ best songs. Cowell acts as agent to the winning singers, and he also takes on some losing finalists especially chosen for their commercial potential. He has been the lead judge, featuring prominently on every live TV show in each UK series up to 2011 when pop star Gary Barlow took over the role in the UK shows to allow Cowell to focus on the newly launched American franchise.</p>
<p>In the first stage, nationwide auditions are held for up to 200,000 hopefuls. Selected auditions appear on the early televised shows. It is a feature of <italic>X Factor</italic> that it was the first TV talent show to use the very worst auditions as entertainment material, with added edge brought by Cowell’s (and latterly, Barlow’s) frank, some would say cruel, public announcements on the auditionees’ lamentable lack of talent, personality, charm or all three. This freak show element attracts criticism for presenting the caterwauling performances of the deeply deluded as comic entertainment. Yet the car crash auditions also serve a dramatic purpose, since they offer a stark contrast which accentuates the talent that improbably emerges from this primeval sludge of solipsistic ego and tone-deaf ambition.</p>
<p>Performances which are no better than competent appear by contradistinction to be shining beacons of show-business talent worthy of a standing ovation from the studio audience; that is, until they are exposed for their mediocrity in subsequent trials as the drama oscillates around the continually shifting constructs of talent/somebody and not-talent/nobody. After several rounds of auditions, accompanied by fevered media coverage of the contestants’ life journey from defeat, dysfunction or despair to the threshold of triumph and personal transformation, a large minority are elected to go to boot camp, a residential talent-churning event from which a smaller set of semi finalists are chosen. The discarded losers, distraught and perplexed but with a story to tell of their close encounter with fame, slope back to their back story, the media attention a mere memory.</p>
<p>The surviving neophytes are allocated to one of four categories: over 25s, girls, boys and groups, and each gets a judge as dedicated mentor. They are then flown to Miami, Los Angeles, or other destinations far from their usual horizon to be temporarily ensconced in the kinds of spectacular homes top stars might occupy, to rehearse intensively under the close scrutiny of their mentor. The juxtaposition of the trappings of extraordinary wealth with the economically humble backgrounds of most of the contestants is deliberate. The contrast between grim reality and bling-tastic possibility is played up for all it’s worth and the contestants are duly wrung for tears to camera as they speak, in quivering close-up, of the transformation that winning would mean for their lives. Emotional dramas ensue until 12 finalists are chosen to compete in the live TV shows, amid much media controversy about the judges’ decisions.</p>
<p>Back in the UK, this elite group of liminars is taken from their homes and families and installed together in a luxury house under tight security in order to rehearse every day for the live show competitions. They have been separated from their previous lives for short periods since boot camp, but this time their separation is prolonged and continuous, lasting until they are voted off the show, or until they win it. Their daily dramas and family and personal problems are filmed and retold in Britain’s celebrity, show-business and, often, news media too, as the aspirants occupy a marginal state on the threshold of stardom, yet also are still deeply ordinary tryers. They are besieged by press and fans in their self-contained compound for the duration of their time on the show, and trips out into ‘real’ life, even to meet with family members, are closely controlled, choreographed and exhibited as vignettes in the TV shows, always with the journey from low to high (or at least, to not-quite-so-low) as the key narrative.</p>
<p>At this stage, the viewing public, previously represented by the baying Coliseum crowd in the apparently huge TV studio arena, are transformed into quasi-judges through the telephone voting system. Each finalist’s nobody-to-somebody story arc is elaborated as the PR is hyped up to saturate the media. Each successive show requires the acts to perform on live, peak-time TV. The judges make all creative decisions on the performances, and the TV audience phones in to vote (at a price) to keep their favourite artist in the show. The artist with the least votes each week leaves, and the ultimate winner earns a recording contract, and a shot at superstardom. The finalists are in competition with each other, yet a policy is strictly enforced under which only public statements of mutual appreciation and camaraderie are permitted. Some private disagreements, or romances, do tend to leak to the press, just to fan the flames of popular interest. Stories of the judges’ rivalry and supposedly bitter arguments also find their way into the media as each judge hopes ‘their’ act will win. The contestants meet the public denigration of their weaker performances with ritual humility, thanking the judges for their sometimes coruscating and personal criticisms. The live shows are spectacular affairs, bringing production values never before seen on TV talent shows and the (usually mediocre) talents receive the very best of professional voice and dance coaching, musical backing, elaborate stage sets, expert PR guidance and, for a lucky few, commercial contracts and management.</p>
<p>Having outlined the <italic>X Factor</italic> process we will now introduce Turner’s (1969) notion of liminality. Turner’s concepts of liminality and communitas have become part of a taken-for-granted vocabulary of interpretive social science that often fails to ground these terms in his original conceptual scheme. It is therefore important to reiterate some foundational issues in order to clearly identify the points of resonance with <italic>X Factor</italic>.</p>

<title>Victor Turner and liminal ritual</title>
<p>The liminal zone was a phenomenon anthropologist Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>: see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112457738">1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593112457738">1974</xref>) had observed in ritual process, building on the work of van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457738">Gennep (1961</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112457738">Turner’s (1967)</xref> initial ideas were grounded in his ethnographic observations of the ritual rites of passage of the Ndembu tribe. Rites of passage are rituals noted in all societies to mark transitional phases of life such as birth, death, marriage, puberty and so forth. Turner conceived of liminality as a realm rich in the possibility of infinite change and renewal, of individuals, ideas and relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) had commented in his later work that, in economically advanced societies, a phenomenon he termed existential liminality had emerged wherein elements of liminal ritual were present in a form detached from traditional rites of passage.</p>
<p>Previously, van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457738">Gennep (1961</xref>) had noted that the ritual process consisted of three stages:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>separation</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>liminal period</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>reassimilation.</p>
</list-item>
</list>This categorization was also referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) as preliminal, liminal and postliminal. The key element is the possibility of a transformation into a new status in a revised social structure. First, there is a separation in which the subject (also known as the liminar, or the passenger) is divested of their usual social context and its symbolic accoutrements. This can be seen as a symbolic death. But the subject is neither quite dead to their old life, nor quite alive in their new life. In Turner’s (1969) phrase, they are ‘betwixt and between’, just as the <italic>X Factor</italic> finalists are neither stars, nor anonymous bar or shop workers. This occurs in a realm Turner called ‘anti-structure’, in that the imprint of social structure is momentarily erased from the social interaction of this group of liminars. There then follows the liminal phase of trial, test and potential transformation. The liminal process is characterized by a number of features, including the observance of a strict procedure enforced by a figure of mystical authority: a sense of the infinite possibility of change; playful and irreverent reversal and subversion of normal social structural roles; marginalization in that the subjects are simultaneously members of two or more social groups – their previous one, which they have not yet formally left, and their new one; and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) called ‘communitas’.</p>
<p>Communitas refers to the momentary experience of mutual emotional connection which can occur in the absence of social structure. The meaning of this term has arguably become diluted since it became popular in social science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) was very clear that communitas is not the same as solidarity or community: it cannot persist over time and occurs in momentary experiences ‘in the interstices of social structure’ (1969: 153). One example might be the connection felt by a group of friends on the summer holiday after finishing high school, before they move on to their new lives and that connection is lost. The liminal phase is often orchestrated by a trickster or shaman figure who lies outside social structure, yet holds mystical power over its domain. The trickster’s authority is absolute within the liminal process. Finally, in the re-assimilation stage, the initiates who have been judged successful in their progress through the liminal passage are received back into social structure, with due fanfare and ceremony, in a new and elevated position.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) felt that the cultural resonance of liminality was by no means limited to traditional rites of passage marking life crises, transitional or calendrical events in pre- or indeed post-industrial societies. He referred to aspects of liminality evident in sub-cultural movements such as religious pilgrimages, cults and the hippie movement, and as a concept helping to illuminate structural and psychological experiences of change in much wider cultural arenas of politics, religion and revolution. He also allowed that communitas can occur in the absence of a liminal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner, 1969</xref>: 109); but most of his examples also exhibit aspects of liminal ritual. Importantly, communitas is not just a blanket term for one thing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) referred to three kinds of communitas that can arise from different forms of liminal process. These are:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>existential communitas</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>normative communitas</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>ideological communitas.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Existential communitas is spontaneous and fleeting, what might have been described in the 1960s hippie movement as a ‘happening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner, 1969</xref>: 132). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) also used the term liminoid experiences to refer to existential communitas. We suggest that it is this form of communitas which most aptly fits marketing and consumption phenomena. The most obvious analogies in contemporary marketing might be flash mob events or adventure holidays, but we suggest that there is no reason not to apply it to mediated experiences as well. Normative communitas occurs where there is a shared goal which demands organization and resources, as in, say, a sports team or a group of soldiers. Ideological communitas refers to utopian social movements. In all three, communitas appears to be a subjective affective state experienced as something spontaneous and momentary, and in its latter two forms the ‘seeds of structural segmentation and hierarchy’ are already sewn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner, 1969</xref>: 136).</p>
<p>Turner also allowed for ‘pathological communitas’ (1969: 129). The Manson ‘family’ or criminal gangs might be examples of this. It is not entirely clear whether Turner intended communitas to be conceived as a collective emotion, or as a system of relationships and practices. It seems clear that the latter may arise from the former, and communitas may generate communitarian ideals. However, when this happens, social structure has reasserted itself and the moment of communitas has passed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) stated that if individuals act ‘in terms of the rights conferred by the incumbency of office in the social structure’; or if they follow their ‘psychobiological urges at the expense of one’s fellows’ (1969: 105), then communitas is violated. In other words, whenever individuals assert their individuality, that is, they revert to the status-seeking behaviour of social structure, communitas is no longer present. This is an important distinction since it reasserts the difference between communitas as an emotional bond which is sufficient in and of itself, and community (or solidarity) as a bond that is structured by mutual obligations and practices. Sub-cultural groups oriented around consumption (for example extreme mountaineering, biker groups, or style sub cultures like Japanese ‘cos players’) might be seen as examples of the creation of anti-structural spaces, yet the experience of communitas need not necessarily be implicated in them.</p>
<sec id="section4-1470593112457738">
<title>Existential liminality</title>
<p>In this paper we focus on existential liminality, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) also referred to as liminoid experience. The characteristics of this are (1) participation is voluntary (as opposed to being a compulsory consequence of marriage, death, birth, etc); and (2) resolution, i.e. re-assimilation into a revised social structure with a new identity is not necessary to the experience of transformation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) gave the example of citizens living under a semi-permanent state of political chaos and/or warfare. In such circumstances, the experience is liminoid in the sense that the experience of being in a state of transformation may not be resolved during a life course. Another example Turner gave was in the Judeao/Islamic/Christian traditions where life on earth is a liminal experience with the desired resolution occurring only after death (and indeed the same may be said of Buddhism and Hinduism, with a different eschatology).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>), then, extended van Gennep’s (1961) ideas well beyond traditions of ritual in pre-industrial societies. As he put it,<disp-quote>
<p>The very flexibility and mobility of social relations in modern industrial societies … may provide better conditions for the emergence of existential communitas, even if only in countless and transient encounters, than any previous forms of social order. Perhaps this is what Walt Whitman meant when he wrote ‘One’s-self I sing, a simple separate person, Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse’. (van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457738">Gennep, 1961</xref>: 203)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Whitman’s phrase has a more than superficial similarity to the <italic>X Factor</italic> format of singing for popular acclaim. Turner’s work gave the notion of liminality far wider currency beyond anthropology and into sociology, political, anthropological and cultural studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112457738">Szakolczai, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112457738">Hayward and Hobbs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112457738">Horvath et al., 2009</xref>). Liminality has been applied to small groups, sub-cultures, historical epochs, entire nations or to individuals: psychoanalysis, for example, can be understood as a liminal process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) suggested that liminality is a time and/or place in which normal social structures and action can be reversed and subverted. It acts not only as a playful counterpoint to everyday norms but also as a site at which the values and practices of the surrounding social structure can be brought into relief. This has helped extend the concept to political anthropology and to the examination of cultural and sub-cultural phenomena. It is in this spirit of political and cultural anthropology that we turn Turner’s (1969) ideas to an examination of a hugely popular TV show.</p>
<p>Before embarking on our analysis, it must be admitted that Turner’s ideas may have been over-extended, and some commentators feel that they lose more of their explanatory power the further away they are applied from traditional sacred rites of passage. There is a danger that the idea has become too abstract and, therefore, is too easily applied in new contexts. What is more, phenomena such as <italic>X Factor</italic> are open to analysis by other conceptual frames. As we note above, the show could resonate to some degree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112457738">Bakhtin’s (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457738">1984</xref>) literary theories of the carnival in its playful and chaotic subversion of social hierarchies. However, the carnivalesque may represent manifestations of anti-structure; but it displays few of the other characteristics of liminal processes, such as strict procedure, the authority of the trickster/shaman, or the ritual re-assimilation of the passenger into social structure. In the management literature, the <italic>X Factor</italic> might be seen as an example of ‘karaoke capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112457738">Ridderstråle and Nordström, 2004</xref>) in that it makes a virtue of the copy. Then again, <italic>X Factor</italic> is deeply original in its unoriginality.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that Turner’s ideas are open to interpretation, and also that <italic>X Factor </italic>can be analysed in other ways, we argue that Cowell’s activities have, unwittingly, marketized existential liminality, adding a deep cultural resonance to a profoundly prosaic entertainment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) explained:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Society seems to be a process rather than a thing – a dialectical process with successive phases of structure and communitas. There would seem to be – if one can use such a controversial term – a human ‘need’ to participate in both modalities. Persons starved of one in their functional day-to-day activities seek it in ritual liminality. (1969: 203).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) clearly identifies communitas as a consequence of liminal ritual, and we conceive of the consumer experience of <italic>X Factor</italic> not only in terms of a need for anti-structure (which can, after all, be served in other forms of group human interaction) but as an experience (as viewer or as contestant) that is given a powerful resonance by its analogy with liminal ritual processes. Now, before embarking on our analysis, we look at previous literature which analyses the management techniques or the consumer motivations underlying marketing success, before offering a more detailed account of Cowell’s role in the ubiquitous marketing entity that is <italic>X Factor</italic>.</p>

<title>Explaining Cowell’s marketing nous</title>
<p>Accounting for major marketing success is all too often beyond the clichéd prescriptions of typical text books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593112457738">Brown, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112457738">Hackley, 2003</xref>). Cowell’s complex business model does not naturally fit the stereotypical one-size-fits-all marketing approach of researching consumer needs, and then satisfying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112457738">Kotler, 1967</xref>). Giving consumers what they say they want is not only a tautological explanation of business success but a palpable misrepresentation of the tactics of many leading business figures from Henry Ford to Michael O’Leary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457738">Brown, 2010</xref>). Cowell’s basic product consists of unknowns singing cover versions of past hit songs, a case of karaoke capitalism (with added layers of taut emotion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112457738">Ridderstråle and Nordström, 2004</xref>) if ever there was one. Of course, while the core product may be yet another contribution to the postmodern ‘culture of the copy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593112457738">Schwartz, 1996</xref>) it is the endless augmentation that transforms Cowell’s simulacra into a compelling set of marketing propositions. Cowell himself is lauded as the pre-eminent marketer of his generation – today’s P.T. Barnum, no less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112457738">Brown and Hackley, 2012</xref>) – someone who has single-handedly transformed a failing and disillusioned industry (the post-download music business) into a veritable fountain of gold discs (and all manner of ancillary merchandise).</p>
<p>Previous research focusing on the style and strategies of legendary marketers has noted their insistence on stubbornly following their personal vision rather than following a formula. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457738">Brown (2010</xref>) shows that Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, James Dyson, Steve Jobs and many more marketing titans eschewed formulaic approaches and, instead, learned from abject failure before they achieved their historic successes on their own terms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470593112457738">Hackley (2009</xref>) points out that ‘The commercial insight of visionary entrepreneurs such as Ray Kroc, Akio Morita, Bill Gates, and Richard Branson, to take a few examples, apparently owed little to formal, textbook models of strategic marketing planning’ (2009: 8). But, the transcendent personal force of legendary marketers aside, most marketing successes can be seen as the results of powers greater than any individual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112457738">Holt (2004</xref>) for example describes the success of iconic brands such as Coca Cola and Volkswagen as the outcome of a dialectical interaction between the brand and the culture which gives it meaning. He argues that astute brand management consists not in blindly pushing the management line but in listening, and responding, to the subtle currents of consumer culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457738">McCracken (2009</xref>) argues that marketing excellence consists not in the personal vision of management gurus but in an organization-wide cultural consciousness. The more managerially leaning theory-mongers posit paradigms such as relationship marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112457738">Gronroos, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457738">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457738">Gummesson, 2002</xref>) or service based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112457738">Vargo and Lusch, 2004</xref>) which may have an intuitive appeal in the post-industrial Western world. Yet the intangible commercial instinct, negotiating skills and sheer clarity of vision that characterize the <italic>art</italic> of marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457738">Brown, 1996</xref>) seem more pre-eminent, and more elusive, than ever.</p>
<sec id="section6-1470593112457738">
<title>Consumption as the pursuit of pleasure, rather than utility</title>
<p>Some academic consumer researchers have focused less on the rationality than the irrationality of marketing success. For example the pursuit of pleasure is seen as a foundational concept in consumer research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112457738">Goulding et al., 2009</xref>), and those marketers who understand the deep motivations of pleasure seekers have a head start in building strategies around the consumption of these pleasures. If Simon Cowell knows anything, he knows what kind of entertainment pleases TV and music audiences. There are many varieties of pleasures which may confer, if not necessarily a sense of communitas, then at least a sense of occupying an anti-structural space for a moment, such as the adrenaline rush of white water rafting, skydiving or mountain climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112457738">Arnould and Price, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112457738">Celsi et al., 1993</xref>); the sweeter but less intense pleasure of indulging in nostalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593112457738">Holbrook and Schindler, 2003</xref>); or the imaginative transformation of fantasy, passion or hedonic gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112457738">Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457738">Belk et al., 2003</xref>). A sense of being outside the established social structure yet also mutually bonded often seems to accompany collective or ‘extraordinary’ consumption experiences, although as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457738">Tumbat and Belk (2011</xref>) point out this need not preclude intensely individual behaviour. The sense of the social is here conceived as a key component of pleasure. One interesting aspect of the experience of Cowell’s TV shows is that the pleasure of partaking is dialectically solitary and social: one can watch the shows alone yet enjoy them as a collective experience, and perhaps phone in to cast your vote or go online to chat about the performances.</p>
<p>Of course, some pleasures are not only solitary as well as social but potentially or actually transgressive or damaging, such as excessive alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457738">Griffin et al., 2009</xref>); dance raves and associated drug taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112457738">Goulding et al., 2009</xref>); illicit sex (Belk et al., 1998); or getting tattoos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593112457738">Patterson and Schroeder, 2010</xref>). All these examples can be seen as attempts to escape the suffocating roles and obligations of social structure, to some extent. Seen as pleasures, they are acquired tastes. The pleasures of <italic>X Factor</italic>, solitary or social, seem to range from the rather vindictive pleasure of watching the ritual humiliation of desperate but talentless auditionees, to the para-social identification with the finalists as quasi-soap opera characters, along the way taking in the fascination of unpicking just what, exactly, are the components of show business stardom. While <italic>X Factor</italic> is not really a transgressive pleasure, it is certainly a guilty one. It is the most unashamedly lowbrow of popular entertainment and is scorned by music fans who feel that it suppresses and devalues more spontaneous eruptions of popular music talent. Nonetheless, there are many in the <italic>X Factor</italic> audience whose demographic profile suggests that they ought to be watching opera instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457738">Day, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The pleasures of social experience can refer to mundane, everyday consumption (Holt and Thompson, 2004) or to activities that are overtly conceived as attempts to escape the strictures and confines of marketized experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112457738">Kozinets, 2002</xref>). Major media events such as hugely popular TV shows, celebrity weddings or indeed tragic disasters have been theorized as homogenizing collective experiences which give people a renewed sense of being bound together within the prevailing social order (for example see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112457738">Pantti and Sumiala, 2009</xref>). In contrast, <italic>X Factor</italic> has anti-structural elements in its raucous, baying live crowds and its glorification of the contestants, the majority of whom as we note are marginal characters of low social status. The show gives a platform to individuals who would never achieve fame and renown by any other means. It is plebeian entertainment given all the wealth and gloss of high society, in which the final judgement ultimately rests with the ordinary viewers at home.</p>
<p>In these senses <italic>X Factor</italic> can be seen both to support the neoliberal social order, and to subvert it. The crowd has the power to recognize the quirky talent of an individual that conventional society has deemed unworthy of great reward, and to confer upon him or her immense wealth and fame. It goes without saying that <italic>X Factor</italic> is also deeply conventional. Many of the early auditions have a bearbaiting character – the odd, the deluded or the personality disordered are mocked and sent back to their dismal lives, while the winners are those who can conform most closely to the demands of the mass market music industry. The show as a whole is, in truth, more of a showcase for the established talent of invited star artists and judges and a booster of royalties for the original copyright holders of featured songs, than a trailblazing pioneer for new artists or new musical forms.</p>
<p>Some other consumer research studies might also have some contribution to make to understanding the <italic>X Factor</italic> appeal. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457738">Firat and Venkatesh (1995</xref>) allude to the fragmentation of traditional social bonds, which press people into seeking multiple and fluid relationships via online media (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112457738">Baudrillard, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112457738">McAlexander et al, 2002</xref>) and which drive the expansion of virtual communities. The notion of the consumer tribe has also gained resonance in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112457738">Cova, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457738">Cova et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112457738">Bauman (1992</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112457738">Cova, 1997</xref>: 301) suggests that postmodern tribes subsist in a perpetual state of becoming which only lasts as long as the power of rituals to attract. This chimes with Turner’s (1969) notion of existential liminality as a collective and transitory engagement with the possibility of change within a fluid social context. The <italic>X Factor</italic> tribe is not only an online phenomenon (page hits for the show’s website number in the scores of millions) – thousands of fans attend the live shows, read the press coverage, buy the magazine and engage in physical as well as virtual modes with the <italic>X Factor</italic> brand. However, the online extensions of the show, as we shall see later in the paper, are hugely significant in extending the reach of the brand and deepening the fans’ collective sense of personal engagement.</p>
<p>We will now explain more of Cowell’s business practices and the huge scale of his success with <italic>X Factor</italic> before moving into our analysis of the ritual dynamic which underpins it. Central to this, we suggest, is Cowell’s media persona as the ultimate trickster figure of the entertainment world.</p>

<title>In with a bullet – the Simon Cowell media phenomenon</title>
<p>As an attribute of a pre-eminent entertainment impresario of the digital era, Simon Cowell’s marketing genius, built on his talent as a music and TV impresario, seems beyond question. But the precise nature of his legendary marketing savvy is an enigma, and some of the contradictions in his cv are striking. For example, by his own admission Cowell can’t sing, doesn’t play a musical instrument, and doesn’t produce records. In an interview with <italic>Playboy</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470593112457738">1</xref>
</sup> magazine he admitted that his keynote TV talent vehicle, <italic>American Idol</italic>, is a soap opera, not a music show. Yet he has sold over 150 million records. As a talent manager Cowell spotted the music selling potential of acts as unlikely as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the Tellytubbies, Robson and Gerome, and professional wrestler The Undertaker. Cowell has also enjoyed consistent success with more mainstream pop artists like ‘boyband’ Westlife, million-selling 1980s singer and sometime girlfriend Sinitta and, latterly, his string of talent show winners headed by superstar Leona Lewis and boy band brand JLS.</p>
<p>Other contradictions are equally arresting. He learned his trade as an artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) man in the record business and had no training in TV, yet Cowell holds the rights to some of the most lucrative TV show formats in history. Even more paradoxically, Cowell claims he doesn’t know how to work a computer or an iPod, yet a cursory examination of the web-based activities around his TV shows reveals a cutting-edge case study in leveraging value from digital and social marketing. Finally, and most significantly, Cowell appears to be an opinionated but grounded individual who boasts of his lack of personal sophistication. Yet leering over the sweeping panorama of his marketing landscape are the botox-smoothed features of the most recognizable global celebrity since Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Cowell’s peerless PR and expensively veneered smile has made him the biggest reptile the TV celebrity jungle has ever known. He claims his talent is simply that he knows how to make money by exploiting his sense of the popular taste. And this is not disingenuous – Cowell happily concedes that his personal tastes are irredeemably vulgar, from his love of chips and pizza to his vulgarly ostentatious cars and houses. He was a private school drop-out who learned the music business from a lowly position in the company post room, and he watches the same popular genres of TV that he makes. He is a sharp dealmaker who understands the politics of TV contracts – he is said to have invented the <italic>X Factor</italic> franchise to give him more leverage in his contract negotiations with his American Idol partner Simon Fuller. The resemblance between Fuller’s original UK success <italic>Pop Idol</italic> and <italic>X Factor</italic> is such that Fuller sued Cowell for copyright infringement. The case was settled out of court, with reports suggesting that Cowell had agreed to appear in more series of <italic>American Idol</italic> while Fuller’s company, Entertainment 19, received a minority interest in various <italic>X Factor</italic>-related intellectual properties.<sup>

<sec id="section8-1470593112457738">
<title>The marketing power of the TV persona</title>
<p>Cowell knows how to negotiate from a position of strength but his unparalleled gift for launching one successful entertainment brand after another is underpinned by his instinctive understanding of his consumers. He knows what people want, because it’s what he likes too. Cowell’s status as a cultural icon might be the result of a combination of experience, instinct, happy accident and the astute skills of his close associate, PR guru Max Clifford. But, just as Cowell admits to being fascinated (and not always in a good way) by the people he auditions for his shows, the fascination of Cowell lies in the extraordinary force of his TV persona. The success of his early career could be understood in terms of the nuts and bolts of talent spotting and the management of media rights, music publicity and broadcasting royalties. But Cowell the icon has emerged after he made it big, went bankrupt, then made it bigger in the music business. Cowell has only existed for the general public since his TV career took off with his role as an invited judge on <italic>Pop Idol</italic> in 2001. It is worth, then, looking at the persona, the cultural icon that is planet Cowell, in order to try to understand something of the marketing universe that orbits around it.</p>
<p>As we suggest above, there is nothing in conventional marketing management theory that explains the publicity leverage which charismatic individuals can give to their business brands, but the alchemy of publicity can transform a brand and everyone knows it. A production line of TV entrepreneurs has followed in the footsteps of Sir Richard Branson, Sir Philip Green, Donald Trump, Lord Alan Sugar and Steve Jobs, seeking to build their brands – or indeed rebuild in the cases of Donald Trump and Alan Sugar – on the back of increased personal exposure. Perhaps more apposite analogies with Cowell might be legends of entertainment such as circus impresario P.T. Barnum, Elvis Presley’s darkly mysterious manager ‘Colonel’ Tom Parker, or British television entrepreneur cigar-toting Lord Lew Grade. All these peerless publicists knew exactly how to whip up the public’s passion for diverting spectacle, and, moreover, how to make top dollar from it.</p>
<p>But Cowell’s public face reaches beyond all these in the intimacy and authority he achieves with his audience. His viewers feel that they know him personally. Even more strangely, they like him. Cowell is a classic narcissist, a workaholic commitment-phobe who has publicly left a trail of women moving reluctantly into their thirties still yearning for his babies. Yet his audience admire his chutzpah and like him for his rakish affinity with much younger women, his dislike of ‘posh’ food, and his instinctive anti-snobbery. They also know his human side. Vignettes from his life story are well publicized, among them his misdemeanours as a rebellious schoolboy, his business failure at 30 which meant that he had to move back to live with his parents, and his grief the day that he phoned home to announce he’d had his first number 1 chart hit, only to find that his beloved father had died that very day of a tragically unexpected heart attack.</p>
<p>Cowell was known initially for his cruel integrity in publicly crushing the aspirations of earnest but talentless hopefuls. However, this initial positioning for his persona has gradually been moderated and warmed with a steady PR leakage of stories about his vulnerability, charitable work and personal loyalty. His role in his shows was to supply the dark shades which contrast with the unbearable lightness of talent show optimism. This contrast, and the spurious authority he brought to his TV presence, brought a dramatic resonance to the format which utterly transformed the talent show genre. Today, Cowell has all but dropped his role as a pantomime British baddy: the Mr Nasty motif has been replaced by Mr Sensitive. What remains of his role in <italic>X Factor</italic> is the trickster’s unfathomable yet effortless authority, played to a ‘T’ by his successor in the UK series, Gary Barlow of chart-topping middle-aged ‘boy-band’ Take That.</p>

<title>Delineating the X-Factor money machine</title>
<p>Cowell’s marketing modus operandi epitomizes the convergence of media, marketing and celebrity culture. At the time of writing, he has reportedly signed a deal to keep his hit show <italic>X Factor</italic> on UK TV until 2013.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470593112457738">3</xref>
</sup> In the meantime, he has exported the format to the USA to rival the success of another Cowell vehicle, <italic>America’s Got Talent</italic>. <italic>X Factor’s </italic>real time viewing figures in the UK of 15–17 million have leveraged the price of 30-second advertising slots up to an estimated £150,000, rising to around £250,000 for the 2010 series final. Other revenue streams bubble from the <italic>X Factor</italic> spring. A reported 10,000,000 viewers paid around 35 pence each to vote in the 2009 final, revenue that is shared between ITV, production company Freemantle Talkback Thames, and Cowell’s SYCOtv. There are sponsorship deals on the main show and its spin-off show <italic>Xtra Factor, </italic>and additional interactive and online content revenues from the show’s website, ITV.com/TheXFactor. The website attracted more than 95 million page views and 30 video million views during the 2009 series. Downloads of the performances generate revenue that is shared between Freemantle, the production company that makes the show, ITV, the UK commercial TV channel that shows it, and iTunes. The website also sells tickets for national tours of sell-out live shows featuring the performers. The site facilitates crowd sourced insights through forums and blogs, and offers the opportunity to buy the contestants’ recording releases or join an online community of karaoke singers (for 99p a song). It carries click-through links to all the main social networking websites (<italic>X Factor</italic> has almost 1,000,000 Facebook fans) and clips of interviews and performances. There is a spin-off magazine, and last but not least there are record sales from the most popular contestants, signed to Cowell’s SyCo label. The show’s winner normally stands atop of the record sales charts each Christmas.</p>
<p>There may be mythic elements to the appeal of Cowell’s TV persona, but there is nothing misty about his marketing triumphs. The all-important bottom line is that Cowell earns serious income from some of the biggest shows in TV history. For example, <italic>American Idol</italic> regularly attracts 30 million viewers for the Fox network, which earned Cowell an annual salary alleged to exceed $30 million.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470593112457738">4</xref>
</sup> In 2008, according to <italic>Forbes</italic> magazine,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470593112457738">5</xref>
</sup> Cowell was the highest earner on Amercian TV at around $75 million. UK <italic>X Factor</italic> is credited with carrying the ITV network through a serious financial crisis by boosting its advertising income by an estimated £100,000,000 in 2009. A single 30-second spot during the show’s final on 13 December 2009 reached more than 19,000,000<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470593112457738">6</xref>
</sup> viewers at a reported cost of around £250,000.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470593112457738">7</xref>
</sup> ITV hadn’t seen viewing figures like that since, well, since Cowell’s previous vehicle, <italic>Britain’s Got Talent</italic>, earlier in 2009. On top of the advertising there is sponsorship from broadband supplier Talk-Talk. The most powerful man on television owns the rights to <italic>I’m A Celebrity</italic> and <italic>Dancing on Ice</italic> as well as producing <italic>X Factor</italic> through his Syco music company in partnership with TV production outfit Freemantle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470593112457738">8</xref>
</sup> And this is just the beginning. Other TV formats are being piloted at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Cowell’s success has been massively leveraged because what he does translated so effectively from terrestrial TV and hard copy CD sales into a fluid, cash-generating format for a digital media environment. In today’s virally enabled, 24/7 marketing democracy, the central tasks are to stimulate demand and facilitate consumer involvement without losing control of the brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112457738">Hackley, 2010</xref>). Even the hyperbolic Barnum might have struggled to exaggerate the difficulty of this high-wire balancing act. And while ITV provides <italic>X Factor</italic> with a website for managing branded content and facilitating viewer engagement, Cowell has found that internet plebiscites don’t always deliver the desired result. His <italic>X Factor</italic> 2009 winning artist Joe McElderry lost out on the UK Christmas pop chart number one spot to <italic>Killing in the Name</italic> as a result of a Facebook campaign protesting against Cowell’s hegemony over the UK music charts. Cowell initially betrayed his anger at this spontaneous show of public defiance with some ill-judged comments, but in time wiser counsel prevailed and he offered the organizers of the Facebook rebellion his compliments and a job with Cowell Inc. As for young Joe, the pint-sized warbler was reported in 2011 to be living back at home with his mum.</p>
<p>A subsequent rebellion in the 2010 series had supporters making hundreds of calls each just to keep Wagner, a tone deaf Brazilian with the sense of rhythm of a three-wheeled shopping trolley, on the show to discredit it as a talent vehicle. Happily for Cowell, this failed, but only after the hapless rebels had generated yet more publicity for the show and poured their phone revenues into the bulging Cowell bank account. Incidentally, it is a curiosity of <italic>X-Factor</italic> appeal that, for the rebels, it epitomizes the corporatization of music and entertainment and therefore represents the most conformist and oppressive forces of social structure: capitalist, corporate control, manifest. Anti-social structure? Hardly. Yet, for its aficionados, large numbers of whom fit a surprisingly affluent and well educated demographic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457738">Day, 2010</xref>), part of its appeal appears to reside in the anti-corporate democracy of the show. The people decide. It is a popular plebiscite of the purest kind. We know what we like and the music cognoscenti can be damned.</p>

<sec id="section10-1470593112457738">
<title>
<italic>X Factor</italic> as marketized liminal ritual</title>
<p>It is no accident that the initial success of <italic>X Factor</italic> is so closely identified with the massive presence and persona of Simon Cowell. We see his TV role as a mythical enchanter, the trickster figure in liminal rituals, who mobilizes and orchestrates a mass-media experience of existential liminality. The trickster and master of ceremonies was a character who stood outside of social structure and who was invested with mystical qualities and an awesome authority, such as the witch doctor or magic man. Cowell’s insight into the importance of the role has informed the success of his replacement judge, Gary Barlow. Barlow was a pop idol himself, the musically talented one from iconic band Take That, before the career went into decline and he sought comfort by his own admission in extra-large and frequent portions of fish and chips. One weight-loss programme later he emerged, now fitting neatly into a suit and looking razor sharp, to act out the role Cowell epitomized. Barlow’s cod formal stage demeanour, his mock horror at the auditionee’s cheek and self delusion, and the withering yet unanswerable authority of his judgements, could be a comic impersonation of Cowell’s definitive shamanic stage persona: but it works.</p>
<p>There are other points of connection, too, between liminal ritual and the <italic>X-Factor</italic> process. For example, in liminal rituals there is often a reversal of social status in which the low in status enjoyed the right to verbally abuse the high born, while the powerful had to humble themselves before the weak. In <italic>X Factor</italic>, the judges are exalted in the TV shows, their every appearance choreographed as if they were movie stars at the Oscars. Their red-carpeted walkway to the theatre is lined with adoring fans, and they sit on a raised dais to pass judgement on the liminals. But as the TV shows reach their climax they are placed symbolically below the voting public, who often thwart the judges’ plans for victory. The sub-text of the show is also anti-structural in the sense that vast fame and riches are seen to accrue to people who enjoy the good fortune of a modest but popular talent. The structural norms of social progression via institutionalized education and professional accreditation are nowhere to be seen. Anyone can make it big in the realm of anti-structure, if the crowd wills it.</p>
<p>The audience (both in the live theatre and at home), along with the show judges, represents the absolute authority to which contestants are subject in their transformational quest from eccentric nobody to putative superstar. We see the huge success of Cowell’s TV talent show genre as one, particularly vivid, example of a wider trend toward the marketization not just of an ersatz communitas but of liminal experiences in their many manifestations. Cowell’s TV talent shows, as liminal rituals, provide these states of existential liminality and communitas in neatly packaged slivers for both audience and participants. Cowell’s role as chief judge directs the ritual, orchestrates the process and lights the liminal way as the trickster, the shaman, the jester, the witch doctor, the voodoo priest. He represents, in short, a charismatic outsider who lives beyond the conventional moral order yet performs the function of legitimizing the social structure through his mystical wisdom and sacred authority. He is someone who can ‘symbolize the moral values of communitas as against the coercive power of supreme political rulers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner, 1969</xref>: 110).</p>
<p>Prominent examples of the mystical outsider who sanctions the moral order from cinematic art include Clint Eastwood’s many manifestations of the moral outlaw; from visual art, the cavalcade of avant-garde iconoclasts, such as Manet, Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol, who challenged the establishment; and from literary art, there are parallels with mythic enchanter characters such as King Arthur’s in-house magician, Merlin, Tolkien’s imperishable Gandalf and J.K. Rowling’s avuncular Dumbledore. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) included political leaders in his pantheon of liminal tricksters – he suggested that, during times of social upheaval or uncertainty, trickster figures can be mistaken for charismatic leaders, leading to potential political turmoil and destruction.</p>

<title>Cowell as quasi-Svengali</title>
<p>The outsider is thus able to both challenge and legitimize the conventional moral order with a force that emanates from his or her semi-mystical persona. In his TV role, Cowell initially earned fame and notoriety for his forthright judgements not only on the candidates’ performing talent or lack of it, but also for his comments on their moral demeanour – he ‘really likes’ some people for their conventional values of earnestness, hard work or charm, while others are sharply rebuked for their ‘bad attitude’, for being ‘idiotic’ or ‘crazy’, or simply for being ‘annoying’. The authority of Cowell’s pronouncements does not come from a conventional moral stance – he is utterly unlike the archetypal TV show host who renders the dangerously unconventional entertainers acceptable by embodying the most conservative elements of the audience. Examples include the ingratiating Hughie Green, who hosted the prototype talent show format on UK TV, or American TV host Johnny Carson who so memorably sanitized Elvis Presley’s lewd dancing so he could appear on prime time TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593112457738">Guralnick, 1995</xref>). Cowell himself, in contrast, is well known for his contempt for conventional standards of politeness, reserve or sexual morality. He proudly boasts of his fondness for money, partying, strippers and himself. His sardonic TV performances and grandiloquent yet authoritative presence have massively expanded the audience for talent shows beyond ambitious kids and housebound grandparents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457738">Nolan, 2010</xref>). The persona Cowell pioneered melds a plethora of archetypal characters – the enchanter, the outsider – who are traditionally treated as separate mythic entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112457738">Mark and Pearson, 2001</xref>) but are somehow fused into what many deem a Frankensteinian televisual format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112457738">Newkey-Burden, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cowell’s TV persona, then, is a coalescence, a composite, a conflation of primal prototypes. He is not without precedent, though. Indeed, he is often described in terms of his great predecessor, the original ‘alien enchanter’, Svengali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112457738">Pick, 2000</xref>). According to the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>, a Svengali is someone who exercises a controlling or mesmeric influence on another, especially in the music industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457738">Rogan, 1989</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112457738">Purcell (1977</xref>: 75) observes however, ‘chances are that scarcely one in a hundred knows the derivation of the term’. Svengali, in actual fact, was a character in an 1894 novel by George du Maurier (1834–96), the grandfather of Dame Daphne du Maurier. The novel was called <italic>Trilby</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593112457738">du Maurier, 1994</xref>) and it was more than a mere mega-seller; it was a phenomenon on a par with <italic>Harry Potter</italic>, <italic>Avatar</italic> and <italic>X-Factor </italic>combined.</p>
<p>Despite the striking parallels, there are at least two noteworthy differences between the <italic>Trilby</italic> craze and the <italic>X Factor</italic> fad. In the contemporary version, Svengali does not lurk in the background, staring maniacally at his malleable musical marionette. Nowadays, Svengali is the star, rolling his eyes in exaggerated exasperation or with pound signs where his pupils should be. The background has thus become the foreground and the foreground – i.e. the actual on-stage performances – serves as a backdrop for Svengali’s money-making schemes and insatiable self-aggrandizement. The puppet master’s manipulations are there for all to see, in other words, though these manipulations are themselves manipulated into a rococo version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593112457738">MacCannell’s (1999)</xref> ‘staged authenticity’; staged inauthenticity, possibly.</p>
<p>More meaningfully maybe, the contemporary rerun of <italic>Trilby</italic>-mania hasn’t ended in disaster. Not yet anyway. Du Maurier was completely destroyed by the ravening beast he created. Simon Cowell not only thrives on the incessant attention but realizes that it is central to his shows’ continuing success, since column inches equate to showbiz mileage. Du Maurier, moreover, made comparatively little money from the blockbuster he unleashed. Cowell, by contrast, has all his revenue streams perfectly aligned and heading straight for his gargantuan bank account. Svengali, similarly, came a cropper in the original version, as did his euphonious protégé, but Cowell’s TV ratings continue to rise inexorably, for the time being at least. Cowell may be a pantomime villain – the ‘great vampire squid’ of the music business – but villains are the good guys nowadays. Yesterday’s alien enchanter, it seems, is today’s national treasure.</p>
<p>Shaman Cowell has, then, tapped into an inexhaustible public appetite for liminal ritual – and he markets it as an entertainment spectacle. In his iconic role as TV talent show judge, Cowell magisterially orchestrates the liminal rites of passage of countless hapless neophytes. His well rehearsed one-liners carry the sacred authority of the jester, faultlessly expressing the collective need for moral judgements, and he serves as a shamanistic intermediary between the mundane world of dead-end jobs and the sacred space of superstardom. Cowell’s shamanism, admittedly, is essentially outsourced, since the music, costumes, drumming, dancing, ecstatic trances and indeed ‘the journey’ are provided by the contestants and a long line of specialists rather than the choirmaster (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593112457738">Eliade, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457738">Nicholson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593112457738">Stutley, 2003</xref>). But he controls, patrols and provides safe passage across the seemingly impassable space between nonentity and celebrity, between penury and plenty, between karaoke and capitalism. Cowell judges and disciplines the participants but he also oversees their welfare in a paternalistic stance (which, coincidentally, also protects his investment).</p>

<sec id="section12-1470593112457738">
<title>The marketization of existential liminality</title>
<p>Cowell’s role, then, is as a pilot, a priest, a (not so) hidden persuader, a postmodern purveyor par excellence of liminal experiences. Today, contemporary liminal experiences are attracting increasing academic attention. We have noted above several consumer research studies which draw on Turner’s notion of communitas to illuminate ‘extraordinary’ consumer experiences. Additional examples can be found in sociological studies of the role of alcohol brand marketing in the UK’s night time economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457738">Hobbs et al., 2000</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112457738">Hayward and Hobbs, 2007</xref>) and in relation to cultural intermediaries who bestride the production and consumption of Australian wine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593112457738">Smith Maguire, 2010</xref>). Such consumption experiences may contain momentary and fragmented spaces of anti-structure, but, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457738">Tumbat and Belk (2011</xref>) point out, they are by no means oppositional to the market or, necessarily, antithetical to the individualist ethos. Indeed, in this paper, we illustrate through one telling example how existential liminality, rather than communitas, can be seen as a super-ordinate concept linking different forms of consumption through elements that echo the religious, social or calendrical rites of passage which have been largely abandoned in contemporary Western societies in favour of liminoid experiences. In our analysis we have referred back to Turner’s original work to illustrate how different elements of liminal ritual, symbolically combined, might add anthropological resonance to ordinary consumption experiences, rendering them all the more compelling in ways which elude conventional management analysis.</p>
<p>Tapping into the elemental consumer need for existential liminality can entail simply offering consumers an experience of supposedly communitarian anti-structure, as in the ‘extraordinary’ consumption experiences related above, but the off-the-scale success of the <italic>X-Factor</italic> brand hints at what might be achieved if more detailed attention is paid to the many other symbols of liminal ritual. The so-called experience economy is replete with ‘immersion’ activities, where audiences participate in ‘pop-up’ events, such as secret rock concerts, movie premieres in mysterious locations, or impromptu pyjama parties in boutique hotels. The authenticity and unpredictability of such an experience renders them potentially transformational or transgressive, or both. ‘People’, one immersion experience organizer observes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>are fed up with overbranded, commercially driven entertainment. They want something personal and emotionally engaging. We get stressed City workers coming to us. Put them in pyjamas and show them something magical and it takes them on a Peter Pan journey for a while. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112457738">Richards, 2010</xref>: 23)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yet, powerful as these experiences of existential liminality may be, the <italic>X Factor</italic> illustrates how it can be translated into a mediated experience by replicating many other elements of the liminal process. Cowell, as we note, is a far more than a group leader, but an archetypal shaman or trickster, enforcing strict procedures and giving the whole process an air of ritual authority. His UK successor, Gary Barlow, has successfully copied the script. The way the finalists are cosseted away from their previous lives and placed under a strict regime of PR niceness accentuates their status as ‘marginals’. Previous TV talent shows have engineered the reversal of authority over the studio judges by empowering viewers to vote for their favourite act. Cowell’s marketing genius has them paying a hugely inflated fee for the phone call. And they do, in their tens of millions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1470593112457738">
<title>Concluding comment</title>
<p>What we see from <italic>X Factor</italic> is that the communitas aspect is by no means the defining characteristic of existential liminality. Indeed its role in the consumption of ‘extraordinary’ experiences may well have been widely exaggerated. The potential for transformation, on the other hand, has been played down. It is present in the liminal ritual of a graduation ceremony, or a driving test, but can also be seen in its existential form in attendance at a rock concert, on a holiday, or in the consumption and display of a luxury car or other brand marketed as an accessory to a burnished and renewed personal identity. Brands transform experience, and they can be marketed as entities with liminal potential. Transformation, as an existential possibility, is marketed through branded liminoid experiences which can be encountered again and again. <italic>X Factor</italic> is a particularly resonant exemplar of the marketization of existential liminality, but is by no means the only one. In this paper we have suggested that the authority of the trickster brings a dark and compelling dramatic force to the experience of <italic>X Factor.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457738">Turner (1969</xref>) pointed out that there seems to be a deep human need for communitas and liminoid experiences in general. We suggest that further research could deepen the understanding of this anthropological basis of marketing and consumption and widen its scope to other areas of the field.</p>
