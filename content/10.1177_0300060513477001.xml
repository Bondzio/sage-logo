<sec id="sec12-0300060513477001"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>To compare the safety and efficacy of conventional monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and 2-micron continuous-wave laser resection (2-µm laser) techniques in the management of multiple nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), and to investigate long-term effects on tumour recurrence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0300060513477001"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients with multiple NMIBC were randomized to receive TURBT or 2-µm laser in a nonblinded manner. All patients received intravesical chemotherapy with epirubicin (40 mg/40 ml) for 8 weeks, beginning 1 week after surgery, followed with monthly maintenance therapy for 12 months. Three-year follow-up data of preoperative, operative and postoperative management were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0300060513477001"><title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 120 patients were included: 56 in the TURBT group and 64 in the 2-µm laser group. Intra- and postoperative complications (including bladder perforation, bleeding and irritation) were less frequently observed in the 2-µm laser group compared with the TURBT group. There were no significant differences in first time to recurrence, overall recurrence or occurrence of urethral strictures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0300060513477001"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The 2-µm laser resection method was more effective than TURBT in reducing rates of intra- and postoperative complications, but offered no additional benefit regarding tumour recurrence.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0300060513477001" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bladder cancer is the second most common urological malignancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513477001">1</xref></sup> Approximately 70–80% of newly diagnosed bladder cancers are of the nonmuscle-invasive type. Nonmuscle-invasive tumours include papillary tumours confined to the mucosa (pTa), those that have invaded subepithelial connective tissue (pT1), or flat high-grade <italic>in situ</italic> tumours in the mucosa (Tis),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513477001">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513477001"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513477001">4</xref></sup> for which initial treatment has traditionally been transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), followed by adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513477001">5</xref></sup> The goals of TURBT are to remove all visible tumours and obtain enough tissue for histological diagnosis, with minimal morbidity to the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513477001">6</xref></sup> Optimal penetration is, however, difficult to control during surgery; consequently, TURBT is associated with substantial morbidities and complications, such as obturator nerve reflex (ONR), bladder perforation and intraoperative bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513477001">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513477001">8</xref></sup> Khorrami <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513477001">9</xref></sup> used transvesical obturator nerve block to prevent ONR and leg jerking during TURBT, but this approach is not completely effective and it can be difficult to locate the obdurate nerve. The advent of modern laser technology offers an alternative to TURBT in treating nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Various laser types have been used to treat bladder or upper urinary tract urothelial tumours. Holmium yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Ho : YAG) is effective, but a major drawback of this technique is the lack of tissue collection for histological examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513477001">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513477001"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513477001">12</xref></sup> In 2005, the thulium laser (Tm : YAG) was investigated surgically, to see if it improved some of the shortcomings of the Ho : YAG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513477001">13</xref> </sup>Tm : YAG generates a wavelength of 2 µm, which is suitable for resection in an aqueous medium, and provides excellent haemostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513477001">14</xref></sup> Unlike Ho : YAG, Tm : YAG operates in a continuous-wave mode (which evaporates tissue continuously, without generating pressure waves). Thus, clean cuts are achieved by moving the fibre tip across the tissue.</p>
<p>The 2-µm continuous-wave laser has been shown to be efficacious, and to have a favourable safety profile, for the resection of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and in the management of NMIBC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513477001">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513477001"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513477001">17</xref></sup> The present study investigated the possible advantages and long-term effects of 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser treatment over TURBT, in the management of multiple NMIBC.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0300060513477001"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NMIBC, attending the University Department of Urology, The First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, were enrolled in this study between October 2006 and May 2008. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had a papillary tumour at cystoscopy with no extravesical extension, lymphatic metastasis or invasion of adjacent organs apparent by imaging studies. Patients were excluded if they had urothelial papillomas, muscle-invasive bladder tumours, <italic>in situ</italic> carcinomas or upper urinary tract tumours.</p>
<p>A detailed history of all patients was collected and standard physical examinations were performed before surgery. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and cystoscopy with biopsy were performed for diagnosing and staging bladder cancer preoperatively. Tumour location was classified as lateral or other, and the tumour base was defined as pedicles (stalk-like) or sessile (flat). CT urography was performed to exclude upper urinary tract tumours. Histopathological evaluation was conducted in accordance with the 2004 World Health Organization grading system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513477001">18</xref></sup> Tumour stage was classified according to the 2002 tumour–node–metastasis classification system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513477001">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients were randomly assigned, using computer-generated random numbers, to the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser or TURBT group. Randomization was not stratified according to tumour grade, stage, location, sex or age.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and informed written consent was obtained from all patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060513477001"><title>Anaesthetic and surgical procedures</title>
<p>Following randomization to the treatment groups, the same urologist (H.L.) performed either 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser or TURBT on all patients. Patients were placed in a lithotomy position and continuous epidural anaesthesia was administered. Each patient received an anaesthetic maintenance dose of 6–12 mg/kg/h propofol by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion, a maintenance dose of 0.001–0.002 mg/kg fentanyl i.v. and 0.05 mg/kg vecuronium i.v. as a muscle relaxant. All patients received premedication (either 0.1 g phenobarbital intramuscularly [i.m.] or 0.5 mg atropine i.m.), and postoperative pain relief (50 mg tramadol sustained-release tablets twice a day or 100 mg pethidine i.m.) with a re-use interval of 4–6 h.</p>
<p>Tumour resections were performed routinely with a semifilled bladder (containing 200–300 ml irrigation fluid [transurethral irrigation flushing fluid 3000 ml/150 g of 5% mannitol solution; 2-µm laser rinse solution of 3000 ml/27 g of 0.9% sodium chloride]) A 2-µm thulium laser system (LISA laser products OHG, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany), operated in continuous-wave mode, was used to treat patients in the laser group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513477001">20</xref></sup> <italic>En bloc</italic> resection was performed to allow adequate tissue for postoperative pathological examination. The power of the laser was set at 30 W–50 W in advance, which was adjusted during the operation according to the volume of the tumour and the position of the surgical resection (in order to protect healthy tissue). Energy was delivered via a 550-mm end-firing PercuFib fibre (LISA laser products OHG), introduced via a 26-F continuous flow resectoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Saline irrigation was used throughout the procedure in all cases.</p>
<p>Conventional monopolar TURBT was performed using a Wolf 26-F continuous flow resectoscope with loop electrode (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany); cutting and coagulation power were set at 140 W and 100 W, respectively.</p>
<p>Regardless of the technique applied, the bladder mucosa was coagulated 20 mm away from the tumour base. Biopsies were performed intraoperatively and randomly, at a minimum of two positions from the tumour base and the mucosa, 2 cm around the tumour margin. Postoperative pathological examinations were performed to determine tumour stage and grade. All patients were catheterized after surgery, to drain urine from the bladder. The duration of bladder irrigation was based on the duration of postoperative haemorrhage. Bladder irrigation was terminated as early as 30 min postoperatively, if gross haematuria was absent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060513477001"><title>Adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy</title>
<p>Adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy with 40 mg/40 ml epirubicin was administered weekly for 8 weeks, beginning 1 week after the operation, and followed with monthly maintenance therapy for 12 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060513477001"><title>Follow-up</title>
<p>Patients attended postoperative follow-up appointments for 3 years: they were examined using ultrasound, urinary cytology and cystoscopy every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months during the final year. Adverse events were well documented throughout the study. The primary endpoint was tumour recurrence rate. Patients with recurrence were excluded from the study on the date of their last known follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0300060513477001"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS® statistical software package, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows®. Data were presented as mean ± SD or mean and range. Between-group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables and the χ<sup>2</sup>-test for categorical variables. A <italic>P</italic>-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0300060513477001" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 120 patients were randomized to receive 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser (<italic>n</italic> = 64) or conventional monopolar TURBT (<italic>n</italic> = 56). Patient and tumour characteristics before surgery were similar in each group and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300060513477001">Table 1</xref>. All cases had specimens that were sufficient for accurate diagnosis, including tumour staging and grading. Of the 120 patients, 21 had a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential, 87 had low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma and 12 had high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300060513477001">Table 1</xref>). No residual tumour tissue was found &gt;2 cm from the tumour base or the mucosa around the tumour margin. There were 71 cases with Ta stage and 49 cases with T1 stage tumours.

<p>A significantly higher proportion of patients in the TURBT group experienced symptoms of bladder irritation postoperatively, compared with patients in the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300060513477001">Table 2</xref>). The durations of postoperative bladder irrigation, catheterization and hospitalization were all significantly lower in the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group compared with the TURBT group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). There were no significant between-group differences in the occurrence of urethral strictures.</p>
<p>During the 3-year follow-up period, two patients died: one patient, aged 76 years who underwent TURBT, died of cerebral haemorrhage ∼1 year after surgery; oneother patient, aged 75 years and treated with 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser, died of cardiovascular disease within 1 year of surgery. In both cases there was no evidence of tumour recurrence.</p>
<p>There was no significant difference in the cumulative tumour recurrence rate between the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser and TURBT groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513477001">Figure 1</xref>). Twelve months after the initial complete resection of visible tumours, seven patients (10.9%) in the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group and six patients (10.7%) in TURBT group showed tumour recurrence by surveillance cystoscopy. Postoperative follow-up after 12, 24 and 36 months showed recurrence rates of 10.9%, 19.5% and 31.3% in the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group and 10.7%, 22.9% and 33.9% in the TURBT group, respectively.

<p>The present study demonstrated that 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser is associated with significantly fewer intraoperative complications during resection of bladder tumours than TURBT. The main focus for intraoperative complications was on ONR or bladder perforation. As a consequence, classification systems (such as the Clavien classification or National Cancer Institute system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513477001">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513477001">22</xref></sup>) were not applied to grade surgical complications in this study. None of the patients in the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group experienced ONR or bladder perforation, which could be attributed to the precise nature of such resections and the absence of a strong local electric field. In contrast, 10 (17.9%) patients experienced ONR and 5 (8.9%) had bladder perforation in the TURBT group. Higher rates of bladder perforation with TURBT were reported in a study where routine cystograms, performed after TURBT, showed contrast extravasation (asymptomatic perforation) in 21/36 patients (58.3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513477001">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>To improve comparability between the groups and reduce the deviation of the results, all of the operations were carried out by the same surgeon. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with lateral bladder-wall tumours in both groups was the same (37.5%). Using the same surgeon could, however, have introduced personal bias. As such, these findings require further verification from additional randomized, blinded, studies. Lack of blinding could also have introduced bias into the study.</p>
<p>The significant rates of morbidities and complications, such as ONR and bladder perforation, observed with TURBT in the present study are consistent with other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513477001">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513477001">8</xref></sup> In the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser group, however, ONR or bladder perforation were not observed. Although this may have been weakly influenced by bias, the obvious contrast of the two treatment approaches suggested that these observed benefits were related to the laser treatment. Moreover, TURBT requires hands-on training to reduce the likelihood of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513477001">24</xref></sup> Thus, the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser technique could be a promising alternative in the resection of NMIBC, especially for recurrent, heavily treated and posterior lateral wall tumours.</p>
<p>The precise resection of tumours in multiple NMIBC that was demonstrated with the laser technique can be attributed to its dual function of vaporization and resection. This enables <italic>en bloc</italic> resection from the tumour base with no bleeding, while the power of the laser can be adjusted according to the size of tumours. In addition, the laser technique is effective at inducing coagulation in blood vessels and lymphatic ducts around the tumour, thereby reducing the efflux of tumour cells and distant tumour recurrence. In contrast, the control of intraoperative bleeding in TURBT was less effective compared with the 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser technique, because cutting and coagulation were separate procedures in TURBT. The less-invasive nature of 2-µm continuous-wave laser and the reduced bleeding associated with this technique contributed to a faster recovery time, with significantly shorter durations of postoperative bladder irrigation and catheterization being observed for 2-µm continuous-wave laser compared with TURBT.</p>
<p>The standard treatment of NMIBC is transurethral resection followed by adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy, as it is recognized that (other than modification to the surgical technique) intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy will change the course of bladder cancer behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060513477001">25</xref></sup> In the present study, epirubicin was used as the chemotherapy agent in both groups. The 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser treatment was not inferior to TURBT in terms of the tumour recurrence rate, which was comparable with (and slightly better than) that reported in other studies that used epirubicin adjuvant therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300060513477001">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300060513477001">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of patients were able to ambulate after discontinuation of bladder irrigation, but still remained hospitalized while they carried a Foley catheter. It was evident in this study that 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser resection significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization compared with TURBT.</p>
<p>The use of 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser in the resection of NMIBC has been investigated previously, but earlier studies involved small patient numbers and only employed a single treatment arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513477001">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300060513477001">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300060513477001">29</xref></sup> To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to provide a detailed head-to-head comparison between 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser and TURBT.</p>
<p>In summary, 2-µm (thulium) continuous-wave laser was superior to TURBT in terms of reducing the incidence of intraoperative ONR and bladder perforation, and minimizing postoperative bladder irritation, catheterization time and duration of hospital stay. Consequently, the 2-µm continuous-wave laser technique may therefore be an effective alternative to TURBT, with an improved safety profile, in the management of multiple NMIBC. Larger, prospective, multicentre studies need to be performed, to validate findings of the present study.</p>
