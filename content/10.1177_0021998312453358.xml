<p>Carbon fiber reinforced plastic composites are being increasingly used for more applications. The evaluation of hole-drilling in these composites remains a difficult and unsolved problem. The drilling process for multi-material composites is quite different than those for their more conventional metal counterparts. In the research reported here, the drilling ability and durability of drills used for drilling carbon fiber reinforced plastic composites, made with a diamond layer was deposited by chemical vapor deposition are evaluated with different r/min. Spindle speed was fixed reasoning based in abundant previous works. A thermal camera and related techniques were used to evaluate chip removal, temperature measurement inside the hole, associated thermal damage during the drilling operation, in an effort to ascertain optimal drilling conditions. Currently, chemical vapor deposition diamond drills appear to produce better holes at lower r/min.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312453358" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Boeing 7E7 has stimulated a lot of interest and a rapid increase in the use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) parts in the aircraft industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312453358">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312453358">2</xref></sup> A major impediment to the expansion in this usage has been the difficulty in manufacturing complicated parts and structures, which often requires the joining of components or parts. Since mechanical connectors such as bolts and rivets are usually used for joining CFRP parts to other structural elements the development/selection of appropriate tools, as well an understanding and optimization of the drilling process in these composites, is of upmost importance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312453358">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312453358">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an illustration of the importance of the drilling process for aircraft composites, it is noted that typically more than about 55,000 holes are made during the manufacture of a large commercial aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312453358">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312453358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312453358">7</xref></sup> As CFRP composites find more usage, tooling development is important to assure that processes are available to efficiently and effectively produce so many holes. Generally, PCD drills are used for processing CFRP parts in the aerospace industries. However, they are expensive and it is relatively difficult to apply diamond powder coatings on complicated drill patterns. To minimize aircraft manufacturing costs, it would be very useful if new efficient drills and processes could be developed to replace the conventional twist-shaped PCD coated drills with their associated high costs and slow drilling speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312453358">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312453358">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The development of methods for evaluation peel-up cracks during drilling on CFRP composites is at least as important as material selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312453358">10</xref></sup> Reducing the amount of heat produced as well as its removal and dissipation during drilling is more important for CFRP composites than it is for more conventional materials such as metals. Part of the heat generated during drilling may be ejected with the drilling chips, but if there is poor chip removal, chips may accumulate and become compacted in the hole, resulting in additional heat production and a reduction in heat removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312453358">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312453358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312453358">13</xref></sup> Metal materials showed the temperature changes during drilling and the effect of the drilling temperature on the diameter and cylindricity of drilled holes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312453358">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312453358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312453358">16</xref></sup> As a result, drilling operations can produce critical problems in CFRP parts for use in commercial aircraft. Therefore, assessment of the amount of heat generated during heating its removal and its effects on the material’s properties, are extremely important considerations in selection of optimal methods and conditions for manufacturing holes in advanced composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312453358">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this research, the drilling ability of CVD diamond drills was compared to that of the PCD drills commonly used. One measure of drilling ability was the measurement of heat generation during each stage of drilling. Finally, the validity of these thermal evaluation methods was evaluated by correlating them with careful determination of hole size, shape and quality. The results in this article relate almost exclusively to CVD diamond drills but at times we compare this performance to that of more conventional PCD drills. Such comparisons are taken from earlier work in this laboratory, which was described in a prior work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312453358">18</xref></sup></p>

As the number of flutes, <italic>Z</italic>, increases the cut per flute per rotation, <italic>F<sub>t</sub></italic>, decreases. Therefore, according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998312453358">equation (1)</xref>, a drill with 4 flutes might be said to be more productive than a drill with 2 flutes at the same r/min and feed rate. Other important factors effecting drill performance, not directly related to this equation, but nevertheless likely dependent on <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>N</italic> and <italic>F</italic>, are heating and microcracking of the hole walls, and delamination.</p>

It was observed, from the exothermic temperature graph, that changes in the measured temperature were affected by the effectiveness of the drills in discharging chips during the drilling operation.</p>
<p>In empirical <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998312453358">equation (2)</xref>, <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> is an identifying parameter for the degree of chip removal. The extent of good or poor chip removal was evaluated during the drilling process. The effectiveness of chip removal can have a significant affect on hole-quality, since chip removal reduces the micro-scratching and microcracking damage by chips on the hole wall. In empirical <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0021998312453358">equation (3)</xref>, <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> is related to the temperature right after drilling. Around 20° was taken away due to the temperature rise, which is attributed in large part to chips adhering to the drill and rubbing against the wall of the hole.

Negative values of <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic> indicate that the local temperature of the matrix is above its <italic>T<sub>g</sub></italic> and hence thermal damage is likely to occur, while the opposite is true for positive values of <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>.

<p>Hole diameter and the degree of microcracking were measured for estimating the extent of thermal damage during drilling. Hole diameters were accurately measured using bore gages and the extent of damage assessed and compared for the different drilling processes. The holes produced by the different diameters of the CVD diamond drills where also inspected visually and with an optical microscope to look for laminate peel-up as well as the presence and extent of macro- or micro-cracking inside and near the holes.</p>

<p>A list of the drilling conditions of CVD diamond drill with different diameters, based on feed and r/min, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312453358">Table 1</xref>. There were 4 r/min conditions (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312453358">Figure 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312453358">5</xref>) for every drill, and every condition was evaluated and compared to each other. The different CVD diamond drill r/min conditions were performed and compared using the evaluation methods describe previously. Conventional twist-shaped PCD drills had a lower production speed, because the twisted flutes were found to function better at low feed conditions. On the other hand, four flutes CVD diamond drills exhibited better processability at higher r/min, which is attributed to more effective drilling due to their extra cutting surfaces. This resulted in a higher production speed for CFRP composites.

<sec id="sec10-0021998312453358"><title>Drilling ability evaluation by a thermal camera</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312453358">Figure 3</xref> shows results using a thermal camera and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998312453358">equation (2)</xref> for chip temperature, <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic>, as a function of drill diameters. Higher <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> was observed with better chip removal and on the other hand lower values accompanied poor chip removal. Typically PCD drills exhibited lower temperatures than did CVD drills for most drill conditions, but particularly at higher r/min. As the r/min increased, chip removal got worse due to the higher speed of rotation. Optical photographs of chips obtained under different drilling conditions are shown in the upper part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312453358">Figure 3</xref>. It is thought that conglomeration of chips during the drilling process caused the drilling phenomenon shown in this photograph. Apparently, the chips are produced more readily than they are discharged, resulting in a compaction of the chip material in the flutes. This results in an increase in friction and associated heating. This conglomeration of chips likely also cases microcracking inside the drill holes. Better chip removal and higher temperature were observed as drill diameter increased, because the larger diameters required and dispersed more power during drilling. As a conclusion, lower r/min resulted in better chip removal than did higher r/min and chip removal was also influenced by drill diameter.</p>
<p>An evaluation of potential thermal damage as function of drill diameters is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312453358">Figure 4</xref>, based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0021998312453358">equation (4)</xref>. The heat inside a CFRP hole after drilling was determined based on the determined value of <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>. Higher values of <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic> are indicative of better drilling conditions. For the case of the CVD diamond drill less thermal damage was developed inside the hole at lower r/min, while more thermal damages occurred for larger drill diameters because four flutes-CVD diamond drills exhibited a higher frictional resistance at larger diameters. It appears that chip removal is one of the more important parameters affecting thermal damage during drill of advanced composites. Too high of drilling temperatures can, among other things, result in decomposition of the epoxy resin matrix. It appears that optimal drilling conditions must be determined for each drill configuration, including number of flutes, geometry/type of flute, nature of diamond coating, diameter of drill, etc. Some of the relationships between the thermal damage and the drill configuration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312453358">Figure 4</xref>. As received CVD diamond drills had a thin but somewhat non-uniform diamond coating on the drill surface. However, after drilling there appearances were entirely different, as there were signs of extensive damage. The diamond layer exhibited extensive cracking and much of it was removed during the drilling operation. All four flutes of a CVD diamond drill play an important role in cutting a hole during drilling and the tips of each of the flutes exhibited rather extensive damage.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312453358">Figure 5</xref> shows the variation in size of the front and back surfaces of the holes after drilling with different diameter drills. This eccentricity was also influenced by the r/min of drilling, with larger r/min causing greater variations from centric. These size variations were accompanied by different extents of thermal damage, efficiency of chip removal and drill wear. Smaller diameter drills produced less geometric size variations than did larger drills. The extent of thermal decomposition of the epoxy matrix was also closely related to these factors.</p>

<p>The drilling of holes is a key part of the manufacturing processes of CFRP composite material parts. Consequently, improved methods for evaluation of drill design and processing operations should be a valuable tool for improving manufacturing methods. In this study, thermal measurements where used to investigate the effective drilling ability of CVD drills with different diameters. Empirical equations were developed and used to model and analyze thermal damage and chip removal during the drilling process. CVD drills exhibited a better drilling ability at lower r/min, which is attributed to the fact that the four flutes configuration had poorer chip removal and higher frictional resistance at higher r/min. Chip removal was one of the most important parameters related to the drilling ability evaluation and in determining optimal drilling conditions. Observations and measurements of hole-size variation, thermal damage, delamination, cracking, etc. associated with CVD diamond drill processing, indicated that the evaluation described in this article should provide valuable tools to help indentify optimal processing conditions.</p>
