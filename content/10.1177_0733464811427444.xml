<abstract>
<p>Low levels of social activity involvement may have negative implications on overall quality of life for older adults living in residential care settings. Despite the recent growth of assisted living (AL) facilities, few studies have examined social activity participation in this environment. The present study assessed the effects of two prompt procedures that included different amounts of positive social attention (personalized prompts alone and combined with brief conversation) on the social activity attendance of 8 AL residents. Personalized prompts were designed to appeal to each participant on the basis of preference assessments regarding activity interests and preferred types of activity participation. During treatment conditions, increases in attendance occurred not only following treatment prompts but also during activities that were not preceded by treatment prompts. Similar effects were observed for both treatment prompts. Results suggest that personalized prompts and positive social attention can increase weekly social activity attendance in AL residents.</p>

<p>Poor social activity involvement among older adults living in residential care settings represents an area of serious concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811427444">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). Inadequate levels of social activity in this population may lead to declines in verbal and self-care skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464811427444">McClannahan &amp; Risley, 1975</xref>) and has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811427444">Winningham &amp; Pike, 2007</xref>), motor decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464811427444">Buchman et al., 2009</xref>), and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811427444">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, social activity participation in residential care environments has been associated with greater life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464811427444">Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811427444">Park, Zimmerman, Kinslow, Shin, &amp; Roff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811427444">Street, Burge, Quadagno, &amp; Barrett, 2007</xref>), higher health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811427444">Jenkins, Pienta, &amp; Horgas, 2002</xref>), reduced maladaptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811427444">Spira, Koven, &amp; Edelstein, 2004</xref>), and longer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464811427444">Kiely &amp; Flacker, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Involvement in social activities has been defined in numerous ways and includes various interrelated concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464811427444">Levasseur, Richard, Gauvin, &amp; Raymond, 2010</xref>). One important aspect of social activity involvement is social engagement, which has been described as maintaining social connections and participation in social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811427444">Bassuk, Glass, &amp; Berkman, 1999</xref>). Social engagement is related to social interaction, social integration, and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811427444">Park et al., 2010</xref>), which have been shown to have a positive influence on both physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464811427444">Cherry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464811427444">Everard, Lach, Fisher, &amp; Baum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464811427444">Mendes de Leon, Glass, &amp; Berkman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811427444">Tomaka, Thompson, &amp; Palacios, 2006</xref>) and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811427444">Cummings &amp; Cockerham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464811427444">Jang, Mortimer, Haley, &amp; Borenstein Graves, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464811427444">Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811427444">Winningham &amp; Pike, 2007</xref>) in older adults and may reduce the risk of age-related dependency in activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811427444">James, Boyle, Buchman, &amp; Bennett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464811427444">Rubio, Lazaro, &amp; Sanchez-Sanchez, 2009</xref>). As it is mentally stimulating, social engagement may also help to protect against cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811427444">Bassuk et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811427444">Williams &amp; Kemper, 2010</xref>). Although some amount of social engagement appears to be an integral part of social activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464811427444">Levasseur et al. (2010)</xref> contended that an individual’s involvement with others during these activities can be viewed as a continuum from passive to active roles. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464811427444">Maier and Klumb (2005)</xref> concluded that social participation involves “both time spent in social interaction as well as time spent in the presence of others” (p. 31). On the basis of these perspectives, participation during social activities in a residential care facility can include (a) being with others but not directly interacting with them, (b) interacting with others but not doing a specific activity with them, and (c) interacting with others while doing an activity with them.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, the growth of assisted living (AL) facilities has been one of the most significant trends in residential care for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811427444">Cummings &amp; Cockerham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811427444">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811427444">Street et al., 2007</xref>). However, relatively few studies have examined social activity participation in AL settings. In an investigation examining 198 residents of 22 AL facilities, relative to residents with lower levels of activity participation, residents who spent more time participating in activities had a longer mean time to discharge (i.e., length of time between the resident’s evaluation and time of death or transfer to another living environment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464811427444">Tighe et al., 2008</xref>). This study suggests that higher activity involvement in AL residents may help to prevent or delay nursing home placement.</p>
<p>One potential barrier to activity participation in AL settings involves difficulties with social interaction within the facility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811427444">Park et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that social engagement in AL facilities often presents challenges for residents because the social context and environment are unfamiliar and dissimilar to past social networks. Although AL residents may continue to receive social support from interaction with family members and friends living in the community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811427444">Street et al. (2007)</xref> found that positive social interaction with other residents and facility staff was the most consistent indicator of self-reported life satisfaction, stable or improved quality of life, and a sense of feeling at home. These findings indicate that social interaction within the facility becomes more salient to resident well-being relative to interaction with those in the outside community. Therefore, regular involvement in social activities with fellow AL residents may contribute to overall well-being, whereas infrequent involvement in these activities may have negative effects on well-being, such as low perceived social support. Low levels of perceived social support can contribute to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811427444">Cummings &amp; Cockerham, 2004</xref>), which has been found to be significantly more prevalent in AL residents compared with community-dwelling older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464811427444">Grayson, Lubin, &amp; Van Whitlock, 1995</xref>). Although low rates of social activity involvement do not necessarily indicate depression, behavioral symptoms of depressed AL residents commonly include social withdrawal and a reduced likelihood of activity attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811427444">Cummings &amp; Cockerham, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811427444">Tsai et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that depression is the strongest risk factor for low levels of social engagement not only during the adjustment period for new AL residents but also for residents who have already become accustomed to their living environment. Thus, it is important to develop and use interventions to increase social activity involvement within the facility among both newly admitted and established AL residents. Even for residents who do not interact with others or actively participate during social activities (e.g., playing a board game), simply spending time in a social context (i.e., being in the presence of others) may have positive effects on overall health and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464811427444">Maier &amp; Klumb, 2005</xref>). Considering the potential benefits of being around others and having the opportunity to engage in social interaction, increasing attendance during social activities is an important goal in promoting social activity involvement in AL settings.</p>
<p>Previous behavioral interventions to increase activity attendance and/or participation in residential care settings have included providing contingent access to preferred edibles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811427444">Spira et al., 2004</xref>), stimulus control procedures involving the provision of refreshments at activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464811427444">Blackman, Howe, &amp; Pinkston, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811427444">Carstensen &amp; Erickson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464811427444">Quattrochi-Tubin &amp; Jason, 1980</xref>), prompts and contingent praise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464811427444">Engelman, Altus, &amp; Mathews, 1999</xref>), and prompts alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske, Rudrud, Schulze, &amp; Rapp, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske et al. (2008)</xref> found that descriptive prompts (i.e., a description of available activities known to be of interest to the resident) increased both time spent in an activity area and unstructured activity engagement in nursing care residents with dementia. Such prompts may be ineffective for organized group social activities because, unlike informal activity engagement, they may infrequently involve specific activities of interest to each resident (e.g., jigsaw puzzles). However, positive social attention combined with similar prompts may be effective in increasing social activity attendance, as positive staff interaction has been associated with higher levels of resident activity involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464811427444">Dobbs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811427444">Meeks &amp; Looney, 2011</xref>). The purpose of the present study was to extend the current literature on the use of antecedent interventions to increase activity involvement in older adults living in residential care settings. The comparative effects of two prompt procedures that included different amounts of positive social attention (personalized prompts alone and combined with brief conversation) were assessed on the weekly social activity attendance of older adults living in an AL facility. It was hypothesized that personalized prompts designed to appeal to each participant based on his or her activity preferences would increase social activity attendance by evoking behavioral responses necessary for activity participation (e.g., attending the activity). It was further hypothesized that brief conversation would evoke behavioral responses associated with engagement in social interaction (e.g., attending a social activity), which may result in greater increases in social activity attendance relative to personalized prompts delivered alone.</p>

<sec id="section2-0733464811427444">
<title>Participants, Setting, and Materials</title>
<p>Participants were 8 AL residents (6 women and 2 men) ranging from 78 to 90 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 84.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.63). At the time of baseline data collection, three residents were newly admitted to the facility and five participants had lived at the facility for 1.25 to 4.33 years (<italic>M</italic> = 2.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17). Five participants ambulated using a walker and 3 participants ambulated independently. According to facility records, three participants suffered from dementia at the time of the study. Due to frailty and/or occasional confusion, physical assistance to the activity area was required for these participants. All participants were capable of verbally expressing their preference to attend or not to attend an activity.</p>
<p>The intervention took place at a 66-unit suburban AL facility that served residents with and without dementia. Residents with dementia were located on a floor that provided a higher level of staff assistance with activities of daily living. Each resident lived in a private unit that consisted of a bedroom, a living room, and a small kitchen.</p>
<p>The first author was placed at the facility during a supervised practicum and was asked by activity staff to assist in increasing resident attendance at social activities. Activity staff identified eight residents who generally displayed low rates of social activity attendance and who were reported by nursing staff to spend the majority of the day alone in their units. In addition, activity staff reported that previous attempts to increase social activity attendance in these residents using nonpersonalized individual prompts (e.g., “Would you like to play bingo today?”) had not been effective. Therefore, participant selection was based on pragmatic concerns of the facility.</p>
<p>Prior to intervention, the first author (who was also the experimenter) conducted an individual interview with each of the eight residents to determine their activity interests and preferred types of activity participation (i.e., playing games, watching/listening to others, and visiting/being around others). Activity interest questions were taken directly from an activity preference assessment used by the facility and required residents to state whether or not they enjoyed a given activity (e.g., bingo). Inclusion criteria required that, during this interview, residents (a) were able to clearly indicate their likes and dislikes and (b) stated that they enjoyed watching/listening to others and/or visiting/being around others during social activities. The latter requirement was included to ensure that participants were receptive to being in the presence of others in the facility. None of the original eight residents were excluded from participation based on these criteria.</p>
<p>Social activities were defined as organized group activities that took place at the facility during which residents had the opportunity to (a) engage in active or passive activity participation and (b) spend time in the presence of other residents and facility staff. Active participation refers to direct involvement with the planned social activity (e.g., playing bingo or calling out responses during a trivia game). Passive participation refers to indirect involvement with the planned social activity (e.g., watching others play a game or listening to others tell stories). A few activities allowed for passive participation only (e.g., music recitals or movies). Although the nature of some activities necessitated social interaction more than others (e.g., playing a card game requires social interaction, whereas attending a music recital does not), all social activities involved the opportunity to spend time in the presence of others and engage in social interaction. Common activities included arts and crafts, bingo, board games, card games, music recitals, and parties. Activities were generally offered throughout the week during the following times: 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.; 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.; and 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The number of available weekly social activities during data collection ranged from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>In addition to the experimenter interview, activity preference assessments previously completed by activity staff were used as a reference for each participant’s activity preferences. These assessments were routinely used by the facility to determine each resident’s activity interests (e.g., playing games, listening to music, animal visits, etc.). Activity interests and participation preferences for each participant were recorded on a data sheet that was used as a reference for the delivery of personalized prompts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464811427444">appendix</xref>). Activity attendance data were regularly recorded and stored by activity staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0733464811427444">
<title>Target Behavior and Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>Activity attendance was defined as the participant’s physical presence in the designated activity area at the designated activity time. For each participant, the percentage of weekly social activity attendance was determined by dividing the number of activities attended each week by the number of available activities for that week. In addition, the percentage of weekly social activities attended following treatment prompts was determined along with the percentage of weekly social activities attended following general prompts (i.e., group prompts at mealtimes, daily activity schedule postings in the dining areas, and activity calendars in each resident’s unit). For Participants 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, interobserver agreement between attendance data collected by the experimenter and facility attendance records was collected for 20% of activities during baseline, 36.63% of activities during the first treatment condition, and 33.70% of activities during the second treatment condition. For Participant 3, interobserver agreement was collected for 30% of activities during baseline, 38.75% of activities during the first treatment condition, and 35.62% of activities during the second treatment condition. For Participant 4, interobserver agreement was collected for 18.63% of baseline activities, 36.63% of activities during the first treatment condition, and 47.37% of activities during the second treatment condition. For Participant 8, interobserver agreement was collected for 18.31% of baseline activities, 36.63% of activities during the first treatment condition, and 29.35% of activities during the second treatment condition. Interobserver agreement was not assessed for follow-up data. Agreement was determined by dividing the number of agreements by the total number of possible agreements and multiplying that number by 100. For all participants, agreement was 100% during baseline and both treatment conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0733464811427444">
<title>Experimental Design and Procedure</title>
<p>A counterbalanced within-subjects design was used to evaluate the comparative effects of two prompt procedures (personalized prompts alone and combined with brief conversation) relative to baseline social activity attendance. Eight weeks of baseline data were collected for the 5 participants who were established residents (Participants 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7). For participants who were newly admitted to the facility, 3, 5, and 7 weeks of baseline data were collected (Participants 3, 4, and 8, respectively). Following baseline, 4 to 5 weeks of personalized prompts followed by 4 to 5 weeks of personalized prompts combined with brief conversation were planned for Participants 1 to 4. For Participants 5 through 8, the same procedure was followed with the reverse prompt condition sequence. Due to an injury, only 1 week of data collection was available for Participant 4 during the second treatment condition. Following treatment conditions, 4 to 5 weeks of follow-up data were collected for all participants except Participants 4 and 7, who suffered complications from injuries and were thus unable to attend activities.</p>
<p>The baseline condition represented typical facility efforts to increase activity attendance. During baseline, only general prompts were used. General prompts consisted of a group announcement delivered by activity staff during mealtimes, which informed residents of the time and location of activities following each mealtime (e.g., “We are playing cards today at 1:30 p.m. on the second floor.”). For the 3 participants who had dementia and who required physical assistance to move from one area of the facility to another (Participants 2, 3, and 8), nonpersonalized individual prompts (e.g., “Would you like to go play cards?”) were also delivered by staff, although this was not done in a systematic manner (i.e., prompts may not have been given for all available activities, and the frequency of prompt delivery was not recorded). In addition, social activities, times, and locations were displayed on a sign placed near the dining areas on each floor that was updated daily. Staff also placed current monthly activity calendars in a salient location (e.g., on the refrigerator) in each resident’s unit that included the day, time, and location of all available social activities.</p>
<p>During treatment conditions, individual treatment prompts (i.e., personalized prompts alone or combined with brief conversation) were delivered to each participant by the experimenter for three to four activities each week. Although four treatment prompts were planned for each participant, this range was used because circumstances did not always allow for the delivery of prompts as planned (e.g., if a participant was sleeping, at a doctor’s appointment, or visiting with family). In both treatment conditions, staff continued general prompting procedures as described during baseline; thus, both general prompts and treatment prompts were delivered during treatment conditions. No more than two treatment prompts were provided in one day. The nature of the prompted activities depended on the activity schedule and varied each week. Treatment prompts were delivered face-to-face between 20 and 30 min prior to the time that the activity was scheduled to begin. The experimenter either knocked on the door of the participant’s unit and waited for permission to enter or directly approached the participant if he or she was in a common area. In addition to positive verbal attention, smiles and eye contact were included during the delivery of treatment prompts. If a participant was sleeping, he or she was not awakened for prompt delivery. Assistance to the activity area was provided for the 3 participants who required it.</p>
<sec id="section5-0733464811427444">
<title>Personalized prompts</title>
<p>During this treatment condition, personalized prompts were similar to the descriptive prompts used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske et al. (2008)</xref>, which specifically described activities that were known to be of interest to participants based on either responses given during a preference questionnaire or previous observations of activity engagement. Personalized prompts consisted of a brief greeting that used the participant’s name along with a description of the social activity in a manner that was designed to appeal to the participant based on his or her responses on an activity preference assessment used by the facility and answers to the experimenter’s questions regarding types of preferred activity participation (e.g., “Hi Martha, I just wanted to stop by and remind you that we have arts and crafts today. We are making flower arrangements.”). If the prompted activity was not indicated as an interest on the assessment (e.g., crafts, playing board games), the prompt included an option for passive participation in a manner that was previously indicated as preferred by the participant (e.g., “Hi John, I wanted to let you know that we will be playing a board game today. You can play or you can just come and watch.” or “Hi Otto, we are working on some crafts today. You can work with us or just come and visit with us.”). If the participant said that he or she will attend the activity, the experimenter made a positive statement regarding activity attendance and stated the time and location of the activity (e.g., “Great! The activity will be at 1:30 p.m. on the second floor. I’ll look forward to seeing you there!”). Similarly, if the participant did not indicate whether he or she will attend, the experimenter made a positive statement about attendance and stated the time and location of the activity (e.g., “Hope to see you there! We will be on the second floor and will start at 1:30 p.m.”). If the participant said that he or she did not want to attend the activity, the experimenter made a positive statement that included the time and location of the activity (e.g., “That’s OK. We will start at 1:30 p.m. and we’ll be on the second floor if you change your mind!”). If the participant asked the experimenter if she could talk for a few minutes, the experimenter replied that she is not able to stay and talk right now because she needs to help with activity setup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0733464811427444">
<title>Personalized prompts + brief conversation</title>
<p>In addition to personalized prompts, brief conversation was initiated with each participant during this treatment condition. The entire interaction (i.e., personalized prompt and conversation) lasted no more than 1 min. To ensure that the interaction did not exceed 1 min, the experimenter used a stopwatch on her cell phone, which was placed discretely on top of a clipboard. In order for the conversation to be natural and sincere, it was not scripted. However, this additional interaction included several consistent elements. First, the participant was given a greeting that used his or her name and was asked how he or she was doing (e.g., “Hi Jennie! How is your day going today?”). Second, the experimenter made at least one positive statement about the participant (e.g., “It’s great to see you!” or “I love your sweater! That color looks great on you!”). Third, if the participant verbally indicated that he or she will attend the activity, the experimenter made at least one additional positive statement about attendance (e.g., “I’m so glad you are coming! It will be great to get out a little bit and see what’s going on!”). The experimenter also made at least one additional positive statement about attendance if the participant did not indicate whether he or she will attend (e.g., “It’s going to be a lot of fun today! I hope you’ll come and join us!”). Similarly, if the participant indicated that he or she will not be attending the activity, the experimenter made at least one additional positive statement regarding attendance (e.g., “Are you sure? You might enjoy getting out for a bit!”). To end the interaction, the experimenter told the participant that she has to go and help set up the activity, but she hopes to see him or her at the activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results indicate that personalized prompts and positive social attention can increase social activity attendance in AL residents. One or both treatment conditions were associated with increases in mean overall social activity attendance for 7 out of 8 participants. Compared with baseline, data for the sample of participants revealed significant increases in overall attendance during both treatment conditions. In addition to positive social attention, personalized prompts included a description of the activity in a manner that was designed to appeal to each participant based on his or her responses on an activity preference assessment and answers to the experimenter’s questions regarding preferred types of activity participation. Thus, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske et al. (2008)</xref>, prompts may have evoked behavior (i.e., attending the activity) that resulted in contact with sources of natural reinforcement derived through activity participation, social engagement, or both. The latter possibility may explain increases in attendance following general prompts during both treatment conditions that were observed in 5 out of 8 participants. For these participants, increased levels of attendance may have been maintained by reinforcement associated with previous activity attendance. Additional support for this explanation is suggested by follow-up data. Of the 6 participants for whom follow-up data were available, 4 participants displayed higher mean overall activity attendance at follow-up compared with baseline. However, a downward trend in follow-up data for Participant 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0733464811427444">Figure 1</xref>) and lower levels of attendance at follow-up relative to baseline for Participants 2 and 8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0733464811427444">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0733464811427444">8</xref>) suggest that, for some residents, the continuation of prompting procedures may be required for long-term maintenance of increased levels of attendance.</p>
<p>Although both treatment prompts were effective at increasing social activity attendance for most participants, the results suggest that the brief conversation during the PP + BC condition provided no additional benefit. It was hypothesized that brief conversation would evoke behavioral responses associated with engagement in social interaction (e.g., attending a social activity) and personalized prompts would evoke activity participation, but the support for this hypothesis was not definitive. Depending on the individual, the motivation to engage in social interaction or the motivation to participate in the current activity for nonsocial reasons could have resulted in increased social activity attendance. Although this investigation did not assess motivations for participant activity attendance, similar effects were associated with both treatment conditions, suggesting that the differences between the two treatment prompts were not substantial enough to yield differential results. Specifically, the positive social attention included during brief conversation in the PP + BC condition did not provide benefit beyond the positive social attention included in the PP condition.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that a relatively simple prompting procedure that uses preference assessment information can increase weekly social activity attendance in older adults living in an AL setting. For most participants, the systematic delivery of personalized prompts preceding just three to four activities a week was associated with increases in attendance following both treatment prompts and general prompts. Attendance data collection and preference assessment involved procedures that were currently in use by the facility. Therefore, this intervention would be feasible for activity staff to implement and may provide an effective way to use such information to better reach out to residents who may be at risk of inactivity and social isolation. In addition to activity interest information obtained from facility preference assessments, the experimenter determined activity participation preferences by directly asking participants about the types of activity participation that they enjoyed. Social activities may infrequently involve specific resident activity interests. However, preferred types of social activity participation (e.g., playing games or watching/listening to others) can be applied to nearly all organized group activities. Thus, the assessment of activity participation preferences may be particularly useful for facility efforts to increase attendance during social activities. As no added benefit was determined from the use of brief conversation, personalized prompts alone may be sufficient in increasing social activity attendance in this population.</p>
<p>The present study supports the efficacy of behavioral procedures in increasing the activity involvement of older adults living in residential care facilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464811427444">Blackman et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811427444">Carstensen &amp; Erickson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811427444">Spira et al., 2004</xref>). Previous applications of antecedent interventions involved prompts to increase engagement in daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464811427444">Engelman et al., 1999</xref>) and descriptive prompts to increase both presence in an activity area and participation during unstructured recreational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to the descriptive prompts used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811427444">Brenske et al. (2008)</xref>, personalized prompts included a description of activity participation in a manner that was designed to appeal to each participant based on prior assessments of activity preferences. This investigation extends past research by demonstrating that personalized prompts and positive social attention were associated with increased attendance during group social activities in AL residents. These findings indicate that positive social attention may be related to increased activity involvement in older adults living in residential care settings as has been suggested by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464811427444">Dobbs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811427444">Meeks &amp; Looney, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Practical implications may be somewhat limited due to the small sample size, which had low statistical power. However, a small number of participants permitted the examination of individual behavior change across conditions; thus, the within-subjects design allowed for the observation and comparison of intervention effects on an individual level. Although greater reliability would have been established with an ABAB design that ended with a reinstatement of the intervention (B) as opposed to ending on a return to baseline (A), the ABA design used in this study allowed for a strong demonstration that the intervention was responsible for increases in attendance. The replication of this design across participants strengthened these conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811427444">Barlow, Nock, &amp; Hersen, 2009</xref>, p. 145) and provides support for the generalizability of these findings. Baselines of varying lengths in the newly admitted residents provided additional evidence that increases in attendance occurred when the intervention was introduced. As general prompting procedures were held constant throughout data collection, and because it is unlikely that any uncontrolled variables would have resulted in increased attendance during treatment conditions in 7 out of 8 participants, it can be inferred with a reasonable amount of confidence that the intervention was responsible for the observed increases in attendance.</p>
<p>Although the intervention was successful in increasing social activity attendance, outcome measures of increased attendance were not assessed. Consequently, it is not known whether this intervention had any effect on participation or social interaction during activities or whether it contributed to improvements in resident quality of life. In addition, types of participation during social activities (e.g., being around others without engaging in social interaction, interacting with others without engaging in the activity, and interacting with others while engaging in the activity) were not examined. Therefore, the effects of personalized prompts and positive social attention on levels of active and passive activity participation are not known. Despite these limitations, this study provides evidence that this intervention can increase social activity attendance in AL residents who typically spend the majority of the day alone, thus increasing time spent in the presence of others and increasing opportunities for social interaction with other residents and facility staff. Moreover, because attendance is an essential prerequisite to participation during social activities in AL settings, the investigation of interventions to increase attendance is an appropriate and needed area of research. To examine the potential benefits of increased social activity attendance in AL residents, it is necessary to develop interventions that are successful in increasing attendance.</p>
<p>Future replications of this intervention could focus on the examination of its efficacy with AL residents who have specific characteristics (e.g., gender, physical or psychological health diagnoses, length of residency). Studies could also compare residents with differing characteristics (e.g., male and female residents, newly admitted and established residents, residents with and without physical disabilities) to determine potential differential treatment results. The effects of increased social activity attendance in AL residents on both subjective and objective outcome measures would be another interesting area of investigation. Pre- and postintervention subjective measures (e.g., perceived social support, depressive symptoms, overall life satisfaction) could be assessed to determine if increased social activity attendance is associated with changes in these measures. Likewise, objective measures collected by observers could be examined to determine if increased social activity attendance results in corresponding increases in measures of participation during social activities (e.g., social interaction, active activity participation). In addition, the effects of different types of social activity participation (e.g., active and passive participation) on various resident outcome measures could be investigated. Participants could also be observed outside of social activities to determine if increased attendance is associated with increases in social interaction and time spent in the presence of others in different settings (e.g., social interaction during mealtimes, time spent in common areas of the facility).</p>
<p>Considering the potential deleterious consequences of poor social activity involvement on resident health and well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811427444">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811427444">Winningham &amp; Pike, 2007</xref>) along with the challenges of social integration that face many AL residents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811427444">Park et al., 2010</xref>), additional research is needed to determine efficacious ways to engage AL residents who may be at risk of social isolation. Social activity participation offers many benefits to older adults living in residential care settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811427444">Jenkins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464811427444">Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811427444">Street et al., 2007</xref>) and may contribute to a higher overall quality of life. As demonstrated by the present investigation, personalized prompts that use preference assessment information and include positive social attention can increase weekly social activity attendance in AL residents. The results of this study suggest that a simple antecedent intervention may offer an effective means for staff to increase social activity involvement in AL settings.</p>
