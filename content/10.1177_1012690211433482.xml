<abstract>
<p>Every four years the Summer Olympic Games fires the imagination of the largest and most diverse sport spectatorship and entices them in their hundreds of thousands to some of the First World’s most iconic and crowded cities. In addition, the ideological symbolism associated with the Olympic Games is rooted in Western, liberal democratic values and traditions. For those who do not share these ideals the Olympics represent something to stand against and, in extremity, disrupt and violate. In short, in a post-9/11 world, the Olympics provide a mouth-watering target for terrorists. Using themes of surveillance drawn form from Bentham and Foucault, this article analyses the nature of the terrorist threat and scale of the security operation designed to ensure the safety of the London 2012 Olympic Games. It concludes by considering the consequences of these measures on the city of London, particularly in terms of the civil liberties of its citizenry.</p>

<p>The Olympic Games stands alone as the world’s greatest sporting spectacle. While in terms of spectatorship, both live and virtual, it may be outgunned by its nearest rival, the Football World Cup, as a sporting spectacle it is peerless. Football World Cups are awarded to nations whereas the Olympics are hosted by cities. The Games bring together the widest range of sports in (more or less) a central location and, unlike Football World Cups, the Olympics capture the attention and fires the imagination of the largest and most diverse world spectatorship. Moreover, largely of its own making, the Olympics are rich in symbolism, rooted in largely Western liberal democratic tradition and susceptible to manipulation by nationalist political ideologies. The Olympics are supposed to ‘stand for something’ and as such they present something to stand against. Olympic events are therefore targeted by a range of individuals and groups as sites for non-violent political protest and, the primary focus of this article, domestic and international terrorism.</p>

<title>The Olympic Games and the superpanoptican</title>
<p>Central to and underpinning the narrative that follows are the concepts of surveillance, social control and the superpanapticon. As elaborated upon later in this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211433482">Minas Samatas (2007)</xref> argues that because of the Olympic Games in 2004, Athens was turned into a ‘panoptic urban fortress’ arguing that at the centre of the intense monitoring Athens was a highly complex and web-like, interconnected network of electronic surveillance gadgetry and attendant software – what he refers to as the ‘superpanoptican’. This conceptualization draws upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433482">Michael Foucault (1977)</xref> who himself raided 18th-century political philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211433482">Jeremy Bentham’s (1995)</xref> innovative prison design, the Panopticon – the all-seeing place (derived from the Greek word <italic>pan</italic>, all, and <italic>optos</italic>, visible) – to develop a metaphor for the saturating and omnipotent nature of state-sponsored surveillance and social control in (post) modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211433482">Andrews, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Bentham’s Panopticon was to be structured in such a way that, like a spider in the centre of its web, a single guard could watch over many prisoners kept in transparent cells arranged concentrically around the observation post so that the guard could see the prisoners but they could not see him. The genius of Bentham’s idea lay in the fact that even if the post was empty the design would lead the prisoners to assume that they were being watched all of the time and this would cause them to moderate their behaviour, effectively becoming self-policing. Foucault takes Bentham’s ideas several stages further arguing that in modernity in the service of social control the state adopts the role of the all-seeing observation post, probing and monitoring the activities of all its citizens. Just as in Bentham’s prison, it is not the surveillance itself that is important, but ‘the drive to self-monitoring through the belief that one is under constant scrutiny’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211433482">Wood, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211433482">1</xref></sup> While Bentham’s prison design was never approved by the British government, as John Rennie points out, the spirit of the Panoptican lives on, saying, ‘once upon a time an ethicist had a brilliant idea for a prison. Today we live in it.’ It is in Bentham’s native city of London, which in the first decades of the 21st century had more public and private CCTV cameras that any other city in the world, that the concept of total surveillance comes closest to being realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211433482">Rennie, 2008</xref>: 4). The presence of the Olympics there in 2012 can only accelerate this process of totalitarian intrusiveness. This has not happened overnight, rather it has an evolutionary history and it is to this story that we now turn.</p>

<title>The Olympics, politics and terrorism: Mexico and Munich</title>
<p>While the link between politics and the modern Olympics is as old as the Games themselves, the overt targeting of the event as a means for grandstanding extrinsic, politically related ends is relatively recent and begins in Mexico in 1968. In this context Mexico ’68 is mostly remembered, not just for Bob Beaman’s astonishing world record long-jump leap, but also because of African American sprinters John Carlos and Tommy Smith’s ‘black power’ podium demonstration at the medal ceremony after the final of the 200 meters. At home, African American track and field athletes had been radicalized by decades of unfair treatment in domestic competitions and, in an era when sport mega-events were beginning to get significant media exposure, this was a relatively benign and opportunistic way of advertising their grievance to a huge global audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211433482">Witherspoon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Less well remembered is that in the build up to the 1968 Olympic Games thousands of students took to the streets in Mexico City to protest against President Diaz Ordaz’s totalitarian government’s social and economic policies and what they perceived as the waste of resources that were being lavished on the Olympics. Matters came to a head on 2 October when, barely a week before the Games started, hundreds of student protesters were gunned down in cold blood by Mexican security forces in Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlateloloco district of Mexico City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211433482">Witherspoon, 2008</xref>). The Mexican government’s heavy-handed response was encouraged by the USA, which at this point in its history saw a communist plot behind every popular movement for reform in Latin America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211433482">2</xref></sup> This represents a clear example of the identification of and suppression of potential disruption motivated by domestic political dissent but amplified by wider geo-politics.The world watched and did nothing. Shamefully, the myopic Olympic mandarins also did nothing, just as they would four years later when Israeli athletes were massacred in Munich.</p>
<p>If there were ever any doubts that sports mega-events could provide a stage for ruthless political exploitation, the hostage-taking and eventual killing of Israeli athletes and officials at the 1972 Munich Olympics removed them. On 5 September 1972, 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were seized in the Athletes’ Village and held hostage by members of Black September, believed to be a militant faction of the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization), the armed wing of the political movement Fatah, led by Yasser Arafat. The German authorities hatched a plot to lure the hostage-takers and their captives away from the Athletes’ Village to a nearby military airfield on the pretext that they were being flown to a destination of their choice. Once at the airfield armed German Police attempted but failed to free the hostages who were all killed in the ensuing mêlée along with all but three of the kidnap gang. In the search for retribution, this tragedy led to one of the biggest espionage and counterterrorism operations ever mounted by Mossad (Israel’s clandestine security service) as it systematically hunted down and killed all who had been associated with the planning and execution of the Munich debacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211433482">Jonas, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In return for the release of the hostages Black September demanded freedom for hundreds of PLO prisoners from Israeli jails, as well as the release of the joint leaders of the German-based Baader-Meinhof anti-capitalist urban terrorist organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433482">Johnson, 2008</xref>). Although it is yet to be proven, this implied that Black September had received assistance from the Baader-Meinhof gang. This connection alone offered the first evidence that under certain circumstances domestic and international political issues could come together to threaten the security of the Olympics.</p>

<title>Black Tuesday: The impact of 11 September 2001 on security at sporting mega-events</title>
<p>The events of 5 September 1972 in Munich made all concerned aware that the Olympics were now on the radar of international terrorist organizations. This was the inspiration behind the 1977 film <italic>Black Sunday</italic> in which a deranged Vietnam veteran teams up with rogue Palestinian terrorists and attempts to crash an airship full of high explosives into a packed stadium staging America’s biggest single sporting event, the Super Bowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211433482">Frankenheimer, 1977</xref>). Despite what had happened in Munich, for most <italic>Black Sunday</italic> was a piece of forgettable Hollywood fantasy. The events of Tuesday 11 September 2001, when Al Qaeda terrorists hijacked a number of fully-fuelled passenger airlines, two of which were flown deliberately into the upper floors of New York City’s Twin Towers, bringing them crashing down, killing and seriously wounding thousands, made the <italic>Black Sunday</italic> plot appear less far-fetched. One can speculate that the World Trade Centre was chosen by Al Qaeda not only because they were packed with people and but also because they were widely recognized, iconic symbols of US global commercial domination. Likewise sporting mega events, like the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup, not only offer large concentrations of people but are also highly symbolic of national prestige and power.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211433482">Mathew Brzezinski (2004)</xref> argues that post-9/11 the United States of America has become a real and virtual fortress wherein the security reach of the state is extensive and all-pervasive. In the immediate aftermath of the attack on the Twin Towers major sporting events hosted in the USA – the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City – were subject to security conditions that would not have been out of place if <italic>Black Sunday</italic> had been based on a real turn of events. This has become the norm in subsequent years. The 2006 Super Bowl in Detroit offers a particular example of ‘supersize security’ involving one of the largest security operations in US history:
<disp-quote>
<p>Inside the ring of steel, fans were screened by metal and radiation detectors; special security forces and bomb disposal teams were on standby; computer linked high resolution CCTV was utilized along with real-time satellite imagery to allow instant response; and the area was guarded by 10,000 police and private security guards. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211433482">Coaffee and Murakami Wood, 2006</xref>: 513)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Outside of totalitarian and heavily militarized regimes, in the West surveillance and security around sporting events on this scale was virtually unthinkable before 9/11. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211433482">Henry Giroux (2008)</xref> has argued that accelerated by the events of 9/11, the United States is rapidly evolving into a society wherein the ethic of militarization dominates at the expense of a liberal tradition of civic freedoms. Militarization implies a condition whereby a nation is either at war or preparing for war and all possible resources – social, economic, political – are mobilized to reflect this condition. The war in question is not the particular on-the-ground engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the more nebulous and all-encompassing conflict between Western and Oriental values and ideologies controversially articulated by Samuel Huntington as a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211433482"><italic>Clash of Civilizations</italic> (1996)</xref> and operationalized by former US President George W. Bush as a ‘war on terror’: a war to be waged both abroad and at home.</p>
<p>Supersize security is complemented by the incorporation of militarized display, memoir and metaphor in the packaging of mega sports events, particularly in the USA. Typically, shortly before a game or event commences, police and army surveillance helicopters temporarily vacate the airspace to make way for a low-level fly past by US Air Force fighter squadrons, while on the field itself, to the accompaniment of the marching bands, the pre-match show features tributes to service men and women fighting and dying overseas – by now an institutionalized feature of big-time American sports military pageantry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211433482">King, 2008</xref>) and increasingly evident in the public presentation of major sports in the UK. This was put into bold relief on 13 November 2011, when a friendly international football (soccer) fixture between England and Spain happened to take place between Thursday’s Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday. Wembley Stadium was festooned with patriotic and militaristic symbolism. Nothing was more prominent than the bright red poppy, ubiquitous throughout the stadium, including on the arms of all of the England players.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690211433482">3</xref></sup> Before kick-off, as the military band played on, the presentation party who greeted the players and officials was made of the Chiefs of Staff of the four services that represent the British armed forces (Royal Navy; Army; Royal Air Force; and the Royal Marines). With displays such as this, the attractiveness of Westernized sports events for terrorists is enhanced by the fact that not only do they generate large crowds, but often they also venerate and valorize the very conflicts which the terrorists stand against and use to justify their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211433482">Silk and Falcous, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Munich ’72 there have been no overtly geo-politically motivated attacks on the Olympic Games. There have been isolated incidents involving rogue individuals, some of which might be classified as domestically generated acts of terrorism. The most serious of these was the pipe bomb blast in the Olympic Park during the Centennial Games in Atlanta 1996, attributed to Eric Robert Rudolph. Rudolph was found to have neo-Nazi leanings but no links with any global terror organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433482">Johnson, 2008</xref>). If it was needed, this was a wake-up call for future Olympic hosts and despite the relative lack of terrorist involvement in the Games since Munich, international terrorism remains the number one concern for host cities. The events of 11 September 2001 turned that concern into nothing short of a moral panic, providing successive host cities and their respective governments with the licence to do almost anything in the name of counter-terrorism, including spying on their own citizens.</p>

<title>The scale and cost of Olympic Security post-9/11</title>
<p>‘The Games must go on’, famously asserted then IOC President Avery Brundage, after the debacle in Munich, but at what cost? The analysis by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211433482"><italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> (2004)</xref> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211433482">Figure 1</xref> starkly illustrates the impact of 9/11 on security budgets for the summer Olympic Games.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1012690211433482-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>In Los Angeles in 1984 when 6829 athletes took part and 5,720,000 tickets sold, the average security cost was US$11,627 per athlete or $US14 per ticket. Two decades later in Athens where there were an estimated 10,500 participants, the average cost was US$142,857 per athlete or $US283 per ticket. Taking account of the increased number of participants this still represents an almost ten-fold increase in security costs in only 20 years. It can be seen clearly from the above graph that there is an extremely sharp increase from Sydney 2000 to Athens 2004 when post-9/11 the security budget leaps a staggering 800 percent. These figures do not account for the £93 million spent by the IOC which for the first time took out an insurance policy against the risk of the Games being cancelled because of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, flooding and landslides, and unnatural ones, namely international terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433482">Johnson, 2008</xref>). The threat of the former had not changed since the onset of the modern Olympics whereas the latter had loomed more and more ominously.</p>

<title>Athens 2004</title>
<p>What can be bought for US$ 1.5 billion? To answer this, it is illustrative to consider the full details of the actual hardware and software deployed in and around Athens in the summer of 2004:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hundreds of CCTV cameras swept the main avenues and squares of Athens, three police helicopters and a Zeppelin, equipped with more surveillance cameras hovered overhead . . . Dozens of new PAC 3 (Patriot Advanced Capability) missiles were armed and in position at three locations around the capital, including the Tatio Military Base near the athletes’ Olympic Village, to provide a full defense umbrella over Athens. Security forces also received 11 state-of-the-art surveillance vans that received and monitored images from around the city . . . Authorities also got two mobile truck screening systems capable of locating explosives, weapons, or drugs in trucks and other large cargo vehicles . . . By August 13<sup>th</sup> the Authorities had installed thousands of CCTV cameras and deployed all over Greece more than 70,000 military staff to patrol the first Summer Games since the September 11<sup>th</sup> attacks on the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211433482">Samatas, 2007</xref>: 224)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This extensive inventory does not take account of the NATO AWACS surveillance airplanes circling high in Greek air space or NATO naval vessels patrolling shipping lanes in the nearby Mediterranean Sea off the port of Piraeus.</p>
<p>Neither does Samatas’s stock-take include other, more shadowy, forms of scrutiny and surveillance that may have been put in place by groups and organizations not directly and transparently connected to the AOOC (Athens Olympic Organizing Committee). Writing in the <italic>New York Times</italic> on the eve of the 2004 Athens Olympics, albeit with journalistic licence, Raymond Bonner comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>Athenians hope that thoughts of running diving and setting new world records will overtake worries about security, which are driven in large part by US fears of a new Al Qaeda attack. At the moment, there are more spies than athletes at the Olympic site, and the only record set has been the cost of security – more than $1.4 billion and rising – even though no intelligence agency has reported picking up any signal that Al Qaeda is planning to ruin the Games. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211433482">Bonner, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When on the 5 May 2004 a hitherto unknown terrorist organization calling itself ‘Revolutionary Struggle’ blew up a police station in Athens as a message to the Games organizers, concerns that the Olympics might indeed be a target for a major terrorist attack were heightened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433482">Johnson, 2008</xref>). Athens has a reputation in the NATO security community for being a hot-bed of radical-left politics and anti-establishment activity. If accounts in the Greek and American press can be believed, the US did not fully trust the security regimes of Athens’s Olympic Organizing Committee or the Greek government. In February 2006 the Greek government revealed that a year earlier a sophisticated bugging device capable of recording the mobile phone conversations of dozens of targeted subscribers had been discovered. The list of those who had their conversations bugged reads like a who’s who of the Greek political elite and includes the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Mayor of Athens and all of the senior police and army personnel who had anything to do with Olympic security. The complex phone tap had been activated shortly before the Olympics until March 2005 when it was discovered and removed. The same month, Kostas Tsalikid, a network manager from the communications technology company Vodafone, one of the few technicians with the access and capacity to plant such a device, was found hanged in his home. Although his death has been officially confirmed as suicide, there are those who are deeply suspicious of the whole affair, especially when the intercept calls were forwarded from four cellular antennas with their coverage circles overlapping over the US Embassy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211433482">Keisling, 2007</xref>). The inference here is that the phone tapping was put in place at the behest of the CIA without the knowledge of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>The major Western powers in the international community – Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Spain, the United Kingdom and, most importantly, the United States – were instrumental in making the Olympic Games in Athens 2004 a test-bed for the ‘superpanopticonic’ approach to mega-event security in the post-9/11 world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211433482">Samatas, 2007</xref>). The construction and implementation of the ‘superpanopticonic’ surveillance and security system proved to be a bonanza not only for the corporate interests of the electronic surveillance industry, but also for the US military and secret service agencies with which that industry is so interdependent. Building upon C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211433482">Wright Mills’s (1956)</xref> notion of the military-industrial complex, Samatas refers to this alliance as ‘the security and surveillance industrial complex’, a conjunction of an immense security establishment and a large high-tech surveillance and data industry.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Israel – arguably the nation at the crux of the West’s confrontation with radical Islamist states and spawned terrorist organizations – has emerged as one of the world’s leading global players in this ‘security and surveillance industrial complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211433482">Brzezinski, 2004</xref>). With its highly developed, militarized, hi-tech economy, coupled with a long history of counterterrorism and dealing with the threat of suicide bombers, Israel is very well placed to exploit the climate of fear that surrounds today’s major sporting events as a business opportunity. As such, its representatives are heavily involved in the planning and facilitation of mega-event security.</p>

<title>Beijing 2008</title>
<p>Through the murk that shrouded the Chinese capital during the 2008 Olympics, it’s virtually impossible to fully ascertain the full facts regarding surveillance and security. We do know that the overall budget for the 2008 Games was more than three times that of Athens and the security budget would have been at least proportionate to that. <italic>The Los Angeles Times</italic> estimated that the figure was in excess of six billion. This is unsurprising given the little that we do know about the scale and reach of the security operation and infrastructure of militarized hi-tech hardware that put Athens in the shade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211433482">Ying et al., 2009</xref>). The official explanation given by the Beijing authorities for the unprecedented scale of the security operation was dominated by the themes of making the Chinese capital safe and friendly place for international visitors while at the same time countering the threat posed by international terrorism.</p>
<p>Given the relatively neutral position occupied by China with regard to the politics of the Middle East, the Beijing Olympics was never likely to be an obvious target for radical Islamist terror groups. Albeit from a credible source, there are even incredible suggestions that the Chinese brokered a secret deal with Al Qaeda to make sure that their Games were off-limits! In a book entitled, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433482"><italic>The Chinese Secret Services: From Mao to the Olympic Games</italic> (2008)</xref>, Roger Faligot, a respected French investigative journalist and intelligence specialist, claims that in 2006 Chinese spies held secret meetings with Al Qaeda in the mountains of Pakistan during which the threat of possible attacks on the Olympics were discussed. Few details of these exchanges are supplied, but Faligot writes, ‘the first negotiations with Osama bin Laden’s entourage are likely to have been held in Pakistan in 2006’ and goes on to ask, ‘what has China promised to prevent a suicide bomber from blowing himself up during the finals of the hundred meters dash? And most importantly, what confidence can we give any commitment undertaken by Osama bin Laden? The answer will come next August in Beijing’ (p. 326). Running counter to Faligot’s claims, in 2010 it was reported on the <italic>WikiLeaks</italic> website, that US diplomatic correspondence in the build up to Beijing had raised serious concerns that Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’s second in command had ordred attacks during the 2008 Olympics, including targeting the equestrian events in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211433482">Hula, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Truth is, that if China faced ‘terrorists’ threats they were most likely to have been internally generated and there is a perhaps more credible criticism that China used the Olympics and the accompanying ‘threat of terrorism’ as a pretext for cracking down on domestic political dissidents, human rights activists, and ethnic/nationalist minority groups, particularly those associated with Tibet and the Uighurs in the Muslim-dominated far western region of Xinjiangn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211433482">Ying et al., 2009</xref>). As well as this, the massive development programmes undertaken in the neighbourhoods adjacent to the main Olympic venue were accompanied by massive relocation of some of Beijing’s poorest citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433482">Giulianotti and Klauser, 2009</xref>). Whether the aforementioned crack-down was as a response to some of the violent attacks undertaken by separatist groups and human rights activists prior to the Olympics or whether the indiscriminate nature of the police and army strong-arm interventions precipitated these acts of ‘terrorism’ remains open to question.</p>
<p>Finally, in London it was reported by <italic>The Times</italic>, that in addition to overt security measures, Beijing was subject to saturation levels of state-sponsored spying, not just aimed at countering the threat of terrorism, but also to garner the technical and tactical intelligence of competing national Olympic teams as well as steal state and industrial secrets from the thousands of foreign government and business personnel who attended the Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211433482">Oakshot et al., 2008</xref>). This serves to reinforce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211433482">John McAloon’s (1997)</xref> assertion that, even before 9/11, the Olympic Games provided the perfect venue for the clandestine activities of international espionage networks. Worryingly, speaking at a conference in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1012690211433482">4</xref></sup> and responding to the author’s question regarding security measures being developed for London 2012 Geoff Newton, Director Olympic Opportunities, London Development, suggested that they would be able to learn from how China handled Olympic security issues. When it comes to human rights and civil liberties, surely contemporary China is the last place on earth that the world’s oldest democracy should be looking towards for guidance?</p>

<title>London in the cross-hairs?</title>
<p>As the so-called ‘war on terror’ continued to cast its shadow around the world, the security operation being developed to ensure the safety of the 2012 Olympics promised to be on an unprecedented scale. There are several outstanding, overlapping contextual issues that augment the risk of London 2012 being the site of a major terrorist incident. First, London is one of the ‘world cities’ which in and of itself makes it an attractive prospect for tourists and terrorists alike, albeit for different reasons. Second, and related to this, Britain’s contemporary foreign policy, its military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and its continued support for Israel, see it demonized as ‘Little Satan’ by Islamic extremists. Third, in the eyes of the militants, Britain stands ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with ‘Big Satan’, the United States, and as such the London Olympics present targets at least as mouth-watering as New York City’s World Trade Centre. Finally, Britain’s troubled history as a colonial power and its postcolonial legacy not only give it a rich multicultural heterogeneity, but also, as the London bombings of 7 July 2005 remind us, make it a repository for the festering of postcolonial resentments and a potential breeding ground for Jihadist sympathizers. This is not lost on those charged with the responsibility of delivering safe and secure Games in London 2012:
<disp-quote>
<p>On the 6<sup>th</sup> of July 2005, it was announced that London had been successful in its bid for the 2012 Games. Just 24 hours later 52 people were murdered in four terrorist attacks in London, which changed the security landscape overnight. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433482">Ghaffur, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two stark sentences, penned in 2007 by Tarique Ghaffur, then the Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and Security Co-ordinator for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics Games, capture the essence of the challenge facing London. Ghaffur goes on to suggest that London is a good choice as host because it has a wealth of experience as a terror target:
<disp-quote>
<p>Athens 2004 set the standard in security and surveillance for future mega-sporting events. London, with its long history of security development linked to the ‘Irish Question’ and with the experience of stadia security born from decades of dealing with football hooliganism, and taking account of lessons learned in Athens (and Beijing), from a practical point of view, may be better placed than most other cities to cope with the post 9/11 security demands that come with hosting the Olympic Games. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433482">Ghaffur, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a perverse rationale for awarding the Games to London – a bit like arguing the case for New Orleans to host them during the hurricane season because of that city’s history of dealing with violent tropical storms. Not surprisingly, given existing levels of public and private surveillance in the UK, the ‘superpanoptic’ approach, piloted in Athens in 2004, is at the centre of London’s strategy to make safe the 2012<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1012690211433482">5</xref></sup> Olympics. With more than an echo of Athens, the London Metropolitan Police have said that the first line of security for London 2012 is to be a ‘technological footprint’ across London. The ‘footprint’ will combine and integrate ‘new-build’ security technologies in and around Olympic venues with existing public and private surveillance and security infrastructure, including traffic control cameras and the 500,000-plus CCTV units which are estimated already to be in place in and around the metropolis.</p>
<p>Responding to this issue, Marcus Morgan has argued that the imposition of the aforementioned ‘technological footprint’ would give the police unprecedented control over up to half a million CCTV cameras, access to DNA archives, and multiple forms of personal identification data. On top of this, tens of thousands of police and privately contracted security personnel will be used and at least as much military hardware as that used in Athens in 2004 will be deployed on the ground, in the air and on the water to create a fortress around London 2012. Further to this, on 14 November 2011 it was confirmed in Parliament by Defence Secretary Peter Howard that surface-to-air missiles would also be deployed in London to counter the threat of any airborne terrorist threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433482">Gibson, 2011</xref>). Morgan concludes that ‘the machinery is being created that is necessary to impose a highly integrated police/military apparatus in Britain’s capital city, under the pretext of keeping the country safe from terrorism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211433482">Morgan, 2008</xref>: 2)</p>
<p>This is a theme picked up by Oscar Reyes, who, writing in the radical journal <italic>Red Pepper</italic> after visiting the Athens Olympiad observed, ‘huge amounts of money were spent on equipment that didn’t work. But the part that did work is now used for the surveillance of Greek society.’ Then turning his attention to London 2012 he states, ‘the Greatest Show on Earth, it seems, would be accompanied by one of the largest security operations ever mounted in the UK. Long after the TV cameras have moved on, the CCTV would still be watching. And that’s a spectre we would be foolish to ignore.’ Coaffee and Murakami Wood share Reyes concerns believing that an event like the 2012 Olympics may be used by government and security-related interest groups to magnify in the public mind the ‘terrorist threat’ and construct a ‘climate of fear’ to ‘justify technologically driven control strategies, to counter anti-social behavior and democratic protest, to exclude the dangerous ‘‘other’’ from public space, and to introduce identity cards that link citizens to state held databases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211433482">Coaffee and Murakami Wood, 2006</xref>: 515). Denis Oswald, the Chairman of the IOC’s London Coordination Commission, admitted that it was difficult, if not impossible, to predict how much will have to be allocated to the security budget. He said, ‘it’s a very difficult area but if we want to have occasions like the Olympic Games, where hundreds of thousands of people meet, then you have to make sure they are safe, otherwise you just give up and the terrorists win’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211433482">Bond, 2007</xref>). This Morgan argues, is tantamount to asking the British tax payer for a blank cheque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211433482">Morgan, 2008</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>According to some newspaper reports, estimates of the final numbers that might be written on such a cheque become more and more inflated as the opening ceremony approaches, rising to well over the $1.5 billion spent on security for the Athens Games and more than three times the estimated security bill in the original bid document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211433482">Briggs, 2008</xref>). As late as March 2011, almost a year before the Games were to commence, Amyas Morse, Head of the UK’s National Audit Office, was still unable to confirm what the overall costs of hosting the London Olympics would be, saying that, ‘the final cost of the Games to the taxpayer is inherently uncertain and, as the Games near, there will be less flexibility to make savings in response to any unforeseen financial pressures’. A NAO report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433482">2011</xref>) could confirm, however, that the official security spend had already risen from an estimated £600 million to £757 million and this was likely to rise even further.</p>
<p>Despite such forecasts as the Games drew nearer late in 2010 in a statement to Parliament it was revealed that LOCG were planning to spend £125 million less than the £600 million previously anticipated in the Olympic Security Budget. This proved to be wildly optimistic and eight months before the start of the London Games LOCOG were forced to eat their words when it was revealed, once more in Parliament, that the numbers of security personnel required to secure Olympic venues in London and elsewhere was way in excess of the 10,000 target and likely to be closer to 20,000. As well as recruiting more personnel from the private sector, LOCOG were considering drafting in contingents from the armed forces and the police. Wherever they came from they would have to be paid for and inevitably the security bill would grow significantly. In early November 2011 this was all but confirmed by Chris Allison, the National Olympic Security Coordinator, who told the London Assembly: ‘I can’t tell you what the final costs are going to be. I just don’t know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211433482">Kortekaas, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Related to this in mid-November of the same year it was reported in the <italic>Guardian</italic> newspaper, that the US had ‘raised repeated concerns about security at the London Olympics and is preparing to send up to 1000 of its agents, including 500 from the FBI to provide protection for America’s contestants and diplomats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211433482">Hopkins and Norton-Taylor, 2011</xref>). While this sparked vigorous denials from both British and US officials and diplomats, given the high status of London as a terrorist target and given the Americans’ record at previous Olympics, especially in Athens and Beijing, there will undoubtedly be a significant US Secret Service presence.</p>
<p>Lincoln Allison argues that no matter how sophisticated pseudo-scientific risk assessments become, unlike in the physical environment, in complex societies there are no real limits to levels of risk posed by unpredictable human forces – including terrorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211433482">Allison, 2010</xref>). This does not stop those who have vested interests in the security business using the spurious notion of ‘worst case scenario’ to justify the most draconian (and expensive) strategies to keep us safe in our beds. Johnson refers to this as a conflict between limited budgets versus infinite demands. Writing about risk assessments and Olympic events he argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>Successful security operations at recent games raise questions about whether the high levels of expenditure are proportionate to the high levels of threat . . . Given that we cannot afford to meet all potential security threats, we must allocate finite resources to address those threats that are most likely or which pose the greatest consequences. However, the dynamic political and social context for many games makes it difficult to validate the findings of any security risk assessment. There will therefore continue to be great uncertainty about the sufficiency of security measures for future Games. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433482">Johnson, 2008</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, given New York City 9/11 and London 7/7 it is very difficult to argue against the need for supersize security, particularly when terror organizations themselves feed the media-amplified, moral panic over mega-event safety. The Olympics may not have been targeted by international terrorist organizations since 1972, but there have been serious terrorist attacks on other major sports events. In 2009 in Lahore, Pakistan, the team bus of the touring Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by masked gunmen, believed to be members of an extreme Islamic faction with links to Al Qaeda, killing six policemen and the coach driver and injuring several cricketers before being beaten back by armed police. Less than a year later a similar incident occurred during the African Cup of Nations when the Togolese National football team’s bus was ambushed by guerrillas from Flec (Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda) as it drove through Angola’s disputed Province of Cabinda on its way to the competition venue. Several team officials were killed and three players were seriously injured, casting a long shadow not only over the Cup of Nations itself, but also stretching as far as South Africa where the World Cup Finals were to be held later the same year.</p>
<p>The terrorist threat was augmented when on the eve of the 2010 World Cup Finals an Al Qaeda spokesman declared on a North African Jihadist website that the competition was to be targeted by suicide bombers using ‘undetectable explosives’. The qualifying game between England and the USA in Rustenburg on 12 June was given special mention:
<disp-quote>
<p>How amazing could the match between the United States vs Britain [<italic>sic</italic>] be when broadcast live on air at a stadium packed with spectators when the sound of an explosion rumbles through the grounds, the whole stadium is turned upside down and number of dead bodies are in their dozens and hundreds, Allah willing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211433482">Edwards, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Statements like the one quoted above from Al Qaeda are cheap to make, but set against a history of indiscriminate public terrorist attacks by them and related groups, including sport-related targets, they serve to accentuate the climate of fear that surround contemporary sporting events. Such statements of intent also encourage vast expenditure on an intrusive security apparatus that violate principles of civil liberty and human rights and blur the distinction between political and civil society. Thus, without even throwing so much as a whiz-bang, Al Qaeda and its ilk are in profit as are the mandarins of the security and surveillance industrial complex for whom the Olympics is just another business opportunity.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While it is by no means certain that Foucault read George Orwell’s novel, <italic>1984</italic>, (although it is likely that he did) the main theme of book, ubiquitous state-sponsored surveillance, and its central character ‘Big Brother’ resonate strongly with the French philosopher’s position on surveillance and social control through subconscious self-discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433482">Haggerty and Ericson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211433482">Orwell, 1949</xref>). By chance, Orwell finished 1984 in 1948 which was the last time London hosted the summer Olympic Games. If Orwell had been so minded, in August 1948 when he completed his manuscript instead of posting it he could have hand-delivered it to his publisher, Secker and Warburg, in London’s Vauxhall Bridge Road before jumping on a red double-decker bus to travel northwest to the Empire Stadium Wembley to watch some of the athletics events in the Olympics. Had he taken the trip from Vauxhall to Brent, Orwell would had been no more than the proverbial ordinary ‘man on a London omnibus’, and in the stadium itself, his would have been just one anonymous face among those of thousands of other unremarkable, unrecognized and unregistered spectators. Sixty-four years later, while austerity was back in town and London’s buses still at least resembled their 1948 ancestors, much else had changed around the staging of the 2012 Olympics, not the least the conditions of surveillance and security.</p>
<p>Little could Orwell have known that by the time the Olympics returned to London the reality of security and surveillance would not only have far exceeded his nightmarish imaginings, but the presence of the Olympics themselves in 2012 had significantly accelerated the expansion of the UK’s digital-state’s totalitarian presence in our lives. In July 2007, Tom Wilson, Secretary to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, asked, in the context of the 2012 Olympics, what would be the ‘impact of surveillance and security and collection upon the privacy of citizens and their relationship with the state?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211433482">Wilson, 2007</xref>). To date those involved in the design and activation of Olympic security for 2012 are yet to come up with a satisfactory answer. Maybe this is because we have already become so accustomed to living in an Orwellian dystopia and the terms of the question no longer have the resonance they might have once had. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211433482">Rennie (2008)</xref> points out, in an era when Orwell’s chilling metaphor for the pervasive totalitarian state, ‘Big Brother’, has been parodied as a popular reality TV show and we have become used to everybody watching, photographing and filming everybody else in public and in private, when it comes to complaining about privacy and civil liberties, the game is already up. Perhaps it is time we got used to the fact that rather than us watching the Games, for the foreseeable future, it is more a case of the Games watching us and once the circus has left town it is highly likely London’s ‘superpanoptican’ will be one of the 2012 Olympic Games most enduring legacies.</p>

<p>Initially the (English) FA had wanted the symbol of the poppy to be embossed onto the England team’s shirts. This, argued FIFA, contravened one of its statutes that banned any form of political symbolism on shirts for international matches. After considerable pressure from the FA and a gallery of representatives from the British establishment, including Prime Minister, David Cameron, who argued, mistakenly in the author’s view, that the red poppy was a universal symbol of respect for the fallen and as such was not a political symbol. Eventually a compromise was reached allowing the poppy to be displayed on arm-bands.</p>
