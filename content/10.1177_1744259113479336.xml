<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fossil energy is an essential component of daily life whose environmental impact and fast-increasing price are two important concerns in the millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1744259113479336">Teschner et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, two price increases, which occurred from 1973 to 1983 and from 1998 to 2008, affected the social and economic aspects of many lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1744259113479336">Ruud, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the depletion of natural resources generated interest in renewable energy sources, such as the sun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744259113479336">Karakosta et al., 2010</xref>), wind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1744259113479336">Saadatian et al., 2012</xref>), biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259113479336">Abu Hamed et al., 2012</xref>), waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744259113479336">Krivtsov and Linfoot, 2012</xref>), rain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1744259113479336">Mateo, 2012</xref>), tides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1744259113479336">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and geothermal heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744259113479336">Johnstone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744259113479336">Karakosta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744259113479336">Kazem, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Solar energy plays an important role for numerous people in different walks of life. Solar energy can be used in remote and undeveloped areas to meet the requirements of schools, clinics and other buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259113479336">Al-Karaghouli and Kazmerski, 2010</xref>). Building accounts for 33% of the world’s total greenhouse-gas emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1744259113479336">Wan et al., 2011</xref>). Careful planning is, however, required during the construction of a building when architectural features such as passive solar energy system can be integrated as a component of a building in an attempt to offset the impeding danger posed by climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744259113479336">Kazmerski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1744259113479336">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1744259113479336">Misra, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Sustainable design based on passive solar technique reduces annual heating demand by 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1744259113479336">Liu and Feng, 2012</xref>) through the use of various architectural instrumentality such as solar chimneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259113479336">Asnaghi and Ladjevardi, 2012</xref>), solar roofs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744259113479336">Fiaschi and Bertolli, 2012</xref>), solar walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259113479336">Albanese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1744259113479336">Kundakci Koyunbaba and Yilmaz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1744259113479336">Quesada et al., 2012</xref>) and many others. These devices provide potential mechanism to reduce environmental impact of greenhouse-gas emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744259113479336">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1744259113479336">Zamora and Kaiser, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Building walls represent an important component that positively contributes to energy saving in buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1744259113479336">Saber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1744259113479336">Sveipe et al., 2011</xref>). Solar walls often referred to as storage walls or solar heating walls (SHW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259113479336">Fang and Yang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259113479336">Hami et al., 2012</xref>) help reduce building energy consumption by up to 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2011</xref>). A solar wall is an important green architectural feature that aids the ventilation, heating and cooling of buildings.</p>
<p>This architectural feature provides important and inspiring energy complement worthy to be incorporated into the Zion National Park Visitor Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1744259113479336">Torcellini and Pless, 2004</xref>) at National Wind Technology Centre in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) in the United States. This article examined the appropriateness of this innovative green technology through careful review of previous research work with the aim to provide in-depth evaluation for future development. This source of information could be very useful to passive-energy designers.</p>

<title>Configuration of solar walls</title>
<p>The technology that underlies solar wall configuration encompasses the use of sun-facing wall (solar wall) to conventionally heat up air for ventilation purposes, which is essentially needed to provide thermal comfort in buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1744259113479336">Zamora and Kaiser, 2009</xref>). This is achieved through the absorption of solar radiation during daylight and the release of the energy absorbed to the interior during the night. The operation strategy facilitates the use of excess energy absorbed during the sun’s peak hours by the building’s occupants when it is most needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744259113479336">Koyunbaba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1744259113479336">Llovera et al., 2011</xref>). Several conformations in use are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259113479336">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Notable classes of solar wall discussed in this article include classic and modified solar wall, zigzag solar wall, solar water wall, solar transwall, solar hybrid wall, solar wall with phase-change material, composite solar wall, fluidised solar wall and photovoltaic solar wall.</p>
<sec id="section3-1744259113479336">
<title>Standard solar wall</title>
<p>Classic, or often referred to as standard, solar wall comprises a compartment of glass and air space that is separated by the wall from the outdoor environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744259113479336">Guohui, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744259113479336">Hestnes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1744259113479336">Mekhilef et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). This type of solar wall was invented by Edward Morse, an American engineer, and was patented in 1881. Classic solar wall was popularised by Felix Trombe (a French engineer) and Jacque Michel (French architect) in late 1950s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259113479336">Birkeland, 2008</xref>). Their innovative work on solar walls led to the modified versions that are currently referred to as Trombwall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259113479336">Birkeland, 2008</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744259113479336">Hatamipour and Abedi (2008)</xref> argued that the concept of solar walls is comparable to gangway architectural vernacular located in the Persian Gulf having a corridor that separated the major entrance to rooms from the main hall with windows by its sides. The gangway walls conserve heat energy, while the corridor functions as an air gap between the glazing and heat-storage solar wall.</p>
<p>The arrangement is similar to the technique used in the classic solar wall that involves the use of materials of high heat-storage capacity such as bricks, concrete, stone and adobe with colour-textured external surface (usually black) to improve the absorption rate of heat energy and are glazed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744259113479336">Allen and Iano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1744259113479336">Thumann and Mehta, 2008</xref>), with air gap between the glass and wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259113479336">Birkeland, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The solar wall surface absorbs direct and diffused solar radiation as the sun shines and conveys the absorbed heat energy towards the thick storage mass interior wall by either convection or conduction when the sun sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>). The air space between the sun-facing wall and the glass, often in the range of 3–6 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2004</xref>), gradually releases absorbed heat energy and stores it as thermal mass. The heat-transfer mechanism from the sun is basically through radiation and convection, which is essentially utilised to increase thermal comfort level of building occupants. Customarily, conventional airflow is produced through solar buoyancy effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1744259113479336">Ryan and Burek, 2010</xref>). However, diversified modifications on the size and shape of classic solar walls can be designed. Commercially modified solar walls are incorporated with gypsum-lined board with layers of masonry exterior and gypsum board. This design conventionally induces buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. A dark-coloured, 2-m<sup>2</sup> commercially modified solar wall having 14-cm air gap can induce 20–90 m<sup>3</sup>/h of air ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744259113479336">Khedari et al., 1998</xref>). The design incorporates air gap between different layers, although different components can be integrated into the classic solar wall to enhance its performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1744259113479336">Santamouris, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1744259113479336">
<title>Solar water wall</title>
<p>Solar water wall is a type of solar wall that works on an operation principle similar to that of classic solar wall. The distinction between the two is that while masonry is used for heat storage in classic solar wall, water storage/reservoir is used in solar water wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1744259113479336">Tyagi and Buddhi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1744259113479336">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). The use of water in place of heat is more effective for indirect heat gain and as a result has drawn the interest of most passive heating designers. The enhanced performance realised through the use of water in place of air is based on the concept that surface temperature of water retains heat more than air, which is used in masonry, and as a result, heat is reflected on the glazing surfaces, which is needed for environmental responsive building design for thermal comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this type of solar wall, glazing is installed at the front of water storage medium, which facilitates the flow of solar radiated heat as water distributes the absorbed heat by convection from solar water wall through to the building rooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>). In order to absorb more heat from incident solar radiation, the surfaces of the solar wall exteriors are darkened. Most solar wall layers are separated with thin film concrete wall that acts as an insulator in the interior and in turn increases the wall’s efficiency.</p>
<p>As a result of high specific heat capacity of water (C), which is higher than most building materials such as concrete, bricks, adobe and stone, more heat energy is conserved using water. In addition, the transfer of the absorbed heat energy to the interior space using water is faster than air, which is used in classic solar wall systems. However, in cold climate, the need arises to insulate the glass layers to prevent heat loss from the sun-facing warm wall to the exterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1744259113479336">Thumann and Mehta, 2008</xref>). The solar water wall can function as a cooling and heating medium for building apartments, which is part of sustainable architectural micro-element in building design. However, liquids such as water are more difficult to handle than solid materials such as the ones used in masonry. As a result, solar water wall is not widely adopted by stakeholders compared to classic solar walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1744259113479336">Simmons, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>An experimental study has been performed on the effects of solar water wall thickness on the efficiency in a controlled environment using 3-in, 6-in and 9-in wall thicknesses in Oregon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259113479336">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). It was found that 9-in and 6-in water walls are more efficient than the 3-inch solar water wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259113479336">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The study concluded that thicker solar water walls provide cooler interior temperature during hot weather and warmer interior temperature during cold weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259113479336">Adams et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1744259113479336">
<title>Zigzag solar wall</title>
<p>Zigzag type of solar wall is primarily designed to turn down excess heat gain of bright sunny days. This form of solar wall comprises three sections: one section faces southward, while two other sections are angled to form a V-shaped wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1744259113479336">NREL, 2012</xref>). The south-facing section is provided with a window through which conventional heating and cooling required for thermal comfort are supplied to the building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1744259113479336">NREL, 2012</xref>). Opposite the V-shaped wall is a classic solar wall, which stores heat for redistribution in the cold night hours (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259113479336">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744259113479336-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The zigzag design incorporates an exterior overhang to circumvent excessive heating during hot summer days. Recent prototype incorporated with five V-shaped sections is present at the visitors centre of NREL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1744259113479336">Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1744259113479336">NREL, 2005</xref>) and has also been used in a 1200-m<sup>2</sup> residential building near Asheville at North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1744259113479336">Sokol, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744259113479336">
<title>Solar transwall</title>
<p>A transwall is another type of solar wall. A transwall is a transparent modular water wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1744259113479336">Prakash and Garg, 2000</xref>). A transwall plays an aesthetic role by providing visual access to a building’s interior. In addition, it provides thermal gain from solar radiation. This wall is built on a metal frame that holds a water container constructed from glass walls and a semi-transparent absorbing plate that is positioned between the walls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744259113479336">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1744259113479336" position="float">

<p>Details of a solar transwall.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744259113479336-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The semi-transparent plate absorbs 4/5 of the solar energy and transmits the rest of the energy inside. Therefore, this type of wall uses the direct and indirect gain systems and is suitable for locations where daytime temperature is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259113479336">Al-Karaghouli and Kazmerski, 2010</xref>). Convective heat transfer in a transwall lessens the efficiency of this type of wall. However, installing transparent baffles overcomes this deficiency. To increase the viscosity of the water and to prevent microorganisms from growing in the water, gelling and bio-inhibiting agents should be added to the water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259113479336">Al-Karaghouli and Kazmerski, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Solar hybrid wall</title>
<p>The solar wall is famous for its heating effects during winter and is designed for cold climates. However, Spanish scholars have presented a hybrid prototype solar wall: the ceramic evaporative cooling wall. The wall functions as a classic solar wall during winter and provides cooling in summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1744259113479336">Melero et al., 2011</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259113479336">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744259113479336-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The solar hybrid wall prototype uses the design of a standard solar wall. However, the wall employs an external thermal insulation blind during summer to avoid any direct solar gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1744259113479336">Melero et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a special type of ceramic known as porous ceramic is used in the interior wall, which absorbs a significant amount of water. Porous materials are special type of materials that have a mean pore size and pore-size distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1744259113479336">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). In hot weather, the ceramic is wetted by a water nozzle installed at the roof over the gap between the glass and the wall, which causes the gap to function as a cooling chamber due to the evaporative cooling phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1744259113479336">Melero et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Solar wall with phase-change material</title>
<p>This solar wall is a new type, which uses a phase-change material, such as phase eutectic salts or salt hydrates to enhance efficiency. A thick, massive wall, which is heavy and increases a building’s dead load, is considered a problem by structural engineers. This problem is addressed through the use of a new type of material known as phase-change material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259113479336">Cabeza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1744259113479336">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1744259113479336">Tyagi and Buddhi, 2007</xref>). These phase-change materials store more energy in a smaller volume and are lighter than normal building materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259113479336">Cabeza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2012</xref>). According to a numerical study by Bourdeau, a 15-cm concrete wall can be replaced by a 3.5-cm wall of phase-change material, but performs similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259113479336">Bourdeau, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>A group of Japanese scientists under Onishi undertook a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the thermal behaviour of a room with phase-change material solar walls. The group analysed three phase-change materials and established that use of phase-change materials in solar walls is valuable for reducing energy consumption in buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1744259113479336">Onishi et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Different phase-change materials affect the performance of solar walls differently. For instance, in a computerised dynamic simulation that was conducted by Khalifa and Abbas in Baghdad, Iraq, for a south-facing solar wall, various phase-change materials showed different reactions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259113479336">Table 1</xref>). Khalifa and Abbas examined paraffin wax and hydrated salt encapsulated in copper capsules with a length to diameter ratio of 0.76. The researchers realised that an 8-cm-thick hydrated salt storage wall is more efficient than a 20-cm-thick concrete or a 8-cm-thick hydrated salt storage wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744259113479336">Khalifa and Abbas, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Bourdeau performed another experimental study on solar walls with phase-change materials. The solar wall was constructed from a polyethylene container positioned on a wooden shelf and was double glazed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259113479336">Bourdeau, 1980</xref>). The results indicated that latent heat storage becomes saturated during the operation, and a solar wall with latent heat storage is more efficient than a concrete wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259113479336">Bourdeau, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In France, Zalewski et al. conducted an experimental study on a small-scale solar wall. In their study, a concrete storage wall was replaced by a new wall that contained hydrated salt to examine the walls’ efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2012</xref>). The results of the study demonstrated that the hydrated salt can release the solar gains with a time lag of 2 h and 40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2012</xref>). This time lag is considered a negative phenomenon in winter if the wall is designed for a dwelling and insulated to take advantage of gains at the end of the day. However, such a wall can be considered advantageous when used in structures that are occupied during the day, such as shopping malls, clinics, universities and schools in winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Composite solar wall</title>
<p>The composite solar wall, which is also known as the Trombe–Michel wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1744259113479336">Marinosci et al., 2011</xref>), is another type of solar wall, which consists of several different layers. These layers include a semi-transparent cover, a mass heating wall, a closed cavity, a ventilated air cavity and an insulating panel. Composite solar walls are considered a remedy for two deficiencies of solar walls: (a) heat loss during cloudy winter days and (b) undesired heat inputs during hot weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1744259113479336">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The composite solar wall functions as follows. The first layer, which is transparent, dispatches the majority of the gained solar beams. Consequently, the storage wall absorbs a portion of the gained solar energy and heats up. The mass wall stores and transmits part of the absorbed energy into the building’s interior. This energy transfers into the room by convection through the ventilated channel. In addition, a small portion of the energy is transmitted by conduction from the wall into the room. These free solar gains must be distinguished from direct solar gains.</p>
<p>The advantages of composite solar walls are as follows: (a) users can control the rate of heating by controlling the airflow into the ventilated channel and (b) the composite solar wall’s thermal resistance is extremely high because the walls and ventilated channel are insulated. One disadvantage of a composite solar wall is that the wall requires a mechanism to prevent reverse thermo-circulation, which occurs when the storage wall becomes colder than the ambient air of the building’s internal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This problem can be solved by inserting a plastic film in the vent, which functions as a thermal diode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1744259113479336">Shen et al. (2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1744259113479336">2007b</xref>), a group of scholars based in France, compared the classic solar wall with the composite solar wall using TRNSYS software and validated it by experiential testing to analyse the walls’ efficiencies . The results demonstrated that the composite solar wall performs better during winter, particularly in cold or cloudy climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1744259113479336">Shen et al., 2007b</xref>).</p>

<title>Photovoltaic solar wall</title>
<p>A new invention is the photovoltaic (PV) solar wall, in which the front side of the glazing is composed of PV panels that simultaneously convert solar radiation into heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1744259113479336">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). The PV solar wall is considered an aesthetic approach in designing solar walls. This wall does not have the unsightliness of a normal solar wall, in which glass covers a black mass wall. The dark blue solar cells can add beauty to a building and increase the building’s appeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744259113479336">Jie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1744259113479336">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). With the PV solar wall, the cool air of the room is drawn in from the lower vent, absorbs the PV heat, becomes hot and travels inside the room before exiting through the upper vent. Absorbing PV heat increases the efficiency of PV panels because the panels function better when they are cool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744259113479336">Chow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744259113479336">De Pascale et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The PV solar wall uses a PV panel, which hinders the penetration of solar rays into the air space between the walls and glazing. Therefore, the efficiency of the solar wall is reduced in terms of heat gain. However, this type of solar wall generates electricity, which is considered a benefit. Therefore, the question arises of how much the efficiency of classic solar walls will be changed when a PV panel covers the glazing. To answer the question, Sun et al. performed an experiment and a computer simulation to measure the internal temperature of a building. The building was equipped with south-facing windows and a 0.83 m wide and 2.6 m tall PV panel installed on a solar wall. Developing a dynamic numerical model, Sun et al., simulated all of the building’s components. The study revealed that installing PV panels over the glazing reduces the thermal performance of the solar wall up to 17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1744259113479336">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). This reduction is due to the obstructed penetration of the sun’s rays into the mass wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1744259113479336">Sun et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another group of scholars studied the use of the PV solar wall, the wall’s optimal width and the wall’s optimal area of winter air vents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the group investigated the effects of insulation and a shading curtain on winter heating and summer cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2007</xref>). The results revealed that insulation increases the indoor temperature by 2.36°C in cold weather and decreases the indoor temperature by 2.47°C in hot weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, curtain shading decreases the internal temperature by 2.00°C in hot weather and may decrease the electrical performance rate less than 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Fluidised solar wall</title>
<p>Fluidised solar wall operational principle is based on the classic solar wall; however, in place of air gap between the solar wall and glazing as found in classic solar wall, highly absorbent, low-density fluid is used in fluidised solar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1744259113479336">Sadineni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1744259113479336">Sayigh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1744259113479336">Tunc and Uysal, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>A fan is used to convey the solar heat captured by the absorptive fluid and are been driven by heated air to the occupants rooms.

A group of Turkish scholars compared classic solar wall with fluidised solar wall theoretically and experimentally and found that fluidised beds provide limited distinctive procedure for solving governing equations based on air as the working fluid. Findings showed that fluidised solar walls perform better than classic solar walls due to the heat-transfer mechanism used, which involves direct contact of fluid with the particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1744259113479336">Tunc and Uysal, 1991</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259113479336">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Efficiency analyses</title>
<p>Solar walls have various accessories that help increase efficiency. Important accessories include vents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259113479336">Abedi, 2012</xref>), fans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1744259113479336">Sebald et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1744259113479336">Yi et al., 2009</xref>) and insulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1744259113479336">Sacht et al., 2011</xref>). Certain intrinsic solar wall attributes contribute to the wall’s efficiency. Size, thickness, colour, wall materials, coating materials and glazing specifications are among the important solar wall attributes that affect the wall’s efficiency. In the following sections, these accessories and attributes will be discussed.</p>
<sec id="section13-1744259113479336">
<title>Vent effects</title>
<p>Classic solar walls could be categorised in two types: vented and unvented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259113479336">Abraham, 2009</xref>). For vented solar walls, two thermo-circulation vents are installed at the top and bottom of the wall to assist heat circulation. These vents are designed to control the heat loss. The heat loss occurs in the air space between the glazing and wall through convection, conduction or radiation back to the atmosphere. The higher the temperature of the air space, the greater is the heat loss. Vents are installed at the top and bottom of the wall to reduce the heat loss. As the air in the air space becomes warm and lighter, it enters the room through the upper vent, and cool air replaces it through the lower vent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The closing or opening of vents changes the heat-transfer coefficients between the air in the gap and the wall and glazing. When the vents are closed, the heat-transfer coefficient should be measured for optimisation. For measurement, the amount of infrared radiation and the natural convection exchange between grey-surface problems for vertical collectors should be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>). However, when the vents are open, a mathematical equation is used to calculate the transfer coefficient.</p>
<p>For vented solar walls, the vents are an important control mechanism, which can assist buildings in heating and cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259113479336">Hami et al., 2012</xref>). The efficiency of vented and unvented solar walls has long been regarded as an important topic in passive-energy research. For instance, Balcomb and McFarland studied the performance of solar walls with thermo-circulation vents and unvented solar walls in nine different climates of the United States. Their study revealed that vents produce a reverse flow during the night and reduce the efficiency greatly under certain circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Balcomb and McFarland proposed using dampers to control the vents to prevent reverse flow. Their results revealed that the use of controlled vents does not significantly affect the performance of solar walls in mild climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland, 1978</xref>). They concluded that vented solar walls function 10–20% more efficiently in severe climates, such as that of Boston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland, 1978</xref>). Furthermore, the research team simulated a thermostatically controlled vented system in which dampers were closed when the internal temperature of the building exceeded 24°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland, 1978</xref>). This method was found to prevent overheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>A simulation study using Energy Plus software was conducted by a group of Portuguese scientists in three different climatic regions of Portugal. The study aimed to determine the effect of vents on solar-wall efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259113479336">Ferreira and Pinheiro, 2011</xref>). The study’s results confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259113479336">Balcomb and McFarland (1978)</xref>.</p>
<p>In designing a solar wall, vent size is an important parameter and depends on the solar saving fraction (SSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259113479336">Balcomb, 1992</xref>). Additionally, external vents, which can be installed in the exterior part of solar walls, facilitate the air circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1744259113479336">Stepler, 1980</xref>). This circulation enables better ventilation and cools the air space between the glazing and main wall during summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1744259113479336">Stepler, 1980</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1744259113479336">
<title>Fan effects</title>
<p>The feasibility of using fans to assist the circulation of heat through the vents is questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259113479336">Balcomb, 1992</xref>). A thermal network computer simulation was performed by Sebald et al., on a solar wall with a thermostatically controlled fan. The thermostatically controlled fan started when the outside wall temperature exceeded 29°C. The results revealed that the fan’s performance depends on parameters such as the wall’s thickness and climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1744259113479336">Sebald et al., 1979</xref>). For instance, a fan can improve the efficiency of a 37-m<sup>2</sup> room with a solar wall by 22% in Albuquerque, 20% in Santa Barbara and 7% in Madison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1744259113479336">Sebald et al., 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>At the University of California, Sebald and Phillips performed another simulation study on the efficiency of a fan-equipped solar wall. In the study, the fan started when the room required heating and the temperature of the gap between the glazing and wall exceeded the room temperature by more than 10°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1744259113479336">Sebald, 1985</xref>). The results indicated that a fan improves the performance of solar walls by up to 8%.</p>
<p>Another simulation, which was validated by a field test, was conducted by Jie et al., on the efficiency of a PV solar wall with and without a fan at the University of Science and Technology of China. The study determined that the fan reduces the internal temperature by 0.5°C and reduces the temperature of the PV cells by 1.28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744259113479336">Jie et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the study observed that a fan can reduce the temperature of PV cells by 1.28°C between 7:00 a.m. and 05:00 p.m., which causes the PV cells to function more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744259113479336">Jie et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, based on the review performed by the authors, the majority of the research conducted in this area relies exclusively on computer modelling, in which questions of validity might not have been fully addressed.</p>

<sec id="section15-1744259113479336">
<title>Size effects</title>
<p>The size of solar walls or, more precisely, the ratio of the solar wall’s area to the total wall area has been proposed as a parameter of solar-wall efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744259113479336">Gomez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>). Based on a study undertaken by Jaber et al. on a typical Jordanian house, which was modified using a solar wall, the ratio of solar wall area to the wall area (α) has a direct effect on thermal efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>). If α = 20%, the solar wall can save up to 22.3% of heating auxiliary energy annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>). However, if α = 37%, the solar wall will be able to save up to 32.1% of heating auxiliary energy annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>). For α larger than 37%, the amount of savings will be almost negligible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259113479336">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Thickness and colour effects</title>
<p>Generally, the optimal thickness of a solar wall is related to latitude, climate and heat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2011</xref>). The thickness of the mass is one parameter that contributes to the effectiveness of solar walls. For example, with concrete, there is a lag of 120–150 min for heat delivery from outside to inside for each 10 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari, 2011</xref>). Insufficient wall thickness results in excessive interior temperature swings, while increasing the thickness will increase costs. With a very thick solar wall, the heat requires too long to reach the interior, which causes thermal discomfort for the building occupants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1744259113479336">Nelson, 2011</xref>). In this regard, in India, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259113479336">Agrawal and Tiwari (2011)</xref> have proposed a 30- to 40-cm-thick concrete solar wall for optimal results.</p>
<p>With respect to the effect of colour, in Turkey, Ozbalta and Kartal employed the unutilisability method to determine the effects of three colours on the performance of solar walls. The colours included dark, natural and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1744259113479336">Ozbalta and Kartal, 2010</xref>). Brick wall, concrete wall and autoclaved aerated concrete wall were used as the main material of the solar mass. The study revealed that the annual heat gain varied from 26.9% to 9.7% for concrete, 20.5% to 7.1% for brick and 13.0% to 4.3% for aerated concrete according to surface colour (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259113479336">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Insulation effects</title>
<p>A classic solar wall possesses low thermal resistance and loses a large amount of heat at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1744259113479336">Kundakci and Yilmaz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1744259113479336">Shen et al., 2007b</xref>). In hot weather and particularly in well-insulated buildings, solar walls might function as a source of undesired heat gain and overheating due to reverse heat transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). To prevent reverse heat transfer, solar walls should be properly insulated. Fifteen years ago, a UK scholar studied this problem with an experimental validated CFD programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259113479336">Guohui, 1998</xref>). The study suggested that proper insulation is necessary for maximising the ventilation rate of a building integrated with solar walls during summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259113479336">Guohui, 1998</xref>). Additionally, the study proposed that the interior of solar walls should be insulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259113479336">Guohui, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A group of researchers in Canada undertook a theoretical study on the use of insulation in a composite solar wall to examine overall insulated solar-wall efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1744259113479336">Zrikem and Bilgen, 1987</xref>). The composite system consisted of a glass panel, a mass wall and an insulated wall. There were vents between the mass and insulated walls. The study revealed that an insulated composite solar wall can perform much better than the classic solar wall in cold and cloudy weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1744259113479336">Zrikem and Bilgen, 1987</xref>). Additionally, the study concluded that use of insulation and a composite wall can enable a reduction in the thickness of the solar mass wall. This combination of wall materials is appealing to structural engineers, who usually desire light buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1744259113479336">Zrikem and Bilgen, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744259113479336">Ji et al. (2007)</xref>, thermal insulation in both winter and summer improves the efficiency of a PV solar wall. Another empirical study was conducted on a residential building in Alcona, central Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). The study used a simulation that employed Energy Plus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). One objective of the study was to analyse the effects of insulation in the solar wall. The simulation results for a normal solar wall and a super-insulated solar wall were compared. The results showed that the seasonal heating-energy demand for a normal solar wall was 58.33 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). However, the same parameter for a super-insulated solar wall was 16.21 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>, which is approximately 28% of the result for the former wall. For cooling, the results were the opposite. For a normal solar wall, the amount of energy required was approximately 9.19 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> and for a super-insulated solar wall approximately 23.31 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the result showed that insulation improves efficiency in winter and increases energy consumption in summer, the overall efficiency of the insulated system is much higher. The total demand for seasonal heating and cooling of a normal solar wall is approximately 62.88 (kWh/m<sup>2</sup>). An insulated solar wall requires approximately 29.58 (kWh/m<sup>2</sup>), which is approximately 47% of the energy requirement of the normal wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al. (2002)</xref> believe that the efficiency of insulation depends on many variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al. (2002)</xref> suggested that the usefulness of insulation should be investigated separately according to solar-wall type and location.</p>
<p>Another numerical study, which addressed the same concern, was undertaken in Xining, China, on an improved type of composite solar wall with insulated internal and cavity walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2009</xref>). The study aimed to compare insulated with non-insulated composite solar walls. The research revealed that this manner of insulation increases the efficiency of a composite solar wall by 56% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744259113479336">Ji et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Wall-material effects</title>
<p>The type of material used to construct a solar wall contributes importantly to the efficiency of the wall’s heat storage, convection and conduction. A group of Algerian scholars used CFD to study a room located in Bechar, Algeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259113479336">Hami et al., 2012</xref>). They concluded that the mass wall is the most crucial part of a classic solar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744259113479336">Hami et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al. (2012)</xref> found that a solar wall’s material is the key determinant of a solar wall’s storage capacity (). Knowles conducted an experimental study by replacing a paraffin–metal mixture wall with a concrete wall. The results revealed that a concrete wall reduces storage mass by 90% and increases system efficiency by more than 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1744259113479336">Knowles, 1983</xref>). Increasing the weight and volume of solar walls increases the storage capacity of the walls. However, this increase in dead load is not desirable for architects and structural engineers.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744259113479336">Hassanain et al. (2010)</xref> of Egypt’s Suez-Canal University examined the effects of various adobe materials on the efficiency of solar walls. In experimental tests, the study found that various adobe materials result in different efficiency in solar walls and can greatly affect the performance of solar walls.</p>
<p>The materials used to coat the mass wall are considered another significant solar-wall component. Therefore, the study of the effects of coating materials on the overall performance of solar walls is important. To address this issue, a group of scholars from the University of Nigeria investigated the effects of a range of coating absorption values on the efficiency of a given solar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1744259113479336">Nwachukwu and Okonkwo, 2008</xref>). The numerical study revealed that high-absorption coating materials improve a solar wall’s storage capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1744259113479336">Nwachukwu and Okonkwo, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the study suggested that the optimal heat-absorption film should be carefully designed to avoid overheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1744259113479336">Nwachukwu and Okonkwo, 2008</xref>). Additionally, the study recommended a cost–benefit analysis of expensive coating materials. According to the study, such analysis should be conducted for any project individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1744259113479336">Nwachukwu and Okonkwo, 2008</xref>). A similar study was also conducted by Nwosu for the equatorial region to analyse the heat-transfer balance across the solar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1744259113479336">Nwosu, 2010</xref>). The study found that highly absorptive coating materials improve the wall’s storage capacity and enhance system efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1744259113479336">Nwosu, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Glazing effects</title>
<p>The use of proper glazing materials is another important subject in solar-wall design. In glazing, not only the material is important, the thickness and the number of the glazing layers are also relevant factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al., 2011</xref>). Normally, glazing is either single or double. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1744259113479336">Stazi et al. (2011)</xref>, in Italy, double glazing improves solar-wall performance. In Canada, Richman and Pressnail introduced a new type of glazing, which uses a low-emittance coating film sprayed over spandrel glass. The glazing increases the efficiency of solar walls by reducing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1744259113479336">Richman and Pressnail, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A simulation conducted by Zalewski et al. in Trappes (longitude: 2°01′, latitude: 48°46′) and Carpentras (longitude: 5°03′, latitude: 44°08′) studied the effects of glazing materials on solar-wall performance. The results revealed that glazing significantly contributes to the efficiency of the solar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2002</xref>). The study showed that use of low-emittance double glazing increases the collected energy. The amount of this increase was 242% in non-ventilated solar walls, 193% in classic solar walls, 188% in insulated solar walls and 217% in composite solar walls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259113479336">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, the study revealed that the effects of glazing materials on the efficiency of solar walls depend on the longitude and latitude of the wall’s location. For this reason, Trappes showed more significant changes compared with Carpentras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1744259113479336">Zalewski et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Advantages and disadvantage of solar walls</title>
<p>Solar walls produce a large temperature variation in a building’s materials. However, solar walls cause insignificant temperature variation in heated spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1744259113479336">Thumann and Mehta, 2008</xref>). A Tunisian study indicates that solar walls significantly affect the thermal comfort of occupants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259113479336">Boukhris et al., 2009</xref>). Solar walls not only provide thermal comfort in the spaces connected to the solar wall. They also provide thermal comfort in adjacent spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259113479336">Boukhris et al., 2009</xref>). A solar wall can reduce a building’s energy consumption by 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744259113479336">Hordeski, 2004</xref>) and decrease the moisture and humidity of interior spaces in humid regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259113479336">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to being environmentally friendly, solar walls can enhance thermal comfort and save energy even in arid and desert areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744259113479336">Hassid, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Solar walls display highly complex behaviour because their operation involves different coupled heat-transfer modes and depends on certain meteorological variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1744259113479336">Shen et al., 2007a</xref>). Solar walls suffer from four shortcomings.</p>
<list id="list1-1744259113479336" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Solar walls have low thermal resistance.

<list-item><p>Solar walls suffer from an inverse thermo-siphon phenomenon.

<p>Simple techniques can control the performance of this system and address some of the shortcomings.

<title>Economic perspective</title>
<p>In conjunction with the innovative-driven modification on architectural design on the integration of solar wall as an essential building component, strong emphasis is stressed on costs and its benefits to the occupants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1744259113479336">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Experimental study on a three-storey building incorporated with solar-wall basement in Andorra showed that the system provided about 20% of the entire household heating demand in addition to its long-term economic benefits to the owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1744259113479336">Llovera et al., 2011</xref>). Experimental study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1744259113479336">Yilmaz and Kundakci (2008)</xref> showed that existing building that was retrofitted with classic solar wall in Istanbul generated enormous energy savings in an average Turkish apartment. A simulation study conducted in India based on TRNSYS building simulation software on a honey-storage building found that solar walls save about 3312 kWh/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259113479336">Chel et al., 2008</xref>). It was concluded that retrofitting buildings were economically viable in the interest of its payback period, which is 7 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259113479336">Chel et al., 2008</xref>).

<p>The study by Jaber et al. on the economic viability of solar walls based on life cycle cost (LCC) technique in a Jordanian house, which was modified with solar walls assuming a 30-year lifespan for the solar walls, reduces 8.9% inflation rate of fuel to 6.25% interest rate and a ‘Present Factor Worth (PFW)’ of 44.96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744259113479336">Jaber and Ajib, 2011</xref>).

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>Innovativeness in solar walls configuration provides appropriate and compatible passive-energy solution to the present alarming environmental and energy crises. The design configuration ranges from those incorporating new components to classic solar wall and extends to the use of modified solar-wall components. Studies have showed that air vents, fans and insulation materials significantly affect the performance of solar wall and should be used carefully to avoid reverse flow. Using fans in solar walls improves the efficiency of the vented solar wall by 8%, subject to size, thickness, colour, wall materials, coating materials and glazing specifications of the solar walls. Solar wall size is related to α while the ratio of the area is related to rooms of other walls with an optimal size of α = 37%. The thickness of a mass wall is an important determinant of the transmission rate of stored heat from exterior to interior compartment. Although the rate varies with respect to climatic regions, they should be evaluated individually for specific installation. However in an average, 30–40 cm mass concrete solar walls performed excellently well in most geographical locations using dark colour absorber energy. It is important to carefully insulate the interior side of the mass wall so as prevent reverse heat transfer. Proper insulation enhances the efficiency of the solar system by 56% and reduces the size of the mass wall leading to lighter buildings.</p>
<p>With respect to solar wall materials, material with high storage capacity is appropriate for the walls preferably, structural designers use lightweight materials with high storage capacity in order to reduce the size of the mass wall. In addition, coating of materials enhances the wall’s performance; however, it is important to carefully design the heat absorbing film to minimise risk associated with overheating. Glazing specifications is another parameter that significantly affects solar wall performance. The associated characteristic features of glazing specifications to the efficiency of the solar wall rely on variables including the longitude and latitude of the building at the site of the project.</p>
<p>It is therefore recommended that future studies should discuss the sociological awareness of the benefits of solar walls, especially among a building’s stakeholders. Further research on the building user’s preferences in various countries with respect to solar walls is recommended with focus on cultural bottlenecks such as aesthetic features of the solar walls, which discourage people of some countries from using solar walls.</p>
<p>From economics and engineering perspectives, there is a need for research on the optimal thickness of different solar wall materials ranging from stone, brick, adobe, concrete and so on, for various climatic regions. However, more research work on the efficiency of various double-glazing arrangements is recommended.</p>
<p>Furthermore, detailed studies should be conducted on the colour effects of mass wall and the glaze material on the performance of solar wall. More research on various absorptive coatings on solar mass and conclusive evaluation of the optimal thickness of solar wall coating materials is needed. Finally, the associated effects of vent size, height and width coupled with vent-channel geometry, optimal vent position, fan power and blowing angle are among important parameters that are recommended for future studies.</p>
<p>In addition, need for optimised thickness of glazing materials and their respective effects on glazing thickness as well as on the performance of solar wall should not be marginalised. However, glazing materials should be considered as a vital component of solar wall based on which external reflection can be minimised with increased absorption from outside to inside, with negligible heat loss.</p>
