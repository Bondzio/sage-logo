<p>In <italic>Total Institutions and Reinvented Identities</italic>, Susie Scott builds on the classic model of total institutions that Erving Goffman developed in <italic>Asylums</italic>, his ethnography of St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital near Washington, DC. Scott draws from published studies of myriad American groups in order to explore Goffman’s conceptual framework and suggest that reinventive institutions have superseded total institutions in terms of their prevalence and broad influence on contemporary culture.</p>
<p>She adds to theory and research in the symbolic interactionist tradition by examining how contemporary citizens of wealthy western societies join together to co-create thousands of voluntary transformational organizations that promise to promote fundamental personal change in different ways than historic total institutions like prisons or asylums. Reinventive institutions differ from Goffman’s model because they are defined by voluntary rather than coercive membership. Moreover, while reinventive groups may be imbedded in total institutions like religious cults or even prisons, peers are the ultimate sources of personal authority within them.</p>
<p>As she explores the concept of reinvention, Scott draws the reader’s attention to the emergence of this relatively recent institutional innovation. Contemporary reinventive institutions may go unnoticed because they are insular and often secret, requiring high levels of personal commitment and investment to cement inclusion. They are a unique social form, and while Scott discusses Simmel in an excellent chapter about secret societies and fraternities, she does not underscore her own contribution to Simmel’s discussion of the dualistic dynamic of inclusion and exclusion that shapes reinventive institutions.</p>
<p>The concept of reinventive institutions integrates some of the theoretical frameworks developed by Goffman, Anselm Strauss, and Michel Foucault. Scott persuasively argues that her theoretical synthesis allows us to better understand the proliferation of self-help and affinity groups in affluent societies. The promise of transformation rests on the belief that everyone is entitled to lead their best possible life by working to erase personal failings that lead to unhappiness. Turning C. Wright Mills around, the ideology of reinventive institutions transforms the political into the personal. Oprah is not mentioned in the book, but she is probably the best-known evangelist for the values of personal transformation that frame reinventive institutions.</p>
<p>Despite their ostensibly benign missions and methods, reinventive institutions are rife with formal and informal inequalities and power struggles. Scott describes battles over contested realities that may have lasting effects on members, because sustained interpersonal discourse has more intense, enduring effects than mere physical coercion. She describes the power of mutual surveillance and judgment and how that can lead to validation or denigration. In reinventive institutions, punishment usually involves a collective assault on the victim’s self rather than physical pain. Often, the member welcomes punishment because it symbolically erases transgressions and promises new possibilities for self-transformation. Scott’s applications of Foucault’s idea of disciplinary power add to the power of this argument.</p>
<p>Individual members of diverse reinventive institutions struggle to change themselves by becoming ever more committed partners in the process of mutual transformation by means of performance and internalization of the reinventive institution’s doctrines. Group members are the leaders in this process, although authorities outside or within the organization may intervene to provide guidance or enforce limits when members try to usurp their power. For example, the leader of a reinventive institution like Scientology may discipline groups who reinterpret key doctrines and practices that define the organization or overstep the boundaries of appropriate discipline.</p>
<p>Widespread faith in possibilities for personal transformation has allowed reinventive institutions to thrive in affluent societies. Transformative values encourage individuals to join together to renew or remake their social identities. Reinventive institutions range from social clubs like fraternities and sororities, to new religious movements like Scientology, to web-based virtual communities of recovering anorectics or former Facebook addicts. All of these formal and informal organizations share fundamental assumptions that people could and should become their best possible selves. Group support allows members to maximize their full human potentials through self-discipline and commitment to self-improvement. In reinventive institutions, individuals may only be able to attain their highly personal goals because they belong to a community of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>Subtle mechanisms of social control characterize reinventive institutions. Because they are physically and/or symbolically isolated from the larger society, members create and uphold formal and informal institutional definitions of social reality. Moreover, they enact their commitments within the larger society and affirm their membership by means of distinctive signs, symbols, and language. For example, when someone states, “I am a recovering alcoholic” outside of a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous members, they affirm their allegiance to their peers and witness their commitment to their reinventive institution. Despite the appearance of support and cooperation, however, the performance of mutual aid may hide interpersonal conflict and competition. For example, some members of a reinventive institution that involves overcoming addictions like alcoholism may secretly rejoice when one of their peers falls off the wagon and has to start the process of self-transformation all over again.</p>
<p>Scott’s exploration of reinventive institutions offers a new lens to examine religious and political movements that promise dramatic personal and social change. By introducing this framework she has updated Goffman and made a contribution to both symbolic interactionism and also to sociological theory.</p>
