<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458018">Jeffrey C Alexander and Philip Smith’s (2003)</xref> self-described ‘strong’ programme in cultural sociology suggests that modern capitalist society is not that different from premodern society. Individuals’ decision making is infused with emotions; their actions are oriented so that they can understand themselves as characters in a story – for some a tragedy, for others a comedy or romance – all as they strive for salvation and the good while shunning all that is profane and evil. Akin to psychoanalysis, the cultural sociologist subscribing to Alexander’s strong programme exposes the subconscious cultural structures that influence a person’s behaviour.</p>
<p>Scholars of markets generally shun such an approach. The orthodoxy argues that deviations from rational choice and strategic behaviour can be analytically set aside as these processes are predictably cleansed by competition and time (for businesses) or a proper economics education (for consumers). To the extent that economic sociologists analyse cultures, meanings and emotions, they typically engage in what Alexander calls a ‘weak’ cultural programme, where culture is explained by material forces. For example, product brands are merely instrumental devices used by capitalists to manipulate consumers to buy more stuff.</p>
<p>Shrugging off this orthodoxy, Wherry’s <italic>The Culture of Markets</italic> offers a concise and careful re-reading of empirical research in economic sociology – primarily over the past 20 years – with the strategic intention of demonstrating the value of a strong as well as a weak cultural programme in economic sociology.</p>
<p>The book’s structure promises to be a counterpoint to microeconomics textbooks, with a chapter each devoted to consumer demand, market supply and the resulting prices. The first chapter demonstrates that consumer preferences are not rational, atomistic and oriented to maximizing utility against a budget constraint. Rather, consumers understand what they desire from their interpersonal interactions (social networks) as well as historical accidents that can lock in consumption habits within subpopulations. Business owners and their employees know this and seek to manipulate consumers to purchase their products.</p>
<p>The second chapter creatively and convincingly argues for a strong cultural programme to understand how capitalists organize firms and industries. Companies do not maximize revenue by minimizing their costs using the optimal available technologies. Rather, such decisions are shaped by cultural discourses that constrain what business choices are perceived as legitimate. These causal narratives, symbols and understandings change over time and vary between societies. Additionally, organizational cultures influence how owners and employees develop their own understanding of right and wrong and therefore influence corporate behaviour. Lastly, Wherry creatively reinterprets Ezra Zuckerman’s research through the lens of Erving Goffman by arguing that how economically significant interpersonal encounters unfold over time is based in large part on the categorical systems available in society.</p>
<p>The next chapter further advances the strong cultural programme by building on the influential work of Viviana Zelizer and Michèle Lamont. Here, Wherry examines how individuals, households, firms and nation states use money and prices to build symbolic boundaries between themselves and others, or use money and prices to affirm, modify or dissolve the relationships they believe themselves to be in with one another.</p>
<p>Chapter Four is particularly useful for describing how one empirically conducts a strong cultural programme in markets. Wherry reviews how image and narrative analysis (hermeneutics), historical methods and ethnography can be used to analyse the autonomous role of culture in markets. Unfortunately, this chapter suggests by omission and rhetoric that cultural analysis is necessarily qualitative research. Fortunately, other portions of the book draw forceful conclusions from quantitative analyses (e.g. by Zuckerman and Joel Podolny).</p>
<p>The book’s structure works as a literature review, but it unnecessarily clouds Wherry’s advocacy for a strong cultural programme of markets. For example, the strong versus weak cultural programme, as well as the argument’s self-described ‘core assumptions’, are both postponed for the brief conclusion. The book’s original argumentation may have been clearer if the chapters were organized around key ideas by Zelizer, Goffman and Alexander, rather than around concepts foreign to Wherry’s argument – demand, supply and price.</p>
<p>The book would be excellent in the upper level classroom, although this reviewer would also assign readings by Zelizer, Goffman and Alexander to unlock the book’s full potential. In a class where students conduct research or write an analytical literature review, this reviewer would particularly recommend pairing Chapter Four (‘How to Conduct Cultural Analyses of Markets’) with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458018">Wherry’s (2008)</xref> own powerful analysis of how people use prices in their social interactions with one another.</p>
<p>For scholars sceptical of non-material explanations of work and employment, this reviewer would also wholeheartedly recommend the book as a concise and intriguing palliative.</p>
