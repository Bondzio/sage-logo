<abstract>
<p>Synchrotron-based, high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements are used to study the local strain fields underlying the transient fatigue crack growth rate retardation produced by a single overload cycle known as the <italic>overload effect</italic>. Specifically, 4140 steel compact tension specimens fatigued for varying levels of crack growth after an overload cycle have been studied with in-situ diffraction under varying external loads. The load responses of the strain at the overload-position, versus at the crack tip, are focused upon in detail. The large compressive residual strain at the overload-point is observed to remain essentially unchanged even after the overload-point is left in the wake of the propagating crack tip. The differential strain-load response at the crack-tip/overload position before and immediately after the overload is seen to be unchanged. Once the overload point is behind the crack tip, a highly nonlinear behavior is observed in which the load response of the strain field transfers from the overload -point to the crack tip when the load exceeds a critical value. The results are discussed in terms of plasticity-induced crack face contact at the overload point as an important local mechanism contributing to the “overload effect” in this specific system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most models for predicting fatigue crack growth are based upon the local crack tip strain/stress fields, which heretofore have been largely inaccessible experimentally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309324711435197">1</xref></sup> This situation has changed dramatically over the past several years with the evolution of high-energy, synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction microscopic strain mapping techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324711435197">15</xref></sup> One problem that these new techniques can shed new light upon is the “overload effect”, in which a single tensile overload, in an otherwise constant amplitude fatigue experiment, causes a pronounced transient retardation in the rate of crack growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309324711435197">Figure 1(a)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309324711435197">21</xref></sup> In real-world variable amplitude fatigue loading, such overload (OL) events have been shown to play important roles in the lengthening of the fatigue life of structural components. The scientific debate over the detailed mechanics underlying the overload effect has been discussed at length in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309324711435197">21</xref></sup> Two opposing interpretations have arisen in this debate regarding the origin of the overload effect. One view argues that it is entirely due to residual stresses in front of the crack tip;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309324711435197">19</xref></sup> while the other, more customary, view is that it is due to plasticity-induced crack closure behind the crack tip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309324711435197">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309324711435197">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>A recent tour de force, in-situ, synchrotron-diffraction/mechanics-modeling article by Steuwer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> studied the overload effect on thick, fine-grained Al-alloy specimens. This study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> did not, however, produce decisive results on the issue of the importance of behind versus in-front-of crack effects in the overload effect. Croft et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> have reported extensive synchrotron-based energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) measurements on a series of 4140 steel fatigue specimens spanning behavior from prior to, to well after, an overload, including as a function of in-situ loading. This work reported the details of the strain distribution, its load response and evolution with crack growth subsequent to an OL, and also quantitatively addressed some modeling predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309324711435197">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309324711435197">27</xref></sup> This work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> did not, however, directly address the controversy over the origin of the overload effect.</p>
<p>The recent work of Belnoue et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324711435197">15</xref></sup> is very important to this question. They have performed detailed two-dimensional (2D) strain mapping measurements on compact-tension geometry Ti–6Al–4V specimens fatigued beyond an overload to points where the crack growth rate is respectively maximally retarded and fully recovered (to the pre-overload rate). They confirmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324711435197">15</xref></sup> the existence of a compressive strain behind the crack tip in specimens fatigued beyond an overload as well as the disappearance of this compression under in-situ loading. Moreover they used a multivariable least squares fitting analysis to integrate the full 2D strain fields into a linear elastic fracture mechanics model. Belnoue et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309324711435197">15</xref></sup> invoked plasticity induced crack closure as the origin of the behind-crack-tip-compression and its load response.</p>
<p>Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309324711435197">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309324711435197">17</xref></sup> have performed neutron scattering strain field measurements on a 6.35 mm thick, CT-geometry, HASTELLOY C-2000 alloy specimen with in-situ fatigue crack growth spanning an overload cycle. These studies used 2 to 4 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309324711435197">3</xref></sup> gauge volumes for profiling the residual strains in the crack plane; and for determining the load response at 13 load levels at positions in-front-of, at and behind the crack tip. Similar to Croft et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324711435197">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> they observed a load-induced transfer of compressive strain from the “blunting region” (the OL position) to the crack tip. They interpreted this in terms of gradual crack opening under load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309324711435197">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Colombo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309324711435197">28</xref></sup> and Christopher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309324711435197">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309324711435197">30</xref></sup> have performed careful, systematic experiments on fatigue crack photoelasticity on thin, transparent birefringent polycarbonate materials. They have measured pre-overload and post-overload (fatigued beyond the OL point) specimens. Their analysis indicates the key role of crack-face interactions behind the crack tip in contributing to crack growth retardation following overloads, in addition to residual stresses generated ahead of the crack tip. Moreover, they have applied detailed analytical and numerical modeling of their results for a variety of related phenomena.</p>
<p>Steuwer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> have noted that much has been learned from such local strain field studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309324711435197">17</xref></sup> they also aptly noted that significant amounts of synchrotron beam time would be required to decisively elucidate the fundamental micromechanical origins of the overload effect. The general scarcity of high energy X-ray beam time availability demands that a comprehensive picture of the existing synchrotron results, and the full weight of the inferences they motivate, be made very clear. This paper thus focuses on expanding the results and discussion of a nonlinear “load transfer effect” previously described in references.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309324711435197">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> Specifically, it will be emphasized that these results are highly consistent with a microscopic mechanism for the OL effect in which crack face contact at the OL position, when it is behind the crack tip, is important in at least this specific set of experiments.</p>

<title>EDXRD measurements</title>
<p>The EDXRD measurements discussed here were performed at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) on the superconducting wiggler beam line X17-B1. The experimental set-up has been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309324711435197">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> Basically, ‘‘white beam” incident radiation is scattered at a fixed angle 2θ (2θ = 12° in this work). The incident/ diffracted beams are highly collimated, thereby defining the small gauge volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref></sup> The energies, E, of the scattered Bragg peaks are given by E = hc/[2d<italic><sub>hkl</sub></italic> sin(θ)] where d<italic><sub>hkl</sub></italic> is the inter-atomic plane with Miller indices (<italic>hkl</italic>), c is the speed of light, and h is Plank’s constant.</p>
<p>In this work the positional variation of the interatomic spacing (d) of the most intense (321) Bragg line has been used to determine the strain ε = [(d–d<sub>0</sub>)/d<sub>0</sub>] = [(E<sub>0</sub>–E)/E<sub>0</sub>]. The reference d<sub>0</sub> (and E<sub>0</sub>) represent the stress-free lattice spacing (Bragg line energy) and were fixed by the Bragg line position far from the crack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> Similar strain results were also obtained by the Rutgers group by fitting a set of 7–10 Bragg lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref></sup> The use of multiple Bragg lines for strain determination has been used on a number of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324711435197">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> It is important to note that since these X-ray strain measurements probe inter-atomic distances they explicitly render only the elastic component of the strain. The relative strain resolution in these EDXRD measurements is in the 10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−5</sup> range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309324711435197">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309324711435197">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper the coordinate system used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324711435197">Figure 2</xref>) defines the x-direction as the direction of the crack growth, the y-direction as along the tensile stress direction (with y = 0 set at the crack plane) and the z direction as through the 4 mm thickness of the specimen (with z = 0 being the specimen center). In the series of specimens studied x = 0 has been set at the termination of the constant amplitude fatigue crack length or equivalently the position where the overload was applied.</p>

<p>The x–y cross-section of the diffraction/gauge volume was a square of 50–60 µm on a side. The y–z gauge volume (GV) cross-section was an elongated regular parallelogram (50–60 µm) along y and with the z extent being ∼300 µm (see Croft et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309324711435197">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309324711435197">5</xref></sup> for further discussion of the GV). The scattering angle of 2θ = 12° allowed the localization of the GV around the center plane of the specimen. Indeed, detailed strain mapping of the crack plane shows that the GV sampled regions well away from edge effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> and in a locally flat region of the crack front. For future synchrotron experiments it is useful to emphasize that the scattering angle of 2θ = 12° in the present work is particularly large for EDXRD measurements, leading to a better localization of the GV in the beam (z) direction. This is important because any uniform slope/curvature or local jaggedness in the crack front can lead to a spatial averaging and degradation of the crack tip strain features. In systems where the spatial extent of the OL compression region (see below) is small, such averaging over crack front excursions out of the GV could render it unobservable.</p>
<p>The scattering vector, in this case, was inclined at only 6° with respect to the y-direction, yielding, to an excellent approximation, the ε<sub>yy</sub> strain component. Despite the tri-axial character of the stresses in these systems it will be assumed, for interpretation purposes here, that the behavior of the strains ε<sub>yy</sub> and Δε<sub>yy</sub> can be used as indicators of the behavior of the stresses σ<sub>yy</sub> and Δσ<sub>yy</sub>. Indeed excellent agreement in many aspects of the results with the multi strain component and derived stress variations of Steuwer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> provides strong motivation for the utility of this assumption.</p>
<p>Strain measurements of the CT specimens under in-situ loading, were performed using a fixture constructed to open the crack mouths by using a jack screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309324711435197">7</xref></sup> The load at the screw pivot point was measured by a digital transducer techniques load monitor thereby allowing the calculation of tensile load, F, at the pins of the CT specimen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309324711435197">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

Despite the very large residual compressive strain, ε<sub>yy</sub>(F = 0), it should be noted that the overall strain response after the overload, is essentially the same as before the overload. This is not entirely surprising since the plastic deformation has displaced the starting point deep into the compressive side of the stress–strain curve and the linear elastic response would be expected to span approximately twice the yield stress. Moreover, the fact that the crack growth rate immediately after the overload, is unchanged is also remarkably well correlated with the unchanged Δε<sub>yy</sub>(F) curve (as discussed below).</p>

<p>The Δε<sub>yy</sub>(F) response at the tip position also shows a linear response between F = 0 and F = 0.5 F<sub>max</sub>; however, this response is much less than that at the OL position. Thus the initial strain response is dominantly at the OL position. An increase in the slope of the tip response curve occurs between F = 0.5 F<sub>max</sub> and F = 0.75 F<sub>max</sub>, with a still greater increase between F = 0.75 F<sub>max</sub> and F = F<sub>max</sub>. Indeed the slope of the tip response between F = 0.75 F<sub>max</sub> and F = F<sub>max</sub> is essentially the same as that of the OL response at low load.

<p>Using an interpolation fit to all of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(a)</xref> allows the construction of such an experimental response-function covering the intervals indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(a)</xref>; 1 [0 &lt; F &lt; 0.25 F<sub>max</sub>], 2 [0.25 F<sub>max</sub> &lt; F&lt; 0.5 F<sub>max</sub>], 3 [0.5 F<sub>max</sub> &lt; F &lt; 0.75 F<sub>max</sub>] and 4 [0.75 F<sub>max</sub> &lt; F &lt; F<sub>max</sub>]. The resulting response function, χ, curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(b)</xref>. Evaluation of these χ(x,f) at the OL position (x = 0) and the tip position x∼0.4 recovers the slope of the Δε<sub>yy</sub>(F) curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324711435197">Figure 3(b)</xref>. In general however such response function curves contain much greater information on the spatial extent of the strain response to load all along the crack plane.</p>
<p>The χ(x,f) curves for the intervals 1–4 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(b)</xref>. Over intervals 1 and 2 the response function is sharply peaked at the OL-position, while being low and constant in the region of the crack tip. A small shift in the x-coordinate of the χ OL-peak, toward the tip, between interval 1 and 2 is also noticeable. Over interval 3, the χ becomes distinctly bimodal with a degraded peak near the OL position and a new peak arising near the crack tip position. This dramatically indicates the onset of the OL-to-tip load response transfer process. Interestingly (as addressed in the discussion section) the x-position of the OL peak is shifted noticeably toward the tip in interval 3. Over interval 4 the χ at the OL position has been totally suppressed and a robust peak has emerged at the crack tip position. The response function curves provide a very tangible illustration of the transfer of strain response from the overload position to the crack tip position above the critical load.</p>
<p>In general a theoretically or experimentally (with smaller F intervals) defined response function (or susceptibility), χ, could be used to predict the strain change between any two loads f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> via</p>

<p>As demonstrated earlier only when F &gt; F<sub>c</sub> does the crack tip strain respond and thus only when F &gt; F<sub>c</sub> should the cyclic damage (crack growth driving force) be operative. Consequently the normalized differential force ΔF/F<sub>max</sub> = 1− F<sub>c</sub>/F<sub>max</sub> should provide a measure of the effective cyclic applied force which is active in crack propagation. Despite there only being three x-points and despite the modest number of loads used to determine F<sub>c</sub>, the plot of ΔF/F<sub>max</sub> (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324711435197">Figure 7</xref>) is well correlated with the crack growth rate curve.</p>
<p>The total cyclic variation in the strain Δε<sub>yy</sub> at the crack tip can provide a microscopic measure of the cyclic crack growth driving force. The normalized strain difference (at the crack tip) Δε<sub>yy</sub>(norm)  =  [ε<sub>yy</sub>(F = F<sub>max</sub>,x )−ε<sub>yy</sub>(F = 0,x)]/ Δε<sub>yy</sub>(before OL) is plotted on the left scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324711435197">Figure 7</xref>. Here the normalization factor Δε<sub>yy</sub>(before OL)  =  [ε<sub>yy</sub>(F = F<sub>max</sub>,x = 0)−ε<sub>yy</sub>(F = 0,x = 0)] is the crack tip strain difference before the OL. Again the correlation between Δε<sub>yy</sub>(norm) and the crack growth rate curve is good. These results underscore the importance of the magnitude of the effective differential variation of the stress at the crack tip in driving crack growth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of the above results is the highly nonlinear elastic response at the OL-position when it is behind the crack tip. Specifically, the strain response at the OL-position is elastic up until a critical load F<sub>c</sub>, above which it saturates at a load independent value. That this OL-position effect is intimately associated with the OL crack growth retardation is empirically clear from the simultaneous crossover from strong-suppression to sharp-enhancement of the response at the crack tip at precisely the same F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p>Although much more sophisticated modeling is called for in the future, these results motivate an immediate and straightforward interpretation. This interpretation is based upon the fact that two surfaces in physical contact, and under compression, exert a normal force, N<sub>s</sub>, upon one another that will exhibit linear elastic response as long as there is surface contact. This normal force will naturally transmit a compressive elastic strain field in the subsurface material. When contact between the surfaces is lost (i.e. N<sub>s</sub>→0) the elastic response ceases and saturates at a constant value. The discussion below is motivated by the microscopic strain data and not by any pre-existing models. Nevertheless, it is emphasized that the simplified interpretation presented here has been proposed as part of more sophisticated modeling in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309324711435197">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309324711435197">25</xref></sup></p>

Upon application of the F<sub>OL</sub> this ligament undergoes strong elasto-plastic elongation under the tensile overload, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figure 8(b)</xref>. At the peak of the overload (F = F<sub>OL</sub>) strong plastic deformation renders this ligament permanently elongated with respect to its pre-overload length. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324711435197">Figure 3</xref> the loss of the response in the elastic-ε<sub>yy</sub> (as measured by diffraction) between F = F<sub>max</sub> and F = F<sub>OL</sub> clearly reflects this plasticity.</p>

<p>Unloading the specimen to F = 0, i.e. from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figure 8(b)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">8(c)</xref>, yields an elastic shrinkage of this ligament. The transverse ligament Poisson-bulging (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figure 8(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">8(d)</xref>) ignores the asymmetry at the crack tip; however, this effect is assumed here to be second order for simplified illustrative purposes. Moreover, as the OL position is left behind by the propagating crack tip this asymmetry becomes smaller. Upon unloading to F=0 this tensile-induced plastic elongation is retained, so that the ligament is now too long to “fit” into the previous volume it occupied. Thus the OL-ligament feels a compressive misfit elastic force (F<sub>el</sub> in figure) from the surrounding material and exerts a Newtonian elastic reaction compressive stress field on its surroundings.</p>
<p>The existence of this post-overload elastic stress field at F = 0 is clear from the sharp compressive peaks in ε<sub>yy</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0309324711435197">Figure 4</xref>. In the literature this OL-feature is often referred as the process or reverse plastic zone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309324711435197">14</xref></sup> The response of this OL-feature under tensile loading immediately after the OL, is linear elastic with the same slope as the crack tip response before the OL as seen in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309324711435197">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>After the fatigue crack has grown entirely through the now fractured, OL-ligament, the misfit ligament created by the OL is still elongated with respect to the surrounding material. Therefore the crack face ends of the elongated OL-ligament, albeit fractured into two parts, exert similar compressive stresses in the interaction with the surrounding medium, as illustrated (d) in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figure 8</xref> schematic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324711435197">6</xref> illustrate this effect by the persistence of a essentially unchanged OL-feature (at F = 0) behind the crack tip in the <italic>max-ret</italic> and <italic>50%-ret</italic> specimens.</p>
<p>Applying a varying external load F to the fractured, elongated, OL-ligament, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">Figure 9</xref> shows a schematic of the load response of the fractured-OL-ligament behind the crack tip as in (d) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figure 8</xref>. For F = 0 (far left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">Figure 9</xref>) the OL ligament feels a compression due to the normal, crack face contact force (N<sub>s</sub>) and the elastic force, F<sub>el</sub>, of the surrounding medium (as discussed above). Here N<sub>s</sub> = F<sub>el</sub> is required for equilibrium. As long as contact between the two fractured ligament pieces persists the normal force remains finite. The normal force communicates the compressive stress between the two separate OL-ligament portions as effectively as if they were still attached. As the external tensile force is increased however, the compression is relaxed, and F<sub>el</sub> (and N<sub>s</sub>) are reduced (see center schematic in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">Figure 9</xref>). At a critical external, F<sub>c</sub>, when the compressed OL ligament is fully relaxed, N<sub>s</sub> (along with F<sub>el</sub>) first becomes 0. For all external loads F &gt; F<sub>c</sub>, N<sub>s</sub> = F<sub>el</sub> = 0 since the OL ligament pieces are no longer in contact as indicated in the schematic on the far right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<p>The reaction force to F<sub>el</sub> creates a long range compressive stress field in the surrounding medium. The work done by the varying tensile load goes into decreasing the elastic stress of the surrounding medium, the normal crack face contact force, and the elastic extension of the OL ligament. This work is diverted from creating stress and doing fatigue damage at the crack tip. Once F &gt; F<sub>c</sub> subsequent tensile loading is free to induce a tensile tip stress, σ<sub>tip</sub> (as indicated in the far right schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">Figure 9</xref>). There was of course some residual and low load stress at the tip below F<sub>c</sub> also.</p>
<p>The clearest example of this behavior in the data is in the <italic>50%-ret</italic> specimen results, where a dramatically clear F<sub>c</sub>-type behavior is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0309324711435197">Figure 6</xref>. For F &lt; F<sub>c</sub>, while the crack faces are in contact, a linear elastic strain response at the OL position, precisely equal to the pre- and post-OL tip response, is seen. Concomitantly very little response at the crack tip position is seen. For F &gt; F<sub>c</sub>, when the crack faces are not in contact: a saturated strain response with no load coupled change is seen at the OL position; and the strain response at the crack tip position is large with an elastic slope essentially the same as the pre- and post-OL tip response.</p>
<p>In the <italic>max-ret</italic> specimen case the OL- and crack-tip- positions are somewhat less resolved. Nevertheless, a similar F<sub>c</sub>-type behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5</xref>) is seen. Indeed, strong peaks in the strain load response susceptibility function illustrate the OL to tip load-response transfer in detail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>The modest shift of the OL position response function (χ) peak toward the crack tip with increasing load was noted in the discussion of the max ret results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0309324711435197">Figure 5(b)</xref>. Such a shift would be consistent with the expected opening of the crack faces moving from the specimen notch toward the crack tip with increasing tensile load, F. Thus for an OL-ligament of finite width, the loss of crack face contact would be expected to move toward the crack tip with increasing load in the vicinity of F<sub>c</sub>, as observed. This expectation should be verified in more detailed studies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0309324711435197">Figure 10</xref> shows a contour plot of the residual (F = 0) ε<sub>yy</sub>-strain in the plane spanning the region above and below the y = 0, crack plane for the <italic>max-ret</italic> specimen. Two features illustrated by this contour plot should be noted: the massive (in magnitude and spatial extent) compressive strain field at the OL-point now behind the crack tip; and the small island of tensile strain at the crack tip position. The massive OL-point compression, behind the crack tip, is consistent with the crack face contact at the plastically deformed OL feature position as discussed earlier.</p>

<p>It has been argued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309324711435197">19</xref></sup> that plasticity associated with crack tip processes always opens the crack rather than closing it. It would follow therefore that the crack face contact proposed here would be expected to contribute a tensile residual stress/strain at the crack tip. Thus the island of tensile strain at the crack tip, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0309324711435197">Figure 10</xref>, is also consistent with the presence of crack face contact at the OL-point behind the crack tip. As seen above however, the diversion of the strain response to the OL position appears to underlay the crack growth retardation for F &lt; F<sub>c</sub>. Thus while the small residual tensile strain feature at the crack tip appears to underscore the consistency of the crack face contact at the OL-point, the very low response to load of this feature, for F &lt; F<sub>c</sub>, implies its lack of relevance for driving crack growth in this regime.</p>
<p>Thus the residual and highly nonlinear load induced strain responses are all qualitatively consistent with the simple schematic/interpretation illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0309324711435197">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0309324711435197">9</xref>. Indeed, in the authors’ opinion, it is difficult to image another self-consistent, alternative explanation that can account for all of the observations. In the past, other authors have proposed sophisticated and detailed models involving such plasticity-induced crack face contact. They did so moreover with in the absence of such persuasive microscopic data as presented here. Elber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309324711435197">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309324711435197">22</xref></sup> proposed OL-plasticity-induced crack face contact and McClung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309324711435197">25</xref></sup> reviewed the concept. Fleck and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309324711435197">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309324711435197">24</xref></sup> presented extremely similar arguments based upon OL plasticity-induced humps along the crack face coming into and losing contact behind the crack tip. Interestingly, the recent OL-effect finite element analysis of Pommier et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309324711435197">20</xref></sup> invoked node points released behind the crack tip which were modeled by nonlinear springs with high stiffness in compression and null in tension. This is of course precisely the elastic behavior at the OL-position used in the interpretation presented here. There have been several interesting works by Kujawski<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309324711435197">31</xref></sup> and Stoychev and Kujaswki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309324711435197">32</xref></sup> taking a fresh look at overload retardation phenomena contrasting the customary approach of analyzing these effects in terms of a single “effective” stress intensity parameter, ΔK<sub>eff</sub>; versus a two-parameter approach requiring both a cyclic, ΔK, and maximum, K<sub>max</sub>, driving forces. Their arguments are particularly clear that a single-parameter approach is necessarily incomplete in describing overload effects. In fact, Colombo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309324711435197">28</xref></sup> and Christopher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309324711435197">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309324711435197">30</xref></sup> in the work cited in the Introduction, likewise have suggested clear argument that several stress intensity factors are needed to correctly describe overload effects, although their approach is quite different from that of Kujawski. It is beyond the scope of the current paper to address all of the subtle issues surrounding various two-parameter models versus more customary approaches. The present authors’ results do show that, on the local crack tip level, both the maximum elastic strain and strain range are affected by the overload. On the other hand, the correlation of the Δε<sub>yy</sub> dependence with the crack growth rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0309324711435197">Figure 7</xref> is suggestive that Δε<sub>yy</sub>, not the peak strain, is the dominant driver. A much higher density of local strain data, as a function of crack growth beyond the OL, is clearly required to resolve the relative importance of peak strain versus strain range in the two-parameter models.</p>
<p>An issue that remains unresolved by the authors’ current work is the effect of stress components σ<sub>xx</sub>, on the phenomenon described above. In preliminary studies by the authors’ group, the measured ϵ<sub>xx</sub> strain is dominantly compressive at the OL point behind the crack tip. A smaller Poisson effect tensile anomaly in the ϵ<sub>xx</sub> component is superimposed on the compressive effect. This superposition is, however, quite dependent on the distance from the crack plane. This would be expected due to the differing boundary conditions on portions of the OL ligament protruding above versus below the crack face. Due to the large amount of synchrotron beam time required for proper systematic studies, the present authors’ results are not sufficient to expand on this subject at present. Future scattering experiments should include equally detailed mapping studies of the ϵ<sub>xx</sub> strain component parallel to the crack propagation direction. Also needed are experimental studies accessing the third strain component, ϵ<sub>zz</sub>, high-resolution studies in this direction will be more difficult due to the elongation of the gauge volume and the thickness of the material in the z-direction.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Detailed strain field profiling, under in-situ loading, of a sequence of specimens with an overload embedded in their fatigue history have been presented. An interpretation has been proposed whereby the key strain field features and nonlinear responses to external loading can be heuristically understood via a simple interpretation. The interpretation involves the following.</p>
<list id="list1-0309324711435197" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>The creation of an OL-induced plastically dilated ligament at the crack tip.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The misfit of this dilated OL-ligament in the specimen at zero external load leading to a robust compressive elastic strain field.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The persistence of the OL-misfit and its compressive strain field even after the fractured OL-ligament is left well behind in the wake of the propagating crack tip. The presence of a normal force between the fractured, but contacting, surfaces supports the compression (but not tension).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The linear elastic relaxation of the OL-compression (behind the crack tip) by external tensile loading up until a critical load, F<sub>c</sub>, while the fractured portions of the OL ligament are in contact. Here the crack tip load response is suppressed by the diversion of the work done to the OL ligament for F &lt; F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The termination of the OL ligament response when the OL ligaments loose contact and the concomitant transfer of load-induced elastic response to the tip position for F &gt; F<sub>c</sub>.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In view of the many model variations of crack face interactions and the debate surrounding them, the authors wish to circumscribe the interpretation here to the specific materials and conditions studied. Nevertheless the data presented appears to heavily support the importance of the role of crack face contact behind the crack tip in the overload crack growth retardation effect in this particular system. Future in-situ synchrotron experimental work on a single specimen fatigued and overloaded in-situ at a higher density of fatigue crack lengths beyond the OL are most definitely called for to verify and elucidate the effects reported here. Future modeling of other systems or conditions should be based upon similar microscopic experimental strain field mapping/profiling studies.</p>
<p>More important than the particular microscopic interpretation proposed here is the fact that detailed, local strain field measurements motivated the bottom up interpretation. The expanded availability of short length scale synchrotron based strain profiling offers the opportunity for a paradigm change in understanding the mechanical properties of materials. In some cases the local strain fields can be used to check the assumptions in existing theoretical modeling at the local level. Indeed, as emphasized above, the OL effect interpretation invoked here was not new but has been proposed by investigators with deeper insight, but less direct/local data, in the past. In cases like the OL-effect the local strain field mapping can provide a detailed picture so that appropriate underlying mechanisms and quantitative model modifications can be supported, or challenged, from the bottom up.</p>
