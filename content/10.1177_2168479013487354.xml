The first is to assess the outcomes of a therapy in independent clinical studies and measure whether effects are similar. If similar effects are seen across several different clinical studies, a meta-analysis allows for determination of a net effect for the given therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013487354">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013487354">2</xref></sup> Second, if a difference exists between outcomes in clinical studies, a meta-analysis can examine factors that can attribute to such differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013487354">1</xref></sup> While many investigators view meta-analyses and systematic reviews as the means for obtaining the highest level of evidence (level 1 evidence),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013487354">3</xref></sup> the quality of the meta-analysis is only as strong as the quality of the included clinical studies.</p><p>The steps in performing a meta-analysis include formulating a hypothesis and identifying pertinent study outcomes; performing a literature search to identify pertinent studies; assessing studies for quality and inclusion/exclusion criteria; collecting data, including adjusting for missing data; and analyzing and reporting any relevant data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013487354">4</xref></sup> A challenging issue for researchers performing a meta-analysis is identifying which studies to include. This includes selecting databases to be searched, formulating the search strategy to acquire the relevant and eligible studies, and determining criteria for inclusion and exclusion of trials relevant to the purpose of the meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013487354">2</xref></sup></p><p>Because well-conducted meta-analyses should summarize and appraise clinical evidence objectively and are routinely used to shape clinical practice, it is critical that these studies be evaluated. It has been recommended that to identify relevant studies to ensure a high-quality meta-analysis, search strategies should be carefully designed to comprise a combination of subject terms selected from controlled vocabulary or thesaurus (eg, medical subject headings [MeSH] and the Emtree thesaurus) with a wide range of text words.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013487354">5</xref></sup> There are published studies assessing the quality of meta-analyses in psychiatry, orthopedics, and critical care. According to the authors, the overall scientific quality of meta-analyses evaluating the treatment of anxiety disorders was classified as “fair”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013487354">6</xref></sup> and those evaluating major depressive disorders as “marginally acceptable.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013487354">7</xref></sup> Similarly, more than half of meta-analyses on orthopedic surgery and two-thirds of meta-analyses published in the critical care literature had methodological flaws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013487354">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013487354">9</xref></sup> However, these papers did not specifically investigate the search strategy used to identify studies for inclusion. </p><p>Even though previous authors have reported methodological flaws in meta-analyses, this study design is still used routinely to guide patient care decisions. Thus, the current study evaluated search strategy methods used in meta-analyses that evaluated drug therapy with cardiovascular effects and were published over a 5-year period.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013487354" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Meta-analyses published between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011, were identified from a PubMed/Medline search using the MeSH headings “cardiovascular agents” and “drug therapy.” The search was limited to studies that used the meta-analysis design, were conducted in humans, and were reported in the English language. Only studies assessing drug therapy of cardiovascular agents were included. Articles that evaluated medical equipment, devices, or point of care testing were excluded. Studies evaluating alternative medications, regardless of the cardiovascular effects, and systematic reviews that did not use meta-analytical methods were also excluded.</p><p>The abstract of each article identified through the Medline search was reviewed to determine whether the study used the meta-analysis design and to confirm that drug therapy of cardiovascular agents was evaluated. Data were extracted on the full-text version of the article to determine the number of databases used to identify trials for inclusion, database used (eg, Embase, Medline, clinicaltrials.gov), search method, use of key words versus MeSH terms, positive or negative study outcome, and category of clinical trial included. Data were also gathered to determine whether published meta-analyses used an assessment tool (eg, Jadad scale) to assess the quality of included studies. Impact factors for 2010 were obtained from the Journal Citation Report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013487354">10</xref></sup></p><p>The data were stored in electronic tables. The software program SAS 9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, North Carolina) was used for data and statistical analyses. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between the use of 3 or more databases and other measures of quality such as specification of the search terms. Linear regression was used to determine whether the journal’s impact factor correlated with the number of databases searched.

Researchers may not have had access to all available databases or did not report the use of a certain database in the methods section. However, this may also be an indicator that investigators did not exhaust all available relevant resources to identify studies for inclusion. Some studies (14.6%) failed to report database search terms, making the assessment of the quality of the meta-analysis difficult.</p><p>Conducting a thorough search of appropriate bibliographic databases or resources was one of the indicators of a higher quality meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013487354">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479013487354">11</xref></sup> Full reporting of Medline subject search strategy lays an important foundation for selecting articles for inclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013487354">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013487354">12</xref></sup> Searching 3 or more databases was significantly associated with reporting the use of search terms (eg, MeSH terms in Medline) and using a quality assessment for included trials. It is important to use all available and related bibliographic databases when performing a literature search for a meta-analysis, because not all publications are indexed in 1 database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479013487354">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2168479013487354"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2168479013487354">15</xref></sup> By increasing the number of resources searched, authors can conduct a more comprehensive search of the literature, and this increases the likelihood of identifying all potential studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The use of search terms for a literature search will identify articles that are relevant to a topic, including articles that may use varying terms to describe the same concept.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479013487354">11</xref></sup> The use of search terms also increases the quality of the literature search because a controlled vocabulary thesaurus is used to index articles. For example, MeSH is the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM’s) controlled vocabulary thesaurus and is used by NLM to index PubMed articles. In addition to assessing the quality of search strategy, one should evaluate for appropriate study design, patient population, statistical analysis, and an adequate power; these parameters will help the investigator to identify only the highest quality studies. Evaluating the quality of the trials increases the likelihood that a robust meta-analysis will be published. </p><p>Our search was restricted to meta-analyses evaluating cardiovascular drugs. Several studies that evaluated therapy of glaucoma medications were included because of the cardiovascular pharmacologic mechanism of action. Since we only evaluated cardiovascular drug therapy, our results may not be extrapolated to meta-analyses focused on other therapeutic areas. In addition, our search was limited to those journals indexed in the PubMed database. Thus, we could have missed cardiovascular drug therapy meta-analyses that were published in journals not indexed in the Medline/PubMed database. However, we believe that most relevant publications were included since PubMed/Medline is the NLM’s premier bibliographic database focusing on health science literature and is most frequently used by US investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2168479013487354">16</xref></sup></p><p>We believe that our results have relevance. Cardiovascular disease is one of the predominant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2168479013487354">17</xref></sup> In addition, cardiovascular drugs are one of the top prescription medications used in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2168479013487354">18</xref></sup> No other study has specifically evaluated search strategies used to identify relevant trials for inclusion, and having well-designed meta-analyses is imperative to practicing evidence-based medicine, especially for the treatment of a disease with high prevalence, such as cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013487354"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Meta-analyses are increasingly relied upon for clinical practice. Interestingly, studies using meta-analytic methods are published more frequently in journals that have lower impact factor. Although the majority of authors of meta-analyses search multiple databases and use appropriate search strategies, more than one-quarter of meta-analyses could be missing relevant clinical trials because the authors searched only a single database. The methods of meta-analysis are just as important as the results and affect the usefulness of a meta-analysis in patient care decisions.
