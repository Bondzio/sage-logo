<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The outcome of rotator cuff repair correlates with tendon healing. Early studies of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair demonstrate lower healing rates than traditional open techniques. Transosseous-equivalent repair techniques (suture bridge) were developed to improve the initial fixation strength.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To compare the initial in vitro tensile fixation strength of a transosseous-equivalent suture bridge (TOE-SB) rotator cuff repair construct to a traditional transosseous (TO) suture construct.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Identical simulated rotator cuff tears were created on 8 matched pairs of humeri. Each matched pair underwent repair with 4 sutures using either the TOE-SB or TO technique. Initial fixation strength was tested in a custom testing jig. Each shoulder underwent 1000 cycles each of low and then high load testing. Gap displacement was measured at anterior and posterior sites of the repair with digital video tracking of paired reflective markers and recorded at predetermined cycle intervals.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no statistically significant differences in gap formation at the repair sites under low or high load conditions between TOE-SB and TO techniques. The mean maximal gap formation of the repairs during low load testing in the TOE-SB and TO constructs was 0.93 ± 0.88 mm and 0.55 ± 0.22 mm, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .505). The mean maximal gap formation during high load testing in the TOE-SB and TO constructs was 2.04 ± 1.10 mm and 2.28 ± 1.62 mm, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .517). The most significant increase in gap distance occurred at the transition from low load to high load in both constructs. Most of the incremental displacement occurred within the first 100 cycles for both high and low load testing (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The arthroscopic TOE-SB technique is comparable in initial fixation strength to the traditional TO simple suture repair technique.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> Arthroscopic techniques can achieve initial fixation strength comparable with traditional TO techniques performed without suture anchors.</p>

<p>The outcome of rotator cuff repair is in part dependent upon the extent of tendon-to-bone healing. A number of studies report a positive correlation between tendon healing and functional outcome. Harryman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511426071">19</xref></sup> were the first to report that function and range of motion were better in patients who had healed and intact rotator cuff repairs. Zumstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546511426071">44</xref></sup> reported that patients with intact repairs of massive rotator cuff repairs had significantly better outcomes at both 3 and 9 years compared with patients with failed repairs. Several other studies also support this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511426071">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426071">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511426071">24</xref></sup> Many studies have shown that tendon-to-bone healing can be affected by mechanical factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511426071">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511426071">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511426071">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511426071">43</xref></sup> Therefore, the technical goals of rotator cuff repair are to minimize gap formation and maintain repair stability, which presumably optimizes tendon-bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511426071">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of studies have shown superior biomechanical characteristics of double-row compared with single-row rotator cuff repair techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546511426071">‡</xref></sup> Yet, much controversy remains about the influence of technique on healing in vivo. Nho et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511426071">28</xref></sup> showed no difference between healing in single-row and double-row techniques. In contrast, Duquin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511426071">12</xref></sup> demonstrated superior healing in rotator cuff tears repaired with double-row compared with single-row techniques.</p>
<p>Over the past 3 decades, the technique of rotator cuff repair has evolved from open to mini-open to all-arthroscopic repairs. In 1944, McLaughlin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511426071">27</xref></sup> described a transosseous rotator cuff repair technique. In the 1990s, the transosseous suture technique was considered the standard of care, and studies suggested that the initial fixation strength could be optimized by exiting the sutures at least 10 mm lateral to the greater tuberosity and tying them over a 10-mm bone bridge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511426071">9</xref></sup> Transosseous sutures were used in open and mini-open rotator cuff repairs. Gerber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511426071">16</xref></sup> showed that larger suture and Mason-Allen stitches improved the mechanical properties of rotator cuff repairs. More recently, advances in surgical techniques and equipment allowed surgeons to perform arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. Initial arthroscopic repairs were performed with single rows of suture anchors and simple suturing techniques. Some studies suggested that the transosseous technique had less tendon interface motion at the footprint compared with suture anchors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511426071">1</xref></sup> Consequently, concerns over repair failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511426071">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511426071">14</xref></sup> led to the development of double-row techniques and more complex suturing patterns, including attempts to re-create the original transosseous repair.</p>
<p>Traditional double-row suture anchor repair utilizes separate sutures from medial and lateral anchors that are tied to fix the tendon. The arthroscopic transosseous-equivalent suture bridge (TOE-SB) technique was developed to maximize tendon-to-bone compression by bridging the medial suture limbs to lateral suture anchors. This results in compression of the tendon onto the rotator cuff footprint. In vitro biomechanical studies demonstrated that the transosseous technique provides more contact and greater pressure over a defined footprint relative to suture anchors alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511426071">29</xref></sup> Similarly, TOE-SB repair provides significantly more contact area and pressure over a repaired rotator cuff footprint than a double-row suture anchor repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511426071">32</xref></sup> Rotator cuff integrity after arthroscopic TOE-SB repair has recently been reported to be as high as 88% at 1 year after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511426071">13</xref></sup> We are not aware of a study that compares the strength of the traditional open transosseous technique with the TOE-SB technique.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the initial in vitro tensile fixation strength of a TOE-SB rotator cuff repair construct to a traditional transosseous (TO) suture construct. Our hypothesis was that a TOE-SB repair would exhibit greater repair gapping when compared with a TO construct under low and high load conditions.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Eight matched pairs (16 shoulders) of fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders, obtained from 8 donors, were used in this study. The mean age of the specimens was 53 ± 9 years (range, 34-63 years). Six of the 8 were men. All of the shoulders had grossly intact rotator cuffs to visual inspection. None of the specimens had notable glenohumeral arthritis. The specimens were maintained at −20°C until approximately 12 hours before creation of the rotator cuff tear, repair, and mechanical testing. The humeri were cut proximal to the epicondyles. All soft tissue except for the subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatous tendons and muscles was removed from the specimens. The prepared humeri were potted in a polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe, measuring 25 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter, with Smooth Cast 300 (Smooth-On, Easton, Pennsylvania).</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511426071">
<title>Rotator Cuff Repair</title>
<p>A crescent-shaped rotator cuff tear measuring 3 cm in length (anterior-posterior) and 1 cm in width (medial-lateral) was created with a No. 10 blade scalpel using a custom-designed template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511426071">Figure 1</xref>) similar to that reported by Smith et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511426071">37</xref></sup> All of the tears were produced from anterior to posterior, starting at the rotator cuff interval and extending along the greater tuberosity into the infraspinatous tendon. Care was taken to avoid disrupting the transverse humeral ligament and violating the intertuburcular groove. A curette was then used to prepare the footprint. The shoulders from each cadaveric specimen were assigned by a coin toss to 1 of the 2 repair techniques. One specimen in each pair was repaired using a TOE-SB construct as described by Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511426071">30</xref></sup> The contralateral shoulder was repaired using a TO suture construct.</p>

<p>The TOE-SB technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511426071">Figure 2</xref>) was performed using 5.5-mm metal suture anchors (Corkscrew FT II, Arthrex, Naples, Florida) and 4.5-mm PEEK PushLock (Arthrex) devices. Two medial anchors were placed just lateral to the articular surface of the humerus, from anterior to posterior, separated by 10 mm of bone. Each suture anchor contained 2 strands of No. 2 braided Fiberwire (Arthrex). Both limbs of each suture strand were passed antegrade from the undersurface of the rotator cuff tendon using a tapered Mayo needle, 10 mm from the free edge of the tendon, resulting in a horizontal mattress configuration. All 4 sutures were tied using an arthroscopic knot tier, from anterior to posterior, using a slipknot followed by 3 alternating half-hitches. Lateral fixation was accomplished using two 4.5-mm PEEK PushLock devices (Arthrex). One limb from each of the first (most anterior) and third knots was brought over the top of the repair and fixed into the greater tuberosity 10 mm inferior to the most lateral aspect of the rotator cuff footprint, directly in line with the medial anchors.</p>

<p>A 4-suture TO tunnel construct was utilized to simulate a traditional open repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511426071">Figure 3</xref>). The repair was performed with 2 transosseous tunnels and 4 simple sutures. Bone tunnels were created with a 1.5-mm drill bit and a tapered No. 3 Mayo needle. The medial aspects of the tunnels were separated by 10 mm of bone and positioned 10 mm from the anterior and posterior edges of the tear, just lateral to the articular surface of the humeral head. The lateral aspects of the tunnels were separated by 10 mm of bone and placed 10 mm inferior to the most lateral aspect of the rotator cuff footprint, equivalent to the position of the PushLock anchors (Arthrex) in the TOE-SB repair. Two strands of No. 2 braided Fiberwire (Arthrex) were passed through each tunnel using a tapered Mayo needle. One limb of each strand of suture was passed through the rotator cuff tendon approximately 10 mm from the free edge of the tendon with the tapered Mayo needle and then tied to the other end of the same suture, creating a vertically oriented construct. All sutures were tied with an arthroscopic knot pusher from anterior to posterior, using a slipknot followed by 3 alternating half-hitches. The knots were placed medially on the surface of the rotator cuff.</p>

<title>Biomechanical Testing</title>
<p>Biomechanical testing of the specimens was performed with the model previously described by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511426071">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511426071">40</xref></sup> Briefly, this is a static testing model in which the humerus is potted and the 4 rotator cuff tendons attached to pneumatic actuators to simulate the action of the rotator cuff muscle tendon units. The subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus tendons were attached individually to 2.5-cm-wide nylon straps as described by Goradia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511426071">17</xref></sup> The potted humerus was placed in a custom-designed testing jig as previously described by Tashjian et al (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511426071">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511426071">39</xref></sup> Each tendon was attached to an independent pneumatic actuator by coupling the nylon straps to the end of the actuator. The pneumatic actuators are oriented along the directions of pull for each individual rotator cuff tendon as though the arm was positioned in 90° of scapular plane elevation and neutral rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511426071">41</xref></sup> Because arm abduction approximates a 2:1 ratio of glenohumeral motion to scapulothoracic motion, the humerus was positioned at 60° to the “glenoid” of the testing apparatus, representing 60° of scapular plane elevation. This position was selected because it is the position that produces peak muscle forces during elevation of the normal shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511426071">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>Two cyclic loading conditions were tested for each shoulder. A “low load” condition simulated normal physiological forces. This was followed by a “high load” condition, which reproduced excessive physiological forces. For the low load condition, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons were loaded simultaneously to peak values of 45 N, 79 N, and 109 N,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426071">20</xref></sup> respectively, for 1000 cycles at a frequency of 1.5 Hz. After completion of the low load cycle, the actuators were stopped for less than 2 minutes, while the armature loads were reconfigured to set up the high load condition for an additional 1000 cycles. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons were loaded simultaneously to peak values of 117 N, 205 N, and 283 N, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426071">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Performance of the rotator cuff repair techniques was quantified by measuring gap formation at the repair site. Repair gapping was monitored using digital video tracking of paired reflective markers placed on each side of the tear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511426071">40</xref></sup> Two pairs of markers were positioned along the length of the rotator cuff repair without overlapping the edge of the repair or the sutures. One pair of markers was placed on the anterior 50% of the repair, and a second pair was placed on the posterior 50% of the repair, in as even a distribution as possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511426071">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Maximum displacement was recorded during a 10-cycle segment at the following cycle intervals: 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 91 to 100, 191 to 200, 291 to 300, 391 to 400, 491 to 500, 741 to 750, and 991 to 1000 during the 1000-cycle low load period. Maximum displacement was similarly measured during the 1000 high load period. A custom code in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts) was used to calculate displacement distance between marker pairs. Mean maximal gapping was calculated for each treatment group at each of the above cycle intervals. Failure was defined prospectively as gap formation of at least 5 mm based upon published work by Burkhart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511426071">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Gap distance comparisons were made between constructs (TOE-SB vs TO) and between location sites along the repair (anterior vs posterior) after completion of the low load and high load conditions by the use of 2-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. The combined maximal displacement was calculated by taking the mean of the maximal displacement of the anterior and posterior gap formation at each of the cycle intervals.</p>
<p>The Mann-Whitney ranked-sum test was performed to compare the change in displacement of the first 100 cycles with the incremental change in displacement of the last 900 cycles to determine where the majority of displacement occurred. This study was 80% powered a priori to detect a significant difference (α = .05) in gap formation of 2 mm between the TOE-SB and TO constructs as described by Bisson and Manohar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426071">5</xref></sup> At the completion of the study, post hoc power analysis was performed to determine the number of specimens required to demonstrate a significant difference between groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>No specimens in the TOE-SB group reached failure, defined as more than 5-mm displacement. One specimen in the TO group failed at 750 cycles under the high load condition with the tendon tearing. Nonetheless, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean maximal gapping of the repairs under low and high load conditions. The mean maximal gap formation of the repairs during low load testing in the TOE-SB and TO constructs was 0.93 ± 0.88 mm and 0.55 ± 0.22 mm, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .505). The mean maximal gap formation during high load testing in the TOE-SB and TO constructs was 1.84 ± 0.97 mm and 2.28 ± 1.62 mm, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .517). No significant differences in displacements were found between the anterior or posterior markers in either treatment group or treatment load (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511426071">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511426071">2</xref>). Notably, there was very little observed suture cutting into the bone at the lateral hole of the TO repairs.</p>
<p>Although the differences in mean maximal gap formation were not statistically significant, the most significant increase in gap distance occurred at the transition to high load in both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511426071">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, within the TO group, mean maximal gapping increased 315% after the transition from low to high load as compared with a 119% increase recorded within the TOE-SB group. In both low and high load fatigue testing, the incremental change in displacement was significantly greater in the first 100 cycles compared with the last 900 cycles (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in both treatment groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we compared the initial fixation strength of a traditional TO technique with that of a TOE-SB rotator cuff repair technique. The tear anatomy and repair constructs were designed to simulate the in vivo condition of a rotator cuff repair with intact anterior and posterior rotator cuffs. Two loading conditions were tested for each technique: a “low” load (representing forces across the rotator cuff with active elevation against gravity) and a “high” load (representing forces across the rotator cuff with active elevation against resistance). There were no significant differences in gap formation between a TOE-SB technique and TO technique under either low or high conditions. Overall, there was very little gapping under any of the conditions tested. In the low load condition, both techniques demonstrated mean displacement of less than 1 mm. In the high load condition, mean displacement for each technique was just over 2 mm. As expected, the repair gap increased during the high load conditions.</p>
<p>This study has several strengths. We believe that the model of rotator cuff tear is more representative of the clinical situation compared with testing of an isolated supraspinatus tendon repaired to the bone, as in most other studies. In our technique, load is applied through the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. Anatomic studies have demonstrated that the rotator cuff insertion represents a “blending” of the tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511426071">38</xref></sup> Removing the subscapularis and infraspinatus tendons may inappropriately alter the loading conditions of the mechanical testing of the rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, some authors suggest that the rotator cable, a structure that spans across the rotator cuff tendons, is critical to distributing the pull of the tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511426071">23</xref></sup> We suggest, therefore, that the presence of an intact anterior and posterior rotator cuff is critical in accurately representing the in vivo situation.</p>
<p>The forces applied to the repair in this model simulate activities of lifting and arm elevation. The low load condition approximates forces applied through the rotator cuff when the arm is held in the scapular plane elevation. The high load condition represents forces applied through the rotator cuff when the arm is actively elevated against resistance. The force estimates that we used were based upon work reported by Hughes and An<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426071">20</xref></sup> using rotator cuff muscle cross-sectional areas and measured moment arms. We did not seek to test load to failure because these loads are generally much greater than the loads that a patient would generate.</p>
<p>Matched pairs of cadaveric specimens were used, and the repairs were randomly performed on each specimen to minimize bias related to bone or soft tissue quality. We considered evaluating bone mineral density, but Pietschmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511426071">34</xref></sup> demonstrated that bone quality does not alter the pull-out strength of transosseous sutures compared with suture anchors.</p>
<p>Failure of fixation was established before the start of clinical testing and defined as gap formation of at least 5 mm. Gap formation of about 2.5 mm was expected in the TO group based on previous studies using this cyclic loading methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511426071">39</xref></sup> This study was 80% powered a priori to detect a significant difference in gap formation based on this information.</p>
<p>Post hoc analysis was performed to determine the number of specimens required to demonstrate a statistical power of .8. This analysis indicates that we would need a sample size of 34 to demonstrate that .93 was significantly different from .55 in the low load group. In the high load group, 137 samples would be needed to demonstrate a significant difference between 1.84 and 2.28. Because of the cost of instrumentation and cadaveric samples, a study of this sample size would not be realistic and likely does not make a significant clinical effect.</p>
<p>The gap formation observed in our TO group approached the expected 2.5 mm. The gapping in the TO repairs was less than the gapping that has been previously reported by our group using the same rotator cuff repair testing model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511426071">40</xref></sup> There were 2 technical differences that might explain this finding. In this study, we used No. 2 Fiberwire (Arthrex) with simple sutures, while Tocci et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511426071">40</xref></sup> used No. 2 Ethibond and Mason-Allen sutures. No. 2 Fiberwire (Arthrex) is larger and has an inner core suture, which might change the mechanical characteristics of the repair and response to testing conditions. The second difference is that this study had a relatively high proportion of male specimens (6:1 male-female ratio) and thus possibly better tissue.</p>
<p>Understanding the initial strength characteristics of different rotator cuff repair techniques may influence surgical decision making and may ultimately improve patient outcomes. The traditional TO technique used in open and mini-open procedures may provide better initial fixation than some other reported techniques. Apreleva et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511426071">2</xref></sup> demonstrated that TO simple suture constructs have been shown to more fully cover the supraspinatus footprint compared with transosseous mattress suture, suture anchor simple suture, or suture anchor mattress suture. Compared with an arthroscopic single-row repair, open TO techniques have been shown to have less motion at the bone-tendon interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511426071">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Newer arthroscopic techniques, however, may achieve fixation strengths that are equivalent to traditional open procedures. Park et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511426071">31</xref></sup> established that a TOE-SB repair had greater contact area and overall pressure at the rotator cuff footprint when compared with double-row repairs. In another study, Park et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511426071">32</xref></sup> evaluated the effect of dynamic external rotation, comparing a suture bridge technique with a double-row anchor repair technique. They reported that there was no overall significant difference in gap formation between constructs. However, they did find that there was more gapping at the anterior aspect of the TOE-SB repair compared with the posterior repair site (1.62 mm and 0.68 mm, respectively). Using a modified TO technique, Bisson and Manohar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426071">5</xref></sup> reported no significant differences in elongation, stiffness, or failure load compared with TOE-SB. Our testing protocol was designed to simulate the forces applied through the rotator cuff during passive and active elevations of the shoulder in a physiological construct. We did not evaluate the effect of rotation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that TOE-SB repairs demonstrate less motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511426071">1</xref></sup> and possess the highest ultimate load to failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511426071">33</xref></sup> The TOE-SB also has been shown to maintain the force contact over time better than either single- or double-row techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511426071">26</xref></sup> The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. It is hypothesized, however, that these in vitro attributes of a TOE-SB repair translate into improved in vivo healing rates. Some authors have suggested that increased contact pressures may compromise tendon vascularity. Maguire et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511426071">25</xref></sup> found that the TOE-SB without medial knots did not demonstrate inferior failure load, tendon-bone contact area, or gapping characteristics compared with knotted medial row constructs in cadaveric specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511426071">3</xref></sup> Clinical studies directly testing this hypothesis are lacking. Evidence evaluating the TOE-SB construct is conflicting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of 25 patients at 1 year after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using a TOE-SB technique demonstrated an intact repair site in 88% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511426071">13</xref></sup> A more recent case series of 51 patients, however, demonstrated 28.9% retear rates (by MRI) at 1 year following the TO suture bridge technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511426071">42</xref></sup> It should be noted that these differences may result from differences in baseline patient characteristics, tendon and bone tissue quality, or surgeon experience and skill level.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it was noted that the majority of incremental displacement occurred within the first 100 cycles for both high and low load testing (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). This may suggest that 100 cycles of testing may provide sufficient data for analysis. However, further research would be required to validate this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that the initial fixation strength of suture anchor and TO suture repairs of a large-sized rotator cuff repair with optimal tendon and bone is equivalent. In our study, both techniques protected against significant gapping at the repair site. Both groups demonstrated the most significant increase in gapping when transitioned from the low to high load condition, as the overall gapping for both groups was relatively low. The ability of the repairs to resist significant gap formation during high load testing, designed to mimic active forward elevation against resistance, may increase tendon healing rates.</p>
<p>Acknowledged limitations of this study include our small sample size, lack of rotational testing, testing of one specific tear pattern, and our deliberate neglect of ultimate load-to-failure testing. It is also important to realize the inherent limitation of cadaveric studies. The specimens had intact rotator cuff tendons, which may have better quality tendon tissue than that encountered in patients with chronic rotator cuff tears. This is a limitation of all of these types of studies. Cadaveric studies do not account for the variety of tear patterns that are seen in clinical practice or the changes that occur during healing. Furthermore, the tear construct that we utilized, with an intact anterior and posterior rotator cuff, may shield the repair from the testing load in a fashion that minimizes repair gapping in a nonphysiological fashion.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the repairs in our study were performed under the ideal condition of being “fully open”: all skin and deltoid were stripped. Although this method does not reproduce the conditions of an all-arthroscopic repair, especially the technical difficulty, it does provide a technique that optimizes the technical aspect of the repair in order to best compare the 2 techniques in question.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the conception of this study, newer techniques of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, including knotless suture bridge and arthroscopic TO repair, were developed. Some authors suggest that “knotless” TOE-SB has a positive effect on tendon vascularity compared with the TOE-SB technique that we tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511426071">25</xref></sup> Our study does not evaluate the knotless technique, but other studies have shown that the knotless technique has decreased initial fixation strength relative to the traditional technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426071">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511426071">25</xref></sup> Lastly, there are differences among the various implants that are on the market today for rotator cuff repair, and the results of this study may not apply when other implants are used.</p>
<p>The clinical relevance of this study relates to the availability of a variety of techniques for rotator cuff repair and the goal to achieve an optimal repair construct that leads to optimal outcomes of treatment. At the outset of this study, the focus was on evaluating current arthroscopic techniques in comparison to traditional open repair techniques. Subsequent to this study, arthroscopic TO rotator cuff repairs have been introduced. The findings of studies that compare suture anchor repairs to TO repairs will likely have clinical relevance to this issue as well.</p>
