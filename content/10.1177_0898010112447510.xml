<p>The <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing</italic> is in its 30th year of publication having arisen from small, yet courageous, beginnings to become a significant force in the advancement of knowledge for holistic nursing and health care. Typically, each issue of the journal offers readers a variety of articles that cover a diverse spectrum of topics that relate to research, practice, education, and aesthetics. First and foremost manuscripts are selected that demonstrate high standards of scholarship, creativity, and relevance that have the potential for advancing our understanding of holistic health and healing. It is important to continue this tradition of variety in what is offered because of the diverse nature of our work and the needs of our readership.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to pause periodically and offer our readers the benefits of exploring some of the advancements associated with a particular area of focus. Likewise, it is important to call for papers from writers who have a significant interest in sharing important work along with other writers in order to create a synergy of understanding and appreciation in a targeted arena of knowledge. This is the purpose of the special issue or special section of any journal. A journal is meant to serve both readers and writers. The <italic>Journal of Holistic Nursing</italic>, an official journal of an organization, exists to perpetuate the intentions and ideals of a group of people dedicated to a mission. The mission of the American Holistic Nurses Association is advancing holistic nursing within a vision that supports wholeness and healing. Substantial advancement of knowledge requires an integration of expansion and concentration. The special issue and section provides for the concentration aspect of this relationship.</p>
<p>Ideas for special issues and sections are welcomed that provide an opportunity for focused attention to a topic that advances holistic nursing. You will find in this particular issue of the journal a call for manuscripts related to botanicals. Dr. Martha Libster, the Associate Editor for Botanicals, has agreed to lead this project and has invited a distinguished panel of reviewers to participate in this endeavor. The call that was crafted by Dr. Libster clearly describes what is sought both in content and quality. It is an exemplar for attracting work that will advance our appreciation and understanding in a focused area—in this case, the healing potentials of botanicals. Special issues and sections will be most meaningful when this kind of attention and intention is clearly articulated in the call. I look forward to seeing the results of these efforts, and I know that we will learn greatly from both the process and product that emerges.</p>
