<body>
<p>Much of our experience with the world is necessarily mediated. Individuals cannot directly experience all of the stimuli required to understand emotions and issues outside their immediate knowledge. So people rely on fiction and nonfiction media for information about the past and present as well as to forecast the future. Cinema and news have been sources of learning about society as well as fodder for determining our characters and behavior. We use these media to articulate and reflect upon what we believe, the kinds of people we wish to be, and how or when to take action. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635212447909">Lippmann (1922</xref>: 10) noted, ‘it is clear enough that under certain conditions men respond as powerfully to fictions as they do to realities.’</p>
<p>Following this rationale, studying the interlacing of the Hollywood industry, films, and news media is imperative. Horror films have conveyed anxieties about life, politics, and even communication technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750635212447909">Nelson, 2005</xref>). Film and news have been linked historically as well. Entertainment crept into newspaper accounts during the Yellow Journalism era of the 1880s, and viewers watched newsreels before the main attraction in the early days of motion pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750635212447909">Surette and Otto, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750635212447909">Weiskel (2005</xref>: 396) worried that politics and news have become ‘Hollywoodized’ due to media conglomeration and political strategies that treat politicians as celebrities, celebrities as politicians, and voters as fans. Evidence suggests Hollywood shapes news, either by providing easily accessible frameworks for comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635212447909">Huxford, 2000</xref>) or to promote films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212447909">Glaser, 1998</xref>). Therefore, research of Hollywood’s impact on news is relevant in today’s largely mediated world.</p>
<p>This article serves as an exploratory analysis of cinematic and journalistic treatments of issues, focusing on the movie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212447909"><italic>Blood Diamond</italic> (2006</xref>, dir. Edward Zwick) and news coverage of conflict diamonds. First, I examine Hollywood’s impact on news, highlighting central ideas of agenda-setting theory and framing as well as the potential for synergistic influences on news due to concentration of media ownership. Second, I discuss the themes and narrative techniques of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, as well as its messages about the diamond trade, American consumerism, and journalistic norms and responsibilities. Third, I assess print and broadcast news related to conflict diamonds in the wake of the movie’s release. Finally, I suggest areas for research into linkages between film and news as industries and forms of mass communication.</p>

<title>Internal and external influences on news coverage</title>
<sec id="section2-1750635212447909">
<title>Agenda-setting theory</title>
<p>As a theoretical foundation for research of Hollywood and news, agenda-setting is useful and comprehensive. The theory states that media determine the salience of issues in the public consciousness (McCombs and Shaw, 1972, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750635212447909">McCombs, 2005</xref>). Researchers have expanded the theory to explicate how media might determine not only what topics people think about, but also how they think about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635212447909">Johnston, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750635212447909">McLeod et al. (2002</xref>: 227) noted that ‘agenda-setting effects are not necessarily powerful, consequential, or universal’ because individuals’ interpretive processes may mitigate aggregate effects.</p>
<p>Framing has been considered a component of second-level agenda-setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750635212447909">McCombs and Reynolds, 2002</xref>), in which attributes of an issue can be emphasized to different degrees to impact its salience. Framing is based on the assumption that the way media present an issue will influence how audiences perceive it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750635212447909">Scheufele and Tewksbury, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635212447909">Huxford (2000</xref>: 188) described frames as ‘chain associations that cluster around a single image or phrase, directing the reader into certain familiar channels of cognition’. Media create frames by emphasizing, de-emphasizing or omitting information, sometimes by using body language, vocal tone, or altering production values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750635212447909">Ryan and Wentworth, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Framing can be a conscious effort to affect issue salience or can occur unconsciously when journalists fall into patterns of information-gathering and storytelling. It can be positive, as when marginalized groups draw attention to issues by framing them as social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447909">Lawrence and Birkland, 2004</xref>). But it can also be negative if powerful factions manipulate coverage to benefit themselves or distract audiences from more pressing stories. News organizations must recognize agenda-setting’s dual nature, especially as media deregulation introduces synergistic pressures to journalists’ gatekeeping processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750635212447909">White, 1950</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750635212447909">
<title>Corporate conglomeration and synergy</title>
<p>Agenda-setting may occur within media organizations from news division executives or from related companies within larger corporate structures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212447909">Campbell (2005)</xref> argued conglomeration degrades the quality of coverage and transforms audiences from citizens in a community to consumers in a demographic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750635212447909">McManus (1992)</xref> decried the influence of media conglomerates as a conflict of interest between the corporate profit motive and journalists’ ethical imperative to serve the public. News outlets often present human interest stories and celebrity gossip because they believe entertainment attracts a wider audience—and more people mean more money. Lighter news agendas are also cheaper to produce, which is important in a world of media alternatives and fragmented audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750635212447909">Shaw, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Hollywood has been heavy-handed in its attempts to influence news. Public relations practitioners for studios and production companies must generate good press for movies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750635212447909">Tilson (2003)</xref> described the jobs of press agents, publicists, planters, and handlers as managing media hype surrounding a film. They find news angles that allow for mention of films, arrange celebrity appearances and interviews, and release footage for newscasts and trade publications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750635212447909">McCombs and Reynolds (2002</xref>: 13) described intermedia agenda-setting as ‘the interactions and influence of various mass media on each other’. It is this intertextuality that underlies this analysis of film and news coverage regarding conflict diamonds.</p>

<title>Demand for diamonds</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750635212447909">United Nations (2001)</xref> has defined conflict diamonds as ‘diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council’. Also known as ‘blood diamonds’, they have been used to finance civil wars fueled by ethnic tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212447909">Lujala et al., 2005</xref>) and have generated revenue for rebels, diamond traders, corrupt government leaders, and terrorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212447909">Grant and Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212447909">Josipovic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212447909">Le Billon, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635212447909">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Blood diamonds have contributed to displacement of civilians, rape, amputation, and abduction of individuals for the recruitment of child soldiers, coercion into sexual slavery, or forced labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212447909">Le Billon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750635212447909">Reddy et al., 2005</xref>). Human rights groups such as Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada exposed abuses linked to the diamond trade, highlighting wars in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212447909">Global Witness, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212447909">Josipovic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750635212447909">Smillie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750635212447909">Tripathi, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1991–2000 war in Sierra Leone was fought internally by ethnic groups and political parties and was exacerbated by external forces seeking to profit from diamonds and war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635212447909">Ndumbe, 2001</xref>). Governments of Liberia and Burkina Faso supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in exchange for illegal diamonds. The UN Security Council also implicated individuals from other nations in illegal transactions. Additionally, Canadian mining corporations provided private security forces, equipment, and ammunition to the government of Sierra Leone to secure long-term leases on diamond-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635212447909">Ndumbe, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To unravel the global web of violence, corruption, and wealth, the diamond industry collaborated with non-governmental organizations, over 50 governments, and the UN in the creation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212447909">Josipovic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750635212447909">Tripathi, 2005</xref>). As a solution to the conflict diamond trade, the KPCS is not without critics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750635212447909">Tripathi (2005)</xref> argued that, although compliance may indicate a corporation’s recognition of a problem, the voluntary initiative is not legally binding. Consequently, enforcement has not been effective, participating countries have not revealed the extent of their diamond holdings, and states have not been held to the same standards as armed opposition groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750635212447909">Tripathi, 2005</xref>). Corruption, lack of transparency, and difficulties in determining the origin of gems hinder the effectiveness of the KPCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212447909">Grant and Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212447909">Josipovic, 2003</xref>). These critiques indicate that the Kimberley Process for certifying diamonds as conflict-free remains complex, controversial, and far from fool-proof.</p>

<title>From Sierra Leone to the silver screen</title>
<p>The film <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> was released in December 2006, during the Christmas shopping season. Set in Sierra Leone in 1999, the movie centers on the diamond trade that financed the nation’s civil war. It follows three characters—honest fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), and magazine reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly)—as they track a rare diamond and try to find Vandy’s family.</p>
<p>At a fictional G8 Conference on Diamonds, Ambassador Walker (Stephen Collins) delivers the film’s persuasive thesis:
<disp-quote>
<p>Throughout the history of Africa, whenever a substance of value is found, the locals die in great number and in misery. Now this was true of ivory, rubber, gold, and oil. It is now true of diamonds. According to a devastating report by Global Witness, these stones are being used to purchase arms and finance civil war. We must act to prohibit the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from conflict zones.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A summary of the debate over conflict diamonds ensues, simplifying decades of sociopolitical controversy for the audience. One character notes that the US is responsible for two-thirds of diamond purchases. The evil of American consumerism is crystallized as images of the diamond miners and their brutal working conditions punctuate the debate. Vandy, who has been forced to mine diamonds, sees a man murdered for stealing a gem.</p>
<p>Later, Archer introduces himself to Bowen and asks if she is an American. ‘Guilty’, she quips, to which Archer replies, ‘Americans usually are.’ When Bowen asks about blood diamonds, Archer mocks the American slang term for jewelry, ‘bling-bling’, popularized by rappers and hip-hop artists. In Sierra Leone, he reminds her, ‘it’s bling-bang’. Conspicuous consumption, he implies, feeds an ugly system of brutality and destruction.</p>
<p>Bowen asks Archer if he feels guilty about the people who die because of the illegal diamond trade. He reminds her of the media’s complicity in cultivating a hunger for diamonds by telling her that magazines such as the one for which she writes contain slick, romantic advertisements for diamond jewelry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750635212447909">Parenti (1993)</xref> contended that advertising legitimates consumerism as an American ideal, promoting false needs as well as the belief that buying things can fulfill real needs such as love and approval. Diamonds have symbolic rather than practical value, having been socially constructed through marketing to signify love, purity, longevity, and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635212447909">Haught, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212447909">Le Billon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750635212447909">Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>). By highlighting the brutality associated with conflict diamonds, advocacy groups sought to counter illusions created by ads, denounce war profiteering, and provoke individuals to reject their role as ‘terrorist consumers’ whose purchasing decisions contribute to the deaths of civilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750635212447909">Le Billon, 2006</xref>). <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> questions the symbolism of the diamond in US culture because, in the movie, a sparkling gem is the focus of greed, violence, and ignorance. To redeem themselves, the film suggests, Americans must assume responsibility for understanding where products originate.</p>
<p>Although the characters initially seem resigned to the carnage and complexity of war and the diamond trade, the movie reinforces the personal obligation to make moral choices. This message is conveyed through dialogue. For example, Archer meets Benjamin Margai (Basil Wallace), who is attempting to rehabilitate brainwashed child soldiers. Archer has agreed to help Vandy locate his son in exchange for a valuable diamond but is conflicted about his motives. Margai tells him that while he wants to believe people are inherently good, he has learned that people’s actions define their character. He reassures Archer that even a single demonstration of love can make a person’s life meaningful and provide a path to redemption.</p>
<p>This message is a call to action for audiences. The final words of the movie—printed on the screen in black and white—inform viewers that 40 nations joined the KPCS to halt the trade in conflict diamonds. The filmmakers warn, however, that ‘illegal diamonds are still finding their way to market. It is up to the consumer to insist that a diamond is conflict-free.’ The movie implies that making informed purchasing decisions is redemptive, and that consumers can atone for the sin of greed by rejecting the systemic corruption that has tainted their material comfort.</p>
<p>The makers of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> presented their story as a melodrama, which allowed them to proselytize about responsible consumption to a nation of capitalists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212447909">Anker (2005)</xref> explained that melodrama is a narrative style that demarcates good and bad distinctly so truth and justice can be made clear. She identified five characteristics of melodramas. First, the narrative centers on morality that is signified by suffering and which can be upheld through heroic action. Vandy exemplifies this misery, having lost his family and home. However, many people in Sierra Leone were subjected to pain. The children abducted by the RUF are forced to commit horrible acts, and audiences see how their humanity has been stripped from them.</p>
<p>Second, melodramas require a ruthless villain, a suffering victim, and a heroic savior who redeems virtue with an act of retribution. In <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, RUF soldiers are villains. They hack off people’s hands, force children to shoot prisoners, and enslave villagers in the diamond mines. Vandy is good and feels uncomfortable pretending he is a journalist, even though finding his son depends on his ability to misrepresent himself. Although he is a victim, he is also the hero. Archer and Bowen are depicted ambiguously, but they overcome their inner conflicts, and each has heroic moments.</p>
<p>Third, people and acts are portrayed in terms of absolute good and evil. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212447909">Anker (2005)</xref> noted that combining dramatic polarizations, as well as cycles of pathos and action, could propel the narrative by creating anticipation and anxiety. For example, audiences first see Vandy walking with his son near their seaside home. The peaceful scene quickly disintegrates as RUF soldiers kidnap and kill the villagers.</p>
<p>Fourth, melodramas juxtapose emotion and action to create suspense and resolution of conflict. For instance, a scene of child soldiers being forced to fire an AK-47 at a live person to prove their allegiance to the RUF is filled with action, bright light, and a din of voices. But in the next scene, the children sleep serenely during the night, and an RUF commander speaks in an almost fatherly way to a traumatized soldier. Although it is a veneer, audiences understand how the soldier’s tenderness draws in the vulnerable children and leaves them open to dehumanization.</p>
<p>Fifth, images, sounds, and gestures are used to highlight the dichotomy between good and evil, coaxing viewers to identify with the protagonist and spurn the villain. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212447909">Anker (2005</xref>: 24) explained, ‘melodramatic narrative employs the plot devices of grandiose events, unprovoked actions, hyperbolic language, and spectacles of suffering.’ She elaborated that melodramatic films are also characterized by the pointed use of ambient music, associative montage, and repetition of themes. <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> employs all of these techniques. Vandy’s anguish is dramatic rather than subtle, and violence intrudes periodically into otherwise quiet scenes. Viewers are not warned about RUF attacks, and the filmmakers do not contextualize the war. Quick cuts and explosions indicate the uncertainty of life in a war zone, while musical crescendos convey the scope of the country, the problems, and the ethical issues involved.</p>
<p>By presenting the subject of conflict diamonds in a melodramatic style, filmmakers couch the binary of good and evil within the context of consumerism. The filmmakers draw audiences into the narrative by giving them a choice about how to respond to the persuasive messages in the film. That is, if buying illegal diamonds contributes to the mayhem depicted in the movie, then consumers are complicit in the deaths of millions of people. But if buyers understand how diamonds are procured, they can voice their opposition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1750635212447909">
<title>The media is the message</title>
<p>The film not only addresses the issue of conflict diamonds, but also journalists’ treatment of the issue. This should interest mass communication researchers because cinematic portrayals of journalists could impact viewers’ perceptions of news media, perhaps inspiring confidence in the profession’s ability to provoke social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750635212447909">Niblock, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At one point in the film, Vandy asks Bowen if people in the US will read her stories and help end the war. ‘Probably not’, she retorts. Another journalist echoes her feelings about readers’ apathy. ‘The story’s the same’, the journalist remarks. ‘Government’s bad, rebels worse. No one gives a toss anymore.’</p>
<p>But the movie does not blame audiences entirely. It also implicates broadcast journalism for its inattention to the war in Sierra Leone. During her first meeting with Archer, Bowen glances at a televised image of then-President Bill Clinton apologizing for indiscretions with a White House intern. Bowen observes, ‘The world is falling apart, and all we hear about is Blowjobgate.’</p>
<p>Bowen repeats a similar sentiment at the Tassin Refugee Camp in Guinea. The main characters step off a helicopter to see a million displaced people behind a fence, with thousands more filing in from the countryside. Bowen says they have arrived at the second largest refugee camp in Africa, adding disgustedly, ‘You might catch a minute of this on CNN, somewhere between sports and weather.’</p>
<p>After Vandy locates his family in the camp, only to learn his son has been kidnapped by the RUF, Archer mocks Bowen for trying to capture the experience in words. Bowen delivers a soliloquy about why covering conflict diamonds or any of Sierra Leone’s strife is so challenging:
<disp-quote>
<p>Do you think I’m exploiting his grief? You’re right. It’s shit. It’s like one of those infomercials. You know, the little black babies with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes. So here I’ve got dead mothers, I’ve got severed limbs. But it’s nothing new. And it might be enough to make some people cry if they read it, maybe even write a check. But it’s not going to be enough to make it stop. I am sick of writing about victims, but it’s all I can fucking do. Because I need facts. I need names. I need dates. I need pictures. I need bank accounts. People back home wouldn’t buy a ring if they knew it cost someone else their hand. But I can’t write that story until I get facts that can be verified, which is to say, until I find someone who will go on record.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Within the movie, this view of journalism as a rigorous endeavor contrasts a direct questioning of the appropriateness of objectivity as a professional norm in this war-torn environment. When Archer tries to convince Bowen to help Vandy locate his family, she resists: ‘The whole country is at war. Why should I help just one person? I can’t believe I just said that.’ She quickly realizes her professional role must not overwhelm her personal sense of decency.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> conveys a hopeful view of the power of media to expose evils and of audiences to act on the messages they receive. Archer and Vandy provide the evidence and testimony Bowen needs to publish an exposé of the illegal diamond trade. The diamond executives are revealed as corrupt. As reporters bombard them with questions and citizens protest in the streets, the executives only mutter, ‘no comment’.</p>
<p>While positive fictional portrayals of journalists may engender trust and excitement about news, the overlap between Hollywood and real-life reporters is more troubling. When actors serve as correspondents to boost ratings and reporters play themselves to give fictional films more realism, there are inherent conflicts of interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212447909">Grossman (2000)</xref> pointed out that several members of the White House press corps and a correspondent from <italic>60 Minutes</italic> took parts in movies, even when the portrayals of journalists were negative. Yet ABC’s correspondents were upset when actor Leonardo DiCaprio interviewed Clinton for a prime-time newscast on Earth Day. Ironically, DiCaprio’s character in <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> attempts to smuggle diamonds out of the country by posing as a reporter for <italic>National Geographic</italic> magazine.</p>
<p>The blending of fiction and news—in terms of content or media professionals—bespeaks an appearance of impropriety about the influence of Hollywood on news agendas. Therefore, it is necessary to examine real news coverage of the diamond industry in the wake of the release of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> in theaters nationwide.</p>

<title>Conflict diamonds in the news</title>
<p>In the year prior to the December 2006 release of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, a LexisNexis Academic database search for ‘blood diamond’ turned up 218 US newspaper items, most of which explicitly mentioned the film. A similar search of television and radio news transcripts resulted in 180 hits. This demonstrates that, even before the release of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, buzz about the film was already helping to drive a news agenda regarding conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>Many news outlets began to cover the issue of blood diamonds during the week of the movie’s release. The movie provided a hook to make the events portrayed seem more immediate, even though the war in Sierra Leone happened several years ago. Because the movie was mentioned in the news stories analyzed here, media organizations most likely felt a need to make an old issue timely. But to determine whether <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> set the agenda for news media in more determinable ways, it is also necessary to examine how conflict diamonds were discussed in a sample of newspapers, magazines, and TV transcripts.</p>
<p>News stories were selected for analysis based on a LexisNexis search using the term ‘blood diamond’ specifically. The sample was also limited to print and broadcast news stories from major media outlets that were published or aired after the release of the film. I also chose to emphasize US-based media to avoid cross-cultural comparisons of coverage that would need to take into account varying media ownership structures, political, and cultural differences. This data collection technique provided a body of news coverage suitable for the exploratory analysis of agenda-setting effects of film undertaken in this article. However, future research on the relationships between film and news should address a more comprehensive sample of news stories, particularly across media systems internationally.</p>
<p>Although agenda-setting theory has been used to determine how news agencies influence issue salience in audiences, it has also been applied to studies of forces that influence news organizations themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750635212447909">Weaver et al. (2004)</xref> listed three primary factors influencing news agendas. First, journalists tend to rely on official sources of information, which could include individual figures as well as events such as press conferences, junkets, and campaigns designed to create publicity and provide access for reporters. Second, news organizations tend to homogenize coverage by imitating news agendas of other outlets, a process called intermedia agenda-setting. Third, journalistic traditions and norms can mold a broad agenda because professionals are trained to think about news values in similar ways.</p>
<p>These factors provide a framework for looking at news coverage of blood diamonds. Because news reports are ‘stylized constructions of reality’ intended to simplify complex issues into dialectical narratives audience members can comprehend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750635212447909">Smith, 1992</xref>), it is important to understand whether Hollywood, the diamond industry, or another entity had greater influence in the presentation of conflict diamonds as a social problem.</p>
<sec id="section9-1750635212447909">
<title>Official sources of information</title>
<p>In many cases, news organizations relied on a predictable set of sources who reflected a limited range of viewpoints. The framework of consumerism allowed news organizations to interview diamond industry representatives as well as jewelry store owners and gemologists. An article in <italic>Newsday</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212447909">Amodio, 2007</xref>) quoted the head of the World Diamond Council and the industry group’s spokesperson. On 13 December 2006, <italic>Good Morning America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635212447909">ABC News, 2006a</xref>) aired a story about how to tell the difference between diamonds sold at high-end jewelry store Tiffany and at retail store Costco that relied on commentary from store employees.</p>
<p>Many of the news stories seemed to be influenced by the diamond industry. Industry public relations professionals released information and created opportunities for journalists to get footage of diamonds and interviews with gem experts. An article in <italic>Newsweek</italic> mentioned <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> only as a controversy facing the young director of the DeBeers Group. Without questioning the veracity of the movie’s claims, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750635212447909">Smith (2006)</xref> allowed the director to point out that the film’s events were historical and did not reflect the current state of the diamond industry.</p>
<p>The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> noted that the release of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> caused the $60 billion diamond industry to increase public relations efforts to inoculate consumers against the negativity of learning about conflict diamonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750635212447909">Semuels, 2007</xref>). But on 9 December 2006, NBC Nightly News referred to this public relations scramble as a ‘multi-million-dollar educational campaign’. This euphemism is no surprise, given two of the primary sources for the story were affiliated with DeBeers and the World Diamond Council.</p>
<p>To balance the use of diamond industry experts and jewelers, many stories quoted Edward Zwick, the producer/director of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, who reiterated the importance of the issue of conflict diamonds and the need for consumers to demand verification of the legal status of the jewelry they purchase. To counter diamond industry experts, stories on <italic>Nightline</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212447909">ABC News, 2006b</xref>) and other news programs also included comments from representatives of Global Witness, an organization that aims to expose corruption in international trade as well as human rights and environmental abuses linked to natural resources. The official website for <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> contains a link to the Global Witness website, and the organization was also mentioned in the movie.</p>
<p>Reliance on official sources makes it easier for journalists to explore topics from binary perspectives. Aiming to be objective, journalists sometimes report both sides of the story, rather than all sides. <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> provided an easy structure of right and wrong by addressing human rights and the selling of diamonds. In general, journalists found advocates and executives to represent two perspectives without independently verifying the success of policy implementations or interviewing people who lived in Sierra Leone or worked in the mines.</p>

<sec id="section10-1750635212447909">
<title>Intermedia agenda-setting</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750635212447909">Shaheen (1985)</xref> described how news wire services engage in intermedia agenda-setting simply because they distribute content to other publications and broadcast outlets. But he also argued that entertainment media are part of the intermedia agenda-setting process. He estimated that cinema could reach an international audience of 500 million to 1 billion people. Those numbers have likely increased due to advancements in technology that allow for multi-platform viewing and easier access to films in a wider range of markets.</p>
<p>The issue of blood diamonds has also come to the forefront of the music industry. The <italic>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic> reported on a February 2007 VH1 documentary about the connection between hip-hop artists and conflict diamonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212447909">Murray, 2007</xref>). On 11 December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212447909">2006</xref>, <italic>CBS Evening News</italic> included a clip of a song by rapper Kanye West about blood diamonds. These cases illustrate how the film <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> prompted metadiscourse in news about the music industry’s attention to the topic.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750635212447909">White (2007)</xref>, <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> is simply another film in the semi-documentary African political thriller genre. He listed a number of films—<italic>Hotel Rwanda, The Last King of Scotland, The Constant Gardener, The Interpreter, Tsotsi</italic>—that have addressed events in African nations, noting that these kinds of socially conscious movies were fashionable in Hollywood. But films about Africa could also lead to more news coverage of the issues contained in the films. In this way, Hollywood’s intermedia agenda-setting effect could offset news organizations’ chronic inattention to Africa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1750635212447909">
<title>Norms and traditions</title>
<p>Journalists are socialized into the norms of their professions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212447909">Bennett (2001)</xref> demonstrated how norms could impact the content of news. He listed four information biases: personalization, dramatization, fragmentation, and authority-disorder bias. Personalization involves use of the ‘human interest’ angle rather than an examination of issues. Dramatization emphasizes conflict, scandal, crisis, and immediacy of action instead of causes or consequences. The use of images and video enhances the dramatic value of stories. Although presenting news as a dramatic narrative may increase audiences’ retention and comprehension of information, journalists also risk oversimplifying issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212447909">Machill et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Because so many news stories discussed illegal diamonds in the context of <italic>Blood Diamond</italic>, Hollywood was able to provide dramatic visuals in the form of film clips and interesting personalities such as the actors from the film. The movie’s release also allowed for capsulization of the issues surrounding conflict diamonds. Rather than delving into the causes of the war in Sierra Leone or the exploitation of natural resources, the story was simplified to cover the movie, safeguards against conflict diamonds, and responsible consumerism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750635212447909">O’Connor (2007)</xref> published an article in the <italic>Denver Post</italic> about <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> and DiCaprio as part of a ‘greening of the American psyche’ (p. L01) in which media messages encouraged people to make eco-friendly purchases. Similarly, <italic>Newsday</italic>’s coverage used the film to highlight options for buying ‘ethical jewelry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212447909">Amodio, 2007</xref>: B02).</p>
<p>Such messages illustrate the third and fourth information biases: fragmentation and authority-disorder. Fragmentation is isolation of a news story from its context. By highlighting personalities and events, fragmentation removes background information that would help the story make sense in relation to other stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212447909">Bennett, 2001</xref>). The authority-disorder bias centers on dramatic tension between order and chaos, and stories crafted in this vein identify people in charge of restoring order and solving problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212447909">Bennett, 2001</xref>). By emphasizing the consumer’s responsibility for making informed decisions, biased news coverage legitimized the diamond industry’s attempt to police itself and ignored systemic flaws that could encourage continued corruption or socioeconomic crises in diamond-producing nations.</p>
<p>Only a few stories questioned the ability of the KPCS to guarantee the provenance of diamonds from conflict-free zones. A 27 June 2007 article in the Toronto Star described a UN Security Council meeting on misuse of resources in countries around the world, and the article did not mention Blood Diamond as a frame of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750635212447909">Ward, 2007</xref>). On 11 December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212447909">2006</xref>, the CBS Evening News also quoted a UN report about loopholes in the KPCS that allowed conflict diamonds to be smuggled out of the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>CNN correspondent Jeff Koinange presented an earnest summary of the illegal diamond trade in Africa. On This Week at War on 17 December 2006, he reminded viewers that blood diamonds financed conflicts in Sierra Leone—as depicted in the Hollywood version—but also in Liberia, Angola, the Congo, and other African nations. When asked how consumers could determine if diamonds are conflict-free, he forewent the glib response about checking the gem’s certificate, instead saying people can’t really know for sure:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s so difficult. And although [in] some countries, for example, Botswana and South Africa, where we are now, they actually grade every diamond and they certify every diamond that comes out of each of the countries, for other African countries, especially those with no government to speak of, countries that have been in conflict for so many decades, [it is] so difficult to track down. No matter how they say that their diamonds are certified, it is so difficult … These villages are so poor, so desperate and they are in need of whatever money they can get and they will sell to literally whoever comes up with money.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Koinange avoided the dramatization, fragmentation, and authority-disorder biases. Although his answers were not comforting, he presented a well-researched, nuanced perspective.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Researchers would do well to scrutinize relationships between entertainment and news, especially as technology, conglomeration, and shifts in journalistic norms blur the boundaries between the two types of content. Scholars interested in media ownership or agenda-setting theory should elucidate the nexus between the film industry and news coverage of issues, events, and people. Additional work could be done on the impact of films presented as fiction and documentaries that may convey a theme with a higher degree of verisimilitude. Drawing upon film or literary studies scholarship, researchers could examine films that cluster around a particular issue and their impact on perceived salience in the public sphere. It would also be interesting to uncover challenges filmmakers face in bringing critical attention to sociopolitical issues in a commercially driven system.</p>
<p>Organizational communication and journalism scholars could use surveys, observation, and interviews to study how corporate control and expansion of media ownership could determine which stories get covered and how they are presented. Answering these questions would require looking not just at specific companies’ news divisions at the micro-level of decision-making but also at trends regarding mergers, vertical/horizontal integration, and the purchasing or consumption behaviors of audiences.</p>
<p>Although critical analyses could provide a wealth of detail to support arguments about themes, scholars should also refine quantitative and qualitative methodologies when studying Hollywood in various contexts. For example, a case study of a film and its related media coverage, such as the one presented here, could benefit from a thorough content analysis of promotional coverage and issue-related coverage. Within a framework of agenda-setting theory, I have illustrated relationships that allow Hollywood to shape the amount and nature of news reporting. <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> was an enlightening showcase of this phenomenon, as themes and narrative styles in the film conveyed messages about the news media, even as the news media presented messages about the film. The discursive interplay between mass media forms created a space for dialogue about an important social issue.</p>
