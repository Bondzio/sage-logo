<p><italic>Sport and Social Mobility: Crossing Boundaries</italic> is an important and well-written look at whether sport is a good vehicle for social mobility. Using a comparative case study (multi-site ethnography) approach, the author, Ramón Spaaij, examines whether non-professional sport could lead to upward mobility for participants. He looks at four sporting contexts, two of which are programs that are specifically attempting to lead to social mobility for their participants (‘sport for development’), and two of which are not.</p>
<p>Sport for development programs attempt to utilize sport to achieve social objectives. The two sport-for-development cases Spaaij examines are the Sport Steward Program (SSP) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Vencer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In these two cases, the programs aim to improve the socio-economic position of participants, who have to be socially disadvantaged in order to participate. The other two cases, both Australian, are the Giants Football Club in Melbourne, and the North Central Football League (NCFL) in north-west Victoria. In looking at these two cases, Spaiij examines whether sport participation can lead to social mobility even when that is not a specific goal of the program.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of this study is that individual programs need to be examined in their own social, political and economic contexts. In order for sport to act as a vehicle for social mobility, it needs to do so in particular places and under particular constraints. Indeed, the concept of social mobility itself has different meanings in different contexts. For example, in the <italic>favelas</italic> (slums) in Rio de Janeiro where Vencer operates, Spaaij reports that residents see social mobility as entailing increased agency and control over their own lives, not necessarily as involving moving out of the <italic>favela</italic>. This differs from the dominant western conceptions of the notion, which focus on changing one’s position in a system of social stratification.</p>
<p>The book is clearly organized, starting with an Introduction that outlines the topic, approach and case studies. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the theoretical framework. Drawing on research into social mobility and social capital, particularly the work of Pierre Bourdieu but also of other theorists, Spaaij identifies the major debates about how societies work, particularly, how social mobility can occur. He argues that different capitals are unequally distributed across society and are potential sources of social inclusion and social exclusion. Sport can foster social mobility, then, when capitals (cultural capital, social capital, different types of social capital) gained through sport participation are utilized in other realms. This chapter provides a particularly interesting and well-written discussion of social mobility and of theoretical insights into social and other capitals. The concepts are clearly examined and defined and the book is worth a read for this chapter alone.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 discusses each of the cases. Importantly, each case is situated within a particular social context which has different structural arrangements. The relationship between sport and social mobility is different for each case because the social context is different for each case, even when the goal of the program, as with SSP and Vencer, is mobility. Chapter 3 discusses the politics surrounding the four programs. Themes around sport as a form of welfare and sport as a source of social control emerge through these discussions.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 explore how social capital is fostered and constrained in the four programs. One of the main points of difference in Spaaij’s analysis of social capital (as compared with other social capital analysts) is his discussion of ‘perverse social capital’. Whereas many social capital theorists focus on the positive impacts of social capital, he highlights that social capital can have positive effects for those who share it, while having negative effects for the broader community. The Vencer example illustrates how this may work.</p>
<p>In chapter 6, the focus shifts from social capital to cultural capital. The chapter looks at the educational outcomes of participation in each of the programs. The two non-Australian programs have explicit educational components that do not involve sport but rather are aimed at improving participants’ employability. The two Australian programs have informal educational components. This chapter includes a discussion of families and the impact of the family environment on the likelihood a sport participant will develop cultural capital through sport. In this view, families and other social structures are important factors affecting whether sport can lead to social mobility.</p>
<p>Chapters 7 and 8 shift the focus from cultural capital to economic capital and social mobility more broadly: does the social and cultural capital developed through sport translate into economic capital and/or social mobility for participants? Spaaij’s main argument is that different types of capital (social, cultural, economic, etc.) are resources for social mobility, but they are not necessarily available to the disadvantaged. Access to multiform capital can enable social mobility, but only in the right circumstances. Participation in sports programs can lead to upward mobility in that the skills and knowledge learnt constitute capitals that are potentially transferable, but the structural and other constraints in individual lives (especially families and schools) shape the likelihood of this type of transfer occurring. So, can sport participation lead to social mobility? Perhaps, in the right circumstances.</p>
<p>The quality of the discussion of the mechanisms behind social mobility lends this book to uses beyond the sociology of sport. Indeed, it is one of the clearest discussions of social mobility, and also of social and other capitals, that I have come across. The ideas applied to sport could certainly be examined in other contexts. I very much enjoyed this book. Although a research monograph, its clear style makes it accessible for undergraduate and postgraduate students. It would be of particular interest to scholars and others interested in social mobility, social capital and the sociology of sport.</p>
