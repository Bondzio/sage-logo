<p>A song made famous by Marvin Gaye says, ‘When I get that feeling, I want sexual healing’, and all over the world people who have no money, hardly any possessions, little access to recreation and few hopes of an improvement in the circumstances of their daily lives turn to sex for consolation in their moments of deepest emptiness and despair. In this sense sex is a blessing. It can indeed provide a kind of healing, but as we all know it has its consequences too. Pregnancy is the most natural of these consequences and that is also a blessing. Families have children because they love children, but also because children offer insurance for the family’s future, through their contributions to domestic work, their employment potential and the marriage alliances they make possible. Children can thus be sources of happiness, security and even prosperity. People have large families to maximise these benefits and because they very reasonably fear they will lose some of their offspring to disease and accidents. If to outsiders families with many children seem to lack planning and forethought this is a failure to appreciate the perceived realities of life amongst the enormous majority of the world’s population who are very poor.</p>
<p>However, it is unfortunately not quite that simple. Sex is both a healer and, at the same time, the vector of many of the ills that beset the populations of developing countries. Mothers in isolated and poor communities, assisted only by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), all too frequently suffer preventable deaths or debilitating injuries in childbirth. Many pregnancies, not separated by an interval in which a mother can regain her strength and establish a healthy start for her baby, can result in weakened and vulnerable mothers and children, susceptible to disease. Inequality in the relations between men and women expresses itself in child marriage, often involving unhealthily early pregnancies, and in child prostitution and other forms of exploitation. Sexual transmission of HIV-AIDS is also a terrible downside of sexual healing. There is no single answer to this complex of problems clustering around the biological core of the relationships between the sexes, but there is one starting point towards providing a range of appropriate answers. That starting point is information. If people know what causes the disasters that lock them into poverty and distress then they can be helped towards the alleviation of their condition.</p>
<p>Family planning and sexual health NGOs in many countries are seeking to provide both the information about what people need to do, and support for them to take control of their lives. Access to contraception is essential, both to avoid untimely pregnancies and in the prevention of HIV-AIDS transmission. Clinics and publicity campaigns that provide the necessary information and follow through by distributing condoms, or fitting intrauterine devices, exist in most countries. Sometimes these are driven by government policyas and sometimes NGOs work in the policy gaps that may be intentionally or accidentally available. Although traditionalists may oppose the work as being counter to the local culture, the impressive evidence of improved health and social welfare associated with reproductive knowledge and practical action erodes their opposition. Yet one organisation consistently stands out against the logic of information and action in the field of sexual health and that is the Roman Catholic Church. Supported during the Bush presidency by American ‘pro-life’ policy initiatives, the Church and its priests condemn sexual health information and contraception as against the word of God and allege that they encourage promiscuity. That celibate priests feel called to promote this idiocy is perhaps not surprising, but the effects on the establishment of an effective approach to sexual health are enormously damaging. Sex can bring healing, but there are problematic consequences of sexual pleasure. Addressing these does not need the intervention of an organisation that prides itself on its faith-based irrationality.</p>
