<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pilot studies are often underreported in the literature largely due to the perceived preliminary nature of the investigation and corresponding outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313493248">Beebe, 2007</xref>), yet much is to be learned from them. Although most pilot studies do not have direct application to clinical practice because of the need for conducting the larger scale study and subsequent replication, they have the potential for providing valuable information for advancing science to inform clinical care. In this issue of <italic>JAPNA</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313493248">Munro et al., (2013)</xref> study “In Search of an Adult Attachment Stress Provocation to Measure Effect on the Oxytocin System: A Pilot Validation Study” illustrates some of the valuable lessons to be learned from sharing results of a preliminary investigation.</p>

<title>Pilot Studies</title>
<sec id="section3-1078390313493248">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Pilot studies, by definition, are small-scale versions or trial runs of planned investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313493248">Prescott &amp; Soeken, 1989</xref>). Their purpose can be wide ranging, including assessment of implementation issues related to design and methods such as recruitment strategies, sample availability, adequacy of measures, feasibility and acceptability of procedures, data collection, test of concept, and analysis plans. Pilot studies may be used to gain experience with the targeted sample, train study personnel, and to further understand the associated potential risks and study costs. Such studies help identify whether or not to pursue larger scale projects, and if so, areas for improvement leading to rigorous and feasible full-scale investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313493248">van Teijlingen, Rennie, Hundley, &amp; Graham, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313493248">Munro et al. (2013)</xref> have embarked on a trajectory of studying the extent to which blood oxytocin levels reflect healthy as well as impaired attachment in humans. Plasma oxytocin levels have been implicated as a potential biomarker for alterations in the attachment system, having possible relevance to clinical care of individuals with psychiatric conditions arising from early relational trauma, childhood maltreatment, and attachment dysregulation. Building on knowledge gleaned from preclinical studies (animal models), these investigators are interested in knowing if this biomarker can be a meaningful clinical index of alterations in attachment in persons with psychiatric disorders associated with impaired attachment. However, prior to examining the clinical utility among individuals with psychiatric conditions, the researchers first needed to examine the extent to which blood oxytocin levels reflect attachment-related stimuli in a nonclinical sample and to explore the possible association between patterns of oxytocin response and stress-related symptoms. While it is generally not the goal of a pilot study to provide definitive answers to hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313493248">Conn, Algase, Rawl, Zerwic, &amp; Wyman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313493248">Leon, Davis, &amp; Kraemer, 2011</xref>), this investigation sought to assess the feasibility of the protocol, gather preliminary data to test the concept proposed, and obtain initial findings to use in planning for sample size in future studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078390313493248">
<title>Feasibility and Acceptability</title>
<p>“Feasibility” and “acceptability” are common aspects of research protocols assessed in pilot studies. Feasibility generally refers to how likely things can be implemented with ease. Acceptability refers to the extent to which the participants find the procedures satisfactory. Munro and colleagues were able to assess the feasibility of several methodological aspects of the protocol. The pilot study demonstrated the ability to successfully use segments of a movie that has been used in a previous investigation of biological correlates of arousal and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313493248">Wirth &amp; Schultheiss, 2006</xref>). In the present investigation, the research team sought to demonstrate the ability to implement various film scenarios representing different types of attachment while also obtaining blood samples to assess possible relationships. The authors indicate that the film was acceptable to all participants, suggesting no perceived difficulties with this procedure.</p>
<p>Important to the measure of interest, these researchers demonstrated the ability to collect blood samples with relatively little difficulty. They learned of some challenges posed by the physical setting of blood sample collection relative to a different location for sample processing. They demonstrated the ability to measure blood levels of oxytocin in the selected setting, as well as measuring change in plasma oxytocin over time relative to different types of attachment exposure (e.g., bonding vs. abandonment). Furthermore, the investigators showed that it was feasible to administer and collect selected psychological measures to allow for the assessment of a potential relationship with biological measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078390313493248">
<title>Test of Concept</title>
<p>Preliminary “test of concept” was another important purpose of the pilot study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313493248">Munro et al. (2013)</xref>. As noted by the authors, while attachment style was not directly measured to validate the use of selected film segments, the advantage of using the scenarios was that they represented both positive and negative expressions of attachment, thus enhancing the ability to assess the specificity of the biomarker with adverse attachment. Furthermore, use of both positive and negative attachment segments minimized bias of exposure to only one type. Initial findings support the possible association between plasma oxytocin levels and negative attachment (as measured by an abandonment scenario) in a nonclinical sample. Further study is needed to demonstrate the provocation response in a clinical sample. While findings are tentative, and observed in a nonclinical sample, there is some suggestion that there may be relationships between plasma oxytocin levels and symptoms associated with stress. As noted by the authors, these initial findings need to be replicated in a larger sample as well as with a clinical sample that is more likely to exhibit the symptoms of interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078390313493248">
<title>Sample Size Estimates</title>
<p>Finally, the pilot investigation sought to obtain initial findings to help estimate the size of a sample, or number of participants, needed in a full-scale study. This is achieved by calculating the effect size (the magnitude of the expected association between variables or strength of the relationship) in conjunction with preferred level of statistical significance (known as alpha or <italic>p</italic> level; an indicator of the likelihood of a Type I error—rejecting the null hypothesis when true) and statistical power (known as beta; an indicator of Type II error—failure to reject the null hypothesis when false; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313493248">Hulley, Cummings, Browner, Grady, &amp; Newman, 2007</xref>). Pilot data are conventionally used for estimating sample size of larger studies and incorporated into sample estimates for grant applications seeking funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313493248">Beebe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313493248">Moore, Carter, Nietert, &amp; Stewart, 2010</xref>). However, others note the limitations in using crude estimates to project effect size of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313493248">Kraemer, Mintz, Noda, Tinklenberg, &amp; Yesavage, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313493248">Leon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313493248">Thabane et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1078390313493248">
<title>Interpretation of Findings</title>
<p>Pilot studies are exactly that—preliminary investigations that trial run the design and methods of a project. Because of this, as noted by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313493248">Munro et al., 2013</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313493248">Lancaster, Dodd, &amp; Williamson, 2004</xref>), pilot findings should be interpreted with caution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313493248">Perry (2001)</xref> notes that if pilot studies were generalizable then there would be no need for a larger study. Nevertheless, publication of rigorously designed and carefully conducted pilot projects can provide valuable information regarding implementation issues useful to other scientists planning future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313493248">Conn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313493248">Connelly, 2008</xref>).</p>
