<p>What if we grew food wherever we could—on farms, city parks, rooftops, and truck beds? Will Allen’s organization Growing Power in Milwaukee (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.growingpower.org">www.growingpower.org</ext-link>), Detroit’s transformation of vacant lots to community gardens, and school gardens growing across the country are examples of the food movement’s transformative power upon urban landscapes. <italic>Truck Farm</italic> chronicles the creation of an unusual farm in Brooklyn, New York, as Ian Cheney transforms the bed of his grandparents’ 1986 Dodge truck into a mobile farm. Filmmakers Cheney and Ellis have created a parable of an urban farm with a harvest that is much more than parsley, arugula, and tomatoes.</p>
<p>Instructors of high school, undergraduate, and graduate student audiences will each find aspects of the documentary engaging for their classes. The length of the documentary—48 minutes—makes it possible to view in one class session. <italic>Truck Farm</italic> is a great discussion resource for introductory sociology courses as a platform for questions about social inequality, social movements, and environmental justice. Students and instructors of sociology of the environment, sociology of community, and social change will find the documentary useful for the start of a more in-depth analysis of the contemporary local food movement in the United States. In conjunction with theoretical readings or case studies, the documentary acts as an important tool to illustrate the impact of alternative forms of agricultural production.</p>
<p>Through song, the musical group The Fishermen Three with Colin Cheney narrate the farm’s odyssey-like journey across the city. Cheney gains knowledge and inspiration through speaking with experts and visiting other innovative urban agriculture endeavors. A soil scientist, a physicist, and a rooftop garden expert provide technical assistance. Visits to a community garden and a rooftop farm in Brooklyn, a barge with a garden off of Staten Island, and a window farm in Chelsea empower Cheney to consider his truck farm project as a vehicle for more than just food. A solar-powered camera in the rear window of the truck snaps 12 photos an hour of the truck bed. The garden grows in fast time as the photos are looped, and in the background there is the blur of the city—buses, cars, dogs, children, commuters, families, baby strollers, and sunrise and sunset against the city’s skyline. This illustration of the urban landscape is an important reminder of the larger social, environmental, and economic contexts in which the truck farm grows.</p>
<p>Marion Nestle, nutritionist, NYU professor, and author of the books <italic>Food Politics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X13485557">Nestle 2007</xref>) and <italic>What to Eat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X13485557">Nestle 2006</xref>), among others, is the first recipient of the truck farm’s $20/season community supported agriculture (CSA) subscription. Cheney cuts the lettuce and herbs for her as she waits on the sidewalk. The truck bed offers arugula, basil, parsley, broccoli, peas, lavender, peppers—this is a diversified operation! A “Fresh Direct” delivery truck passes by during Cheney and Nestle’s exchange, reminding us of the growing industry in healthy foods being integrated within larger corporations—but are the two in competition? Nestle makes the point that the fresh and organic food at her local grocery might be shipped from California and already weeks old by the time it reaches her refrigerator. Cheney’s truck farm, in contrast, is immediate. She can watch it grow.</p>
<p><italic>Truck Farm</italic>, unlike Cheney and Ellis’s earlier documentary, <italic>King Corn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X13485557">Woolf 2007</xref>), does not aim to educate the public about the realities of a segment of our food system; rather, <italic>Truck Farm</italic> motivates and inspires the audience to look around their own town or city to see what might be transformed into a place to grow and fall in love with food again. It is not a failure of the documentary that it does not analyze the politics and inequalities of food distribution and access. The documentary’s seemingly simple premise—how to create a truck farm—creates a story that is accessible to a wide audience and possible to view through many lenses. Hints at the larger environmental justice or social context of the urban food system are illustrated through small moments such as the explanation that the Brooklyn soil cannot be used because it is too polluted. The chef at Blue Hill Restaurant asks whether the truck farm approach is not too simplistic for the complex problem of global food security. The light-hearted tone of the documentary shifts when, after the sale to the Blue Hill Restaurant, there is a theft from the truck bed garden. With the chef’s question echoing in his head, Cheney loses hope. Cheney’s sadness about the theft of the plant during the second growing season is not so much about the loss of the income as it is a reminder of the marginalization and vulnerability of those who dare to farm in a different or new way.</p>
<p>The truck farm presents an interesting model for community agriculture—the farm is mobile and its landscape is the city that it traverses to obtain new plants, more soil, and water and to distribute its produce to customers. Yet, as Cheney sells $3 worth of fresh herbs to the chef, one might ask whether the truck farm would ever be a financially profitable endeavor. The costs of water, soil, gas, truck maintenance, and, during the second growing season, a truck bed greenhouse make this model of agriculture input-intensive and expensive. Of course we cannot feed our urban areas through truck farms alone, but the film inspires us to reimagine urban space and its possibilities.</p>
<p>A phone call from Denver brings the documentary to an empowering close. The truck farm has started a movement inspiring creative solutions as people rethink the possibilities around them for community-motivated agriculture. Across the country, people of diverse ages and backgrounds are finding inspiration in his truck farm’s story and starting to re-imagine agriculture. Each spring and summer, the project tours around the United States to visit farmers markets, summer camps, and schools to share the story of the truck farm. The project’s website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.truck-farm.com">www.truck-farm.com</ext-link>) provides tour details.</p>
