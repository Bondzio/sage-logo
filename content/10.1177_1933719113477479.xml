<abstract>
<p>Endometriosis-associated infertility manifests itself via multiple, poorly understood mechanisms. Our goal was to characterize signaling pathways, between peritoneal endometriotic lesions and the ovary, leading to failed ovulation. Genome-wide microarray analysis comparing ovarian tissue from an in vivo endometriosis model in the rat (Endo) with controls (Sham) identified 22 differentially expressed genes, including transiently expressed early growth response factor 1 (<italic>Egr1</italic>). The <italic>Egr1</italic> regulates gene requisites for ovulation. The <italic>Egr1</italic> promoter is responsive to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) signaling. We hypothesized that altered expression of ovarian EGR1 is induced by elevated peritoneal fluid TNF-α which is upregulated by the presence of peritoneal endometriosis. Endo rats, compared to controls, had more peritoneal fluid TNF-α and quantitative, spatial differences in <italic>Egr1 mRNA </italic>and EGR1 protein localization in follicular compartments. Interactions between elevated peritoneal fluid TNF-α and overexpression of follicular <italic>Egr1/</italic>EGR1 expression may affect downstream protease pathways impeding ovulation in endometriosis. Preliminary studies identified similar patterns of EGR1 protein localization in human ovaries from women with endometriosis and compared to those without endometriosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth of endometrial tissue in ectopic locations outside of the uterine lining is the hallmark of a gynecological disease called endometriosis, affecting 10% to 15% of women of reproductive age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113477479">1</xref>
</sup> The presence of endometriotic lesions in the peritoneal cavity is commonly associated with pain and subfertility, yet mechanisms causing these conditions in endometriosis are diverse and not well characterized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113477479">1</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Pituitary–ovarian dysfunction manifested as abnormal patterns of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion including a delayed and reduced amplitude LH surge and LH receptor (LHR) disorder contribute to infertility in women with endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477479">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113477479">7</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113477479">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719113477479">12</xref> </sup>Such anomalies, directly or indirectly, may account for impaired follicular growth, reduced dominant follicle size, fewer mature ovarian follicles, and decreased ovulation in women with endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719113477479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719113477479">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719113477479">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719113477479">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The process of ovulation is normally controlled through multiple temporal inputs, including protein and steroid hormones, metabolic signals, intrafollicular paracrine factors from the theca, mural, and cumulus granulosa cells and the oocyte.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719113477479">14</xref>
</sup> Animal models replicating signs and symptoms of human disease have provided opportunities for in-depth characterization of mechanisms involved in the process of ovulation in women with endometriosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719113477479">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Initiating with a peak in serum estradiol from the ovary, causing the pituitary LH surge and culminating in follicular rupture and extrusion of an oocyte, rat models facilitate studies of mechanisms of human disease. Such studies include intracellular signaling, gene regulation, and tissue remodeling in the ovary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719113477479">16</xref>
</sup> The LH surge induces transient expression of numerous ovarian genes, including early growth response factor 1 (<italic>Egr1</italic>) which is requisite for ovulation. Subsequently, LH-induced <italic>Egr1</italic> transcription in the ovary activates expression of other genes involved in ovulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719113477479">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719113477479">18</xref>
</sup> Then <italic>Egr1</italic> promotes expression of LHR as well as temporal differences in protease and inhibitor expression and activity in the ovarian follicle, which are important for ovulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719113477479">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, the <italic>Egr1</italic> promoter is highly responsive to diverse biochemical signals including inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719113477479">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719113477479">21</xref>
</sup> Elevated levels of TNF-α in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis compared to those without the condition may induce <italic>Egr1</italic> gene expression as seen in several common inflammatory diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719113477479">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719113477479">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719113477479">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesized that abnormal signaling in the pituitary–ovarian pathway and/or inflammatory factors in the peritoneal environment from endometriotic lesions alter regulation of ovarian EGR1 protein and downstream mediators requisite for ovulation, which correlate with ovulatory dysfunction in endometriosis. The goal of this study was to examine serum LH levels, ovarian LHRs, and the concentration of peritoneal fluid TNF-α in relation to ovarian <italic>Egr1</italic> expression and ovulatory dysfunction in an established model of endometriosis. Further to initiate translation of these data to the human, cell-specific localization of EGR1 in ovaries from women with and without endometriosis was evaluated.</p>

<title>Endometriosis Model Surgeries</title>
<p>Mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g; Harlan, Madison, Wisconsin) were acclimated to the vivarium for 14 days prior to surgery. The peritoneal endometriosis (Endo, n = 12) and control (Sham, n = 12) surgeries were performed as previously described and routinely used in our laboratory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719113477479">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719113477479"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719113477479">26</xref>
</sup> Briefly, in Endo rats, the left uterine horn and ovary were removed and four 2-mm sections (implants) of the uterine horn were autotransplanted into every other arterial cascade of the small intestine beginning at the cecum. Sham rats also had the left uterine horn and ovary removed without transplantation of uterine sections. One week after surgery, daily evaluation of vaginal cytology confirmed the rats had normal 4- to 5-day reproductive cycles in order to facilitate growth of the endometriotic implants. The use of animals in these experiments was approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accord with the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Washington, DC: National Academy Press).</p>
<p>Four weeks from the date of surgery following growth and establishment of the peritoneal implants, experiments began. A luteinizing hormone receptor hormone (LHRH) agonist (40 µg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) was used to synchronize, not superovulate, the rats reproductive cycles as routinely performed in our laboatory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719113477479">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719113477479">26</xref>
</sup> Between 8:00 and 10:00 <sc>am</sc> on the morning of the first estrus after synchronization (∼ 6-8 hours postovulation) as evidenced by the presence of cornified epithelial cells in the vaginal lavage, rats were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719113477479">
<title>Sample Collection and Processing From the Model</title>
<p>Blood was collected by aortic puncture and aspiration (Sardstedt Monovette Syringe, Newton, North Carolina). Serum was isolated by centrifugation at 13 000 g for 30 minutes and stored at −80°C for analysis of serum LH concentrations. Serum LH was quantified in triplicate by the University of Virginia Center for Research in Reproduction, Ligand Assay and Analysis Core Facility National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NIH, SCCPRR Grant U54-HD28934, Charlottesville, Virginia) using a sandwich immunoradiometric assay.</p>
<p>Peritoneal fluid was collected by injecting 1 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, into the peritoneal cavity, massaging the abdomen and aspirating as much fluid as possible. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the clear, straw-colored fluids were frozen at −80°C for subsequent quantification of TNF-α. The TNF-α was quantified in peritoneal fluid aspirates in triplicate using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit specific for rat TNF-α (RayBioTech, Norcross, Georgia). The concentration of TNF-α in peritoneal fluid was determined by the standard curve method and normalization against total protein concentration in each sample.</p>
<p>The remaining ovary was excised and surrounding adnexa was removed. One-half of each ovary was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for whole genome expression analysis. The remaining half of the ovary was formalin fixed, routinely processed, and paraffin embedded for spatial, cell-specific messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein localization. The presence of oocytes in ampulla of the oviducts of all rats further documented the postovulatory stage of the reproductive cycle.</p>

<sec id="section5-1933719113477479">
<title>Genome-Wide Microarray Analysis of Ovarian Gene Expression</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from approximately ∼25 mg of rat ovarian tissue (approximately one-quarter of the frozen ovary) using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Valencia, California) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, including the optional on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). RNA was eluted from the column with 40 uL of RNase-free water. This elution was repeated using the first eluate to increase the RNA concentration and yield. Quality and quantity of the total RNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE).</p>
<p>Total RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the NuGen wt-ovation Pico RNA Amplification Kit (San Carlos, California). Biotinylated complementary RNA was hybridized to the Illumina RatRef-12 Expression Bead Chip (San Diego, California). This genome-wide array contains 22,523 probes selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence database. An Illumina BeadArray Reader identified differential gene expression between Endo and Sham rat ovaries, which Asuragen (Austin, Texas) quantified.</p>

<sec id="section6-1933719113477479">
<title>Microarray Results Validated Using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>To validate the microarray results and quantify the selected genes, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed. Total RNA was isolated from another quarter of the same frozen rat ovary (∼25 mg) with the same protocol used to isolate RNA for the microarray. The final total RNA volume was 35 µL. RNA quality was analyzed by an Agilent Bioanalyzer at the University of Missouri–Columbia DNA Core. The ovarian RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the Roche First strand cDNA synthesis kit for qRT-PCR (Basel, Switzerland). The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-fold for qRT-PCR.</p>
<p>The qRT-PCR was performed in a 25 µL reaction volume that contained 1 µL of diluted cDNA, 1 µL primer mix and 12.5 µL Sybr green buffer from SuperArray Bioscience Inc (Bethesda, Maryland) and assayed in an ABI 7500 Smart Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California). Gene expression of 18 s ribosomal RNA facilitated normalization of the target gene expression. Primers for <italic>Egr1</italic> and 18 s were purchased from SuperArray Bioscience Inc.</p>

<sec id="section7-1933719113477479">
<title>Cell-Specific Localization of Egr1 mRNA in the Ovary</title>
<p>Spatial localization of <italic>Egr1</italic> mRNA in the ovary was identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization (ISH). All reagents and equipment used were ISH dedicated and free from RNAases. Formalin-fixed, processed, paraffin-embedded, ovarian tissues were sectioned at 8 µm specifically for ISH. Tissues on Super Frost slides (Fisher Scientific) were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded series of xylene, ethanol, and water washes. A pretreatment buffer of 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.05% Tween at 95°c for 20 minutes permeablized the tissues for hybridization. Endogenous peroxide was blocked using 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes were designed using PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa) for use as sense (GTA ATT TCA GTC GTA GTG ACC ACC T) and antisense (AGG TGG TCA CTA CGA CTG AAA TTA C) DNA probes with 100% identity to rat <italic>Egr1</italic> in exon 2 (NM_012551.2). Tissues were hybridized overnight at 37°C with a hybridization buffer containing 20% 20× sodium citrate buffer (SSC), 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 20% w/v dextran sulfate, 10 mg/mL sonicated salmon sperm, and the oligonucleotide probe at 1.0 ng/mL.</p>
<p>The next day, tissues were washed in 1:50 saline–SSC wash at 45°C for 20 minutes then rinsed in Tween 20 Tris-Buffered Saline. Tissue sections were blocked against nonspecific avidin binding at 37°C for 30 minutes with 1× ISH blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California). Tissue sections were then incubated for 30 minutes with fluorescent avidin tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon), and cover slipped with anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).</p>
<p>Hybridization staining was quantified using a conventional fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, 114 Zeiss Axiopath Systems, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, New York). Immunofluorescent localization in the ovarian follicular theca and granulosa cells was quantified morphometrically by area fraction as described previously.<sup>

<title>A Role for EGR1 in Ovulatory Dysfunction Leading to Infertility in Endometriosis</title>
<p>Molecular pathways set into motion when a preovulatory follicle receives an ovulatory LH stimulus to initiate a complex, interrelated cascade of events leading to ovulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719113477479">14</xref> </sup>We hypothesized that in endometriosis, abnormal pituitary–ovarian pathways and/or the inflammatory peritoneal environment function to regulate expression of ovarian <italic>Egr1</italic>/EGR1 and downstream mediators requisite for ovulation and correlate with ovulatory dysfunction.</p>
<p>The EGR1 is a phosphoroprotein with an extended transcriptional activation domain on the N-terminus and a DNA-binding domain, consisting of 3 zinc finger motifs. These motifs bind to the GC-rich sequence 5’-GCGGGGGCG-3’ and are rapidly activated in many cell types by numerous stimuli.<sup>29 </sup>The EGR1, via coupling with extracellular signals, is believed to elicit long-term responses by altering expression of EGR1 target genes. The targeted gene products are then responsible for the physiological or pathophysiological alterations that result from cellular stimulation and EGR1 biosynthesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719113477479">29</xref> </sup>In a tissue-/cell-specific manner and conserved across species from rabbit to human, EGR1 reportedly participates in diverse roles regulating the cell cycle, growth and signaling, tissue remodeling, differentiation, and apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719113477479">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719113477479">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The<italic> Egr1</italic> in the ovary binds promoter elements of many of genes altering pathways important for ovarian function. Knocking out <italic>Egr1</italic> in the mouse demonstrated that EGR1 is essential for ovulation.<sup>

For example, abnormal expression of cathepsin L in ovarian granulosa cells and/or alternations in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) in granulosa cells and thecal cells have been associated with ovarian dysfunction.<sup>

</sup> As demonstrated in our laboratory, TIMP1 synthesized and secreted from endometriotic lesions localizes in ovarian thecal cells of Endo but not Sham rats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719113477479">25</xref>
</sup> Endometriotic TIMP1 localization in the theca is associated with decreased follicular growth, decreased ovulation, and decreased fecundity.<sup>

<title>Serum LH and Ovarian LHR</title>
<p>In women with endometriosis, infertility might be a consequence of a defect in mechanisms mediating serum LH and ovarian LHR action.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719113477479">17</xref>
</sup> These models have shown that increasing serum LH concentrations cause induction of <italic>Egr1</italic> expression in ovarian thecal and granulosa cells in the rat.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719113477479">18</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719113477479">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet in our study, the similarity of serum LH concentrations between Endo and Sham rats suggests that overexpression of <italic>Egr1</italic> in the ovary is not induced via a serum LH surge mechanism. In turn, elevated ovarian EGR1 concentrations in endometriosis did not promote expression of LHR as per the typical role of EGR1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719113477479">19</xref>
</sup> Plausible interpretations include lack of an LH-EGR1-LHR mechanism in ovarian dysfunction in endometriosis or the use of LHRH to synchronize the estrous cycles in this model. Also, other studies did not report the reproductive cycle stage at the time of sample collection. All of the rats in our study were euthanatized between 8:00 and 10:00 <sc>am</sc> on the morning of the estrus stage. Hence, the different hormonal milieu of each reproductive stage may be related to the varying results. Different testing methods or different rat strains may also account for these discrepancies. These disparities remain to be resolved.</p>

<sec id="section21-1933719113477479">
<title>Peritoneal Fluid TNF-α</title>
<p>Women with endometriosis have elevated levels of TNF-α in their peritoneal fluid, which may be necessary for establishment and maintenance of endometriosis. Peritoneal fluid TNF-α has also been associated with infertility through inhibition of sperm motility and function and oocyte development.<sup>

</sup> As in women with endometriosis, our studies have shown that rats used to model endometriosis-associated subfertility have significantly more TNF-α in their peritoneal fluid compared to controls. Others have also reported elevated levels of peritoneal fluid TNF-α in Endo rats correlate with increased numbers of activated macrophages.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719113477479">40</xref>

</sup> Hence TNF-α may bind to and increase expression of <italic>Egr1 </italic>in this endometriosis model.</p>
<p>Thereby we propose a model whereby elevated TNF-α in peritoneal fluid that bathes the ovary incites EGR1 biosynthesis. Then, abnormal amounts and localization of EGR1 in the ovary disrupt normal cell signaling and gene expression required for ovulation. In turn, excessive ovarian thecal cell EGR1 may mediate tissue remodeling in the ovary in endometriosis essential for ovulation via inference with the metalloproteinase/inhibitor pathway<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Endometriosis is a common disease among reproductive age women and elucidating the mechanism behind reduced fecundity seen in these women is important. The etiology of infertility in endometriosis likely involves numerous mechanisms that may be confounded by interpretation. Abnormal hormone production, receptor function, peritoneal fluid inflammatory mediators and ovulatory dysfunction may individually or synergistically play a role in endometriosis-associated infertility.<sup>

<p>Collectively, results from this study support a correlation between elevated concentrations of TNF-α in peritoneal fluid, upregulation of follicular EGR1, and its association with altered expression of downstream genes and proteins involved in ovulatory dysfunction in endometriosis, directly in the endometriosis model and indirectly in women. Further insights into the outcomes of elevated TNF-α in peritoneal fluid and increased EGR1 in the ovary in endometriosis and its effect on ovarian function may help develop novel therapeutic targets for ovulatory dysfunction via the use of inhibitors or antagonists to TNF-α action.</p>
