<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A key question for trade unions is how and in what ways they might develop capacities to better deal with the array of challenges they face, particularly in relation to the broader implications of restructuring processes for work and employment. This article examines union responses to processes of restructuring within one sector, and argues for trade unions to articulate alternative perspectives to prevailing corporate practice. The argument is made with reference to the consolidation and restructuring of the European Union (EU) steel industry and is specifically focused on the increasing centrality of training and high skills to industry developments. Worker engagement with training and learning opportunities is to a large extent subject to the decisions made by employers and union involvement is often uneven and partial, with significant differences in the platforms for negotiation and consultation within EU member states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11404577">Bosch and Charest, 2008</xref>). More particularly, entitlement to formal training and the capacity to access informal learning are factors constitutive of the balance of power in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11404577">Rainbird et al., 2004</xref>: 40). Union engagement is made more difficult and complex – but nonetheless all the more crucial as part of wider processes of union renewal – by international/global processes of modernization and restructuring across companies and individual sectors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref> on the conditions for union response to processes of globalization, and within this context opportunities for union renewal).</p>
<p>A central proposition of this article is that trade union involvement in training and workplace learning is essential to ensure that workers are in a position to adapt readily to changing circumstances and bargain from a strong position (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11404577">Healey and Engel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11404577">Mahnkopf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck, 1994</xref>). The context in which this proposition is advanced is with reference to the increasing international consolidation of key industrial sectors, such as steel. The argument has two dimensions. First, trade unions need to engage with training and workplace learning practices in more direct and involved ways than allowed for by current partnership arrangements (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11404577">Heery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>). This involvement is to protect workers’ interests, promote worker development and to develop jobs as decent jobs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11404577">Rainbird et al., 2004</xref>). The article explores, in this respect, the issue of poor levels of union engagement with corporate training strategies and the organization of learning across the EU steel industry, particularly in respect of continuing training and a perceived reliance by companies on informal workplace learning. The suggestion is that members’ interests are compromised by inadequate approaches based on servicing members, rather than developing an active and direct engagement with training and learning policy and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2008</xref>). The assessment is of national union engagement with training and learning in the industry and the reach and effectiveness of current partnership approaches on training.</p>
<p>Second, the article argues that more focused union engagement on training and learning requires that they consider their organizational capacities in two respects, within national contexts and across borders. For unions this is realized through the strategic framing of interests and engaging with processes of cooperation through the pursuit of: (1) cross-border strategies between national unions; and (2) union engagement in sector-level approaches (for context see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11404577">Tarrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11404577">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11404577">Anner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11404577">Hyman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull, 2009</xref> for related discussions). The question here is one of steel union strategy and organizational capacity, particularly within the broader context of significant and internationalized processes of modernization and restructuring across the EU industry, and the increasing centrality that workforce development, recruitment and retention strategies play in these processes. Recent evidence on union involvement in social dialogue suggests limitations to partnership approaches, particularly with regard to tension between social partners on the shape and focus of the training and learning agenda (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11404577">Stuart and Wallis, 2007</xref>). The analysis in this article focuses on the conditions and circumstances for cross-border cooperation and coordination of union response to management decisions, through the development of sector level and national union to national union strategies, as a way of influencing processes of restructuring and addressing new and emergent (sector) challenges (for wider context see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11404577">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2009</xref> for specific discussion of the EU steel industry).</p>
<p>The article employs case study research on the EU steel industry, including observations of the Steel Sector Social Dialogue Committee (SSSDC) and its steering group on Workforce Development, Recruitment and Retention (SSSDC-WDRR). What follows begins with a discussion of the analytical themes that concern this article. An account of the EU steel industry and its processes of restructuring is then presented, before I provide details of the research approach. A fourth section examines approaches by steel unions in relation to training, discussing the importance of the agenda for steel trade unions and current union engagement with the training agenda at the sector level. Discussion and concluding remarks complete the article.</p>

<title>Themes</title>
<p>This article addresses the themes of training and (workplace) learning, and trade union participation in this important area of work and employment. The focus of this article is less on initial forms of training, such as apprenticeships, and more on continuing training – programmes aimed at the further training of an existing employed workforce, including in-house programmes within an organization or enterprise – and workplace learning. Understandings of what is meant exactly by training as opposed to workplace learning often rest on spatial understandings, which have much to do with the extent to which learning and work can be separated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11404577">Butler et al., 2004</xref>). Stevens et al. (2002: 13) suggest, for example, that training is away from the job and a formal learning experience generally delivered by professional trainers, whereas workplace learning is informal, incidental, experiential and on or close to the job. However, these boundaries can become blurred and contested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11404577">Lee et al., 2004</xref> for an overview). There is more certainty that both workplace learning and training occur within the context of broader social arrangements, which are defined by national systems of Vocational Education and Training (VET) and the organizational structures and processes that define employing enterprises and their training and learning practices (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11404577">Koike, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether organized formally or informally, training and learning is a key part of the way firms develop, ‘modernize’ and meet competitive and market pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck, 1994</xref>). For workers too, learning (and acquiring qualifications) is an important protection against employment instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2000</xref>). Of course, workforce development is not always a priority for employers, and might even be viewed as a threat to managerial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2000</xref>); in which case, access to learning opportunities can be heavily restricted and controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11404577">Fuller and Unwin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006</xref>). In some cases, workforce development is viewed by some employers as an unnecessary cost where work is defined as routine and standardized or where labour can be readily substituted. Evidence indicates that there is a greater likelihood of training provision if a workplace is unionized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11404577">Kersley et al., 2006</xref>). Certainly, involvement in corporate training strategies and workplace learning opportunities would seem to be in the interests of trade unions, through, for example, the enhancement of member skills and qualifications profiles and thus their bargaining power and broader employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There are, moreover, obvious reasons why trade unions would want to enhance the competitiveness of an employer and secure market position by adopting strategies that enhance workforce skill profiles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11404577">Mahnkopf (1991)</xref> outlines how the adoption of a progressive ‘skill-orientated strategy’ (as opposed to a regressive and defensive price-oriented strategy) by trade unions challenges the employers’ prerogative with regard to training; enhances bargaining positions in the restructuring process; and combats deskilling. Others suggest that trade unions should ‘embrace skill formation’ as part of a ‘new cooperative, and productive strategy’, while at the same time insisting on a power base to impose rules and obligations on employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck, 1994</xref>: 252; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11404577">Healey and Engel, 2003</xref>). Unions might also work to challenge the employability perspective that dominates the workplace learning/training agenda – with which unions have to date been largely complicit – and invoke a democratic citizenship framework for learning, which frames employability within trade unions’ ‘wider societal objectives and aspirations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11404577">Forrester, 2005</xref>: 258).</p>
<p>The reasons for union engagement with the training and learning agenda appears clear, and the scope for trade union involvement in training and learning decisions and strategies seems to be widening. There are, for example, policy initiatives at European and EU member state level that facilitate and support the development of training and learning through social dialogue and partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>: 189; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>: 342–3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11404577">Heidemann et al., 1994</xref> on the EU Commission’s proposed EU framework for transnational bargaining for multinational companies and sectors). Here, Stuart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">2007</xref>: 278) suggests ‘tensions around the competing definitions, value and purpose of learning and skills’, but there are clear examples of where the promotion by unions of learning opportunities for their members, often in partnership with government and employers and within the broader discourse of lifelong learning, has been an ‘important success story’ for trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11404577">Forrester, 2004</xref>: 413; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2009</xref>). The Union Learning Representative (ULR) programme in the UK, where such representatives have been tasked with promoting learning partnerships with employers, provides one such example. More particularly, such arrangements have laid the potential for a revival of trade unionism (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11404577">Forrester, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11404577">Heery, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The bargaining process and social dialogue, including partnership approaches, remains one of the primary ways in which trade unions might seek to influence the training and learning agenda. Generally, the shape of union (and company) engagement with training and learning tends to reflect national systems of VET. Such systems are distinct, often contain sector-specific dimensions, and are shaped by specific histories that reflect both established social partner cooperation and diverse forms of work organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11404577">Bosch and Charest, 2008</xref>). A wider classification indicates that there are clear differences between VET arrangements in liberal market and coordinated market economies, particularly in relation to apprenticeships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11404577">Bosch and Charest, 2008</xref>: 429–30). For example, in the coordinated market economies (e.g. Germany and Netherlands), trade unions and employers work together (supported by governments) to ensure credentialization and related recognition at initial levels of training systems. In contrast, these arrangements are subject to limited collective bargaining in liberal market economies (such as the UK) and there is restricted capacity for trade union confederations and associated employer organizations in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11404577">Bosch and Charest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11404577">Keep et al., 2008</xref>). It is important to note, however, that union engagement in continuing training remains limited across Europe more generally, even where partnership approaches are well established and ‘corporatist’ approaches to VET are pursued, such as in Germany (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11404577">Crouch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref>). Of further note is the way institutional and regulatory apparatus lead to asymmetry in training provision across and within multinationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Social dialogue and partnership on training and learning is also evident at a transnational level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>). Focusing on Europe, Gennard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">2009</xref>: 341–2) identifies three levels at which social dialogue takes place in this regard: cross-sectoral, sectoral and company level through European works councils. The latter are consultation bodies, not negotiating bodies, and cover the rights of all employees, not only trade union employees. At a cross-sectoral level the European Commission consults with the social partners (Business Europe, European Centre of Employers and Enterprises [CEEP] and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises [UEAPME] on the employers’ side and the European Trade Union Confederation [ETUC] on the employees’ side) on the general direction of social policy and specific proposed measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>: 341–2). At this level a framework of actions for the lifelong development of competencies and qualifications was implemented in 2002. The sector level is configured upon European Industry Federations/Confederations (EIFs) and Sectoral Dialogue Committees, and focuses on affiliates agreeing non-binding codes, guidelines and joint opinions to implement at national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>) – which may include training (on EIFs see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11404577">Erne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11404577">Hyman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The value of social partnership approaches is however contested, with some unions hostile to what they see as an ‘emasculation of trade union purpose’ and a weakening of the employees’ position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>: 195–200). On training and learning specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes (2007)</xref> suggests union involvement in social dialogue and partnership is likely to create tensions between social partners, particularly in relation to how interests are defined and for whom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11404577">Stuart and Wallis, 2007</xref>). Indeed, it is suggested that the shape and form of learning processes and opportunities might suffer in the collective bargaining process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>). There is, moreover, robust evidence that employers tend not to inform union representatives of training plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11404577">Kersley et al., 2006</xref>: 124–5), and trade union promotion of and involvement in training is found to be uneven (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11404577">Munro and Rainbird, 2000</xref>). Debates on the merits and shortcomings of partnership and social dialogue are extensive, increasingly so with regard to training (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref> and a special edition of the <italic>European Journal of Industrial Relations</italic> edited by Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>), but the purpose of this present article is particular. The aim here is to give a broader consideration to the organizational and strategic capacities of unions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>), and how unions might make use of them in relation to training.</p>

<title>The EU steel industry</title>
<p>The EU steel sector is becoming increasingly global in its activities, particularly through processes of consolidation (as evidenced by the mergers of Arcelor and Mittal in 2006 and the acquisition of Corus by Tata in 2007). These multinational corporations are progressively more involved in acquiring and securing relationships with suppliers of raw materials (e.g. iron ore, coke) and transportation (i.e. shipping) across the world. At the same time there have been heavy job losses, which have been paralleled by changes in work organization and demands for more highly qualified and multi-skilled workers, a process supported by increasingly sophisticated training and learning strategies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11404577">Bacon and Blyton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006</xref>). More recent deliberations focus on the demands placed on the industry by EU climate policy, with the need to cut carbon emissions adding a new dimension to debates on change within the industry. Certainly, as the industry continues to restructure, ‘modernize’ – technologically and otherwise – and be shaped by wider events there are important implications, if not stark consequences, for workers and their representatives.</p>
<p>During the postwar period steel industry trade unions enjoyed a significant degree of influence within the sector and the EU. From the initial founding of the EU steel unions have played a part in the way the industry has been shaped at a policy level (for example, through the European Coal and Steel Community – ECSC). Generally, however, unions increasingly face two contradictory developments, one concerned with the internationalization of steel corporations and the other located in the ever greater political and economic integration of the EU. Indeed, within processes of Europeanization, EU policy-makers present unions with a further parallel set of contradictory developments: neoliberal competitiveness and common terms and conditions of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11404577">Room, 2005</xref>). Part of the latter rests on an increased emphasis on ‘Social Dialogue’, which has often taken the form of European works councils (EWCs), but national unions have been unevenly involved in these processes; highlighting a national embeddedness with regard to union efforts to deal with European integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11404577">Anner et al., 2006</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Specific to steel, the end of the ECSC in 2002 resulted in the SSSDC being established in 2006. The committee provides a platform for dialogue at the European level, and involves the major European-based steel companies (through Eurofer, the employers’ organization) and the trade unions (through the European Metalworkers’ Federation [EMF], the industry’s union confederation). The SSSDC provides European steel unions with the opportunity to address the implications and outcomes of the changes that have taken place in the EU steel industry over recent years. Recognizing the increasing importance of training and learning to the steel sector, the EMF pushed for the SSSDC to convene a steering group on Workforce Development, Recruitment and Retention (WDRR) in 2009. This is paralleled by similar efforts within the European Steel Technology Platform (ESTEP) to develop a training agenda. ESTEP brings together a range of industry ‘stakeholders’, including unions, to tackle various industry issues, but it is not discussed in detail here.</p>

<title>Research</title>
<p>This article employs data from ongoing research, begun in 2000, on the EU steel industry. The research conducted over the past 10 years has focused on a number of different but interrelated sector issues: restructuring and redundancy; workforce reconfiguration and equal opportunities; and, in particular, skills and training needs. The period over which data have been collected offers the opportunity to assess and evaluate union engagement across the EU sector over time, and thus provides a long-term perspective on change. The research data are derived from extensive case study research, complemented by participant observation of the EU steel sector social dialogue process. The detail of training and learning approaches is outlined with reference to two international steel corporations: ThyssenKrupp Stahl AG (TKS) and Corus. The union strategy development is considered in relation to the activity of the SSSDC and SSSDC-WDRR.</p>
<p>Corus has its roots in the merger in 1999 between British Steel and Koninklijke Hoogovens, a Dutch steel producer, to create Corus plc. Following the merger the company immediately underwent extensive processes of retrenchment and restructuring, which resulted in significant job losses. Corus was then acquired by the Indian conglomerate Tata in 2007, and became a subsidiary of the Tata Steel Group (TSG). It operates as part of Tata Steel Europe (TSE) and has experienced further recent cuts to its workforce. It currently employs in the region of 37,000 people, and is the second largest producer of steel in Europe (as part of TSE). The Corus case study sites discussed in this article are IJmuiden in the Netherlands (employing 9500) and Port Talbot (between 3750 and 5000), Shotton (600) and Trostre (450) in the UK.</p>
<p>TKS was formed following a merger of the German companies Krupp-Hoesch AG and Thyssen Stahl AG in 1997. Like Corus it implemented an extensive programme of restructuring following the merger. For example, as part of its divisional review TKS proposed transferring the production of 150,000 tons per year of low-grade electrical steel from Terni – in southern Umbria and one of this article’s case study sites – to other steelworks, as well as ending the production of specified high-grade steels. Terni, however, remains operational employing in the region of 3000 workers. The much larger second TKS case study site in Duisburg employs approximately 13,000 people. ThyssenKrupp has approximately 51,000 employees across steel enterprises worldwide and is the third largest steel producer in Europe.</p>
<p>The case studies informing this article involved 27 individual and 36 panel interviews to a standard (and semi-structured) format addressing skills and learning (2001–4) and workforce recomposition and equality and diversity (2004–7). Each set of project interviews involved different people. More recent training evaluation research at Corus Port Talbot in 2009 and 2010 replicated the shape and form of these case studies. The panel interviews involved production workers and operators, team leaders, apprentices and section/production managers and the individual interviews involved training staff, trade union officials or officers, human resources managers and company directors or senior managers. The aim of the case study method was to elicit different perspectives from workers on the same issues, and allow workers to consider themes in general terms.</p>
<p>The second stage of the research involved participant observation of the SSSDC and associated committees from 2006 to 2009. The latter included attendance at SSSDC meetings in Belgium and Italy over the latter period, as well as attendance at all three of the SSSDC’s workshops and steering groups on Workforce Development, Recruitment and Retention in 2009 (subsequent meetings are scheduled for 2010 and 2011). The SSSDC and SSSDC-WDRR meetings were attended by representatives of affiliate unions to the EMF, the EMF general secretary and/or deputy general secretary and the EMF’s steel policy advisor, as well as officers from the employers’ federation, Eurofer, and representatives from its affiliate companies. A member of the European Commission’s (EC) Directorate General (DG) for Employment also attended the SSSDC-WDRR meetings to provide data and information on the direction of the EC’s skills and employment policy. More detail is provided in subsequent sections of the article of the various committees and their functions.</p>
<p>I was invited by the EMF to the SSSDC meetings to make presentations on different aspects of the industry, such as equal opportunities and training and learning. I attended the SSSDC-WDRR as an advisor to the EMF on sector skills and training policy and practice. There are evident implications for my (and, at various times, a colleague’s) involvement in these processes. For example, presentations to the SSSDC and SSSDC-WDRR help set the agenda for discussion and my role as advisor to the EMF has partiality implications. Nonetheless, the SSSDC meetings offered the opportunity to observe deliberations on a range of industry issues (e.g. structural change, health and safety, EU climate policy), whereas discussions at the SSSDC-WDRR was more obviously focused and allowed for engagement with employer and employee representatives on the specific issues tackled in this article. The observations made are employed specifically to evidence union and employer approaches to sector developments, and complement more generally the case study data.</p>

<title>Training in the EU steel industry</title>
<p>The steel industry has undergone a dramatic period of rationalization and restructuring and these processes continue. The recent economic downturn has intensified industry pressures, with subsequent implications for the industry’s workforce and for the shape of work and employment more generally. In turn, the question arises of why it is difficult to mobilize and develop organizational capacity around issues like training, particularly when the industry continues to restructure and workers need to be better placed to resist and recover from processes of restructuring, redundancy and retrenchment.</p>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11404577">
<title>Current practice</title>
<p>As the industry’s restructuring processes have unfolded, companies and unions have been concerned to develop the appropriate capacities to facilitate change. For companies more than unions, part of this has involved a consideration of new and emerging training needs precipitated by developments in the workforce profile, technological changes and the broader processes of restructuring. Increasing consolidation within the sector and the emergence of multinational corporate entities, international or global in scale and scope, means that from country to country companies deal with workforces that have different experiences of education and hold a different array of qualifications. The qualification profile of a workforce and the training provision within a company – steel or otherwise – is very much a reflection of nationally defined (education and) VET arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11404577">Bosch and Charest, 2008</xref>). Thus, the basis of company training strategy – particularly with regard to formal programmes and initial training (e.g. apprenticeships) – differs from country to country, as does the scope for trade union involvement in training.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, for example, where the works council and the Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV) union federation (and affiliate trade unions) adopt proactive and codetermined strategies with regard to workforce development, Corus has developed a fairly comprehensive set of training arrangements and, of particular note, a Practical Craftsmanship Programme (PCP) for low-skilled workers (interview notes, 2002 and 2010; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>). High levels of codetermination evident in Germany also allow the trade unions greater influence over training, principally through the Bundesinstitut für Berusfsbildung (Federal Institute for Vocational Training) and the works councils (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>). The social partnership approach and involvement of IG Metall in both corporate and plant management policy-making is more likely to create favourable contexts for the pursuit of skills-orientated strategies, as a union official observed:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . the future occupational profiles for the steel industry are developed in an institute for vocational training in Berlin . . . and they have representatives there from trade unions and employers. . . . The trade unions make sure these professions are multi-functional . . . trade unions are also putting in effort [to] get a much stronger relationship to their company during training. (IG Metall official, 2002)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the UK and Italy, however, the approach was very much management directed. Within the Corus UK plants there was limited involvement from the unions, with no structured discussion and no right to bargain about training (interview notes, 2002, 2005 and 2010; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>: 350–5). Indeed, within the workplace, the major UK operators’ union, Community, follows traditional methods and lines of representation, which largely ignores the training and learning agenda (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>: 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11404577">Stuart and Wallis, 2007</xref>). There are also significant differences in the organization and structure of training in the TKS Italy plant when compared with the plant in Germany. Indeed, while acknowledging the complexity of Italian industrial relations and in this respect the scope for ‘differences’ between unions, the Italian metalworkers’ trade union section of the Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro (FIOM-CGIL) suggests an adversarial relationship not much focused on the development of training: ‘No we are not participating [in training]. It is entirely a matter for the company’ (FIOM-CGIL official, 2002).</p>
<p>The way training is organized across a company differs from place to place, and union involvement in training reflects more broadly the extent to which social partnership operates nationally. However, where higher levels of formal union engagement on training through partnership approaches exist, they do not necessarily guarantee improved outcomes for workers (such as better access to training and qualifications), nor do they meet demands for continuous lifelong learning and create (equal) opportunities to upgrade skills in parallel with industry developments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>). Indeed, where such partnership arrangements exist, accommodating the demands for continuous lifelong learning remains problematic and, in Germany particularly, ‘attempts by trade unions to encourage joint regulation of all worker training have, in the main, been unsuccessful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004b</xref>: 31). What is agreed in partnership does not always result in good practice on site and some parts of training (i.e. continuous training) sometimes remain beyond the scope of partnership arrangements. For the most part, social partnership on training mostly concerns initial training and less so further workplace-based training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11404577">Crouch et al., 1999</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood (2007)</xref> argue, such institutional frameworks are actually less effective in determining the implementation of training and actual participation than management attitudes, worker characteristics and union activities. Thus, despite different regulatory conditions from country to country, there is often little overall difference between plants of the same company when it comes to influencing (worker) participation in company training programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>: 356–9).</p>
<p>Indeed, across the case study plants the problem for trade unions and their memberships is that – with the exception of health and safety training – access to training is distributed unevenly across the workforce, with patterns of engagement largely determined by management and limited trade union involvement (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006</xref>). The determination of these arrangements by employers is clearer in the liberal market economies. In Italy, for example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Computer courses, the English language course. The English course had already been set up, but was only available to technicians and higher positions. The worker had to remain an ignoramus unless he could get a recommendation [from management]. (TKS Italy, production manager, 2001)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, four years later there remains a clear demarcation between workers with regard to accessing training at this plant:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Unfortunately we don’t have equal opportunities [to training courses], office workers can have them, the others can’t. This is still a problem in Italy. (TKS Italy, production worker, 2005)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, the evidence is that unions have limited input into training programmes. With regard to continuing training particularly this extends across the case study plants, even where strong partnership arrangements exist (e.g. Germany). Indeed, many workers are more or less excluded from key aspects of training programmes, particularly workers engaged in low-skilled occupations and those with poor qualifications (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11404577">Ashton, 2004a</xref>). Thus, while a significant number of workers across the industry will have undertaken an apprenticeship, the workforce is predominantly skilled by experience and workplace-based informal practices, such as learning-by-doing:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>So what you need here is practice. You must . . . school your own. On your own. Then you learn the most about hydraulic systems. (TKS Germany, production worker, 2002)</p>
<p>Learning-by-doing. Yes. That is the lowest level and they [management] promote it. . . . Low based education. (Corus Netherlands, works council rep., 2002)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such approaches to skill formation are a common feature of internal training across the industry. Where workers pursue qualifications on-site there is evidence of accreditation of prior learning (APL), but such opportunities are uneven and generally there is little evidence that management explicitly recognizes skills learnt on the job (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11404577">Fuller and Unwin, 1999</xref>). There was, moreover, little indication of unions harnessing such processes within bargaining procedures. Indeed, management acts as a gatekeeper to the more sophisticated training opportunities being developed and filters (and often restricts) access to what formal (and value-added) learning opportunities they do provide – with more highly qualified staff benefitting most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006</xref>). Thus, specific skill needs are not always met by conventional practices, as illustrated in the following interview extract, and unions struggle to penetrate organizational policy decisions on training and learning, and enhance skills and employability profiles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2008</xref>: 240):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . all the manuals are in English, so you should at least be able to know that much of the language in order to understand those. (TKS Germany, production worker, 2002)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The broader claim is that unions are complicit with current strategy within the industry and ‘locked’ (by the past and traditional practices) into viewing and treating training as an additional and narrowly defined objective, rather than as core to members’ interests and concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>: 471).</p>

<title>The importance of training for steel trade unions</title>
<p>A significant challenge for unions is to develop a more strategic and positive approach to training and learning agendas, which recognizes the importance of training for trade unions and (all) members. Such a move might strengthen the collective base of the union. A second challenge is to extend the remit of training and learning as part of the engagement by unions with the restructuring and reorganization of industries that may be taking place.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, access to training and qualifications is important for the development of worker employability profiles. This is an industry vulnerable to restructuring and large-scale programmes of redundancy, but the accreditation of skills (to enhance employability) has not always been a concern for companies:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . it is important qualifications are not pursued as an end in themselves, even if the Further Education College points out the funding available if they are awarded. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11404577">Corus, 2001</xref>: 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not that qualifications are unavailable to workers in the UK, but they are not central to training strategies, nor are they an embedded part of training systems. This was a surprise to a manager within the Energy Optimization Team at Port Talbot recently transferred from IJmuiden. During an interview to discuss a new gas combustion training programme (introduced to improve risk assessment practices and enhance efficiency, but not linked to formal qualification systems) it was pointed out that:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . in the Netherlands training is always directly linked to qualifications . . . you need at least a HNC or HND degree to be a team-leader . . . to progress in IJmuiden you always need to gain the theoretical as well as the practical . . . with every step in IJmuiden you need to go up a [qualification] level. (Corus UK, manager, 2010)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This illustrates the way training systems reflect institutional arrangements with regard to VET, and also how workforces might be differentially qualified across a single corporation (albeit one that operates independent business units). For UK workers, the point is that training <italic>could</italic> be linked to qualifications (and workers express a desire for qualifications), but there is little pressure exerted upon management by unions to ‘pursue qualifications as an end in themselves’ – certainly there was an absence of union involvement in training arrangements at Port Talbot. Of course, there remains a reliance on informal practices across Corus more generally, including at IJmuiden, and participation in training is often subject to training budgets and the preferences of individual section and business unit managers. The argument is that the adoption of progressive skill-orientated strategies by trade unions becomes important because such strategies challenge the employers’ prerogative with regard to training and combats deskilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11404577">Mahnkopf, 1991</xref>). More importantly, developing this agenda places workers in a better position to adapt readily to changing circumstances in the restructuring process and enhance bargaining positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The training and learning agenda is becoming increasingly central to industrial relations, particularly within the context of the determinants of the European social model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>). The corollary is that the need for a more coherent union skills strategy (by sector) becomes increasingly important, too (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11404577">2009</xref>). At present, while pockets of union success on training might exist, including within the steel industry (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11404577">Stuart and Wallis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11404577">Wallis et al., 2005</xref>), the outcome is that steel industry management has significant influence not only on the shape and form of training, but also on the participation of workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11404577">Stroud and Fairbrother, 2006</xref>). Even where institutional and regulatory arrangements have proved important for agreements on learning and setting the conditions of training participation, adherence to such agreements is partial and uneven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11404577">Leisink and Greenwood, 2007</xref>). It is management that continues to take the lead on what training and skill needs will be met, and in what ways, particularly in relation to forms of training and learning beyond initial training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11404577">Crouch et al., 1999</xref>). As things stand, multinational steel companies have scope to restructure operations and develop the adaptability and flexibility of their labour as they see fit, dealing with unions within their national contexts and treating workers differently within and across the same company. It might be that in more general terms aspects of this are picked up by EWCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>), but the argument is that there is clear scope (need) for greater cross-border union engagement on minimum levels of provision within and across a company, if not the sector.</p>

<sec id="section8-0143831X11404577">
<title>‘Organizing’ training strategy in the EU steel sector</title>
<p>The argument in this article is that there is significant potential for unions to build organizational capacity to address the many varied aspects of restructuring. The training agenda, in particular, provides an opportunity for unions to gain leverage on the wider implications for workers of ‘modernization’ processes. Currently, however, steel unions are unevenly engaged in training and there are weaknesses, particularly with regard to continuing training, in relation to existing partnership arrangements at the national level. A central argument of this article is that a more coherent response is required from unions, one which employs strategies that mirror corporate restructuring processes and the international framing of interests (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11404577">Tarrow and McAdam, 2005</xref>). This section of the article examines, in this respect, one example of union strategy development at the EU sectoral level: the SSSDC.
</p>
<p>The SSSDC has operated since 2006 and has developed on two levels. Following the end of the ECSC Treaty the activities of its Consultative Committee have been transferred into the reformed Economic and Social Council. The Mixed Committee Steel has been developed into a sectoral social dialogue structure, and it is the latter that provides the focus for the following discussion. The SSSDC brings together the EMF and Eurofer with the declared aims of monitoring the structural evolution of the industry, contributing to and monitoring EU policy and its consequences for the development of the EU steel sector, and supporting high-quality jobs through high standards of health and safety and seeking the most appropriate approaches for training in a context of demographic change and competition for highly skilled workers. Since 2007 it has operated two horizontal working groups, one on health and safety and one on education and training. The SSSDC meets approximately five times per year, but it is only recently that the steel training agenda has been picked up by the EMF and pursued through the SSSDC with any vigour.</p>
<p>On 28 January 2009 an SSSDC workshop on training was held, which involved presentations by the author of this article on industry challenges, the DG for Employment on ‘New Skills for New Jobs’ and examples of best training practice from various company representatives. At the end of the workshop the delegates agreed to convene a steering group to develop a common position on ‘workforce development, recruitment and retention’ (observation of SSSDC, 2009). In some senses, this is a case of better late than never, as ‘most [other] European social dialogue sector committees have [already] discussed lifelong learning and have developed concrete actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11404577">Winterton, 2007</xref>). It might be argued that the apparent delay in developing this agenda derives, in part, from the particularities of sector-specific cultures, where – with regard to training and learning – informal practices have traditionally taken precedence and union engagement has tended to be limited and nationally bound. Indeed, there is a history of uneven engagement by national unions with the broader EMF training agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11404577">Erne, 2008</xref>), which reflects (1) the traditions of union engagement across metals sectors more generally and (2) the different levels of national union engagement with the institutional and regulatory contexts that govern national VET arrangements.</p>
<p>Observation of the three steering group meetings held to date suggests a consensus between unions and employers on the importance of the training agenda. Meetings are chaired by the EMF and comprise delegates from large and major steel companies and representatives from affiliate unions, plus invited experts from the EU and other organizations. To date, the principal focus of the meetings has been on creating a better understanding of the problems the industry faces with regard to workforce development, recruitment and retention, and the SSSDC-WDRR is undertaking research in this respect. Discussions have focused more specifically on the need to improve the image of the industry in order to recruit highly qualified individuals from the widest pool of talent, a major concern for employers and one also discussed extensively at the ESTEP. The emergence of the green skills and jobs agenda has also concerned delegates, as has the ageing profile of the industry and the impending loss of firm/sector-specific knowledge. Less to the forefront have been concerns with the development of broader employability profiles and facilitating access to a wider array of training opportunities for all workers. In fact, it would seem that the agenda has been led by what might be regarded as the more immediate and emerging concerns for employers and management and less focused on the more deeply entrenched training and employability issues that concern workers (observations SSSDC-WDRR, 2009).</p>
<p>As secondary organizations to the employer, unions attempt to mobilize and represent their membership to address the content and implications of management decisions and practices, but there seems little evidence of attempts by affiliate unions in the context of the SSSDC-WDRR to define learning needs precisely and address the specific implications for members of the restructuring EU steel sector. Nonetheless, as Sutherland and Rainbird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">2000</xref>: 190) suggest, union engagement with this agenda does provide them with opportunities ‘for the constructive and creative re-thinking of policies’. It might be that the EMF’s tendency towards a strategy of benchmarking standards, the success of which is contested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11404577">Erne, 2008</xref>), casts some doubt over whether the SSSDC(-WDRR) is the appropriate means to build ‘top-down’ cross-border capacities with which to defend member interests – and the question of a separate and independent agenda should be considered (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, such engagement in cross-border initiatives signals perhaps an aim to reassert control over the broader processes of restructuring currently being led by steel multinationals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An increasingly consolidated and ‘global’ (steel) sector presents nationally embedded unions with problems of a particular character. Globalization exerts a significant set of pressures on unions, but the extent to which such pressures impact on unions is dependent upon the capacity of unions to respond effectively and mobilize their power resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>: 39–40). It is, moreover, that a systematic and proactive reinforcement of a broad set of power resources provides significant opportunities for union renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>: 59). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray (2002)</xref> suggest that for workplaces and sectors more exposed to the international economy, such as steel, this demands the mobilization of internal and external resources. The argument here is partly one of organizational capacity, particularly with regard to the ability to pursue an autonomous agenda – through the development of internal and external solidarity and proactivity – and enhance union power in the context of globalization.</p>
<p>What is argued in this article is that there is significant potential for (building union power and) union renewal through proactive engagement in restructuring processes and, specifically, building organizational capacity through the training and learning agenda. This, it is suggested, requires unions to reflect on organizational capacity and strategy formulation (that engages multinational companies) in two ways. First, organizational capacities need to be developed within national/domestic contexts to address current weaknesses of existing partnership arrangements on training and learning. Second, organizational capacities should seek to acquire a cross-border dimension, particularly in relation to multinational-led processes of restructuring that characterize aspects of the industry. More broadly, what this involves is a discussion of the way union capacity (and power) might be (mobilized and) developed through national and cross-national organizations.</p>
<p>The importance of building organizational capacity needs to be demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>). The concern here is with how unions might focus their resources and capabilities to build capacity – as part of wider processes of union renewal and considerations of union futures more generally. Capacity may be enhanced and developed through union engagement with the training and learning agenda, in terms of the value with which education and training activities are increasingly imbued. Such a prospect is part of a wider discourse and policy rhetoric of lifelong learning and the knowledge economy or cognitive capitalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>). This process first involves and necessitates articulating a coherent (training) policy, union by union, which involves local and national levels of engagement. Second, it means that unions would have to develop a case by case approach (e.g. multinational by multinational and/or issue by issue), through national union to national union forms of engagement. Taking these two steps together, union engagements with the training and learning agenda may mean framing wider (but at the same time problem-specific and independent) programmes for action and policy through such bodies as the EMF and SSSDC (-WDRR) to articulate alternative perspectives on company (and EU) led processes (of restructuring). The argument is that such strategies begin to address the capacity dilemma and wrest the initiative from employers on matters crucial to processes of restructuring. In this particular case, the emphasis is on the importance of training and learning as a defining resource in an individual’s (i.e. member’s) career.</p>
<p>Where steel unions across Europe have responded to industry developments it is over pay and immediate employment conditions, not training and learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11404577">Bacon and Blyton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>). On this agenda, the conditions for advancing union initiatives are set by the increasing concentration of ownership, workforce recomposition and the prevailing bargaining agenda. Placed on the defensive by employer strategies and approaches, involving technological restructuring, as well as trends in steel company ownership and concentration, unions fail to pressure employers on training and learning issues more broadly. One condition for the development of a proactive union strategy on training and learning is for unions to re-examine their position in relation to the management of change, review their own leadership styles and organizational forms and begin to argue for proactive policies with regard to lifelong learning agendas and, in particular, the way training within the industry is organized, structured and delivered – including on training content and competences and the enhancement of wider employability skills and qualifications (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11404577">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>: 45 on the more general need for proactive policy development; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>During restructuring, trade union engagement with the learning agenda offers the potential for increased influence over aspects of industrial relations, particularly with regard to skill formation and the organization of work. Such strategies lay the foundations for a more extensive involvement of workers in production activity (further developing and using their skills) and for processes of union renewal. To develop capacity it appears crucial that unions engage on a cross-border basis in transferring and implementing strategies beneficial to members across multinationals (and the sector). Notwithstanding a more general reliance on informal workplace learning practices across the industry, it is evident that the training strategies of multinationals differ from place to place across the EU sector, and that management shapes the learning agenda. Thus, asymmetry in provision results, which is underscored by institutional and regulatory apparatus. This situation necessitates an examination of current provision within and across multinationals, with the aim of identifying specific training and learning demands and needs and developing a platform for benchmarking standards across companies (on, for example, negotiation and/or bargaining on access to training and qualifications, training budgets, aspects of programme content, etc.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11404577">Hyman (2007)</xref> suggests that there is a danger that if unions do not shift their focus beyond nationally focused policy as sectors restructure, sectoral and corporate developments will overtake them. It is in this respect that the case is also made for cooperation between unions on restructuring processes – and training and learning particularly – at the EU sector level. The conditions and circumstances under which trade unions might cooperate, coordinate and organize at a European (and global) level have been variously set out by a number of commentators (see inter alia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11404577">Anner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11404577">Erne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11404577">Tarrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull (2009)</xref>, in particular, draws attention to union success in the ‘global framing’ of worker interests and specifically the concerted campaign of industrial and political action by European dockworkers in the face of the EC’s strategy to ‘divide and conquer’ workers in the pursuit of market liberalization. Critical to the success of this campaign was the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF), and its development as a supranational force, and an engagement by different unions in coordinated and contentious action, including a first ever pan-European dock strike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This example illustrates possibilities for the development of collective organizational capacities to meet the changing circumstances of work and employment, particularly in transnational sectors. Of course, it is necessary to be cautious when drawing parallels between the ETF’s actions and the purposes of, for example, the SSSDC-WDRR. Nonetheless, the strategy of the dockworkers’ national unions and the ETF thwarted EC strategy and diverted the course of Community action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11404577">Turnbull (2009)</xref> suggests that key to this success was ‘shifting scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11404577">Tarrow and McAdam, 2005</xref>) from the national to the international arena, and, in particular, the role played in this by the ETF. Others, such as Hyman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11404577">1999</xref>: 111), suggest that in general European-level organizations ‘possess extremely restricted capacity either to influence capital or the EU decision makers, or to communicate with the members whom they in theory represent’. EWCs are a case in point, but embody a tension between nationally based unionism (dealing with worksites) and sponsored supranational trade unionism. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler (2005)</xref> – on the EMF – shows EIFs can have real influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard (2009)</xref> too highlights the successes experienced by the EMF with regard to negotiation of company-wide transnational agreements – including with Arcelor-Mittal on health and safety.</p>
<p>The EMF deals with one of the most transnationalized sectors in Europe, and steel forms part of the portfolio of industries. At present, as an overarching strategy, it has focused on common minimum standards and guidelines, or a benchmarking approach. For example, in response to sector restructuring and further EU integration, the EMF has instituted a policy to move beyond national wage bargaining negotiations and adopted European collective bargaining coordination; in effect benchmarking affiliates’ national wage bargaining. Similar approaches are also evident in other areas, with varying degrees of success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11404577">Erne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11404577">Gennard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref>). It is clear that the SSSDC-WDRR is an effort to respond to problems by developing a cross-border agenda, with the aim of tackling the ‘international’ repositioning of the employers with which the unions must negotiate. To date employers have been cautious but nonetheless responsive towards union engagement with the agenda, driven as it is by management concerns over emerging skills problems and long-standing recruitment difficulties. At the same time, the success of the SSSDC-WDRR steering group (and what constitutes union success) remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Certainly, the SSSDC-WDRR does not constitute a ‘new industrial relations’, which in this case might be based on common interests in high skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck, 1994</xref>: 251). As Sutherland and Rainbird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">2000</xref>: 190) suggest, in the context of something like the SSSDC-WDRR, what is warned against is ‘misunderstanding the relationship between productive cooperation and distributive conflict on the one hand, and between cooperative policy and adversarial politics on the other’. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11404577">Streeck (1994)</xref> is clear that cooperative policy does not signal an end to adversarial politics, and observations from the SSSDC and SSSDC-WDRR confirm Eurofer’s occasional reluctance (at the employers’ behest) to fully engage on this topic; for reasons given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11404577">Heyes (2000)</xref> discussed earlier in this article, but also for apparent reasons of corporate confidentiality. Indeed, a reliance on cross-border confederations, such as the EMF, and in particular social dialogue and partnership approaches, raises questions about capacity, and may lead to an overestimation of what is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11404577">Heyes, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11404577">Anner et al., 2006</xref>). This is particularly the case when attempting to engage ‘unions that enjoy considerable access to decision-making at the national level’ as they ‘are less likely to support the establishment of a European industrial relations system, even if they represent trans-national sector workers, than those unions which have lost out at the national level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11404577">Bieler, 2005</xref>: 479).</p>
<p>In part, the focus here is on the (in)ability of (steel) trade unions to ‘frame coherent policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11404577">Hyman, 2007</xref>: 198) in relation to the changes that are going on around them. The argument in this article is that unions need to develop cross-border capacities through proactive and preventative policies in relation to restructuring, adopting an anticipatory and long-term perspective rather than incorporation into crisis management on the employers’ terms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11404577">Sutherland and Rainbird, 2000</xref>: 194), which seems to be the current basis for discussions within the SSSDC-WDRR. The potential for formulating and building organizational capacities with regard to training strategies and agendas is pronounced, particularly through coordinated union approaches across multinationals, and thus building the capacity for more strategic forms of leverage, questioning management prerogatives on workforce development and planning. This requires unions (developing but at the same time) moving beyond the prevailing nation-state focus, with ‘a reorientation of union strategies and a need for new modes of engagement with employers, whatever the national context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11404577">Stuart, 2007</xref>: 278), but also the development of new modes of engagement between unions, which are more independently focused (from companies) and orientated more decisively towards meeting member concerns.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Against a background of EU policy largely framed by neoliberal economic imperatives, steel unions struggle to meet the challenge of comprehensive and widespread restructuring and change – which range from closure and redundancy to the new and broader implications for work and employment of restructuring processes. The principal focus here has been on the limitations of union policy development in the steel industry, which makes it necessary to consider how union organizational capacity may be realized collectively in these changing circumstances. The task facing unions in the circumstances of changed managerial hierarchies, shifting patterns of ownership and more assertive approaches is to assess and evaluate their capacities to operate on this changing terrain. This article draws attention to the importance of continuing to re-examine the different dimensions involved in these processes. It is reasonable to infer that there is an increasing disjuncture between institutional arrangements and practices, indicated by the focus of multinational corporations in the case of steel, and the ways that unions organize and operate. It can be argued that the way forward for unions in these circumstances is to prioritize the organizational and strategy questions, and only then will unions be in a position to realize their capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11404577">Lévesque and Murray, 2002</xref>).</p>
