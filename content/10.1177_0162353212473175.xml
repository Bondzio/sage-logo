<p>This special issue of the <italic>Journal for the Education of the Gifted</italic> focuses on the history and nature of gifted programs in other countries, their research base for operation, and intended developments for the future. As we see services for the gifted burgeoning in many parts of the world for the first time, it is heartening to discern that work has been steady over several decades in many other places. The articles included in this issue reflect on the development of gifted education in seven different countries in Europe and Great Britain, all representing decades of work. The final article focuses on the importance of cross-cultural research as a distinct way to study the development of gifted education through comparative analysis and to gain deeper insight regarding key constructs and interventions as a result.</p>
<p>The Gyarmathy article from Hungary traces the development of efforts to design networks of support for gifted students from kindergarten through secondary schools. The strongest work has been done with young children on one hand and with secondary students on the other through competitions and specialized boarding school opportunities. Using a definition closely based on Renzulli’s three-ring conception, Hungary honors the importance of ability, creativity, and persistence in selecting students for services. Special issues of concern include the need to find students from lower socioeconomic strata, the need to infuse learning into the digital age, and the concern for teacher development to augment the support structure for programs.</p>
<p>In the case of England, the history of gifted education has been short and fraught with difficulty in school-based implementation. The Casey and Koshy article cites a recent history since 1999 of a national provision to find and serve gifted children in that country. However, they also chronicle the difficulties in making that provision a reality in every school context, beginning with teacher attitudes toward labeling students as gifted and their lack of preparation to offer appropriate interventions. The attempt to make provisions in all schools creates special challenges to building an infrastructure to support the provision, an aspect of policy implementation seemingly overlooked in the English context. Efforts to interpret the national curriculum in ways that support the needs of the gifted through approaches like acceleration have not materialized. Rather, teacher attitudes reflect a rejection of the terminology of the field, a resistance to the use of test protocols to find these students, and a reluctance to offer services to these students that extends beyond what others are receiving. The authors suggest that only through intensive and systematic professional development coupled with a longitudinal research agenda will authentic progress be made.</p>
<p>The Limont article from Poland emphasizes the role of specialized schools as the major delivery model for gifted programs. These schools focus on the development of artistic talent in the domains of the visual arts, music, and ballet, and in the development of sport. Several schools are featured in the article, which provides insight into the process in Poland for selection and intervention for these learners. Newer specialized schools are also featured that serve the academically talented in the country in selected areas. The author has also included a section on universities and lead researchers in this field working at those institutions. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on next steps in the developmental paradigm for programs that acknowledges central issues in the field, including the concern for widespread identification and service delivery systems, the concern for seeing giftedness from a lifespan perspective, and the preparation of teachers.</p>
<p>Finland exemplifies a similar trend toward specialized schools for the gifted in the arts and sports found in Poland. The Tirri and Kuusisto article discusses more recent work done to provide for the academically talented learner, especially in science and linguistic areas. The authors lament the lack of attention, however, to the social and emotional component of programs for the gifted, suggesting that the Finnish system ignores that emphasis. Curriculum trends have included an emphasis on greater individualized approaches and freedom of choice by teachers, seen as positive provisions for the gifted. A detailed description of specialized schools for the gifted gives us deeper insight into this mode of delivery for gifted students, noting that International Baccalaureate programs are also available. Attitudes of teachers toward the gifted, however, still demonstrate naïveté about their need for identification and specialized services.</p>
<p>The O’Reilly article from Ireland chronicles the history of education in that country as being strongly dominated by the Catholic church, offering little in the form of special services to special needs populations, including the gifted. The most significant development in this traditionally poor country has been the talent search model, introduced in the 1990s to find and serve the most gifted students in mathematics and verbal areas of learning. Used as a catalyst to promote gifted education more broadly, evaluation data suggest that it has been effective. Yet the transfer to regular in-school programs has not occurred, leaving the opportunities for appropriate programs to the out-of-school Saturday and summer offerings. Given that special education also came late to the Irish scene in the 1990s, Ireland is still at a beginning point in its efforts to influence schools regarding the needs of the gifted. One obstacle to making it happen is funding, especially for teacher preparation.</p>
<p>Like Ireland, Spain also relies heavily on out-of-school opportunities to serve the gifted students more appropriately. The Sastre-Riba article from Spain focuses on an extracurricular program offered to students through the University de la Rioja and the University of Madrid that provides enrichment opportunities in a number of areas. Teachers in the program are often graduate students in psychology and other fields who can provide strong content background to their students and share recent research in the fields they are studying. Evaluation research from these programs suggests they are successful not only from the vantage point of client satisfaction but also from the perspective of enhancing metacognitive skills in the students attending. Selection approaches include an emphasis on creative capacities as well as academic ones.</p>
<p>One country in Europe is using a strong gifted education policy as a lever to promote more widespread involvement of schools in the process of program provisions for the gifted. The De Boer, Minnaert, and Kamphof article from the Netherlands offers a policy perspective on gifted education emanating from that country, with a major emphasis on the need for systematic services for the gifted population, defined as the top percentages of students in schools. Buttressed by strong needs assessment data, the government moved to emphasize excellence in schools, beginning in 2000, through providing funding for special projects that emphasized effective models for finding and serving gifted students. Similar to other countries featured in this issue, however, teacher preparation is a central problem in ensuring that appropriate services will be put in place. Yet many examples of school-based provisions are available in the country and evidence from over half of the schools surveyed indicated that teachers are providing for the gifted in their classrooms.</p>
<p>What are the similarities across these efforts in Europe to develop and sustain programs for our best learners? It is clear that all of the programs presented represent pockets of activity rather than comprehensive coverage of the needs of each country’s gifted youth. It is also clear that most of the countries lack the infrastructure at the current time to make that happen—whether it is funding resources from the government, support from educators, a research agenda, or access to the mechanisms of school change such as teacher training. Consequently, systematic progress in gifted education in the seven countries noted here may not be a reality. Yet, all of the articles represent real commitment on the part of educators and researchers to the task so needed in their countries—providing quality education for their best learners. The models that they present of current work are replicable examples of what all countries could be doing—the talent search model in Ireland, the university-based program in Spain, the special schools model in Finland and Poland, the preparation for competitions in Hungary, the emphasis on school-based services in England, and the policy focus in the Netherlands. If a European model for gifted programs might emerge out of this collection of efforts, then gifted students would be the winners as all of the emphases cited in these countries are important to complete the picture of a comprehensive articulated set of experiences for the gifted. Taken together, the articles provide much to think about in respect to both problems in the field and strategies that work to overcome them, given the varied cultural contexts represented.</p>
