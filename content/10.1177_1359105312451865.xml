<abstract>
<p>This study explored predictors of clinically meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among obese patients completing a specialist weight management programme. One hundred and ninety-nine adults aged from 20–88 with a BMI &gt;30 with comorbidities or BMI&gt;35 with/without comorbidities were sampled. The results suggested that both weight loss and changes in depression were significant predictors of HRQOL improvement. However, predictors differed between weight loss groups. Clinically meaningful improvement in HRQOL was found to be due to weight loss when participants had lost 5 kg or more in weight. In contrast, among individuals who lost 0.1–4.9 kg, improvement in HRQOL was accounted for by positive changes in depression scores.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scotland has one of the highest levels of obesity among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, second only to the United States of America and Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312451865">Scottish Government, 2010</xref>). Obesity has major cost implications because it is associated with numerous health consequences. It has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney failure, arthritis, back pain and decreased life expectancy. It is understood to be a complex disease resulting from the interaction of multiple factors: genetic; metabolic; social; behavioural; and cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312451865">National Institutes of Health, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1359105312451865">
<title>Obesity and psychological well-being</title>
<p>The physical comorbidities associated with obesity are well established but changes in emotional well-being are also commonly associated with obesity. An increase in the prevalence of affective disorders with increasing body mass index (BMI) has been described in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312451865">Hasler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312451865">Johnston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312451865">Tuthill et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312451865">Hasler et al. (2004)</xref> found that psychiatric conditions were positively associated with being overweight and results were maintained after controlling for substance abuse, levels of physical activity, demographic variables and family history of weight problems. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312451865">Johnston et al. (2004)</xref> found that depression was more likely to occur in patients who were obese. However, these results were not conclusive and it was noted that more studies were needed to validate the findings. In a recent UK sample of patients attending specialist obesity centres, 48% of patients had elevated scores for depression and 56% elevated scores for anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312451865">Tuthill et al., 2006</xref>). Although these authors found a higher prevalence of affective disorders with an increasing BMI they did not find this to be statistically significant after controlling for age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312451865">Atlantis and Baker (2008)</xref> reviewed the literature, concluding that there was a weak level of evidence supporting the hypothesis that obesity increases the incidence of depression. This may not be surprising given that obese individuals often have related comorbidities and face prejudice and discrimination in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312451865">Wadden et al., 2002</xref>). Women are less likely to be married or complete schooling/education, and achieve lower incomes than non-overweight females, despite comparable intellectual abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312451865">Gortmaker et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359105312451865">
<title>Obesity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</title>
<p>HRQOL has been viewed as a distinct set of concepts relating to a patient’s perception of physical, psychological and social functioning. This concept has been researched in obese samples and a strong negative relationship between obesity and health-related quality of life documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312451865">Fontaine and Barofsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312451865">Kolotkin et al., 2001b</xref>). Typically an individual’s HRQOL decreases as a function of increasing weight. As impaired HRQOL in obese samples (with BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) are common (&gt;40%) and a linear relationship established, research has focused on understanding what factors underpin improved HRQOL in obese patients. It has been found that weight loss improves HRQOL in both overweight and obese populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312451865">Blissmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312451865">Kolotkin et al., 2001b</xref>) and those individuals with the poorest HRQOL at baseline derive the greatest benefit. However, in a meta-analytic review of this literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312451865">Maciejewski et al. (2005)</xref> concluded that HRQOL was not consistently improved in randomized controlled trials of weight loss. This may be because different measures of HRQOL were used, some of which were generic measures of HRQOL (assess a wide range of health domains) and others condition-specific (i.e. the impact of being obese). When generic measures were used positive effects of treatment varied by study duration but only two of the 15 randomized control trials (RCTs) had positive effects. There were 11 RCTs that used obesity specific measures with six of these trials showing positive effects. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312451865">Maciejewski et al.’s (2005)</xref> review article analysed a wide range of weight loss interventions; there were not enough randomized trials that included HRQOL assessments to make definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>Other factors such as increased fitness and/or reduced physical symptoms have been argued to bring about improvements in HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312451865">Williamson et al., 2009</xref>). Support for this view was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312451865">Bowden et al. (2008)</xref> who reported that weight loss attempts had a positive impact on HRQOL factors (social functioning, work and other daily activities) even when weight loss attempts were unsuccessful. They concluded that initiating an exercise and dietary programme may be enough to improve both physical and psychological HRQOL. Research has also found that poor HRQOL impairs weight loss, weight loss maintenance and early drop-out from weight loss programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312451865">Teixeira et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312451865">2005</xref>). Women with poorer HRQOL at the start of treatment, particularly in areas of work, health and self-esteem, were more likely to drop out of the programme compared to women with better initial HRQOL scores. Similarly longer-term studies have reported that maintaining a significant weight loss (&gt;5%) is not necessary to maintain improvement in HRQOL at 24 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312451865">Blissmer et al., 2006</xref>). These studies lend support to the idea that the relationship between HRQOL and obesity may be bidirectional and improvements in HRQOL not just a function of weight loss.</p>

<sec id="section4-1359105312451865">
<title>Weight, emotional well-being and quality of life</title>
<p>In line with the hypothesis that weight is not the only factor which underlies HRQOL in obese patients, research has indicated that psychological difficulties (binge eating and depressive symptoms), but not increasing obesity, predict poorer HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312451865">Loh and Chan, 2010</xref>). In addition, HRQOL has been found to be more strongly and directly related to symptoms of depression than BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312451865">Fabricatore et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore it may be that the relationship between weight loss and HRQOL improvement is spurious. Losing more weight leads to a greater reduction in depressive symptoms or psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312451865">Dalle Grave et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312451865">Dixon et al., 2003</xref>), and hence an improvement in HRQOL. Determining the relationship between obesity treatment, weight loss and HRQOL is complicated because a given treatment programme may affect HRQOL, independent of weight loss and at the same time cause weight loss to occur.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312451865">Palmeira et al. (2009)</xref> examined the associations among obesity treatment-related variables (change in weight, quality of life, body image and subjective well-being) exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes, during a behavioural obesity treatment. They observed no evidence of a reciprocal relationship between weight change and HRQOL but did find weight change partially mediated the effect of the treatment on quality of life. In contrast, depressive symptoms were not a mechanism that influenced weight loss, nor were improvements in depression mediated by weight changes. Overall, the results suggest that improvements in HRQOL outcomes for obese patients completing weight management programmes are primarily due to weight loss but other factors such as emotional well-being may play an important role that needs to be more clearly understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105312451865">
<title>The present study</title>
<p>The present study aimed to provide a better understanding of the relationship between weight loss, emotional well-being and clinically meaningful HRQOL change in obese patients completing a specialist obesity programme in routine clinical practice. It was hypothesized that weight loss would predict clinically meaningful HRQOL improvement in obese patients, but reduced symptoms of depression and/or anxiety would also predict meaningful change in HRQOL, particularly in patients who failed to achieve at least 5 kg weight loss.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1359105312451865">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A cross-sectional, repeated measures design was used to assess participants’ weight, emotional well-being and HRQOL pre- and post-weight management intervention. The primary aim of the study was to understand what factors predict clinically meaningful change in HRQOL. The second aim was to investigate whether different factors predicted changes in HRQOL between participants who were successful with weight loss, compared to those who were less successful with weight loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105312451865">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants comprised 199 adults with a BMI &gt;30 with comorbidities or BMI &gt;35 with/without comorbidities. Comorbidities included diabetes, coronary heart disease, previous stroke, hypertension and sleep apnoea. Participants had been referred for specialist weight management treatment to a government funded National Health Service programme covering the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. This health board area in the West of Scotland has a population of 1.2 million individuals and includes a diverse mixture of urban and rural populations. Thirty-one per cent of the board’s population lives in very deprived areas compared with 15% of Scotland’s population as a whole. Referrals to the service were completed by a patient’s general practitioner or hospital consultant (i.e. Cardiologist, Orthopaedic surgeon).</p>
<p>All participants were invited to join a closed group programme comprising of nine fortnightly sessions incorporating lifestyle advice (diet and activity) and behavioural change strategies. Each group session lasted 1.5 hours and was led by a dietician who had undergone training in cognitive-behavioural approaches and had access to ongoing supervision from a Clinical Psychologist. The participants in this study were restricted to programme completers who were defined as individuals who attended four or more of the closed group sessions. This definition had both face validity, in that it defines completers as those who attended at least half of the sessions, and it is consistent with a definition of completion used in another weight management programme in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312451865">Counterweight Project Team, 2004</xref>). All participants attended either session eight or nine to complete the post-intervention evaluation.</p>

<sec id="section9-1359105312451865">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Weight</italic> (kg) was measured to the nearest 100 g, using Seca 685 multifunctional digital scales (CE approval class III; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) and was carried out by the Dietician leading the group session. Only one measure was taken at each weighting as the scales were digital and presumed reliable in result. Scales also had seating option to reduce any effect of poor balance.</p>
<p><italic>Emotional well-being</italic> was assessed by administering the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105312451865">Zigmond and Snaith, 1983</xref>). This self-report rating scale measures the two most common forms of emotional disturbance, anxiety and depression. It consists of two subscales, each containing seven items on a four-point Likert scale (ranging from 0–3). It is scored by summing the ratings for the 14 items to yield a total score, and by summing the ratings for the seven items of each subscale to yield separate scores for anxiety and depression. The HADS is widely used in clinical settings and higher scores indicate more severe anxiety and depression. As it is a screening tool, scores on the HADS do not allow definitive diagnoses. Research has reported the HADS has good concurrent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312451865">Bramley et al., 1988</xref>), performs well as a psychiatric screening device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312451865">Bjelland et al., 2002</xref>) and test–retest reliability coefficients as high as .85 for depression and .84 for anxiety have been found over two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312451865">Herrmann, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>HRQOL</italic> was assessed by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life – Lite (IWQOL-Lite – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312451865">Kolotkin et al., 2001a</xref>). This is a 31-item self-report instrument that assesses obesity-specific HRQOL and consists of five subscales: physical function (11 items), self-esteem (seven items), sexual life (four items), public distress (five items) and work (four items). Items are rated based on the past week on a five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘never true’ to ‘always true’. Internal consistency coefficients for the IWQOL-Lite have ranged from .90 to .96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312451865">Kolotkin et al., 2001a</xref>) and test–retest coefficients from .81 to .94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312451865">Kolotkin and Crosby, 2002</xref>). The IWQOL-Lite scores are based on 0 to 100 scoring, with 0 representing the poorest and 100 the best quality of life. Raw scores for each IWQOL subscale were computed for each of the five subscales only if a minimum of 50% of the items for that scale were answered and for the total score only if 75% of the answers for all items were completed. In computing raw scores, a pro-rated system was used to handle missing data, using the mean score for items on a subscale to replace missing data.</p>
<p>A previously published algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312451865">Crosby et al., 2003</xref>) was used to identify participants who experienced meaningful changes in weight-related quality of life (i.e. improved or deteriorated) from initial assessment to programme completion. This algorithm combines information from anchor-based and distribution-based methods, and takes into account baseline severity (none/mild, moderate/severe) and statistical regression to the mean. The cutoff for determining whether changes in IWQOL-Lite scores are meaningful is 7.8 points for individuals with low baseline impairments in weight-related quality of life and 12 points for those with severe baseline impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312451865">Crosby et al., 2003</xref>). Using this algorithm, participants were categorized as improved, deteriorated or unchanged. The unchanged and deteriorated categories for meaningful HRQOL change were then collapsed into one variable because few participants were categorized as ‘deteriorated’ in HRQOL in this study. As this measure has been widely used in weight-related quality of life research, these results can be compared to other obesity populations with published findings.</p>
<p><italic>Social deprivation</italic> was assessed using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312451865">Scottish Executive National Statistics, 2006</xref>). This is an area-based index that uses seven domains (current income; employment; health; education, skills and training; geographic access to services; housing; and crime) to describe the level of deprivation in small geographic areas (data zones). All data zones in Scotland are ranked from 1 (most deprived) to 6505 (least deprived) and a variety of quantiles are available for their further categorization. We used quintiles of the Scottish population, ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105312451865">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Questionnaires on emotional well-being and HRQOL were completed by participants at their initial assessment appointment before joining a group and at their last group session. All participants provided written consent to take part in the research. Weight monitoring occurred at each group session and demographic information was collected on gender, age, and index of social deprivation (SIMD).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105312451865">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The sample characteristics were initially investigated by calculating the proportion of participants who occupy each gender, SIMD quintile and weight loss category. Following this, a series of paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to investigate pre- and post-weight management intervention differences in weight, depression, anxiety and on all subscales of HRQOL. To investigate whether a participant’s initial weight affected their emotional well-being and HRQOL scores (pre-intervention), a series of linear regression analyses were performed.</p>
<p>A binary logistic regression analysis was then used to investigate which factors explained the variance in meaningful HRQOL change. The dependent variable was meaningful HRQOL change which was dichotomous and contained two levels: ‘improved’ and ‘unchanged/deteriorated’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105312451865">1</xref></sup> The predictor variables were gender, age, SIMD category, weight change, depression and anxiety change. All of the aforementioned predictor variables were continuous except gender and SIMD category which contained two (male/female) and five categories respectively (from 1 = least deprived to 5 = most deprived).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359105312451865">2</xref></sup> Change scores for weight, depression and anxiety predictor variables were calculated by subtracting the post-weight management intervention scores on these variables from the pre-weight management intervention scores.</p>
<p>Following the initial logistic regression analysis on the whole sample, logistic regression analyses were performed on participants who successfully lost 5+ kg compared to participants who lost less weight (0.1–4.9 kg). Change in weight was therefore removed as a predictor variable from the analyses.</p>

<title>Improvement in HRQOL</title>
<p>Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate which factors predicted meaningful changes in HRQOL.

Although the test of the full model versus the constant was statistically significant, χ<sup>2</sup> (9) = 26.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and able to classify correctly 68.5% of participants, many of the individual predictors did not significantly contribute to the model fit.

<p>The binary logistic regression analysis showed that among participants who lost 5+ kg, the logistic regression analysis was non-significant. In contrast, among participants who lost less weight, change in depression was the only significant predictor of improvement in HRQOL, χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 6.88, <italic>p</italic> = .009 and the model explained approximately12% of the variance in meaningful HRQOL change. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1359105312451865">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the logistic regression analyses and variables entered into each of the models. These results suggest that HRQOL improvements are due to weight loss when 5+ kg weight loss is achieved. However, in patients who lose less weight, meaningful changes in HRQOL are underpinned by improvements in depression scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clinically meaningful improvement in HRQOL was found to be due to weight loss when participants had lost 5kg or more in weight. In contrast, among individuals who lost 0.1–4.9 kg, clinically significant improvement in HRQOL was accounted for by positive changes in depression scores. The finding that greater weight loss leads to improvements in HRQOL fits with the majority of studies showing the higher the weight loss percentage, the greater the improvement in HRQOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312451865">Fontaine and Barofsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312451865">Kolotkin et al., 2009</xref>). However, there have been mixed findings to date regarding the role of psychological disturbances and this study contributes to the literature by exploring the improvements in HRQOL in obese individuals who only lose small amounts of weight by the completion of a weight loss programme. If psychopathological disturbances are relevant factors associated with poor HRQOL and are largely independent of the severity of obesity as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312451865">Mannucci et al. (2010)</xref>, it follows that improvements in HRQOL may be seen in all participants, whether or not they have lost weight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312451865">Palmeira et al. (2009)</xref> observed improvements in depressive symptoms in participants who followed either a behavioural obesity treatment or a health education programme. They suggested that participants’ well-being was affected by their social interaction with their group, by their continued contact with health professionals and possibly by some of the topics covered (e.g. time/stress management). Depression was not mediated by weight changes in either group. Although the predictors of positive changes in depression scores were not investigated in this study, it is unlikely weight loss is a significant factor since these individuals only achieved small amounts of weight loss. In the context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312451865">Palmeira et al.’s (2009)</xref> study, it seems likely that mood improvements were programme-related and therefore independently affecting HRQOL perceptions. These findings are also in line with the meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312451865">Blaine et al. (2007)</xref>. In their review of 117 weight loss treatments, they found that weight loss moderated treatment effects on self-esteem but not depression; improvements in depression were independent of weight loss. However, it appears from the results that when participants lose greater amounts of weight, weight loss becomes the strongest mediating variable for HRQOL improvement.</p>
<p>Only a small proportion of the variance in HRQOL changes were accounted for by the numerous factors explored in this study. Given that we accounted for degree of social deprivation, age, gender, weight loss and changes in the two most common forms of emotional disturbance (anxiety and depression), it is likely that other intrapersonal factors (i.e. self-esteem, body image), interpersonal (degree of social support) or programme-related factors are contributing to HRQOL improvements. The effect on participants of being part of a supportive group programme is likely to be a significant contributor to improved perceptions of HRQOL. The sense of shame that individuals describe regarding their weight is likely to reduce as group members share common experiences. Social identity theory states that members of a distinct group are more likely to view group members in a more positive light and members of the out-group more negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312451865">Tajfel and Turner, 1986</xref>). Although this has not been shown to be the case with overweight individuals as they appear to hold negative attitudes towards others being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312451865">Rudman et al., 2002</xref>), it may be that for obese and severely obese individuals there is an ‘in-group’ preference that affects HRQOL. Confidence in being able to make lifestyle changes, motivation, body image and self-esteem are all aspects of the group weight loss intervention that need further evaluation. There may be specific aspects of the intervention that directly contribute to changes in perception of HRQOL or alternatively it may be external factors such as the degree of social support that alters perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312451865">Verheijden et al., 2005</xref>). While it is recognized the information and support provided in weight management interventions can be a key factor in behaviour change, most of the dynamics of behaviour change take place in patients’ private and work settings. In these situations, social support from people’s natural environment plays an important role.</p>
<p>The majority of obese patients completing the weight management intervention described positive outcomes in relation to weight loss, several aspects of quality of life and emotional well-being. Post-intervention, over 90% of the participants had lost some degree of weight, and 46% achieved the goal of 5+ kg weight loss. Men lost more weight than women. This is a pattern found in other studies and fits with the idea that the resting metabolic rate of women is slower than men’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312451865">Carpenter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312451865">Stubbs et al., 2011</xref>). In a larger-scale, full evaluation of Glasgow &amp; Clyde Weight Management Service (GCWMS) outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312451865">Morrison et al., 2011</xref>) it was found that men were less likely to complete the programme, but more likely to achieve their target weight loss when they did. Further investigation about the gender differences regarding weight loss programmes would be beneficial to improve the uptake and retention of men. Initiatives reported to improve the outcomes for men have been promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312451865">Gray et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, significant improvements in emotional well-being (anxiety and depression) and in all domains of HRQOL were found post-intervention. These finding are in line with the majority of the research evidence that weight management programmes have many positive outcomes for obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312451865">Blissmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312451865">Osei-Assibey et al., 2010</xref>). Participant’s BMI pre-intervention affected their HRQOL, as heavier participants described more impairment particularly in the public distress and physical functioning domains. Impairments in the physical functioning domain of HRQOL is well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312451865">Callegari et al., 2005</xref>) and the higher scores for public distress are unsurprising given the stigma associated with being obese. In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312451865">Atlantis and Baker, 2008</xref>) a higher BMI at the start of the programme predicted more severe depression scores, although did not predict elevated scores on anxiety. There have been higher rates of anxiety among obese populations reported but further investigation is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312451865">Tuthill et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and strengths</title>
<p>This study did not include a control condition as it was based in a routine clinical practice and thus we were unable to evaluate the effects of the treatment on HRQOL compared with the absence of treatment. There were also significantly more female participants than male and it is worth noting that the data on HRQOL and emotional well-being was self-reported. Therefore the limitations inherent in all survey research are acknowledged. A particular strength of this study is that it presents outcomes on patients attending an NHS clinical service and therefore will be relevant to similar routine health settings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study found that HRQOL improves in obese patients on completion of a weight management intervention, primarily due to weight loss in those who lose 5+ kg and due to positive changes in depression in those who lose less weight. Other factors not investigated, contribute to HRQOL improvements and therefore future research is required to investigate whether specific aspects of interventions are particularly important in perceptual changes in HRQOL or whether changes are due to participation in a supportive group environment (i.e. the ‘group effect’). Further, whether the positive changes in depression were a result of this ‘group effect’, due to the initiation of lifestyle changes, because of the small weight loss achieved or due to some other intrapersonal/interpersonal factors needs to be determined.</p>
