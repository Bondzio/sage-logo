<abstract>
<p>We present an exercise on “doing gender” that uses digital media to create an opportunity for interactive learning. Students create photo essays on gender performances in everyday life and then present their photo essays to their peers. This exercise allows undergraduates to engage in “real-life” learning regarding the socially constructed and performative nature of gender. In discussing each other’s images in class, students confront both the ubiquity of gender performances and understand how they produce, receive, and police performances. We present the assignment and grading rubric in detail, describe examples of photo essays ranging from unsuccessful to excellent, and detail student learning and assessments of the assignment.</p>

<p>The social construction of gender is a ubiquitous concept in sociology courses. Through readings and discussions, students may leave sociology courses with the ability to define gender as “constructed,” “fluid,” or “cultural not biological,” but to what extent are they convinced of the relevance of this theory to their own lives beyond the classroom? In students’ everyday lives, as in our own, gender continues to manifest in ways that appear natural, normal, and routine. In an effort to embed the relevance of social construction in students’ lived experiences, we offer an assignment that utilizes digital media as a platform for interactive and inductive learning. We ask students to photograph “gendery” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X13480050">Sedgwick 1995</xref>:16) moments from everyday life, upload the images to a private class gallery, and then present their work to the class, responding to peer interpretations of their images.</p>
<p>Early approaches to illustrating gender as a social construction employed visual analysis to critique gender stereotyping of women in popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X13480050">Curry and Clarke 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X13480050">Goffman 1979</xref>). Popular multi-edition instructional films such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X13480050">Jhally’s (2007)</xref> <italic>Dreamworlds</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X13480050">Kilbourne’s (2010)</xref> <italic>Killing Us Softly</italic> have for decades deconstructed images from students’ everyday lives and explained the negative impact of these images on women’s equality. Most recently, Lisa Wade and Gwen Sharp’s Web site Sociological Images (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Thesocietypages.Org/Socimages/">http://Thesocietypages.Org/Socimages/</ext-link>), while not designed exclusively for the classroom, has invited its readership of over 15,000 viewers per day to interact with and comment upon the provocative images and critiques they post, the majority of which are focused on gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X13480050">Mayeda 2010</xref>; Wade personal communication).</p>
<p>Within recent scholarship on teaching and learning, authors appear to have turned their attention away from methods of visual analysis, focusing on bringing concepts to life through methods of performance and embodiment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X13480050">Hoop 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X13480050">MacNevin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X13480050">Murphy-Geiss 2008</xref>). To teach gender as a social construction, authors have asked students to perform gender transgressions through norm-breaking assignments that utilize fingernail polish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X13480050">Edwards 2010</xref>) and styles of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X13480050">Berkowitz, Manohar, and Tinker 2010</xref>). In assignments like these, students learn firsthand both the possibility for gender fluidity and the power of gender norms—particularly homophobia—to structure gender as two distinct and opposite categories.</p>
<p>We unite these visual and performative active learning methods by asking students to photograph and reflexively analyze their own “lived experiences as text” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X13480050">Hoop 2009</xref>:48). Utilizing the interactive capacity of digital media, we also ask students to annotate and share their photos with the class. In discussing their images with the class, students confront, defend, or modify their interpretations of gender normativity and transgression in specific social contexts that can be both familiar and diverse, thus setting the stage for deeper conversations about inequality and intersectionality.</p>
<sec id="section1-0092055X13480050">
<title>Interactive Learning and Student Engagement</title>
<p>The interactivity of <italic>Sociological Images</italic> indicates the power of digital media to transform visual analysis into a reflexive, collective, and contested process. Sociologists have begun to explore the use of blogs, social networks, and even audio documentary as alternative modes of student writing and discussion, arguing for their value as tools that foster active and collaborative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X13480050">Pearson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X13480050">Wright and Lawson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X13480050">Wynn 2009</xref>). Such media, argue education and media theorists, not only allow for collaboration, but also upset traditional classroom hierarchies, thereby allowing students to construct knowledge interactively with the instructor in ways that are applicable and relevant to their current experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X13480050">Corneli and Danoff 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X13480050">Ito et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X13480050">Rheingold 2012</xref>). Such student-driven interactive learning fosters student engagement, citizenship, media literacy, and an understanding of how knowledge is socially constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X13480050">Gee 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X13480050">Lapadat et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X13480050">Scholz 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this general theory of media and engagement, we seek to understand how the emergent technology of digital photo sharing can be usefully employed toward the specific disciplinary concept of doing gender, where gender is understood as an interactional and performative construction. In the assignment we present in the following, students produce their own images, making active choices about interpretation and representation. As they share their images and discuss them with peers, they must also actively respond to alternative interpretations, experiences, and critiques about their choices and assumptions. Norms or practices that may seem obvious to one student can be problematic to another. Using social media to facilitate interactive learning, we aim to create a learning space where the social construction of gender—and knowledge about gender—is made visible.</p>
<p>In the spirit of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X13480050">Scholz’s (2011)</xref> collection <italic>Learning through Digital Media: Experiments in Technology and Pedagogy</italic>, we treat our presentation and analysis of this assignment as an “experiment” that entailed unanticipated successes and obstacles. Through honest reflection on what worked and what didn’t, we hope not only to offer a practical tool to the repertoire of teaching the social construction of gender, but also to guide sociologists through the pros and cons of integrating digital media as a method of engaging students in their learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0092055X13480050">
<title>Learning Goals and Assignment</title>
<p>We utilize digital media and interactive learning techniques to focus students’ attention on their own role in both the doing of gender and in the reception of gender performances and to enhance students’ abilities to articulate gender norms and transgressions in their own terms. The specific learning goals for this assignment are: (1) that students understand the distinction between gender and sex categories; (2) that students develop a critical awareness of gender as a meaningful category of social organization; (3) that students are able to analyze and demonstrate how gender is negotiated, transgressed, affirmed, and/or reproduced in social interaction; and (4) that students are able to theorize how particular institutional and cultural contexts compel or inhibit particular gender performances. This fourth learning goal is broad enough to not only include conversations about the intersections of gender with traditional categories of race, class, and sexuality, but also to include how the doing of gender is interdependent with the demands of various work environments, regional cultures, or student subcultures.</p>
<p>We have assigned this exercise in four different courses, one introductory large lecture course on social problems (spring 2011) and three advanced seminars on cultural sociology (spring 2006, spring 2011, fall 2011). None of these courses are typically designed to focus in depth on gender theory, yet each requires students to have or gain a basic grasp of gender as a social construction in order to understand fully social problems or issues of cultural representation. We created this assignment out of a need to immerse students quickly, yet effectively, in the concept of gender as a social construction. Our intention was to expose all students to the concepts of the fourth learning goal through sharing and subsequent discussion, even if a number of students were only able to achieve the first through third learning goals in the graded assignment they submitted prior to class discussion. We generally spent a portion of a class session to explain the assignment and a full class session (approximately an hour) on the discussion of student work following the assignment submission.</p>
<p>In all courses, we assigned the exercise in conjunction with either <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X13480050">West and Zimmerman’s (1987)</xref> classic piece “Doing Gender” or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X13480050">Lorber’s (1994)</xref> chapter “‘Night to His Day.’” In the advanced seminars, we also assigned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X13480050">Hays’s (1994)</xref> “Structure, Agency, and the Sticky Problem of Culture” in order to delve more deeply into how gender performances are always situated historically and institutionally. We expected that most students in introductory lecture course would achieve goals 1 and 2, while we expected that most students in the advanced seminars would achieve goals 2 and 3.</p>
<p>In the introductory lecture course, we offered the assignment early in the semester in order to provide a foundation for further discussion of gender and inequality, and in the advanced seminars we offered the assignment later in the semester as a way for students to synthesize information from the course. In all cases, students were given the assignment (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092055X13480050">Appendix A</xref>) at least two weeks before it was due. In the courses from 2011, the assignment also included the grading rubric (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0092055X13480050">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
<p>The assignment asks students to create a digital photo essay of gender in everyday life that illustrates people doing gender. The photo essay includes at least 10 photographs that are individually annotated to describe: (1) the context of when and where the photo was taken, (2) what the student intended to capture, (3) what the photo means to the student, and (4) whether the student had impressions in the moment that are not captured visually by the photograph.</p>
<p>We suggest that students take photographs of themselves, friends, and/or family and that when asking others to participate they ask for explicit permission and explain the class assignment, noting that their instructors and peers will view the pictures and that the pictures will be stored in a private class gallery. We suggest the same permission process for photographs of strangers in public places or alternatively that students take photos at a distance sufficient to obscure the subjects’ identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0092055X13480050">1</xref></sup> Finally, the assignment offers brief technical guidance about photo quality, resolution, and uploading and annotating photos with our learning management system (LMS).</p>
<p>Once students have completed the assignment, only the instructor has the ability to display all of the photographs, although each student has access to his or her own photographs. In the advanced seminars, each student presents his or her photo essay to the class. In the introductory lecture course, students volunteer in their breakout discussion sections to do the same. In conjunction with the presenting student, the instructor facilitates a conversation of the photographs raising alternative interpretations and moderating conflicting judgments and opinions. We, and other students, ask questions such as, “How might this person be treated if he or she were a woman/man? How do you think most people would respond to transgressions of this gender norm? How might the representation of this behavior be interpreted differently if it were taking place in a different social setting or racial or class context?”</p>
<p>While we assert that the sharing of images is central to student engagement and learning, we do not evaluate the students’ presentations as a part of their grade, focusing formal evaluation on only their submitted written work. We do so in order to keep the classroom discussion open and student-driven as well as to allow students the option of privately sharing their photo essays with the instructor. To date, however, no student has asked us to keep the photo essay private.</p>

<sec id="section3-0092055X13480050">
<title>Institutional Context</title>
<p>We offered this assignment at the University of Virginia, a highly ranked public university with an undergraduate population of just over 14,000, 69.4 percent of whom are in-state students and 55 percent of whom are women. Of the 14,000 undergraduates in 2011–2012, 7.2 percent are African American, 12.4 percent are Asian or Pacific Islander, 5.2 percent are Hispanic, 0.1 percent are Native American, 3.0 percent are multirace, and 72.1 percent are white. While the university is a PhD-granting research institution, it also takes pride in the education of its undergraduates, whose graduation rates are 85 percent or better across all ethnic and racial categories.</p>
<p>Thirty-three percent of the undergraduates receive any form of need-based financial assistance, and the institution’s students are generally equipped with smartphones, laptops, and other personal camera-ready devices that they normally use to frame, capture, and share their everyday social experiences. The institution also has several centers that support learning technologies and has developed its own LMS that was built to encourage collaboration outside of the classroom and the sharing of audio/visual media. These resources allowed us to create an assignment that takes students’ everyday uses of technology and challenge them to use it in a structured academic context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0092055X13480050">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The institution where we offered the assignment also presents particular challenges to the teaching of gender, particularly its intersection with race, class, and sexuality. While there are no statistics that can capture fully the culture of the campus, our cumulative experience has been that while students value the school’s diversity and its attempts to increase diversity, students across genders and ethnic categories generally have a strong aspirational focus that overshadows more critical discourses on gender or race that may be prevalent at institutions with a similar demographic composition.</p>
<p>In courses we’ve each taught previously, we found that some students, despite increasing diversity, have been especially resistant to critiques considered “feminist.” In office hours and one-on-one conversations, we have encountered students who are uncomfortable with expressing critical views and others who are frustrated by what they perceive as a blurred boundary between liberal political ideology and knowledge. While these conditions are perhaps specific to the demographics and location of this institution, those who teach gender at other institutions may be familiar with contemporary resistance to the term <italic>feminist</italic> and student ambivalence toward critical approaches to gender. Through this assignment we sought to begin with students’ actual everyday experiences, assessed in terms of learning goals that are gradually more nuanced, in order to facilitate an entry point to deeper critical engagement with concepts of gender as an axis of inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0092055X13480050">
<title>Student Outcomes</title>
<p>We assessed student work according to the rubric we developed for the assignment. The rubric was formalized in spring 2011 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0092055X13480050">Appendix B</xref>). Here we present examples of student work that met each of the three learning goals for the assignment.</p>
<sec id="section5-0092055X13480050">
<title>Competent Photo Essays</title>
<p>We considered photo essays that met our first and second learning goals—students understand gender as distinct from sex category and develop a critical awareness of gender as a meaningful category of social organization—to be “competent photo essays” that earned grades of C to B–.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0092055X13480050">3</xref></sup> At the lower end of the grade range, the photographs represent gender-normative behavior with a mild degree of social context, such as noting how signifiers of colors or clothing styles differ between men and women. Even those essays in the lower range manage to make the point that “gender is everywhere” and it is not simply “natural” or synonymous with biological sex categories. Common subjects in this category were babies on blue/pink blankets and products, such as cell phones, that have “men’s” and “women’s” colors or names.</p>
<p>Sometimes, students producing essays in this category were actually the ones most surprised to discover the prevalence, power, and performative nature of gender. These students may turn in weaker projects because they start from a strongly essentialist and/or biological understanding of gender. Although their projects may not be graded very highly or of much interest to more sophisticated students, the students themselves often note in their essays how the assignment changed their perceptions of gender in their own lives. Because they were unaware of the social nature of gender, they may be taken aback at how ubiquitous gender is and how “everyone” is engaged in gender performances. These essays often have a tone of surprise. For example, one student discussed a student barbecue in which the women sliced tomatoes while the men lit the fire “without even having to talk about it [how to assign tasks].” She also carefully noted the tension and teasing that arose when the female president of the (ethno-religious) student association hosting the event took over the grilling. But other than noting how surprised she was that everyone, including herself, was doing gender through everyday activities, she had little to say about, for example, family socialization, or the role of her religious subculture in explicating and maintaining gendered practices, or the obvious policing of gender boundaries through peer teasing. Similarly, another student’s photo essay focused on a mixed-gender road trip in which the female student discussed how her male friend “insisted” on driving her car. Her (earnest) take-away from the exercise was that “I learned that I do gender without even noticing.” Such essays failed to understand fully the social construction of gender because they normalized the settings and practices of their particular social context and were thus not able to offer insight into the reproduction of gender or its variation across other axes of inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0092055X13480050">
<title>Well-done Photo Essays</title>
<p>Well-done photo essays went beyond a critical awareness of gender as a meaningful category of social life and distinct from sex to meet learning goal 3—students are able to analyze and demonstrate how gender is negotiated, transgressed, affirmed, and/or reproduced in social interaction. Well-done photo essays earned a grade of B to A– and are distinguished by their emphasis on interaction or the performative aspect of gender. One student produced a photo essay on men and women’s shoes (shooting subjects from only their knees to the ground). If she had stopped there, her essay would have been competent. But in addition to noting how fashion constructs and emphasizes gender, she discussed the body language of male and female groups, noting how women tended to point their toes (and unseen bodies) toward each other while male friends rotated their feet (and bodies) away from each other and/or kept a larger distance between their bodies. She connected this to differential claims to space by men and women and to issues of heteronormativity and physical intimacy.</p>
<p>Several student-athletes have also produced well-done photo essays by photographing their teammates and sporting activities referencing both similarities and differences across gender in game rules, uniforms, rituals, and bodies. When women wrote these essays, they often raised the issue of sexuality in addition to sex and gender, using the exercise to both refute and embrace myths about female athletes. One student produced a photo essay about female softball players and their simultaneous embrace and rejection of gender performances across both the gay and straight players on the team. She photographed not only their weight training in which the women lift large weights in a typical male pattern (a “power clean”) but also their “senior day celebration” at the final game in which the women are highly emotional, even crying, while receiving flowers and decorated baskets. Essays in this category were more successful in demonstrating the reproduction and transgression of gender, as many considered gender in a specific subcultural context or in relation to the policing of sexuality. What distinguishes these essays from those graded “excellent” is generally a failure to problematize the source and/or reproduction of the “myths” they discuss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0092055X13480050">
<title>Excellent Photo Essays</title>
<p>Excellent photo essays went beyond the first three learning goals, building on the understanding that gender is socially constructed to meet learning goal 4—students are able to theorize how particular institutional and cultural contexts compel or inhibit particular gender performances. Excellent photo essays earned the grade of “A” and were generally the work of the most engaged students who are also often those with the most exposure to the gender literature and therefore the most sophisticated theoretically. These photo essays are difficult to categorize as they span a broad range of categories and are often significantly longer and more complex than the assignment requires. We present two examples, both from students in the advanced seminars, to illustrate the upper limit of what the most sophisticated students were able to achieve in the assignment.</p>
<p>Susan’s project demonstrates both the creativity and theoretical sophistication of the best photo essays. Her photo essay focused on sexuality, transgender performance of both male and female genders, the role of consumption and motherhood in perpetuating gender binaries, and the male gaze as applied by/to transgendered bodies (among other things). Susan photographed Edward, a transgendered, cross-dressing friend, at various stages of dressing and in “typically” fe/male situations in both female and male self-presentation. She wrote thoughtfully with reference to the gender literature about many of these issues. This essay also represents how students might closely examine the nuances of the reproduction of gender at its intersection with sexuality. Her annotation of a photograph of Edward contemplating a tampon while made up as a woman but without his wig and dressed in male clothing reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>In all of our discussions about pregnancy and motherhood, Edward brought home to me the implications of being physically unable to bear children, but wanting to inhabit the gendered space of motherhood and femaleness that is expressed completely only through pregnancy and motherhood. In much the same way that masculinity is largely invisible in many contexts, so are viable ovaries. If mother is the ideal to which feminine values ascribe, how does a woman negotiate her gender without the physical proof of her womanhood? How does a gay man who wants to raise a biological child negotiate the contradictions of male biology and “female” sentiments about motherhood?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Susan’s photo essay was one of only two (out of 60 seminar students) graded an “A+” so it is hardly typical, but it does demonstrate the possible scope of the exercise (we discuss the second “A+” exercise shortly).</p>
<p>Regina also created an excellent, although perhaps more typical, “A” project. Her photo essay compared two types of sports teams. Regina argued that although the women’s and men’s swimming/diving teams train, work out, and compete together as well as share practice facilities and weight and nutrition coaches, the men’s and women’s teams are strikingly gendered and their practices highly bounded by gender. Her photos showed successful women’s swim team members hugging and smiling while successful men’s team members roared and banged into each other. Regina’s range of photographs included differences in dress, body decoration, parental/audience participation (dressing up and dancing for female competitors, serious and armed with stopwatches for male competitors), and “team spirit.” In addition, she took a second set of photographs of the men’s and women’s basketball teams, arguing that although these two teams have separate coaching, space, and travel schedules, the actual playing practices, uniforms, and within-team interactions for basketball are much more similar across genders than for swimming/diving. Regina’s project was graded an A for its nuance and demonstration of the institutional context for gender, rather than individual differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0092055X13480050">
<title>Unsuccessful Photo Essays</title>
<p>Unfortunately, some students were not able to meet even the first learning goal. These unsuccessful essays earned grades of C– to F (see note 3) and consisted of attempts to capture gendered objects or behaviors but only to reaffirm them as natural or biological in the analysis.</p>
<p>While there were only a small number of unsuccessful essays (2/139 in the lecture class; none in the seminars), they are worth describing in order to understand the lower limits of engagement and the potential for student resistance to critical analysis of gender in this assignment. For example, one student took six photographs of secretaries at their desks. The student’s analysis was correspondingly banal and atheoretical—“guys would be embarrassed to be secretaries because it’s not masculine.” In a more extreme case, a student did not follow the instructions of the assignment, but instead submitted cutout photographs of women from <italic>Maxim</italic>, a men’s magazine known for its borderline soft-porn portrayals of women, and used the essay as a space to rank the women’s “hotness.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0092055X13480050" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Student Discussion of Photos</title>
<p>The subsequent in-class discussion of student work usually occurred in groups of 15 to 20, either as full seminars or, in the case of the lecture, in smaller discussion sections, meaning that in each course we were able to work from a rich and diverse body of 150 to 200 images of student life. These images touched on 10 to 20 themes, covering everything from men’s magazines, to childhood socialization, to Greek life, to women’s athletics, to transgendered identity, through the lens of students’ own cultural frames of reference.</p>
<p>In facilitating student discussion, we leveraged this rich diversity of student work to address gaps in students’ knowledge and challenge all of them to consider how particular institutional and cultural contexts compel or inhibit particular gender performances (our fourth learning goal). For example, in one discussion, students engaged in a heated debate about the gender of tattoos—for some students, tattoos were strictly a masculine practice, for others they were a signifier of “white trash” or (black) “gangsters,” for others they were symbols of artistic or cultural self-expression. Once confronting their conflicting perceptions openly, the students then explored how the geographic regions where they grew up (and the area’s class and race composition) had shaped their understanding of the gendering (and racing and classing) of tattoos. Discussions such as these set the stage for deeper subsequent discussions of intersectionality.</p>
<p>Some of the excellent essays sparked especially lively discussions about inequality, gender “policing,” and the social bases for “natural” gender distinctions. The class discussion following the second “A+” project focused on the gender performances and institutional assumptions built into the hypermasculinized environments of the military and wilderness firefighters. Marshall presented photos of women “smoke jumpers,” describing how women are now included on crews but remain excluded from leadership positions in part because they are excluded from the culture of male camaraderie that marks wilderness firefighting camps. This example led Marshall’s peers to think about the reproduction of gender inequality even in the face of attempts to overcome it.</p>
<p>In response to Marshall’s presentation, students discussed “gender policing” among their own peer groups—teasing, “friendly” insults, gossip, and outright shaming are used against peers who transgress and resist appropriate gender performances. Marshall showed photos of wilderness firefighters with hoses between their legs, noting that men on the crew make this joke almost daily, but women can only do so rarely. Students laughed casually at the photos of men with hoses between their legs, but his photos of women mimicking male genitalia with the hoses elicited a more nervous laughter—and some comments from students mocking the women. Class discussion then focused on their own recognition and acknowledgment of policing behavior in this context and others as well. The students grappled with understanding why such “joking” can be funny or the source of strong discomfort.</p>
<p>Students’ ability to share and discuss their photographs from their own everyday lives made visible the process of gender construction in the moment. As students debated their perceptions and explored the causes of their differences, they were constructing and reconstructing their interpretations about the meaning of gender. They themselves were enacting gender construction and were made aware of it, both by the comments of the instructor and by the peers with whom they share at least some common culture. Because of their shared understandings, even students who are extremely conventional in their understanding of gender appear receptive to learning from the more critical or sophisticated student presentations.</p>

<title>Assessment and Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Our initial assessment used a voluntary post-assignment survey in the spring 2011 lecture course and the spring 2011 seminar. This survey included the open-ended question, “What was the most important thing you learned from this assignment?” In the lecture class, 70 percent (97/139) of students completed the anonymous online post-assignment survey. In the spring 2011 seminar, all 18 students completed the post-assignment surveys, which we passed out just before class as students took their seats.</p>
<p>Later, in the fall 2011 seminar, we used an open-ended pre- and posttest question about students’ definitions of gender to focus better on students’ changing understanding of the concept. Thirteen of 20 students completed the pretest and all 20 completed the posttest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0092055X13480050">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In both the post-assignment survey and the posttest, we also asked two questions about student perceptions of the effectiveness of the interactive learning components of the assignment. We first discuss the results and limitations of the open-ended question about what students learned in the post-assignment surveys and pre/posttests before discussing responses to these latter questions about interactive learning.</p>
<p>We do not treat our assessment as quantitative evidence that our approach taught the concept of doing gender better than other existing approaches. Instead, we offer a qualitative analysis that explores what students learned through this approach and how they responded to our attempts to engage them more deeply in their own learning, charting both unanticipated successes and obstacles of the assignment.</p>
<sec id="section11-0092055X13480050">
<title>Student Learning</title>
<p>In the post-assignment surveys for the spring 2011 lecture course on social problems and one of the seminars on cultural sociology, we asked students to describe the most powerful lesson they learned from the assignment. By asking them this qualitative question, we sought to understand what the students believed they gained from the assignment. We read through the open-ended survey responses independently, stacking similar concepts, and then together created a typology that inductively coded categories of answers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0092055X13480050">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>On reporting what they learned, the students in the lecture offered statements that related to the first and second learning goals—recognizing gender as distinct from sex category and developing a critical awareness of gender as a meaningful category of social organization. Some examples of responses include “I didn’t realize gender was everywhere,” “I now know that gender is socially constructed rather than biological,” and “gender is cultural while sex is biological.” In the lecture course, 33 percent of students offered answers that we coded as “gender is socially constructed,” and 19 percent of students explained “gender is culturally pervasive” and not just an expression of sexed persons.</p>
<p>For students in the spring 2011 seminar however, such basic realizations were not the primary take-away. None reported that they learned gender was socially constructed and only 17 percent reported that they learned gender is culturally pervasive. Instead, the seminar students reported more advanced take-aways that are relevant to the third and fourth learning goals.</p>
<p>Both introductory lecture and spring 2011 seminar students alike expressed the third learning goal—analyzing and demonstrating how gender is negotiated, transgressed, affirmed, and/or reproduced in social interaction. For example, students explained that in everyday social interaction, gender was more “fluid” and/or more “rigid” than they had previously realized. In the lecture course 15 percent noted the fluidity of gender and 13 percent its rigidity and in the seminar 28 percent noted fluidity and 17 percent its rigidity.</p>
<p>The responses of spring 2011 seminar and lecture students differ most drastically with the fourth learning goal—connecting the social construction of gender with inequality through institutional and cultural context. We noted that few students in the lecture class (8 percent) were able to express the institutional and cultural context of gender as a social construction and when they did, it was through a concern that individual freedoms are limited by the rigidity of gender norms. Thirty-three percent of seminar students, however, expressed the connection between the social construction of gender in particular institutional and cultural contexts leading to systematic gender inequality, 22 percent focused on the ways that gender is policed in particular contexts, and 39 percent expressed that gender is entrenched in social institutions.</p>
<p>The post-assignment surveys reinforced our observation of student work and class discussion, indicating that most students were able to achieve at least the first and second learning goals and that seminar students were more likely than students in the lecture to produce more sophisticated analyses related to the third and fourth learning goals. The results also indicate that even students with a range of sophistication and experience with theories of gender construction can still learn something from the assignment. However, the post-assignment surveys alone cannot clarify what students have gained from their experience with the assignment versus what they may have already known.</p>
<p>In the fall 2011 seminar, we aimed to address this limitation of our initial assessment tool by conducting a pretest, which consisted of a single open-ended question: “How do you define sex and/or gender?” We then followed the assignment with a posttest that asked, “What was the most important thing you learned about gender from this assignment?” In asking these two open-ended questions, we did not seek to measure the amount of change for particular proportions of students but to understand holistically and qualitatively how students’ ways of explaining gender differed before and after the assignment.</p>
<p>Among the pretest responses, all but one identified gender as a social construct and three even explained that both sex and gender are social constructs. The responses appeared to confirm students’ grasp of the social construction of gender going into assignment. However, on closer analysis we noticed that pretest responses mistook the source of agency in constructing gender and had difficulty explaining the process through which “society” constructs gender. While most often sociologists struggle to show students the existence of society beyond individuals, we found ourselves dealing with a converse issue in advanced students—they pointed to an abstract notion of society as the source of gender reproduction and inequality and cast individuals as merely passive dupes or lone rebels without recognizing the role of people in interaction in specific social contexts.</p>
<p>Such a perspective is evidenced most clearly by this answer: “Society defines it [gender]. It is a concept from the top. How one looks at sex and gender is determined by their [<italic>sic</italic>] religion, race, class, etc. to a certain extent and then the rest is determined by outside social forces (i.e., media).” In this response, society is anthropomorphized and we lose a sense of social process as well as students’ own roles in constructing gender through interaction in daily life. Additional student responses focus on society as the agent that “determines,” “creates,” “forces,” or “causes” gender performances and reproduction.</p>
<p>The pretest indicated to us that most of these upper-level students had already met our first and second learning goal—seeing the distinction between sex and gender and having a critical awareness of gender—from prior course work. However, they generally lacked an understanding of the social and active process of gender reproduction in specific cultural or institutional social contexts.</p>
<p>To understand whether the assignment affected students’ ability to meet the third and fourth learning goals, we asked another open-ended question after the submission of the assignment: “How, if at all, has your understanding of gender changed after completing the assignment?” As a whole, student responses focused on the performative “doing” of gender in interaction. Nine of 20 students expressed a newfound consciousness of their own role in constructing and policing gender. Seven of 20 stressed the interactive nature of gender construction and 6 of 20 also focused on how “unconscious” or “habitual” actions create gender. This shift in perspective was expressed most clearly by this response:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve learned in several of my classes that gender is not biological, but rather, we learn it through socialization, however, doing this exercise has also made me realize how we actually work to create differences and distinctions among what we categorize as male and female sexes. I’ve also realized how much self and peer policing affect our conceptions about gender.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All but one student in the posttest emphasized the performative and interactive nature of gender. Rather than privileging an abstracted “society” as the source of gender, students now discuss “people in society.” Instead of using verbs like “choose” and “accept” to describe individual action, they use “do,” “work,” “perform,” “expect,” “play,” “perceive,” “police,” “practice,” and “accomplish.” Thus the pre- and posttest demonstrate students’ grasp of the concept of performance and interaction in society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0092055X13480050">
<title>Student Assessment of Interactive Learning Methods</title>
<p>Our analysis of the open-ended survey question and comparison of the pre- and posttests assessed whether the assignment taught what we intended students to learn and whether it taught them something they did not already know going into the assignment. However, we created this assignment not only to teach the concept of doing gender, but also with the intention of making doing gender “stick” in a way that would allow students to use the concept in their lives beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>It is challenging to assess how students use, apply, or expand what they have learned through a particular assignment after they leave our classrooms. In this project we were only able to survey students about their perceptions of the assignment while they were still enrolled in our courses. What we offer here is thus only partial evidence of whether the interactive method we’ve advanced in this article was an effective approach for the purpose of integrating the concept into students’ lives beyond the classroom. However, we believe that students’ own sense of the impact of the exercise and their engagement with the assignment are the best measures of its efficacy available to us.</p>
<p>To give voice to students’ assessment of our teaching methods, we asked two additional questions in the post-assignment surveys in the spring 2011 lecture and seminar and on the posttest in the fall 2011 seminar. First, we asked, “How useful was the assignment relative to the lecture and readings alone,” and, second, “How valuable was the opportunity to take your own photographs, rather than analyzing images provided by the instructor?”</p>
<p>In relation to the first question, we found the assignment drew in nearly all students in both the lecture and two seminar courses, particularly those who did not have a previous basis for critical analysis of gender and students who were potentially resistant to critical analysis. Of students completing the assessment in the lecture class, 75 percent (73/97) felt the assignment significantly enhanced their learning relative to reading and lecture alone, while 5 percent reported that the assignment did not enhance their learning beyond reading and lecture. Similarly, 83 percent (16/18) of the spring 2011 seminar students and 75 percent (15/20) of the fall 2011 seminar said the assignment significantly enhanced their learning beyond reading and lecture alone.</p>
<p>Students in both the spring 2011 and fall 2011 seminars had the opportunity to add comments to the rating. Here we learned that the positive response was not simply an indication that the assignment was fun or interesting, but as explained by the more than half of the spring 2011 seminar students, the assignment also worked well because it allowed them to “apply concepts to my own life.” Others in the spring 2011 seminar who found the assignment to significantly enhance their learning also explained that it worked well because it allowed them to respond to the material in ways that were “visual,” “creative,” and “interactive;” and the analyses seemed more “authentic” because they were about real people in real contexts. A student in the fall 2011 course explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>As with many things in sociology, it is difficult to see something until it has been pointed out. As for doing gender and visualizing gender, I never really thought about it. Now I see it when I look at pictures of friends and just daily. I even introduced the concept to some of my friends and they have been pointing out examples to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others in the fall 2011 seminar talked about how the assignment changed the way they understand their roles as parents, workers, and friends. As one student put it, the assignment “helped me to learn—and believe in—‘doing gender.’”</p>
<p>We also discovered an additional benefit to students taking their own photos that we had not expected—44 percent of the spring 2011 seminar students explained that taking photos themselves gave them opportunities to talk with their subjects, usually family and friends, about the concepts they were learning in class and to consider their subjects’ perspectives on gender during this time. Students wrote enthusiastically about these conversations.</p>
<p>We believed that asking students to take their own photographs rather than to analyze provided images not only spurs individual student engagement but also allows for a rich discussion of doing gender in a variety of cultural and institutional contexts. Overall, students responded positively to the opportunity to provide the raw materials for the discussion. In the large lecture course, 72 percent of the students significantly valued the opportunity to take their own photos rather than analyzing images from popular culture, such as magazines, and only 11 percent reported that they did not value this opportunity. In both seminars, 100 percent of the students reported valuing the opportunity to take their own photos.</p>
<p>Several students in both seminars noted that the sharing and discussion of photos elicited a variety of institutional and cultural contexts and a range of analytical sophistication that remained grounded in students’ everyday lives: “Although people had similar pictures (sometimes), somehow everyone brings a new point and perspective.” Another student remarked on the diversity of gendered expectations and norms just within university social life. This type of comment was particularly prevalent among those who already reported a familiarity with theories of gender as a social construction. Even students who did not find the assignment particularly new in terms of its theoretical content noted that it was interesting to hear other students’ interpretations of the photos and that it challenged them to explain familiar theories in new ways to their peers.</p>

<sec id="section13-0092055X13480050" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our review of student work, observations of student discussion, and students’ post-assignment reflections, we find the benefit of this assignment is in a deeper engagement with the complexity of gender performance, a recognition of the multiplicity of interpretations that exist alongside shared awareness of durable structures of gender normativity, and a new awareness of the role of action in everyday life in the social construction of gender. Rather than retrofit theory onto selected experiences, students critically and inductively engage with the theory of doing gender through analysis of their own lives and through reflection on the affirming and conflicting interpretations offered by their peers. This assignment was particularly useful to us in teaching a student body that is generally wary of feminist perspectives. The assignment can facilitate a point of entry for teaching gender in institutions where the study of gender is politically embattled.</p>
<p>Overall, the assignment succeeds in helping students to understand gender as a social construction sustained in everyday interactions. It highlights students’ own practices, both as actors and audiences, drawing their attention to previously unrecognized behavior. When students take their own photographs, they are actively engaged in the process of recognizing and interpreting “doing gender.” They face real subjects who are “doing gender” in ways that are both conscious and unconscious, both reproductive and—occasionally—oppositional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X13480050">Risman 2009</xref>). As they interact with their subjects, the assumptions of both parties are brought into focus. In the accompanying essays, students become explicit about how they and their subjects evaluate and interpret gender in everyday interactions.</p>
<p>However, the process of taking photographs and writing about them does not on its own serve to connect gender in everyday life to issues of structural reproduction and change. It is the interactive component, facilitated by digital media sharing, that helps students articulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X13480050">Hays’s (1994)</xref> concepts of structurally transformative agency and structurally reproductive agency, allowing them to think about agency and institutional contexts. Throughout the sharing and discussion, students can see photo essays that focus on the broad range of behavior shared by men and women and read this as indicative of significant changes in traditional gender practices and performances. At the same time, however, they can see photo essays that demonstrate the persistence of the male/female binary, its attendant gendered practices, and the social policing and stigma attached to transgression. By seeing the range of work done by their peers and hearing differing perspectives, students examine how the agency of “doing gender” happens against an overall structure of social life that is more “durable.” Students make this sophisticated theoretical point together, teaching and learning from each other, with our facilitation.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop this assignment, we plan to utilize better the images students create in our discussions of intersectionality in other moments of the courses we teach. We have seen a number of student photographs that are well suited to discussions of race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality. Most students, however, were not prepared to discuss these issues at the time of the assignment and in some instances, conflated gender transgression with sexuality or failed to notice intersections altogether. In the future, we plan to add readings that would help students connect their observations of gender to issues of race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality by assigning, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X13480050">West and Fenstermaker (1995)</xref> “Doing Difference” or Patricia Hill Collins on black feminist thought (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X13480050">1986</xref>). We could then return to the archive of class photos and ask students to reanalyze relevant photographs.</p>
<p>Beyond this assignment’s usefulness in teaching content about the social construction of gender, it offers students an opportunity to exercise their sociological imagination. It asks students to observe reflexively social life and to uncover patterns and identify extra-individual explanations for individual behavior. In addition, students find it to be a fun and creative assignment that brings energy to the classroom, engaging students who may be otherwise reluctant to discuss theoretical concepts.</p>

<title>Appendix C: Technical and Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>The university where we offered this assignment runs its course management software through Sakai, an open source platform that provides instructors with an online space to host course readings, syllabi, assignments, and discussions. The platform is designed as both a course management system and a collaboration system for any university groups that would like an online space to share files and manage projects online. This dual design makes it particularly amenable to nonhierarchical interaction among students while still allowing instructor control over how students can use the course site.</p>
<p>We chose to use Kaltura, an open-source video and photo sharing platform, because it was available to us within our course management system and doing so gave us complete control over the visibility and accessibility of the photos. In the university’s installation of Kaltura, students only had permission to upload files and could not view or download files that were not their own. In class, the photos were displayed through the instructor or teaching assistants’ accounts. When considering adapting this assignment for other institutions, we recommend reviewing Institutional Review Board policy for student work and talking with your institution’s instructional technologists about the security protections for class photo sharing.</p>
<p>Since Kaltura was a part of the university’s course management system, it was not difficult to learn for our students or us. Kaltura allowed students to upload photos to a class gallery, name them, and add information about date and time as well as a description of unlimited characters using an interface that was similar to other tasks they have done in the course management system or in noneducational settings such as Facebook or Flickr. Occasionally, students lost information while they worked in their browsers, so we strongly encouraged them to write in a word processing program and then paste the text into Kaltura.</p>
<p>Kaltura is available for integration with Blackboard, Moodle, or Design2Learn, though its purchase would be an institutional, rather than individual faculty, decision. At some institutions, Blackboard and Moodle may have their own photo gallery options that would work as well or better for the assignment we have described. To retain the privacy of students and their subjects, we do not suggest using public platforms like Flickr, Tumblr, or Instagram in place of a closed course management system. However, public platforms such as these could be especially useful in a modified version of the assignment that asks students to photograph and comment on gendered objects—a practice that is already happening on Tumblr outside of classroom contexts. In this version of the assignment, the key consideration would be whether to have students publicly annotate their images and if so, to discuss with students the implications of writing for the broader public.</p>

Our earliest version of this assignment in the 2006 seminar allowed students to use disposable film cameras with prints submitted in paper journals or to submit digital files on CDs or flash drives. While interactive media inspired us to think about how students could share and discuss their photographs, prints could also be shared in a physical format, such as a poster presentation.</p>

For example, a single student may understand that gender is both “socially constructed” and go on to explain how difficult it is for people to transgress gender norms (“gender is rigid”). It was rare for students in the lecture to express multiple concepts in their answers, whereas roughly half of spring 2011 seminar students did so. In addition, 12 of the lecture students left the open-ended question blank or provided an unintelligible answer.</p>
