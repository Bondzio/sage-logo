         <abstract>
            <p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disorder of the small pulmonary arteries characterized by progressive fibrotic and proliferative changes that result in an increased pulmonary vascular resistance. It is a progressive and debilitating disease that leads to right ventricular dysfunction, impairment in activity tolerance and eventually right-sided heart failure, and premature death. The treatment goals for PAH include improvement in symptoms, improvement in functional class and exercise class, decreased morbidity, and preventing mortality. Combination therapy in the treatment of PAH is an emerging therapeutic option. Combining therapies with differing mechanisms of action will maximize therapeutic benefits such as symptom control and increased rate of survival. The updated 2007 American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend combination therapy in functional classes III and IV if there is no improvement with current therapy or if there is deterioration in class. PAH monotherapy has been shown to improve symptoms, but the patients’ hemodynamic parameters may not be normalized, leading to further pulmonary vascular remodeling. Combination therapy offers an additional option for those patients who are unable to stabilize on monotherapy.</p>

         <p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disorder of the small pulmonary arteries characterized by progressive fibrotic and proliferative changes that result in an increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).<sup>

            </sup> It is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or 30 mm Hg during physical activity with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), left atrial pressure, or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466046">2</xref>
            </sup> Patients presenting with a mPAP between 21 and 25 mm Hg are diagnosed with borderline pulmonary hypertension.<sup>

            </sup> PAH is a progressive and debilitating disease that leads to right ventricular dysfunction, impairment in activity tolerance and eventually right-sided heart failure, and premature death. It may occur as a complication resulting from other medical conditions, medications or as a primary disorder of the pulmonary circulation.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466046">2</xref>
            </sup> Despite the etiology, patients with PAH will show similar pathological changes in the small pulmonary arteries and resulting symptoms.<sup>

         <title>Epidemiology and Classification</title>
         <p>PAH is a rare condition with an annual incidence ranging from 1.1 to 7.6 cases per million people and a prevalence of 15 to 26 cases per million people.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466046">5</xref>
            </sup> The mean age at diagnosis is in the third or fourth decade of life, but studies have revealed patients being diagnosed at age 70 or greater. Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) is more common in women and the most common form overall.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466046">6</xref>
            </sup> PAH is classified based upon the categories established by the World Health Organization (WHO), with modifications made in 2008 to the clinical classifications.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466046">6</xref>
            </sup> Group I PAH includes idiopathic, heritable, mutation in the transforming growth factor β signaling family (ie, bone morphogenic protein receptor type II [BMPR-2], activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK-1], or endoglin), unknown and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease, connective tissue diseases, drugs and toxins, human immunodeficiency virus, portal hypertension, hemoglobinopathies, and myoloproliferative disorders. Hereditary PAH is the result of a mutation in the BMPR-2 that causes an alteration in cellular apoptosis that leads to pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, and 10% to 20% of mutation carriers typically develop PAH. The differentiation between the clinical classification of hereditary as compared to mutation in the transforming growth factor B signaling family is that patients may present with or without identified germ line mutations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466046">3</xref>
            </sup> The current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines support genetic testing in individuals of family members known to carry the mutation.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466046">2</xref>
            </sup> Other WHO categories for PAH include group II PAH with known left heart disease, group III PAH associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia, group IV PAH due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease, and group V PAH due to miscellaneous conditions.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466046">2</xref>
            </sup> A new category of group 1 includes PAH as a result of pulmonary venoocclusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.</p>
         <p>The specific mechanism in which medications cause an increase in pulmonary pressure is unknown but is thought to be through vasoconstrictive and growth-modulating effects on smooth muscle cells within the pulmonary vasculature.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012466046">7</xref>
            </sup> Anorectic agents are most strongly associated with the development of PAH. Medications are classified as either definite, very likely, or possible causes of PAH. Fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and aminorex are classified as definite; amphetamines are classified as very likely; meta-amphetamines and chemotherapy agents are classified as possible. A review of the patient’s drug history is important upon evaluation for PAH and at diagnosis.</p>
         <p>The overall prognosis for PAH is poor with a 1-year mortality rate of 15% based upon current therapies. The reported survival rate for PAH without treatment is 2.8 years.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012466046">8</xref>
            </sup> Prognosis is also related to underlying etiology. Those patients with scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension have a poorer prognosis than patients diagnosed with IPAH. Currently, there is no cure for PAH, but over the past 2 decades there have been advancements in medications targeting structural and hemodynamic abnormalities within the pulmonary arteries.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466046">2</xref>
            </sup> These advancements have led to increased survival through the use of mono- or combination therapy.</p>

         <title>Pathophysiology</title>
         <p>The pathophysiology of PAH is based upon increased PVR due to restricted flow through the pulmonary arterial circulation leading to right-sided heart failure.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466046">6</xref>
            </sup> PAH is primarily a disorder of the small pulmonary arteries characterized by intimal hyperplasia, medial hypertrophy, thrombosis, inflammation, and cellular proliferation. Dysfunction in the prostacyclin, endothelin and nitric oxide pathways and vascular remodeling due to excessive cellular proliferation, and reduced rates of apoptosis further cause hypertension in the pulmonary arteries. Abnormalities in the endothelium include increased production of vasoconstrictor compounds, such as endothelin and thromboxane, and decreased production of vasodilators, such as prostacyclin. Another contributing process is platelet dysfunction causing the formation of thrombi that obstruct blood flow within the vasculature. The combination of these disorders results in an increased PVR leading to increased pulmonary pressures both at rest and during exertion.</p>
         <p>Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of PAH has guided the development of treatment options that promote vasodilation and inhibit cell growth. These options include treatment with prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonism, and inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5.</p>

      <sec id="section3-0897190012466046">
         <title>Diagnosis</title>
         <p>The common presenting symptoms of PAH include dyspnea on exertion, edema, fatigue, and chest pain.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012466046">9</xref>
            </sup> Early in the disease, patients are generally asymptomatic with initial symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance leading patients to believe it is related to their level of fitness. Many patients are diagnosed late in the disease state when it is advanced and structural changes are irreversible. Data from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) registry show that 21.1% of patients who were enrolled in the registry had greater than 2 years (34.1 ± 1.2 months) between the diagnoses of PAH and the initial onset of symptoms.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012466046">9</xref>
            </sup> Researchers found that the onset of symptoms at a younger age and comorbid respiratory illnesses were associated with delayed PAH diagnoses. The most common comorbidities associated with PAH include hypertension, obesity, collagen vascular diseases, clotting disorders, obstructive airway diseases, and the use of anorexigens or amphetamines.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012466046">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012466046">10</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Noninvasive diagnostic testing options for PAH include chest radiography, echocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function testing (PFT), computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466046">6</xref>
            </sup> Chest radiography usually shows a right ventricular enlargement with a prominent central pulmonary artery, but normal chest radiography does not rule out PAH. ECG is useful in diagnosing PAH by estimating right ventricular systolic pressure with a pressure greater than 40 mm Hg warranting further evaluation. PFT is utilized as a diagnostic tool to identify the underlying lung disease. CT and MRI are newer imagining techniques used in evaluating patients with PAH. These modalities are being explored for their capabilities in assessing right ventricular mass, volumes, and function. Other diagnostic tests that may be useful in differentiating causes for PAH include overnight oximetry, arterial blood gases, HIV testing, liver function tests, and antinuclear antibody serology.</p>
         <p>Patients that are considered to be at risk for PAH should be screened periodically, which includes patients with a known BMPR-2 mutation, scleroderma, thromboembolic disease, and portal hypertension.<sup>

            </sup> If pulmonary hypertension is suspected based upon history and physical examination, performing an echocardiograph can identify possible causes. Definitive diagnosis of PAH is made by right-sided heart catheterization revealing an elevated mPAP and PVR with a normal PCWP. Upon diagnosis, patients are evaluated based upon the limitation of physical activity and other pulmonary and cardiac symptoms; their symptoms are placed in a WHO Functional Class as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012466046">Table 1</xref>.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012466046">7</xref>
            </sup> It is important to determine the patient’s functional class at baseline and to follow throughout the course of the disease in an effort to best guide pharmacotherapeutic management. Prior to development of the WHO Functional Class in 2004, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification for heart failure was utilized for evaluating disease severity.</p>

This is determined during right heart catheterization with the patient being exposed to either nitric oxide, intravenous epoprostenol, inhaled epoprostenol or iloprost, or adenosine. CCBs are believed to halt the progression of the disease by improving pulmonary hemodynamics. Diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine are the 3 agents currently used in the treatment of PAH. Diltiazem is the preferred agent in those patients that have a heart rate of greater than 100 beats/min, nifedipine for a heart rate of less than 100 beats/min, and amlodipine for patients unable to tolerate the other two agents. An alternative treatment should be initiated if the patient does not respond to therapy with an improvement in functional class.</p>

               </sup> The major mechanism of action is similar to epoprostenol, but its main pharmacokinetic advantage is the longer half-life (4 hours), thus minimizing the risk of rebound pulmonary hypertension crisis. Clinical benefits of treprostinil include improvement in hemodynamic parameters, symptoms, exercise capacity, and possible survival in patients with PAH.<sup>

               </sup> There have been two endothelin-receptor isoforms identified, endothelin A (ET-A) and endothelin B (ET-B). Stimulation of ET-A receptors results in vasoconstriction, smooth muscle proliferation, and inflammation; whereas stimulation of ET-B receptors results in dilation and clearance of endothelin. Levels of ET-1 are thought to be elevated in PAH, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>
            <p>Bosentan and ambrisentan are the two oral ETRAs currently FDA approved for treatment of PAH. Bosentan is a nonselective, sulphonamide-based ETRA with activity at both the ET-A and ET-B receptors.<sup>

Ambrisentan is a nonsulfonamide-based, moderately selective ETRA with activity primarily at the ET-A receptor. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits or ETRA therapy on morbidity through significant improvement in 6MWD, Borg dyspnea index, improvement in WHO functional class, and increased time to clinical worsening (TTCW). Bosentan is FDA approved for treatment of patients with functional class III and IV PAH, and ambrisentan is approved in the treatment of functional class II and III.<sup>

            <p>The combination treatment of a prostanoid plus ETRA has been studied in 3 randomized controlled trials and a retrospective study. The BREATHE-2 trial (Bosentan randomized trial of endothelin antagonist therapy for PAH) was the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine the potential benefit of combination therapy with epoprostenol plus bosentan in 33 patients in NYHA classes III and IV.<sup>

               </sup> The trial lasted 16 weeks, and sample patients were initiated on epoprostenol therapy with later randomization to either bosentan or placebo. The combination treatment group did show a trend toward improvement in the primary outcome of total pulmonary resistance as compared to monotherapy, but the trend was not found to be statistically significant. The same was true for chosen secondary outcomes of improvement in 6MWD, dyspnea–fatigue rating, and improvement in functional class. Adverse effects reported more commonly in the combination therapy group included leg edema and diarrhea.</p>
            <p>The combination of iloprost and bosentan has been studied in two multicenter, randomized controlled trials. The STEP (Safety and pilot efficacy trial in combination with bosentan for evaluation in PAH) study was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial that enrolled 67 patients already receiving bosentan in NYHA classes II through IV.<sup>

The study did show significant benefit in combination therapy over monotherapy in improvement of NYHA functional class (34% in combination therapy group vs 6% in the placebo group, <italic>P</italic> = .02), postinhalation reductions in mPAP (−6 vs 2 mm Hg, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and PVR (−164 vs 81 dyn sec cm<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>P </italic>= .0007). The study failed to show significant improvement in Borg dyspnea scale or 6MWD with combination therapy. Preinhalation hemodynamic parameters were not shown to be statistically different between the two groups.</p>
            <p>The second study examining the use of combination therapy with iloprost and bosentan was the COMBI (Combining inhaled iloprost with bosentan in patients with IPAH).<sup>

Patients enrolled in the study were already taking bosentan 125 mg twice daily. The combination therapy study group received iloprost 5 mcg inhaled 6 times daily with nighttime interruptions. The primary outcome evaluated in the trial was improvement in 6MWD. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, clinical decline, change in functional class, peak oxygen uptake, ventilatory efficacy, and peak systolic blood pressure during exercise. The trial was terminated early due to the likelihood of not reaching the clinical outcomes with recruitment of only 40 patients from a 70 patient projection. Analysis of the data showed that there was no statistical difference between primary or secondary outcomes. The 6MWD in the treatment group was 317 ± 75 m at baseline and 309 ± 124 m after 12 weeks of treatment (<italic>P </italic>= .65). In the control group, baseline 6MWD was 296 ± 79 m and 297 ± 94 m after 12 weeks. Patients enrolled in the COMBI trial did have more advanced disease as compared to previous trials, and the sample size was not large enough to definitively detect a difference between the two treatment groups.</p>

               </sup> Survival rates for patients treated from January 2002 to December 2004 were compared to a historical control of patients treated between January 1999 and December 2001. The investigators set the goals of therapy to be a 6MWD of greater than 380 m, peak oxygen uptake of greater than 10.4 mL/min per kg, and a maximum systolic blood pressure during exercise of greater than 120 mm Hg. Patients meeting all 3 treatment goals were considered clinically stable. Patients were initiated on bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by 125 mg twice daily thereafter. Patients not meeting one or more of the treatment goals by the second visit were initiated on combination therapy according to a predetermined algorithm. Sildenafil 25 mg 3 to 4 times daily titrated to 50 mg 3 times daily, if needed, was the first-line add-on therapy. If treatment goals were not met with this combination, inhaled iloprost was then added to therapy. Intravenous iloprsot and lung transplantation were the alternative treatments for patients not reaching the treatment goals on triple therapy. A total of 118 patients, from the 123 PAH patients, were initiated on monotherapy. Of all, 51 patients (43.2%) required 2-combination therapy, 19 patients (16.1%) required a 3-drug therapy regimen, 5 patients (4.2%) received intravenous iloprost, and one patient required lung transplantation. When compared to the historical control group, survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was found to be 93%, 83.1%, and 79.9%, respectively (<italic>P </italic>= .047). Additionally, transplantation-free survival was found to be better in the goal-oriented treatment group (<italic>P </italic>= .007) as well as survival free from transplant and intravenous prostanoid treatment (<italic>P </italic>= .002). Combination therapy was well tolerated in all patients with no signs or symptoms of additive toxicities.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The ACCP treatment algorithm for PAH recommends initiating therapy with a single agent based upon the patient’s current WHO functional class.<sup>

            </sup> Many clinicians will start therapy with an ETRA or PDI based upon the ease of administration and tolerability. A meta-analysis performed by Ryerson et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012466046">8</xref>
            </sup> analyzed monotherapy in PAH and concluded that the ETRAs and PDIs did provide an improvement in clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, but there was no improvement in mortality. The prostanoids were the only class that actually showed an improvement in both morbidity and mortality. Combination therapy allows the potential for improving patient outcomes through complementary effects targeting multiple pathways. The progressive characteristic of this disease does provide a strong rationale for combination therapy, but its place in treatment is yet to be determined. Clinical evidence has shown the combination of two to three agents from different classes improves 6MWD and functional class, but the optimal regimen has not been established.</p>
         <p>The most recent updated ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding medical therapy in PAH recommends combination therapy if there is no improvement in symptoms or if the patient experiences a deterioration in current therapy.<sup>

            </sup> The 2009 Expert Consensus Report from the American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology makes a recommendation of grade IIA or IIB for combination therapy, interpreted as the evidence and opinion is in favor of the benefit and effectiveness.<sup>

            </sup> The authors’ evaluation of current trials found a significant increase in 6MWD; however, functional class did not improve.</p>
         <p>Current practice for first-line therapy in PAH is treatment with oral agents, the exception being patients with advanced disease.<sup>

Smaller clinical trials examining the combination have shown mixed results regarding improvement in 6MWD, hemodynamic parameters, and functional class. The largest trial to date, PHIRST, did demonstrate that the combination increases 6MWD, improves TTCW, and quality of life at a higher dose of tadalafil,<sup>

         <p>There have been several clinical trial and case reports of combination therapy with a prostanoid and oral therapy. Smaller case series have had mixed results with regard to improvement in hemodynamics, functional class, TTCW, and 6MWD. The two larger trials to date, PACES and TRIUMPH-1, both demonstrated an improvement in 6MWD, but had opposite results with TTCW and improvement in functional class.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The appropriate place and agents in PAH treatment with combination therapy is yet to be determined. Clinical trials have shown some improvement in patients on monotherapy with advancement to combination therapy if there is deterioration in class or upon symptom worsening. Establishing the place of combination treatment in therapy, be it initially or upon deterioration, will require additional evidence established by multicenter, randomized clinical trials.</p>
