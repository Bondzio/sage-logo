In order to be effective,
Christian development practitioners need to have a comprehensive understanding
of poverty informed by the concepts and definitions used by the poor themselves.
Far too often, this is not the case. Research shows that community level
understandings of poverty encompass a gamut of relational, material, cultural,
psychological, and spiritual variables that are often overlooked, and that
need to be taken into account for more effective holistic, transformational
development to take place.

Introduction
Without a doubt, Christians are called to work with the poor, and to serve
the needs of the least advantaged.1 To be truly effective in this work, one
must have a comprehensive understanding of poverty that goes beyond material
depriva- tion to include both the psychological and spiritual aspects of poverty.2
And, this understanding of poverty needs to be informed by the concepts and
definitions used by the poor themselves.3 In practice, however, this is very
often not the case. Even with the empha- sis on `holistic' and `transformational
development' (Myers, 1999), Christian development practitioners still have
`blind spots' when it comes to the content and the sources of the formal and
informal theories of poverty that guide their actions. On the one hand, the
notion of poverty as material deprivation still dominates, with the psychological
and spiritual dimensions given short shrift. On the other, even when the psychological
and spiritual dimensions of poverty are incorporated, most often this is done
by drawing on academic writings and
131
insights
and not from consultation with those with whom the development practitioner
is working. This article seeks to shed light on those blind spots and point
the way towards how evangelical development workers can use a more comprehensive
under- standing of poverty to engage in more effective development work. It
does so by quickly reviewing theories and understandings of poverty that have
informed Christian development practice, and then by contrasting this frame
of reference with the results of community-based research done by 60 Eastern
University development worker graduate students in 27 different countries
of Asia and Africa in 2006 and 2007. This research asked the people of the
`poor' communities themselves to define poverty and its causes, their analysis
of the state of relation- ships between the `poor' and `non-poor,' and their
perception of vulnerability to external shocks. The results of this research
show that the understandings of poverty emanating from the `poor' themselves
need to be taken into account in development work, and encompass the gamut
of relational, material, cultural, psychological, and spiritual variables.
If development workers have a greater appreciation for the knowledge that
the poor bring to the table on this subject, the opportunities for more effective
holistic, transformational development will increase. Understandings of Poverty
Over the last decade, evangelical writings on poverty and development have
grown significantly in depth and sophistication. These writings have drawn
on both secular and religious analyses, and provide a framework for understanding
poverty that guides development practice. The most common understanding of
poverty comes from the theory of depriva- tion in which the poor experience
a deficit that defines their lives (Myers, 1999). Most of the time, it is
an obvious deficit of material goods – lack of adequate nutrition,
housing, school uniforms or other necessities of life. A more sophisticat-
ed version of this approach to poverty concerns a deficit of knowledge: the
poor do not have the knowledge necessary to move themselves out of poverty.
And, of course, evangelicals should add that the poor have a lack of spiritual
connection to God in their lives (Myers, 1999). In fact, the spiritual dimensions
of poverty are only one of several factors and variables that add necessary
depth to the material understanding of poverty. Robert Chambers, for example,
offers the concept of `poverty as entanglement' in which the poor are caught
in a `poverty trap' of material poverty, physical weakness, powerlessness,
isolation and vulnerability (Chambers, 1983). John Friedman, on the other
hand, proposes that poverty comes from a lack of access to social power in
which the household is under the influence of power from four different domains:
state power, political power, economic power, and social power (Friedman,
1992). And other secular authors, extending as far back as Oscar Lewis in
the 1950s, point to cultural factors as being a major explanatory variable
(Harrison and Huntingdon, 2001; Lewis, 1966). From an evangelical perspective,
Jayakumar Christian takes these theories fur- ther in his description of `poverty
as disempowerment'. Like Chambers and his `poverty trap', Christian sees the
poor as trapped in a complex web of systems that keeps them disempowered.
He addresses the concepts of physical weakness, inadequate worldviews, the
marred identity of the poor, and the poor as vic- tims of the `god-complex'
of the non-poor. Christian also brings in the spiritual
132
perspective
with a categorization of religious systems and notes that the poor are often
deceived, in a variety of ways, by evil principalities and powers in rebellion
against the kingdom of God (Christian, 1999). Bryant Myers elaborates on Christian's
theory, adding that broken relationships between God and his people, among
people, and between people and nature, are the causes of poverty and thus
the starting point for transformational development (Myers, 1999).4 To what
extent do these analyses by evangelical writers mirror the actual frame- works
used by Christians to interpret poverty and engage in action? Two decades
ago, Richard Mouw (1989) found five distinctive understandings of the poor
by evangelical Christians. •~ The~ poor~ are~ made~ in~ the~ image~ of~
God,~ and~ have~ been~ gifted~ by~ God~ but~ lack~ education, and thus the
opportunities, skills, and knowledge to move out of poverty. The role of the
development worker is to plug the gap of these deprivations. •~ The~
poor~ are~ people~ in~ rebellion,~ living~ out~ their~ sinful~ nature.~ They~
are~ lazy~ and~ make poor choices, and as a result it is their own fault that
they are poor. This behavior pattern becomes enshrined in their culture and
keeps the society and community in rebellion against God and, therefore, in
poverty. This perspective gives development workers the rationale to pursue
spiritual transformation in the development process, focusing on redeeming
the sinful nature of the poor. •~ The~ poor~ are~ Christ~ incarnate,~
the~ `least~ of~ these'~ (from~ Matthew~ 25).~ Therefore,~ they need love
and compassion, and someone to come alongside them as part of the development
process to relieve their suffering. •~ The~ poor~ are~ `lost~ souls'~
who~ will~ have~ a~ better~ future~ in~ eternity.~ The~ imperative~ for development
workers here is to preach the gospel to save the poor, with `development'
work being secondary. •~ The~ poor~ are~ God's~ `favorites':~ `Blessed~
are~ the~ poor~ for~ theirs~ is~ the~ kingdom~ of~ heaven' (Matthew 5:3).
In this viewpoint, poverty is seen as having structural causes. The poor are
oppressed by the non-poor in a two-tiered structure, and the role of the development
worker is to help the poor nd their voice and to work for justice
and empowerment within the sociopolitical system. Evangelical development
organizations and practitioners have been formed in settings where their understandings
of poverty have been shaped by a combina- tion of the concepts and tendencies
listed, although the understanding of poverty as a state of material and resource
deprivation continues to predominate. All of these understandings, however,
share one important limitation: they have been formed with little consultation
with the poor themselves. It is high time that, as with any good development
practice, we pay attention to what the poor are say- ing about their own understandings
of poverty and its causes, and to how those understandings can, and must,
shape development efforts. Overcoming Blind Spots on Poverty through Research
A development professional enters the vocation already conditioned from previous
life experiences, at times including formal education in the field of development.
Through these experiences, the development worker forms biases based on either
cultural or individual influences as to what works, what is good, and what
is right (Samuel, 1995). Included in this previous conditioning is an understanding
of pov- erty. When a development worker finds himself in a situation that
conflicts with his previous understanding or training, the development worker
may be tempted to `reframe' his current experience with the poor to fit his
preconceived assumptions
133
(Chambers,
1997). The caution then for development workers is to examine previ- ous conditioning,
life experiences, and assumptions concerning poverty, and to be open to changing
those assumptions before being tempted to `reframe' the current experience.
One of the dangers with current evangelical praxis in development is that
it is guided in great part by an application of the theory of deprivation
as a work- ing definition of poverty, whether it be in the material or the
spiritual sense. In immediately pinpointing what the poor lack as a starting
point for development, the development workers are tempted to believe that
they are needed by the poor to `fix' the situation, rather than engaging in
a journey with them in which gifts, talents, and skills are shared and learned
from mutually in the process of develop- ment (Christian, 1999; Myers, 1999).
One of the consequences of this starting point is that it hampers this mutual
journey, and the effectiveness of the development endeavor, leading to a lack
of consultation with the poor around the nature of poverty itself in its fullest
dimensions. As part of its Masters in Organizational Leadership degree program,
focused on development practice, Eastern University sought to address this
problem by creating a course called `Perspectives on Poverty and Development'.
During 2006 and 2007, 60 development workers, 28 women and 32 men, from 27
different countries in Asia and Africa, enrolled in this degree program and
carried out field research as part of this course. In almost every case, the
development worker was a local national studying poverty in his or her own
country of birth.5 Before attending the three-day `Perspectives' course, each
development profes- sional was asked to spend 48 hours in a community defined
by their organization as `poor'. The participants were asked to stay in the
home of a local family while filling out a formal research journal of specific
questions to guide the collection of primary research. The purpose of these
home visits was to build relationships and trust in order to find out how
the poor defined their own life situation, what they saw as the causes of
their poverty or life situation, their relationships with the poor or non-poor
in the community, and their perceptions of vulnerability to the external influences
that affected situations of poverty in their community. The graduate students/development
workers brought the results of this research to a three day `residency' as
part of this course, and examined their find- ings in the light of the theories
of poverty and accompanying models of develop- ment. After this three day
session each participant was asked to spend another 48 hours in the same home
to facilitate a deeper understanding of the household's as well as the community's
situation. The unique and important feature about these surveys and research
is that those designated as `poor' were explicitly asked about their perceptions
of their own situations. Previous research has often used objective measures
of income or assets to categorize people as poor, or has been based on observations
of the poor rather than on deep discussions with the subjects of the study.
The rest of this article looks at the information that was gathered, focusing
on what these professional development workers had not realized about poverty
in their own countries before undertaking the Perspectives course and engaging
in the field research. Blind spots, prejudices, and many other preconceived
understand- ings of the development workers were revealed and challenged.
In reviewing the information collected by the development workers, patterns
and trends emerged, some that supported previous understandings of the poor,
and some that provides added insight for evangelicals working in the field
of development.
134
Defining
Poverty The first question the development workers in the `Perspectives on
Poverty and Development' course presented to the poor was to ask them to define
and describe their own situations. This was the key question in this study
as most development professionals arrived in a community with a preconceived
understanding of pov- erty from their training and life experiences. Many
of the researchers found their preconditioned understandings significantly
challenged by the results. A textbook understanding of poverty is that the
poor are those who cannot `command sufficient resources to satisfy basic needs'
(Todaro and Stephen, 2006: 202). The poor may be counted as those living below
a specific level of real income, measured in purchasing power parity (PPP),
or the `less than a dollar a day' concept used by the World Bank (that amount
has been adjusted for infla- tion to $1.25 per day as of 2008). Since the
organization for which the graduate students worked focused on the `poorest
of the poor' (less than $1.25 per day), the participants in this study chose
to visit families who were determined to be `poor' by this `objective' international
standard.6 What the development workers came to find out through their research
was that poverty meant many different things to different people,7 and that
identifying their hosts in the community as `poor' surprised and insulted
many of the community members who entered into such discussions with the researchers.
In large part, this was because the definition of `poor' used at the community
level was based not on level of income received, but rather on the assets
that one owned. In Southern Sudan and Ethiopia, for example, as in many regions
of East Africa, researchers found that the number of oxen owned was an indicator
of wealth and status within the community. If a community member owned even
one ox, he was not considered poor. Yet development projects were set up among
these people who had no idea they needed `help' from the outside world because
they were not poor in their own eyes. In Ethiopia, owning three pairs of oxen
determined that one was a very wealthy man, whereas in Southern Sudan it was
two. The ownership of plough oxen, dairy cows, and even land provided assets
that could generate an income, therefore the owner was not considered poor
within the community. However, a development worker from outside of that area
might label these rural farmers as the `poorest of the poor' if one used the
arbitrary definition from the World Bank, even though these people did not
consider themselves poor. One researcher from Tanzania confessed that he had
understood poverty as primarily material deprivation, but when he interviewed
the community mem- bers whom he determined as `poor' he was surprised that
they did not define poverty in the same way. The community members confidently
claimed that they were not poor at all, and then listed the `assets' that
they owned, the sources of their income, and even their vision for the future.
These people, who from an out- sider 's perspective would clearly fit the
World Bank definition of the `poorest of the poor', refused to say that that
poverty was an issue in their community. In this particular case, the development
worker was able to discuss the issue more deeply on his second visit to the
community. In his second visit his new friends shared with him that they used
to think that poverty was just a question of material wealth, but after the
development organization's work in the com- munity, their attitude and understanding
had changed to the belief that knowl- edge of the resources available and
the motivation to work can prevent one from
135
experiencing
poverty. The conclusion of this researcher was that the definition of poverty
was derived from one's attitude and perspective rather than material wealth
or income. In another part of Africa, a Ugandan development worker reached
an identi- cal conclusion after he visited a slum in Kampala, Uganda, and
spent time in two different homes with identical material circumstances: both
homes were the same size and in the same neighborhood, and both households
were headed up by women in their mid-30s.8 In the first home, the researcher
was greeted with warm hospitality and invited into a small home that was clean
and well-kept. The homeowner also took care of herself, shared what little
she had to eat, and claimed that she was not poor at all. The researcher visited
the second home, which showed no signs of care, and the woman who headed the
second house- hold expressed significant self-pity and claimed to be a victim
of her circum- stances. In these contrasting cases, it would be difficult
to say that an `objective' definition of poverty could be rooted in issues
of income levels or material pos- sessions. Rather, the definitions appear
to be based in the perspective and attitude of the specific people involved.9
In summary, throughout these regions of East Africa the development workers
found that it was difficult, if not impossible, to predict who would identify
them- selves as poor based solely on the level of material possessions. In
other words, the psychological variables, the variables of attitude and perspective,
rather than variables within the framework of material deprivation, were far
more important for explaining how people understood poverty. Some people in
these communities who to the outsider appeared to be poor based on the understanding
of poverty as material deprivation refused to label themselves as such and
appeared to make do with what they had and lead contented, although difficult,
lives. Others, at the same level of material wealth, labeled themselves as
poor and led less contented lives. What does this mean for development work?
People in these communities may have been caught in a `poverty trap' of their
physical circumstances as defined by Chambers (1983), but there is no doubt
that the implications of this trap had much to do with their own perceptions.
The attitudes and perceptions, one could posit, might hold the key to not
only a higher quality of life based on what one does have, but also might
hold the keys to possibilities for development: those with more hope and more
positive outlook might be able to better take advantage of and help create
opportunities for progress. Therefore, development workers coming into communities
such as these need to reframe their own perceptions and understandings, redefine
their rationale for working in such a community, remain- ing sensitive to
the perceptions of community members, and be aware of the need to help nurture
and foster attitudes and perceptions that lead to hope amidst dif- ficult
situations, rather than relying on arbitrary statistics or shallow understand-
ings that define poverty in ways that hide these important factor. And, in
order to do this, one must be aware of what gives rise to these attitudes
and perceptions, in short, what the causes of poverty are as seen by the people
themselves. Causes of Poverty In defining poverty, the question of what causes
poverty was asked during the conversations that the development workers had
with the homes and communi- ties they visited. In these conversations, they
realized that their own preconceived notions of the causes of poverty were
challenged by the responses they heard.
136
Once
again, the researchers found that the causes perceived by the community had
little to do with lack of material assets or income, but that the psychological
and spiritual causes of poverty were much more influential and important to
the subjects of these community visits.1 0 In Vietnam, for example, those
who self-identified as poor felt that their mate- rial circumstances were
a result of failures in an earlier life, therefore attributing everything
wrong in their current life as punishment for wrongs done in the dis- tant
past. This left them with a sense of hopelessness, an attitude of `cannot
do', and thus with no motivation to try to change their current situation.
They were very sensitive to the supernatural influences in their lives, and
believed that the spiritual powers left them no control over their material
circumstances. Similar explanations were found within communities across East
Africa in Christian and non-Christian households. In Ethiopia, for example,
some believed that their cur- rent poverty was a result of God's punishment
on the past and present genera- tions' sins. In other words, the cause of
their poverty, as they identified it, was spiritual, an example of Jayakumar
Christian's `deception by principalities and powers' within the religious
system of his model of `poverty as disempowerment' (Christian, 1999). Until
the spiritual deception could be dealt with in the develop- ment process,
the people of these communities had no reason to believe that their levels
of living or poor material circumstances could be changed.1 11 The spiritual
causes of poverty were supplemented by a variety of other vari- ables identified
by people in the communities visited by the researchers. Some blamed their
poverty on their families: they were destined to be poor simply because they
were `born into poverty', or because their fathers and forefathers did not
leave them property to inherit so that they could establish a life for their
own families in the current generation. Others believed that the cause of
poverty was the deterioration of economic conditions due toward the lack of
government efforts to help the poor. Finally, some identified the causes of
poverty as a lack of education, and some as laziness, inefficiency, or incompetence
by the poor themselves. Those who blamed their families or the government
felt little respon- sibility for the situation and little power to change
it, a classic case of feelings of disempowerment (Friedman, 1992). Quite a
different picture emerged, however, from Kenya, where development workers
interviewed community members in the slums of Kibera, Nairobi. There, the
development workers found that the causes of poverty were seen as tem- porary
by the community members, who claimed that because they were liter- ate, they
were able to work, and were just waiting for opportunity for gainful employment
so that they could move to a better place. These community mem- bers pointed
out that only when one became infected with HIV/AIDS did the causes of poverty
become permanent, as one became locked into a web of physi- cal weakness,
isolation, vulnerability, and powerlessness, echoing the analysis of the poverty
trap described by Chambers (1983). This disease is seen as a cause of poverty
at both the micro level of the community as well as the macro pandemic level,
bringing with it feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. A final, and major,
cause of poverty identified in the research had to do with the state of relationships
within the communities themselves. People in the com- munities themselves
stated that broken, conflictive, and unjust relationships in and of themselves
were major causes of poverty, and it is to the relational aspect that we now
turn.
137
Relationships
within the Community Many of the development workers found through their interviews
that relation- ships within the community were a significant factor determining
the material circumstances and provided another challenge to their development
work that they had not previously considered. In communities in Tanzania,
for example, people in the communities expressed that broken and unjust relationships
were the cause of poverty. There were broken relationships between Christians
and other religious groups in the community that were independent of material
cir- cumstances or levels of income. There were also broken relationships
among the poor, where they would not share their surplus crops or care for
each other 's children, keeping families isolated and poor. There were also
broken relationships among community members and development workers who were
trying to bring in support activities and interventions that would help the
community have a bet- ter life. These broken relationships, part of the psychological
and spiritual aspects of poverty, created an `absence of shalom' as described
in Jayakumar Christian's and Bryant Myer 's models of poverty (Christian,
1999; Myers, 1999). In the Philippines, the developments worker found a similar
perceived rela- tionship between problems in relationships, attitudes and
feelings, and material difficulties, albeit with a different perceptual starting
point. A feeling of hope- lessness had led to an attitude of passivity, not
caring about others and thus not wanting to participate in the development
activities and projects. Community members reported that they `faced the pain
of malicious gossip and criticism, the difficulty of relating to different
personalities, and the hardship of thinking through and analyzing problems
and solutions'. In one community in Cambodia, on the other hand, the development
worker found a spirit of caring and cooperation within a community that resulted
from the strength of the community leaders. The communities in Cambodia had
no more material wealth than the communities in the Philippines as measured
by traditional statistics, and even though both fit the category of the `poorest
of the poor' using the World Bank criteria, they had very different types
of relationships within the community. In this particular community in Cambodia,
the leadership showed compassion and concern for the members of the community.
They cre- ated a community of transparency and trust so that they could foster
activities to help the poor such as community savings, microloans, and income
management projects. One development worker commented that a community such
as this was rare in Cambodia, but that the strong local leadership could truly
change the way a poor community functioned. In the same way, researchers found
communities in Ethiopia where a variety of social structures and relationships
existed that helped to prevent poverty. Some of these were kinship-based,
where living and working in kinship groups helped one avoid poverty as the
groups took care of one another and met together to plan their income generating
activities. Others were community-based support systems, with a strong focus
on support outside of the kinship groups for orphans and vulnerable children
and for community members experiencing illness, death of a relative, or other
hardships. It is one thing to identify the important impact on poverty and
quality of life that particular kinds of relationships, attitudes, systems,
and leaders have in a community. It is quite another to apply these insights
to development programs, since changing relationships, attitudes, and perceptions
is a process fraught with
138
challenges,
especially when relationships are broken. In Zimbabwe, the develop- ment workers
assumed that offering self-help or support groups in a particular community
would provide a common rallying point for the community to come together to
effect change. Yet, local level and macro level conflict and disillu- sionment
had `crowded out' any sense of support among community members. Conflicts
among local leaders overshadowed the development needs of the com- munity.
There was a lack of unity and love among the people there, one develop- ment
worker summed up her experience there in this way: `I have never seen two
men from this area walking side by side'. In fact, lack of unity, power struggles,
and infighting are, as people in the com- munities stated, a major cause of
poverty and are a serious restraint to the devel- opment process. Many times,
these conflicts stem from the relationships between the poor and non-poor
and the attitudes and perceptions that accompany them, and for this reason
it is important to examine those relationships more closely.1 2 The Relationship
of the Poor to the Non-poor The relationship between the poor and non-poor
in the communities was a major focal point of the research carried out by
the graduate students. The guiding ques- tions were the following: `How do
the non-poor of the community describe the poor? What is their individual
or collective relationship to them? What was the relationship of the members
of their households to the non-poor?' Based on the responses from community
members to these questions, the researchers found that the relationships between
the poor and the non-poor affected the community members' perceptions of the
causes of their material cir- cumstances and of their social status. Many
of these preconceived definitions of poverty in the minds of both groups come
out of the relationship between them and the way that each group perceived
the other. Few researchers found a positive relationship between the poor
and the non- poor. One example of a positive relationship was in a community
in Ethiopia where the researcher found that the non-poor in the community
she visited were willing to share seed and oxen with the poor, and to loan
money to the non-poor to get them through challenging times. More often, however,
the researchers found either an adversarial relationship or very negative
perceptions of the poor by the non-poor. A common trend was that the non-poor
of the community saw the poor as `lazy', blaming the poor themselves for their
own poor material con- ditions. This attitude was prevalent in communities
even where there was little evidence to distinguish the poor from the non-poor.
In several countries in Africa, the researchers found that the non-poor were
exploiting the poor. One example of this was hiring the children of the poor
to herd the animals of the non-poor. This freed up the non-poor children from
the family responsibilities so that they could go to school, meanwhile preventing
the poor children from receiving an education.13 Exploitive relationships
were also found in Cambodia, but rather than consisting of an exploitation
of labor, they were based on usury. A common finding across the researchers
was that the non-poor usually hired the poor for their own benefit, not for
the benefit of providing income for the poor, and that the poor were not given
leadership positions in the traditional social structure so that they could
make decisions to protect their own welfare and that of their children. One
additional key facet to these non-poor/poor relationships was that the non-poor
discouraged the poor from aspiring to a better life, perpetuating the belief
that the poor were inferior and keeping them in a subservient position.
139
However,
this was not necessarily a `conscious' or `intentional' purpose by the non-poor,
in that their attitudes and actions towards the poor were legitimated through
a variety of beliefs. For example, the belief of the non-poor in several Ethiopian
communities was that the poor were actually created by God to `serve' the
non-poor. In a community in Swaziland, the poor were described by the non-
poor as cursed ones who are too lazy to take care of themselves. Because the
poor do not have enough to eat, or a decent house that can survive the rainy
season, they become a burden to the non-poor. Yet the non-poor in this community
described the poor as people given to them by God to work for the non-poor.
The relationship then becomes one of master and servant, rather than human
beings of equal value. This hierarchy of status is ingrained in the poor,
who describe the non-poor as masters of their community. At times, they keep
them at a distance and engage in other subtle forms of resistance.1 4 They
feel deeply inferior to the non-poor, which results in a marred identity (Christian,
1999). One researcher in Swaziland told the story of an older woman who lived
in isolation and had no relationship with the non-poor as she felt that her
shabby house makes her a `laughing stock to the whole community'. The older
woman preferred to live by herself rather than become a `nuisance' to the
non-poor. These types of relationships disempower the poor and have a negative
effect on their identity. It also makes development work, in the sense of
transforma- tion, extremely difficult and complicated. As observed by one
of the research- ers, changing the attitude of the people is the most important,
yet most difficult goal of the development process, and the non-poor need
as much transformation as the poor, if not more. Working with the non-poor
to change their attitudes requires added awareness, effort, advocacy and prayer.
An evangelical desiring to work with the poor must be aware of the complicated
relationship between the poor and the non-poor, and how the barriers to transformation
of the individual and community may lie within that relationship. This relationship
lies within the psychological and spiritual realm rather than being rooted
in the differences in material circumstances defined by levels of income or
assets, even though those material aspects are extremely important.1 5 Relationships
and Political Power The relationships between the poor and non-poor, and their
contribution to the causes of poverty, are complicated by at least one additional
major factor: the links that the non-poor have to formal political power.
In fact, this was a major cause identified by people in Vietnam of the disparity
in levels of living between the poor and non-poor There, the difference between
the poor and non-poor was directly attributed to the level of political involvement
in the Communist Party system.1 6 Most of the non-poor were involved in political
or social organizations, and maintained a high ranking in the Party at the
communal or village level. They received training in Ho Chi Minh's philosophies
and the Communist Party guidelines while rejecting any notion of God. This
periodic training gave the non- poor confidence as well as opportunities to
move up within the Party structure, even beyond their local community. Membership
in the political system gave them knowledge of and access to those living
in the more developed urban areas, including access to new income-generating
activities for economic well-being. The poor, on the other hand, had none
of these opportunities, leaving them vul- nerable to policy decisions of local
Party members and government officials, and with a feeling of despair.
140
In
many other countries, while this was not the analysis of the poor themselves,
the development workers found similar situations in that those they identified
as poor had no voice in the social or political systems, and often they were
sys- tematically discriminated against by local authorities due to political
or ethnic affiliations. This lack of voice kept the poor in a psychological
place of hopeless- ness in which they felt they had no power to change their
living conditions. This powerlessness in decision-making provided a much more
difficult challenge for development workers than issues of income disparity
or material deprivation. The lack of participation in decision-making was
also compounded by other kinds of variables involving government. In several
instances, development workers found that corruption at the local level of
government was as preva- lent as at the national level, further complicating
the development process and perpetuating a sense of hopelessness. In Zimbabwe,
on the other hand, the local government was famous among the poor communities
for its false promises of income generating activities. The local representatives
of the central government's Agricultural Ministry were very ineffective in
that they had no resources to go into communities to be proactive in supporting
the poor, but instead justified their own jobs by helping the already established,
wealthier farmers. In addi- tion, in Zimbabwe, it was necessary to be `politically
correct', belonging to the `right' political party, to benefit from any key
services such as food or educational assistance. As a result of all of this,
the poor farmers of the communities felt mar- ginalized and `thrown away',
without any power to change their current circum- stances, another expression
of what Jayakumar Christian identifies as a marred identity of the poor (Christian,
1999). A different situation involving the legacies of a particular type of
governmental system was observed in Ethiopia. In that country, researchers
encountered many communities that had been adversely affected by the heavy
hand of the former socialist government, the Deurg Regime. This regime had
nationalized the entire economy, leading to a state monopoly that paralyzed
the private sector and left a high unemployment rate and corresponding lack
of productivity in the rural and urban areas. Many of the families in the
communities visited by the research- ers had a history of poverty that could
be traced to the policies of this particular socialist regime, both from a
material and psychological perspective. In addition to lack of employment,
the Marxist regime's policies had led to an erosion of creativity, innovation
and coping mechanisms. An attitude of despair also domi- nated many of these
households. Researchers also found, however, communities and governments that
were working well. In Sri Lanka, for example, the poor were able to get political
rep- resentation, and thus have a voice, through the creation of Community
Based Organizations (CBOs). At first, the development organization had tried
to work with local government officials, but encountered considerable `political
interfer- ence' in the development process. The formation of a network of
CBOs, a model that has worked in other countries, run by an Executive Committee
and in charge of its own budget, enabled community members to have a voice
in their own development, and thus overcame a sense of hopelessness. In Swaziland,
on the other hand, the Ministry of Agriculture worked within local communities
to prepare for the farming season. The agricultural officers taught local
farmers which crops were best for the region under their particu- lar climatic
conditions, promoting a change from maize as the rains diminished to the more
drought resistant crops of cassava and jugo beans. The Ministry of
141
Agriculture
set up a program to help the farmers bring these new crops to market to sell,
allowing the local farmers overcome the insecurity of changing from a crop
on which they had previously depended. It is clear that the involvement of
local officials can either help or hinder the development process. A development
worker, therefore, needs to pay attention to the national as well as local
government policies affecting the life chances as well as the attitudes of
a community. The development worker also needs to be aware of the political
and psychological barriers to and opportunities for development embedded in
the relationships between the poor and the government entities in the region.
In short, the development worker needs to be trained in a comprehen- sive
analysis and approach to advocacy in a way that incorporates the material,
psychological, and spiritual elements of that kind of work, looking to understand
the relationship between the poor, non-poor, and the government entities in
order to work best through them, or in spite of them.1 7 Vulnerability to
External Shocks An understanding of the definitions and causes of poverty
from the perspective of the poor themselves would not be complete without
an understanding of the concept of vulnerability and how it feeds into those
perspectives.18 In fact, researchers found that the perception of vulnerability
to negative influences from outside the community, defined here as `external
shocks', played a key role in the psychological and spiritual well-being of
community members and their understanding of poverty. These external shocks
took many forms, from the macro level of the political and economic systems
to the impact of the natu- ral environment. How the communities perceived
and reacted to these external shocks dramatically affected their ability to
participate effectively in the devel- opment process. In several communities,
the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) initiated by the national governments
brought about severe economic turmoil, which left communities very vulnerable
to economic influences outside of their control. For example, in Tanzania
the national government enacted free market reforms in which price controls
were removed. Prices rose quickly, especially for construc- tion materials,
petroleum products, farm inputs, and food. This created unexpect- ed economic
pressure within a community that was just beginning to experience success
from its agricultural development projects and left them with a sense of hopelessness
about attaining a higher level of living. External shocks also come in the
form of nature itself. Loss of a crop in a drought year can lead to both food
insecurity as well as economic insecurity in an agricultural region, and the
level of preparedness in a community to weather such shocks directly correlates
with the level of fear and uncertainty in a poor community. For example, through
strong leadership and vision, the Marungu Community in rural Kenya had established
a community savings plan to deal with emergencies and external shocks, and
had created alternative income gen- erating activities such as soap and brick
making so as to be able to buy food when their crops failed. Likewise, in
Zimbabwe, researchers visited families who believed that education and good
management of farming and livestock activities could prepare them to survive
an external shock and even help others. The com- munity had what they called
the `chief's store room', which stored surplus grain for the poor. They operated
on a concept of an `extended family' that provided material support for the
orphans of the community. There was hope rather than
142
vulnerability
in that particular community because their positive attitude had led them
to take preventive action. Along these lines, the researchers noted as they
compared communities across regions that vulnerability to external shocks
was directly related to the differences in attitudes about saving and preparing
for the future. In communities where there was a concern for the future beyond
the present day, preparation was taken to deal with anticipated natural disasters
and there were less feelings of vulner- ability. In communities that did not
plan looking forward, and which therefore were not prepared to deal with disasters,
people felt extremely vulnerable. In a comparison of these communities, the
levels of material development were neg- ligible: what distinguished them
was their attitude towards the future and their corresponding levels of preparedness
and vulnerability to external shocks.1 9 The understanding and feelings of
vulnerability were articulated clearly by the people themselves in the communities.
In Ethiopia, the poor families visited by the development workers explained
in detail the parameters of the vulnerability of their households to external
shocks. They analyzed how they existed in a strug- gle for daily survival,
and as a result could not put anything away for reserves, surviving on a daily
wage for the household of about 7–10 birr (about one US dol- lar),
which barely covered their daily consumption. The families feared getting
sick with no money to pay for the local clinic, therefore felt highly vulnerable.
Without assets to sell, or relatives in the area to assist them, these families
lived in fear of the unexpected. Compounding their fear was the awareness
that the mac- roeconomic policy implemented by the central government could
severely affect their communities without them having any input into these
policies. One researcher was able to discuss with the people of the community
she visited a variety of external shocks taking place at that time in Ethiopia
that are also symp- tomatic in many developing countries. The people of the
community listed infla- tionary pressures on prices, recurrent drought that
led to land degradation, popu- lation pressure upon the land that further
exacerbated the inability of the land to support its people, and disease from
outside the community that affected humans, animals, and even crops. All of
these added to their feelings of fear, powerlessness, hopelessness, and vulnerability,
the tangled web of which presented as great a challenge to the work of development
as did the low levels of living and obvious physical aspects of poverty in
the poor communities visited for this study. Conclusion As demonstrated, when
the people of 60 `poor' communities in Africa and Asia were asked to define
poverty and its causes, their answers were surprising and instructive to the
development workers/graduate students/researchers who had engaged them in
this conversation. At times, those the development workers con- sidered to
be poor based on the `objective' measure of income were insulted and did not
consider themselves to be such. Rather, they defined poverty in terms of assets
owned, knowledge and motivation. In addition, the researchers discovered that
people at apparently similar low levels of material welfare differed in terms
of whether they defined themselves as poor or not and in terms of their quality
of life. Based on their `attitudes', psychological levels in terms of contentment,
hope- fulness, fear, and hopelessness varied tremendously and affected the
possibilities for development work. The causes of poverty as defined by the
`poor' also pointed to the impor- tance of psychological, spiritual, and relational
variables in addition to material
143
ones.
As seen earlier, the people in the communities pointed to poverty being a
punishment for things done in a previous life or for sins past and present,
and as being caused by being born into poverty of into families who did not
leave them enough inheritance, a lack of education, a deterioration of economic
conditions, lack of jobs, HIV/AIDS, laziness, inefficiency, and incompetence,
broken relation- ships at the community level among and between the poor and
non-poor, and the differentiated levels of access to political power and resources.
This multifaceted nature of social analysis by the poor was also evident as
the people of the com- munities shared their understandings of vulnerability,
what they had or had not done to prepare for external shocks, and the feelings
of hope or hopelessness and fear that they felt as a result. From this discussion,
it is clear that development workers must be expand their theory of poverty
beyond that of deprivation, and learn to take into account the combination
of psychological, spiritual, relational, cultural, and material variables
that the poor themselves clearly identify as being part and parcel of the
defini- tion and causes of poverty. To be most effective, these evangelical
development workers need to put aside their own preconceived assumptions of
poverty, and reframe their assumptions, plans, and activities through the
perceptual lenses of the poor with whom they are working. The training and
education of these development workers needs to include much more than just
tools of economic development, such as programs and activities for income
generation and human capital development. It needs to include the broader
theories of development to include the psychological and spiritual issues
faced by the poor. Only when this deeper level of effective engagement takes
place in the mind of the development professional will holistic and sustainable
development happen.

Notes
1 It is beyond the scope
of this paper to go over the theology that argues for this Scriptural mandate.
See Myers (1999), among many others, for this kind of argument.
2 As used here, the distinction
between psychological and spiritual dimensions is in the frame of reference:
Psychological dimensions of poverty originate in the perceptions and understandings
within the mind of the subject, while the origin of the spiritual dimensions
of poverty is external to the individual in the unseen spiritual realm. They
are, obviously, related. See the discussion of Paul Hiebert's `Excluded Middle'
in Myers (1999).
3 The use of the term `poor'
is fraught with tensions, as well pointed out by development discourse theorists
(Sachs, 1992). These tensions are dealt with later on in this article. There
is no way getting around using some kind of `label' (label reference), and
there is no problem in doing so as long as one is aware of the inherent tensions
in doing so. Jesus himself, for example, used the term `poor,' and did so
in such a way as to draw attention to the political and spiritual meanings
involved in the word (see Matthew 26:11, cross-referencing Deuteronomy 15:4,11).
4 See also Linthicum (2003)
and Kraybill (2003) for a good analysis of the nature of poverty in the community
from a spiritual perspective.
5 In what follows, the
students are alternatively referred to as `development workers', `researchers,'
and `graduate students,' since they were all three at the same time.
6 For a good summary of
the problems with the poverty lines, see the September 2004 edition of
In Focus published by the United Nations Development Program, entitled
`Dollar a Day: How Much does it Say?'.
7 This is not surprising,
given the tendency to `homogenize' bounded categories in development, such
as the `community'. See Pigg (1992) for good insights into this tendency
and what it can hide.
8 One limitation of this
research was that the researcher did not look at the level of assets and,
as we will see later on, at the situation of vulnerability. These may have
differed, and might have explained some of the differences identified in
what follows.
9 Further research into
why the different attitudes existed was not carried out. Below, some variables
are considered that might explain why such differences exist.
10 These causes were identified
by people in the communities both in terms of what caused poverty for them,
if they defined themselves as poor, and for others.
11 This is a similar finding
to that of Bornstein (2005), who examined the way that a `spiritual' approach
to development was the only way to address issues of witch-craft that arose
around development processes.
12 While the differences
in income and wealth, as is seen below, were major aspects of the research
and results, people in the community mentioned gender as an important aspect
of relationships within the community. This data is still being analyzed
and interpreted, and will be the subject of a future article.
145
13 It is, of course, the
case that the income the poor children received helped their families survive.
The point is, however, that these kinds of relationships, and the attitudes
that were created and reinforced by them, limited the opportunities open
to the poor for advancement.
14 For an analysis along
these lines, see Scott (1985).
15 An excellent analysis
of this kind of situation, and a theory of social change designed specifically
around this analysis, is found in Freire (1970/2000). Freire's analysis makes
it clear that this kind of situation exists in just about every society along
class, gender, ethnic, and other lines.
16 It is possible, of course,
that the causal direction between wealth and political connections runs in
either, or on both directions.
17 See Davis's article in
this volume for additional insights into the importance of advocacy work.
18 The idea of `vulnerability'
is at the core of the `Sustainable Livelihoods' analysis of poverty. See
http://www.livelihoods.org/ for more details. It also is a key concept in
the area of disaster prevention and mitigation, and see Wisner et al. (2004)
for an excellent treatise on the subject.
19 Of course, one might argue
that the level of preparedness and vulnerability should in fact be counted
in the measurement of material development. However, the argument here is
precisely that attitudes and perceptions are a factor to consider apart from
the material when one is defining the relative importance of variables in
development.</meta-value>

                  <p>13 It is, of course, the case that the income the poor children received helped their families survive. The point is, however, that these kinds of relationships, and the attitudes that were created and reinforced by them, limited the opportunities open to the poor for advancement.</p>

                  <p>14 For an analysis along these lines, see Scott (1985).</p>

                  <p>15 An excellent analysis of this kind of situation, and a theory of social change designed specifically around this analysis, is found in Freire (1970/2000). Freire's analysis makes it clear that this kind of situation exists in just about every society along class, gender, ethnic, and other lines.</p>

                  <p>16 It is possible, of course, that the causal direction between wealth and political connections runs in either, or on both directions.</p>

                  <p>18 The idea of `vulnerability' is at the core of the `Sustainable Livelihoods' analysis of poverty. See http://www.livelihoods.org/ for more details. It also is a key concept in the area of disaster prevention and mitigation, and see Wisner et al. (2004) for an excellent treatise on the subject.</p>

               <list-item>
                  <p>19 Of course, one might argue that the level of preparedness and vulnerability should in fact be counted in the measurement of material development. However, the argument here is precisely that attitudes and perceptions are a factor to consider apart from the material when one is defining the relative importance of variables in development.</p>
