<p>
<italic>Environment and Society</italic> is a textbook for undergraduate students which presents the foremost approaches of environment-society research. This is accomplished through general introductions to selected perspectives and by illustrating them with a few examples from the everyday world. Eight differing views to environment-society relations are elucidated, namely those stressing population, market and institutional dynamics, ethical aspects, risk and hazard calculations, links to political economy, and the role of social constructions.</p>
<p>The authors confess, however, while explicating their own research views, that what they have come to share is a perspective best described as political ecology. This means that they stress that relationships among people and between people and the environment are governed by historically changing interactions of power. Accordingly, as the authors acknowledge, they have a particular sympathy for issues related to political economy and social construction.</p>
<p>This orientation leads to an inspiring treatment of the empirical cases in Part II of the textbook, entitled ‘Objects of Concern’. Here the authors apply and compare the pertinence of the already-presented views to such environment-society enigmas as carbon dioxide, trees, wolves, tuna, bottled water and French fries. All of the selected examples are of high quality and serve well in unveiling many promising avenues of critical socio-environmental research.</p>
<p>The chapter on tuna, for example, is a perfect case to compare the views relying on the dynamics of markets, political economy and ethics in solving the heated conflicts related to overfishing, industrial tuna ‘farming’ and collateral dolphin mortality due to unethical fishing methods. The market approach guides us to focus on consumer activism and environmental certifications of tuna product cycles, whereas the political economy approach helps us to identify the corrosive ways of capitalist production and the options for re-regulating the global tuna industry. The ethical approach, by emphasizing the fate of dolphins in tuna fishing, asks humans to extend their moral concerns beyond the human realm and consequently points toward a rethinking of animal rights.</p>
<p>The chapter on bottled water, on the other hand, highlights approaches that favour population dependencies, risk calculations and the effects of political economy. Bottled water is, according to the population approach, a response to mismatched water resources and demand, including scarcity due to water pollution. The risk approach focuses on the actual and perceptional safety variations between bottled and tap waters and aims at improving risk communication. Finally, the political economy approach shows how public utilities have increasingly become privatized into ‘enterprise’ units and how bottling has turned water into a commodity, a thing marketed for profit. Moreover, the political economy view identifies two parallel trends in water commodification: poorer regions of the world have witnessed a trend toward expropriating community water supplies and selling them back to locals in bottles, while in wealthier regions the demand for bottled water is increasing even in areas where public water is abundant. This is a result of effective lifestyle and health branding.</p>
<p>
<italic>Environment and Society</italic>offers readers much incentive to reflect upon their position in the web of dependencies. It forces us to critically evaluate the daily routines through which we become entangled in the complex and continuous articulation of dominance and injustice in the surrounding world. However, it fails to advise undergraduates how to concretely make research on these types of dependencies and articulations in, as they say, our ‘social environment’ and among ‘environmental beings’. The examples are predominantly from the United States and the ways of coping with the world are strikingly American-centred. The textbook is clearly addressed to American students and others need to read it with an extra effort in order to identify developing dilemmas within their daily lives. Hence, the book gives, if in numerous contrasting ways, a lot of inspiration for us all to rethink our dependencies.</p>
