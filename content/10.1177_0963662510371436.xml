<p>How are secondary accounts of “bad” scientific practice constructed? How do they engage with the primary data produced by “bad” scientists? And what happens to those primary data as generations of secondary accounts <italic>purporting</italic> to describe them accumulate? This paper addresses such questions via a case study of Dr. Hong, a microbiologist accused of “bad” scientific practice by numerous secondary accounts of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Bringing Hong’s own account of his own actions into dialogue with one of the most influential secondary accounts of his actions, the paper highlights the gross disparity between the two. Having argued that the rhetorical structuring of the secondary account is, ultimately, responsible for Hong’s characterisation as a “bad” scientist, it then moves to explore how subsequent accounts developed their own characterisations. What becomes clear is that as secondary accounts began feeding off one another, references to Hong’s account disappeared. Aided by the concepts of the “vanishing” and the “phantasm,” the paper concludes with a consideration of how this process left Hong’s work with a very peculiar form of existence.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>At a press conference in Beijing on 31 March 2003, the Director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control (CCDC), Lee Liming, noted how “Chinese experts have successfully separated a <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agent from the bodies of five SARS victims” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510371436"><italic>China Daily</italic>, 2003a</xref>). But, as he added, these laboratory results had not yet allowed for any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the aetiology of SARS. Why? Because, as one of Lee’s “experts,” Dr. Hong Tao, went on to make clear, there was “strong evidence” to suggest that SARS patients were being “co-infected by a <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agent and a coronavirus-like agent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510371436"><italic>China Daily</italic>, 2003b</xref>). Since mid February, Hong and his research team had been isolating <italic>both</italic> agents from SARS patient samples. SARS, Hong was suggesting, had been caused by <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, by coronavirus, or by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and coronavirus acting together. Indeed, so seriously were each of these aetiological possibilities considered that they appeared again, a little over three weeks later, in “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like and coronavirus-like agents found in dead cases of atypical pneumonia by electron microscopy” (CLA), a SARS research paper written by Hong and his research team, and published in the 25 April edition of the <italic>Chinese Medical Journal</italic>:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It appears most likely that both agents play some role in the disease. At the present time, however, it is not possible to determine whether these agents interact synergistically, or whether one follows another. This requires further study. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510371436">Hong et al., 2003</xref>: 632)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And yet, Hong’s plea for “further study” was to fall on deaf ears: by the time the paper was published, the medical community had already settled the aetiological question. At another press conference, this time organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and held on 16 April, it was announced that a “consensus agreement” had been reached by WHO microbiologists. “The conclusion today,” as the WHO’s spokesperson put it, was that “the coronavirus alone was capable of causing [SARS]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510371436">WHO, 2003</xref>). But Hong’s failure, on an evidential level, to convince others of the need for “further study” was in fact only the prelude to something much more serious: the unravelling, by those others, of the <italic>credibility</italic> of his evidence. The WHO press conference marked a curious turning point here. As ever more people began to accept the “consensus agreement,” the critical questioning of Hong’s original laboratory work intensified. Indeed, whilst reading through subsequently produced secondary accounts of his actions during those early weeks of the SARS outbreak, one finds it difficult not to understand Hong’s scientific work as extremely <italic>bad</italic> scientific work.</p>
<sec id="section2-0963662510371436">
<title>The purpose and point of this paper</title>
<p>My aims in this paper are twofold. Firstly, I wish to understand how we got here – to a set of accounts of Hong’s actions that could be storied and understood in this way. As the previous section sought to make clear, it is not immediately obvious why he <italic>should</italic> have ended up playing the role of the “bad SARS scientist.” So how, then, were those secondary accounts constructed? How did they engage with and interpret their primary data: Dr. Hong’s press conference transcripts, his research articles, and so on? And did the imperative of telling an engaging, dramatic story lead them to foreground certain data and certain <italic>interpretations</italic> of those data at the expense of other data and other interpretations? In this sense, the paper can be seen as a contribution to two projects: the complication of the “canonical” understanding of the public communication of science,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510371436">1</xref></sup> and the sociological analysis of debunking in science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510371436">2</xref></sup> The second aim of this paper, which has its connections to the first, is to think about what happened to the primary data as generations of textual accounts <italic>purporting to describe those primary data</italic> began to accumulate. What happened after the first secondary account had been published? How did subsequent accounts relate to that one account? Did they too engage with and interpret the primary data? Or did they simply ignore Hong’s own work, accepting that secondary account as the final, definitive account of what <italic>really</italic> happened? And if the need to rely on Hong’s original account in order to develop an understanding of that account has receded, then what might this suggest about the <italic>ontological</italic> territory it now occupies? In this sense, the paper is also a contribution to the science and technology studies inflected project of exploring the multiple, complex ontologies of seemingly singular, seemingly simple, everyday objects such as textual accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510371436">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The paper begins with a close rhetorical examination of one particularly influential account of Hong’s actions: “China’s Missed Chance” (CMC). CMC was a “news focus special report” that appeared in the 18 July 2003 edition of the prestigious journal <italic>Science</italic>. Written by the highly respected science journalist Martin Enserink, it was the first article to tell of the outbreak during the “post-outbreak” period. The interesting thing about CMC is that in order to incorporate Hong’s laboratory work into its overall narrative, it relies heavily upon one piece of material evidence: CLA, the aforementioned research article, written by Hong and his research team. That CMC is dependent on CLA in this way generates an interesting analytical opportunity, and one that I seek to take advantage of. It arises because I too have access to CLA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510371436">4</xref></sup> Thus, in Section 2, the detailed examination of CMC commences with a discussion of the ways in which my own understanding of CLA differs from Enserink’s. Reading of Hong’s actions in CMC one finds it difficult not to conjure the image of an inept scientist. Yet my own reading leads me to suggest that Hong could, quite plausibly, have been represented in a far more favourable light. In Section 3, a great deal of attention is given over to understanding how CMC’s rhetorical structuring of the primary data actually enabled Hong’s characterisation as a “bad” scientist. Turning to address the question of “what happened next,” Section 4 looks at the ways in which <italic>subsequent accounts</italic> of the SARS outbreak came to relate to, engage with, and appropriate CMC. A final, concluding section reflects upon the research findings in light of the two, overarching aims of this paper. In terms of the transport, translation and transformation of information about Hong’s laboratory work over time, it is noted that CMC quickly became a key text, not only for “pedagogical” and “popularising” texts, but for specialised scientific journal articles too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510371436">5</xref></sup> But it is also noted that whilst those secondary accounts were turning CMC into a “definitive-historical-account” of Hong’s actions, Hong’s <italic>own</italic> accounts of his <italic>own</italic> actions were being left unread and ignored. And, in an attempt to think about what this process has done to the ontological status of Hong’s primary data, two concepts trailed during earlier sections – the “vanishing” and the “phantasm” – are re-introduced into the discussion.</p>

<title>2. China’s missed chance</title>
<p>CMC tells of a race that developed between three scientific research groups during the early weeks of the outbreak. The prize sought by each was the discovery of “the cause of the new disease” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). The scientific research groups in question were: a WHO laboratory network led by Dr. Klaus Stöhr, a research team working out of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS) in Beijing and led by Dr. Yang Ruifu, and, finally, Dr. Hong’s research team at the CCDC, also in Beijing.</p>
<p>According to Enserink, the group that <italic>really</italic> won this race was the AMMS, led by Yang. “By the first week of March,” he suggests “the group had tentative evidence that [a] new virus might indeed be linked to the epidemic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). Having “grow[n] a virus of some sort from the samples in so-called vero cells,” “they [had] observed what looked like coronavirus particles in an electron micrograph.” The team “also discovered that serum from SARS patients could inhibit the growth of the virus – a key test to show a correlation between an isolated agent and a disease” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). As Enserink makes clear, having achieved all of this they were “weeks ahead” of the researchers in the WHO laboratory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). And yet the AMMS were, nevertheless, to be denied the prize of a “prominent place in the history of the disease, and perhaps even a publication or two in a prestigious scientific journal” by that very same group – the WHO laboratory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). For on 16 April, some five weeks after the AMMS had reached the same conclusion, it was the WHO research team that were to receive all the plaudits, announcing at a press conference in front of the world’s media that the causal agent was a hitherto unknown coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Looking back” at this episode, Stöhr is quoted as suggesting, “had the AMMS researchers reported their findings immediately, the larger group [the WHO SARS laboratory network] might have been on the right trail much sooner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295–6). How had this situation arisen? Because, according to Enserink, the AMMS “didn’t dare tell the world” about their discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). Their silence, however, was not self-imposed, but forced upon them through the actions of “an esteemed senior microbiologist and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering” – Dr. Hong – and the institution for which he worked – the CCDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). In mid February, Hong “proposed that the agent was a new type of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). And even though “others suggested that it may have been something different altogether” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295), there was apparently no dissuading him: “promoted by Hong Tao, an esteemed senior microbiologist and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> hypothesis had become … well established” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 294). The CCDC, in conjunction with other institutions in China, subsequently forbade any further discussion of the aetiological question, and moved to prevent others from expressing alternate views. In late March, for instance, and “bolstered by WHO’s daily reports and new, more solid data of their own, AMMS scientists reported their findings to the Ministry of Health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 296). The result? “The department stuck to the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> theory,” and set up “a working group … to control publicity about SARS pathogen studies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 296). Indeed, it was only as late as the last week of April, after the Chinese health minister had been sacked for mishandling the outbreak that the coronavirus discovery came to receive official acceptance within China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 296). But by then of course the AMMS team had been pre-empted by the WHO, and it was too late for them to take any credit for the discovery. This, it seems, was “China’s missed chance.”</p>
<p>Everything here centres on the WHO and the AMMS as the champions of the coronavirus aetiological claim. Dr. Hong, on the other hand, concentrates his attentions on a <italic>Chlamydia</italic> bacterium. And, whereas the former groups let their results speak for themselves, Dr. Hong “promote[s]” his “<italic>Chlamydia</italic> hypothesis.” In a sense, this is a fairly standard popular scientific tale of the “good” scientists (in this case, microbiologists) who get it right, versus the “bad” scientist who gets it wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510371436">6</xref></sup> But what happens when this tale is examined in a little more detail? Presented below is Enserink’s interpretation of Hong’s article, CLA:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In a paper in the 25 April <italic>National Medical Journal of China</italic>, Hong reported having found “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles” in a total of seven patients. (In two, he also noted the presence of a coronavirus which by then had been proven to be the cause of SARS.) But he was not able to actually isolate the microbe or characterize it further, and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> was not found in most SARS patients. Moreover, antibodies to known <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species did not react with the tissue samples. Hong therefore proposed that the agent was a new type of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, but others suggested that it may have been something different altogether. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Now immediately it seems to me that there is something about this gloss that jars with CMC’s overall narrative. For therein, trapped within a parenthesis, is an acknowledgement that Hong had in fact “noted” the coronavirus too. But before discussing this peculiarity at any great length, I want to present the abstract from the original source document CLA, written by Hong and his co-researchers:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>OBJECTIVE: To explore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also SARS) that occurred recently in some regions of [China]. METHOD: Organ samples of 7 dead cases of SARS were collected from Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic examination. 293 cell lines were inoculated with the materials derived from the lungs in order to isolate the causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell cultures were revealed by immunoassay. RESULTS: <italic>Both</italic> Chlamydia-<italic>like and coronavirus-like particles were found by electron microscope</italic>. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies, reticulate antibodies and intermediate bodies of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agent were visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs (7 cases), spleens (2 cases), livers (2 cases), kidneys (3 cases) and lymph nodes (1 case), by ultra-thin section EM [electron microscope]. In some few sections, coronavirus-like particles were concurrently seen. <italic>A coronavirus RNA-polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of two cases</italic>. After inoculation with materials from the lung samples, similar <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles were also found in the inoculated 293 cells. Since the <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures did not react with the genus specific antibodies against <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and monoclonal antibodies against <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. psittaci</italic>, the results might well be suggestive of a novel <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agent. CONCLUSION: <italic>Since the novel</italic> Chlamydia<italic>-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like agent in the dead cases of SARS, it appears most likely that both agents play some role in the disease. At the present time, however, it is not possible to determine whether these agents interact synergistically, or whether one follows another. This requires further study</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510371436">Hong et al., 2003</xref>: 632 my emphasis)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Not only Enserink’s gloss, but his telling of “China’s missed chance” more generally, starts to appear a little problematic once CLA is examined. Reading through this abstract one finds it difficult not to draw the following conclusions: firstly, that Hong gave his (entirely plausible) coronavirus findings far more attention than Enserink is allowing for; and secondly, that Hong was far less excited about his (entirely plausible) <italic>Chlamydia</italic> findings than Enserink is allowing for. Hong made it quite clear in CLA that he had not yet ruled out the possibility of the outbreak under investigation having a multifactorial aetiology; that the cases of SARS from which he had received samples, might well have been caused by a complex interaction, or “synergy,” between <italic>both</italic> pathogens. But then, if these conclusions can be accepted, it is worth asking the following question: does CLA really support, back up or vindicate <italic>in any way</italic> CMC’s tale of the “good” microbiologists versus the “bad” microbiologist? I want to suggest not. And the rhetoric through which CMC manages this peculiar “mismatch” will be the focus of attention in the following section, where, purely for reasons of space, I concentrate on CMC’s management of Hong’s coronavirus findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662510371436">
<title>3. The discovery of the coronavirus</title>
<p>There is one other curiosity about CMC’s formulation of CLA that needs some mention here. Every activity detailed within CLA, <italic>including Hong’s discovery of the coronavirus</italic>, took place between mid February and early April 2003. But if this is the case, then surely Hong’s coronavirus findings actually pre-empted <italic>both</italic> the AMMS group (by a few weeks) and the WHO SARS group (by at least a month). Indeed, if the time period during which Hong’s laboratory research took place is taken into account then Hong can quite easily be cast in the role of microbiological hero! Whether he had adjudged the coronavirus to be the one singular cause or part of a synergistic causal process would, in such a casting, be deemed irrelevant – for he, and he alone, would have been the first microbiologist to see this hitherto unknown coronavirus. The curious thing about CMC’s interpretation of CLA, however, is that it possesses at least three rhetorical devices that serve to play down just such a version of events: verbs capable of capturing process actions in different ways, parentheses that de-emphasise certain data, and fuzzy temporal markers that manipulate the narrative sequence of events. Each of these devices will be discussed in the next three subsections.</p>
<sec id="section5-0963662510371436">
<title>Findings and notings</title>
<p>Consider, for example, the following extract from CMC: “Hong reported having found ‘<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles’ in a total of seven patients. (In two, he also noted the presence of a coronavirus)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). Although both sentences seek to capture and represent a process of discovery, they do so in different ways. And this difference, though slight, is highly consequential. To make this point a little clearer the sentential units can be broken down into their constituent parts: Actor, Process and Goal:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662510371436">7</xref></sup></p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hong</td>
<td>reports</td>
<td>finding</td>
<td><italic>Chlamydia</italic></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><bold>[Actor]</bold></td>
<td><bold>[Process 1]</bold></td>
<td><bold>[Process 2]</bold></td>
<td><bold>[Goal]</bold></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hong</td>
<td>notes</td>
<td>–</td>
<td>Coronavirus</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>In both, the Actor remains as Hong. The Goals, too, remain similar – although differently named entities, they are, nevertheless, entities of a similar, pathogenic order. The real difference, the difference that makes a difference, is to be found when the Processes are examined. In the first instance, Hong “reports” on his engagement with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. “To report” is to perform not a material, but a verbal action process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510371436">8</xref></sup> Considered as an action in and of itself, a report would involve a conscious being sensing a phenomenon before then making that which had been sensed known to others. But in this particular instance the report is a report that a pathogen had been “found.” And this second process verb, “to find,” immediately implies that some kind of material action process had <italic>also</italic> taken place – a process of doing and not simply of speaking. In order for Hong’s “report” to have become possible, he would have had to have made some kind of material contact with the bacterium through, say, a laboratory instrument. To find, in other words, is to found; to found a relationship, the Actor having at least a degree of human interest in the object found. In the second sentence, Hong “notes the presence of” a coronavirus. To “note” is to perform a mental process action. One that involves sensing. But unlike in the first sentence, this action is not then followed by a <italic>material</italic> action. Hong, as a conscious being, simply notes the presence of a phenomenon before making that which he had sensed apparent to others. No material contact with the coronavirus is implied in any of this.</p>
<p>Is this rhetorically significant? I want to suggest that it is. Dr. Hong himself, for instance, suggested in CLA that “both <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like and coronavirus-like particles were <italic>found</italic> by electron microscope.” Indeed, not once in CLA does he use the mental process verb “to note” to describe his coronavirus work. Apart from the electron microscope work in which he “saw” the coronavirus, everything revolves around material process verbs: to <italic>find</italic>, to <italic>amplify</italic>, to <italic>prepare</italic>, and so on. The effect of this “deletion of materiality” is a definite structuring of the ways in which we, as readers, are able to come to an understanding of Hong’s laboratory work. Why? Because as Simpson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510371436">2004</xref>: 23 my emphasis) has noted in relation to process actions:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Unlike material processes <italic>which have their provenance in the physical world</italic>, mental processes inhabit and reflect the world of consciousness … the entity “sensed” in a mental process <italic>is not directly affected by the process, and this makes it of a somewhat different order to the role of Goal in a material process</italic>.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So does the act of “noting” the presence of something indicate that a scientific discovery has actually been made? Perhaps not. Perhaps it suggests an action that teeters on the edge of not being a discovery at all. To “note” is merely to acknowledge the presence of an object in passing, remaining at a certain remove from that object before then moving on somewhere else. It is, on Simpson’s reading, to leave the entity “unaffected” by the process. Another way to make the rhetorical significance of Enserink’s lexical choices clear is to consider culturally entrenched ways of using language in scientific practice. After all, microbiologists like Dr. Hong do not build their careers around “notings.” They build them around “findings.” In microbiology, materiality is everything. So at the very least it seems possible to suggest that a “noting” does not suggest quite such a clear cut a discovery as a “finding.” And although previous studies of rhetoric have noted that different process verbs can generate different degrees of “opacity” when used to portray agency and intention,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662510371436">9</xref></sup> it seems that here, in CMC, they end up manipulating not human <italic>agency</italic>, but rather, human <italic>interest</italic>. Where CLA indicated that both the coronavirus and the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> findings were of equal ontological standing, leaving their status as discovered objects clear and uncomplicated, CMC erodes this sense of equality via the use of process verbs that evoke differing levels of Actorial contact with, and interest in, their end-Goal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662510371436">
<title>Hong’s cognitive brackets</title>
<p>Leaving aside these process actions now, I want to throw something else into relief within that two sentence extract from CMC: the parenthesis:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Hong reported having found “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles” in a total of seven patients. (In two, he also noted the presence of a coronavirus which by then had been proven to be the cause of SARS.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Why is the parenthesis there? What is its purpose? On the face of it, its stylistic significance seems clear: it serves to surround and completely cut off from the rest of the text the only reference that CMC makes to the fact that Hong found coronavirus as well as <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. That “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles” – in the plural – were found in all seven of Hong’s samples is a point that is left outside the parenthesis. That “a coronavirus” – in the singular – was noted in just two samples is a point that is placed inside the parenthesis. So far, so obvious: in standard English usage, brackets are usually deployed to mark off “asides” or “afterthoughts” from the main body of an argument. This, then, is what the parenthesis does. But it is not at all clear <italic>why</italic> it is made to do what it does <italic>here</italic>. Indeed, the separation is especially curious given that Hong’s own research article goes out of its way to avoid making any such separation. The very title of the article – “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like and coronavirus-like agents found in dead cases …” – seeks to draw the two discoveries together. Further, in CLA’s conclusions, their entanglement with one another is once again made clear: “since the novel <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like agent in the dead cases of SARS, it appears most likely that both agents play some role in the disease” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510371436">Hong et al., 2003</xref>: 636). CMC’s brackets, however, cut off all links between the two discoveries. They create an “aside” or “afterthought.” And although little has been written about parentheses in rhetorical theory, the concept of enactment, taken from the field of stylistics, helps to make the rhetorical significance of this “cutting” operation a little clearer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662510371436">10</xref></sup> The critical and stylistic assumption underpinning the concept is that literary forms can mime the meanings they seek to express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510371436">Leavis, 1964</xref>). So for instance in Dickens’s <italic>Oliver Twist</italic>, a stylistician might note how the following passage seeks to enact movement, noise and confusion <italic>in and as</italic> a description of the actions of movement, noise and confusion:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Away they ran, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash, tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares and courts re-echo with the sound. (Dickens, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510371436">Wales, 2001</xref>: 125)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>My argument is that CMC’s brackets work to produce a similar effect in relation to Hong’s scientific practice. They enact the “cognitive brackets” that Hong must have placed around his coronavirus “noting” in order to come to the final <italic>Chlamydia</italic> conclusion that he ended up “promoting”: Hong dismissed the aetiological significance of the “noting,” and thus the brackets enact the dismissal. Moreover, given what is placed inside – <italic>singular</italic> coronavirus findings – and what is placed outside – <italic>multiple Chlamydia</italic> findings – they start to look less like CMC’s own interpretation, and more like a faithful attempt at enactment. The very presence of the parenthesis, the cognitive brackets, is in this way granted an explanation. And although not perhaps entirely convincing to a reader with some first-hand knowledge of CLA, it is at least plausible: Hong’s context of discovery, it seems, was a context built around quantitative criteria. Fascinated by the <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles and their abundance in relation to the coronavirus particles, Hong completely overlooked the aetiological significance of the latter. Through the use of the parenthesis, CMC generates a sense that, <italic>even if</italic> we can allow that Hong’s coronavirus was a discovery rather than a noting, it was, <italic>nevertheless</italic>, a discovery that Hong himself regarded as secondary and unimportant in relation to <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963662510371436">
<title>“By then …”</title>
<p>Things, it seems, could have been very different. And nowhere was this more so than when it came to the question of “who was first?” CLA could quite easily have been used to index the work of a scientific group that had managed, quite impressively, to pre-empt both the AMMS group (by a few weeks) and the WHO laboratory network (by at least a month). But Enserink manages not to treat CLA in this way. In fact, he manages to treat it in quite the <italic>opposite</italic> way, with the result that Dr. Hong starts to appear as the pre-empted scientist. So how is this reversal achieved? Consider the extract from CMC one final time:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In a paper in the 25 April <italic>National Medical Journal of China</italic>, Hong reported having found “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles” in a total of seven patients. (In two, he also noted the presence of a coronavirus which by then had been proven to be the cause of SARS.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the sentence immediately before the parenthesis the reader watches through Enserink’s eyes as a CLA research finding is summarised. According to Enserink, Hong used CLA to “report” having found <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles. The focalising subject here is Enserink, the focalised object the research article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662510371436">11</xref></sup> At no stage during the sentence is there any possibility of observing the actual act of discovery. Because CLA, and not Hong’s laboratory work, acts as the focalised object, the reader is placed at a remove from the actual action. The result of this “distance” is the creation of a temporal lag; a lag between the act of <italic>finding</italic> and the act of <italic>communicating a finding</italic>. At some point in the past, it seems, Hong had found “<italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles.” Then, at some point later on, he reported this discovery in a research article. But in actual fact there is no need to be so vague about the timing of all of this. For Enserink had already made clear that the direct act of finding took place “on 18 February” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). And, as is clear from the extract presented above, the research article based on those findings was published “in the 25 April <italic>National Medical Journal of China</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>: 295). As a consequence, the article itself had to have been submitted for publication some time between “18 February” and “25 April.”</p>
<p>So much is clear. But when we turn to examine the sentence that appears in the parenthesis, the identity of the focalised object seems a little <italic>un</italic>clear. The reason for this ambiguity is a lack of any reference to “reporting,” or indeed to any intermediary separating Enserink, our focaliser, from Hong’s laboratory work. Is the focalised object Hong’s research article? Or his actual laboratory work? Is Enserink watching <italic>a report of</italic> Hong watching the coronavirus, or is he watching Hong watching the coronavirus? To me, the fact that these questions can be asked at all admits the possibility of more than one structural interpretation of the text. In the clause prior to the parenthesis, for instance, such questions would have made no sense: one knew, quite clearly, that the act of <italic>finding</italic> and the act of <italic>communicating the finding</italic> were temporally separate.</p>
<p>For reasons that I hope will become clear, I want to proceed by playing up to my feeling that Enserink is indeed suggesting that he was there, watching Hong in his laboratory. As a result, when he writes that “in two [samples] he also noted the presence of a coronavirus,” we <italic>are</italic> watching through Enserink’s eyes as Hong notes, in two patient samples, the presence of coronavirus. The consequence of this immediacy is that any sense of a lag-time between the <italic>finding</italic> and the act of <italic>communicating the finding</italic> is lost. In classical rhetorical terms, we no longer watch as Enserink “tells” of something. Instead, we watch as Enserink “shows” us an act that appears to be fully-present-to-him. But, if this is so, what we need to ask now is <italic>when</italic> is Enserink’s immediacy in this formulation? <italic>When</italic> is he watching Hong doing his noting? A clue here is the deictic marker “by then” in the second half of the sentence. It anchors Enserink, the focaliser, as he watches Hong. But if it was “by then,” then when was this “by then”? Let us run through some of the dates that were mentioned above to try to answer this question. Was “by then” the 18 February, the date when Hong found his <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles? It cannot have been, because “by then” has to suggest a date after 16 April; that is, the date on which the WHO officially announced that the coronavirus was the causal agent of SARS. By implication, the only way in which Enserink’s “by then” could be referring to 18 February was if it was somehow trying to suggest that Hong, in some bizarrely manoeuvre, had managed to pre-empt himself (“in two he also noted the presence of a coronavirus, which by then he had already discovered …”). Let us reject this possibility.</p>
<p>So what about 25 April, the date on which the article was published? Before answering this question directly, let us imagine for a moment that I was wrong in playing up to my suspicion that Enserink had “told” us of the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> finding, yet “shown” us, very directly, the coronavirus discovery. Let us imagine, instead, that in both cases he had been focalising Hong’s research article. If this were so, then his “by then” would be a reference to the research article: “by then [25 April when the article was published] ….” And yet, he surely cannot have been making such a reference. Why? Because in the case of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> he had already admitted that the act of finding took place on “18 February.” He had, in other words, already admitted that the act of finding took place <italic>before</italic> the WHO made their announcement on 16 April. Despite the fact that the article had been published on 25 April, then, the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> findings had been made on 18 February. By implication, if the coronavirus discovery had taken place on or around that same day, or indeed at any point before 16 April, <italic>then irrespective of the date when the article was published</italic>, Enserink would, logically, have had to admit that Hong, in “noting” the presence of coronavirus, had pre-empted both the AMMS and the WHO laboratory network. What I take from all of this sleuthing around is a proof that Enserink’s “by then” simply <italic>has</italic> to be a reference to the coronavirus discovery, and the coronavirus discovery alone. What I also take from it is a certain confidence that my suspicions were correct: Enserink was indeed playing around with the difference between “telling” and “showing” in his reporting of the two discoveries. The coronavirus findings, Enserink would have us believe, were somehow conducted separately and apart from the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> findings.</p>
<p>So, let us ask the question again and, this time, attempt a direct answer: was “by then” the 25 April? No. For the coronavirus findings to have been made and published in a journal on the very same day would, of course, have been impossible. But we are, nevertheless, closer to the correct answer now. For there was in fact a little more time for Enserink to play around with in his reference to “by then.” As I noted above, and by Enserink’s own admission, Hong’s article must have been submitted for publication some time between “18 February” and “25 April.” If the coronavirus discovery was already history by the time the article appeared, then Hong’s coronavirus discovery could only have been made in the 9 days separating 16 April and 25 April. This, I want to suggest, is the <italic>when</italic> of Enserink’s “by then.” It is, I submit, the only possible way in which his reference to “by then” could have made any sense at all.</p>
<p>Playing around with a direct focalisation strategy, placing the coronavirus results in a parenthesis, and appending those results with the deictic marker “by then,” Enserink brings Hong’s coronavirus work forward into a time when it is (was?) already history. Indeed, this rhetorical strategy is aided by the fact that CMC has already suggested, three paragraphs beforehand, that Hong’s <italic>Chlamydia</italic> “hypothesis” was already “well established” in China. The coronavirus discovery, we could easily start to suspect, was a “noting” that came afterwards. And this effect, rather unsurprisingly, does not allow Hong to appear as a very able scientist. Instead of representing “the first scientist to discover the coronavirus,” he now cuts a rather forlorn, buffoon-like figure. “What,” we might conceivably ask based on a reading of CMC, “was Hong doing dithering over the identity of the causal agent when <italic>by then</italic> everyone knew that the agent was, in fact, a coronavirus?”</p>
<p>If this is indeed what Enserink is suggesting, then it is grossly unfair. <italic>All</italic> the laboratory work reported therein was quite clearly carried out at the same time: mid February–early April 2003. Even a cursory glance at CLA would make this apparent. For whatever else it does, CLA indexes the hard scientific labour that went into its production. As with the AMMS’ work, cell lines were inoculated with materials derived from SARS patients, and electron microscope examinations, serological tests and polymerase chain reaction tests were conducted. Even by Enserink’s account, this kind of work took Yang’s team a full 12 days – from at least 14 February to at least 26 February. Yet CMC’s “by then” seems to be suggesting that Hong began his coronavirus work after 16 April. If this were so, then in the 9 days between 16 April and 25 April, Hong would have had to have done his experimental work, written a 5 page scientific report, had it peer-reviewed and then published in China’s most prestigious science journal. Put like this, the suggestion starts to appear somewhat implausible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0963662510371436">
<title>The first hint of the developing “phantasm”</title>
<p>If it <italic>was</italic> so implausible, then why should Enserink attempt to suggest Hong’s discovery of the coronavirus happened later than it did? Because, I submit, it represented the only way in which Enserink could protect the overall story being told within CMC. As Hayden White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510371436">1978</xref>: 84 my emphasis) has noted of historical “story-telling” more generally, there is a deep and irresolvable tension between, on the one hand, “primary data,” and, on the other hand, “plot structure”:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>No given set of casually recorded historical events can in itself constitute a story; the most it might offer to the historian are story elements. The events are made into a story by the <italic>suppression</italic> or subordination of certain of them and the <italic>highlighting</italic> of others, by characterisation, motific repetition, variation of tone and point of view, alternative descriptive strategies, and the like – in short, all of the techniques that we would normally expect to find in the emplotment of a novel or a play.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>CMC’s tale of the “good” microbiologists versus the “bad” microbiologist depends on precisely such rhetorical work. Hong, for instance, simply had to be around to make a (patently) false <italic>Chlamydia</italic> claim. Granted, CMC <italic>could</italic> have “highlighted” Hong as the microbiologist who saw the coronavirus before anyone else, just as it <italic>could</italic> have “highlighted” him as a microbiologist who had taken the coronavirus’ presence in patient samples as seriously as that of his other discovery, <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. But if it <italic>had</italic>, then the suggestion that Hong, having made both discoveries, “promoted” his <italic>Chlamydia</italic> hypothesis whilst ignoring his coronavirus findings, would have started to appear a little less believable. At the very least it would have been an idea requiring of some further explanation. And that, of course, was precisely the kind of “further explanation” that Enserink, relying so heavily on the evidence presented in CLA, could not have given.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most important effect of CMC’s refusal to treat Hong’s coronavirus discovery as significant and timely has to do with the way in which it “suppresses” the possibility of Hong’s “synergy.” As is clear from CLA’s abstract, Hong was considering the possibility of <italic>both</italic> a multifactorial <italic>and</italic> a singular aetiology for SARS. And the possibility of multifactorality is, in a sense, Hong’s defence against Enserink’s charges. True, lip service is paid to this defence in CMC: we, as readers, learn that two separate pathogenic discoveries had (just about) been made. But note what starts to happen here. Within CMC, Hong is no longer ready and waiting to interpret their significance for us. Refused entry into this text from the very outset, he is in fact replaced by an imposter; a character who seems intent on thinking only in terms of singularity: “it was not the coronavirus causing SARS, but <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> alone.” Indeed, as a character born largely of Enserink’s imagination, it is perhaps useful to think of it as a “phantasm.” And so although we, as readers, are indeed able to see that two separate pathogenic discoveries had (just about) been made, thanks to the presence of this illusory figure, we lose sight of the possibility of multifactorality, and, in the process, the possibility that Hong’s scientific practice had been in any way reasonable.</p>

<sec id="section9-0963662510371436">
<title>4. Appropriating CMC</title>
<p>At this stage of the analysis, it is worth asking: what happened to CMC after it had been published? For if CMC had been neither read nor cited, its portrayal of this Chinese microbiologist would have made little impact on our understandings of the SARS outbreak. But the fact is that CMC quickly became a key text. As of August 2009, for instance, 18 English language scientific research papers containing references to CMC had been published. And whilst it is not <italic>that</italic> unusual for scientific research papers to cite popular scientific texts, the fact that all 18 did so <italic>approvingly</italic>, elevating a work of popular science to the status of “definitive-historical-account” is a little unusual. What we find in those accounts is a form of repetition, as in this example, published in the <italic>Journal of Clinical Virology</italic>:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Almost nobody knew at that stage that virologists in Beijing had already discovered a new virus in samples from some of the earliest SARS patients. However, the official line in China at the time was that the novel “atypical pneumonia” was caused by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510371436">Enserink, 2003</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510371436">Berger et al., 2004</xref>: 13–14)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As might be expected in a scientific research article, actors and their actions are de-emphasized, whilst broad processes come to the fore. In this sense, Hong is “let off the hook.” And yet, what I find striking here is the citation strategy. If the euphemistic metonymy of the “official line” catches your eye; if it hints at some kind of scientific malpractice, then you have a reputable source to turn to in order to find out more: “China’s Missed Chance.” But what of Hong’s own research article? Despite the fact that the German research team were writing an article of a similar order to Hong’s – i.e. one that discussed primary scientific knowledge – they eschew any reference to his primary research article in favour of a popular science article that glosses it. This same strategy is at work in each of the 18 research articles: an approving and unquestioning citation of CMC, yet no citation of Hong’s research article. There is something else to bear in mind here too. For when the number of citations received by those 18 research articles are added together, a total of 478 citations is generated. At the very least, then, it is possible to suggest that whilst all of those articles would have come into contact with CMC as a definitive-historical-account, none would necessarily have learnt anything of CLA, that definitive-historical-account’s <italic>primary source</italic>.</p>
<p>But what about “pedagogical” and “popular” accounts? In a sense, they were the accounts that really mattered in mediating an understanding of the outbreak: for most of us today the reality of something like SARS comes to us not through articles in the <italic>Journal of Clinical Virology</italic>, but rather, through the filter of journalistic language and imagery. So how did <italic>they</italic> engage with and appropriate CMC? As with the research articles discussed above, a common strategy was <italic>repetition</italic>: each account citing CMC approvingly, whilst ignoring CLA. But another form of appropriation is also apparent in these accounts: <italic>embellishment</italic>. Consider the following extracts:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In mid-February, the Institute of Virology also in Beijing, under China’s national CDC received two lung tissues … Hong soon claimed, after examining [them] under the electron microscope, that it was <italic>Chlamydia</italic> – a bacterium notorious for being the pathogen of a common sexually transmitted disease which is not generally fatal – that was the cause of the atypical pneumonia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510371436">Cao, 2004</xref>: 268)</p>
<p>The new rumours … came from Guangdong … A senior local scientist maintained that chlamydiae [<italic>sic</italic>] bacteria had caused the outbreak. The theory was so prevailing that it proved inhibiting in a culture of deference to authority and seniority. When scientists in Beijing identified a new virus in late February, they chose not to say anything about it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510371436">Balasegaram and Schnur, 2006</xref>: 75)</p>
<p>The medical community’s understanding of the true aetiology of SARS was delayed significantly by a February announcement from a senior scientist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control that he suspected the infectious agent was <italic>Chlamydia</italic> – a commonly understood bacterial agent that would not have warranted heightened concern of investigation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510371436">Mahmoud et al., 2004</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Gone from the final extract, for instance, are any references to the “drag” of Chinese institutional intermediaries. It is now Hong, and Hong alone, who stands responsible for the false claim. The all powerful, yet totally inept superman. A line of moral responsibility is drawn, leading straight from this “senior scientist” to the “significant delay” in the medical community’s attempts to get to grips with the outbreak. Even the identity of Hong’s <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-like particles is now characterised in such a way as to make him appear ridiculous. In the first extract, for instance, we are able to laugh at a “fact” that the cited source, CMC, never mentions: Hong’s belief that a sexually transmitted infection could have caused an outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease. And yet the joke, I would suggest, is on the extract’s author. For there is more than one <italic>Chlamydia</italic> “bacterium.” In CLA, Hong merely refers to the viral family <italic>Chlamydiaceae</italic>, of the class <italic>Chlamydiae</italic>. Included within this family are two genera: <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and <italic>Chlamydophila</italic>. The species <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, which causes “sexually transmitted disease,” is only one of three <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species, and only one of the nine species included within the overall family <italic>Chlamydiaceae</italic>. In CLA, Hong never mentions <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>. But he does mention <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>, species which are known to cause pneumonia-like illness. And finally, consider the second extract. Here, the Beijing based Hong even has his place of work and his geographical location within China manipulated! Cast in the role of “local doctor from the rural provinces,” Hong-the-simpleton now appears only in order to frustrate the AMMS, the thrusting, big city research group from Beijing.</p>
<p>These repetitions and embellishments perhaps represent real tragedy for Dr Hong. But his experience at the hands of these accounts reveals something more than a personal tragedy: the slow, yet ineluctable vanishing of the primary data as one traces a path away from CMC, and into the mass of subsequent CMC citing literature. Whereas CMC at least allowed the reader to catch sight of Hong’s double finding – coronavirus <italic>and Chlamydia</italic>-like particles – these subsequent accounts do not. Foregrounded in each and every case, and in some cases with an almost sadistic pleasure, is the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> discovery and the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> discovery alone. In CMC one could still sense the faint presence of a reasonable scientist considering the possibility of “synergy.” But here, in these texts, that scientist has finally been excluded. That we struggle to notice his absence is because, in a sense, he never actually disappears. For in his place, conjured up from all of the embellishments and repetitions on display in those secondary accounts, is a phantasm of Hong. Bearing little, if any, relationship to the original Hong, he is an <italic>illusory</italic> figure, created solely by those secondary accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0963662510371436">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>So, how did we get here – to a set of accounts in which Hong’s actions could be storied and understood in <italic>this</italic>, rather than in any other, kind of way? A great deal of epistemological responsibility for the creation of “Hong,” the textual illusion, has to lie with CMC. Published quickly, and before most other secondary accounts, it was as if CMC came to stand guard over CLA, ready and waiting to suggest to anyone who strayed too close that the latter text had already been explored, and that, as a result, everything of interest about it could now be found, far more easily, in the pages of the former text. Before CMC, then, Hong’s own account of his own actions had to be taken into consideration; afterwards, that account <italic>also</italic> had to be taken into consideration, but only now <italic>via the order imposed upon it within CMC</italic>. Interestingly, CMC seems to have played this “gatekeeper” role not just for other “pedagogical” and “popularising” accounts, but also for papers published in specialised scientific journals. Indeed, rather than knowledge of Hong’s laboratory work simply diffusing outwards, from scientific “sender” to journalistic “mediator,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0963662510371436">13</xref></sup> a curious kind of “feedback loop” seems to have developed between the two, with most scientists learning of Hong’s original scientific laboratory work via CMC, a popularising account: the popularising article became the “science,” and the scientists became the “public.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0963662510371436">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>CMC’s near constant presence within all further generations of accounts of Hong’s laboratory work is also of interest here in another sense. For at the same time as those secondary accounts were turning CMC into a definitive-historical-account of Hong’s actions, Hong’s <italic>own</italic> account of his <italic>own</italic> actions was being left unread and ignored. But then, if the need to rely on the primary data in order to gain an understanding of that primary data has receded so utterly, then what kind of ontological status does Hong’s account now possess? In a sense, it still “exists.” It is still “out-there.” No-one has destroyed or deleted it. As with the work of other “failed” scientists like the “cold-fusion two,” Pons and Fleischman, for example, we are still able, with a little effort, to recover the original data. And yet, perhaps this standard philosophical distinction between the “existent” and the “non-existent” is a little too rigid when considering the work of long since “failed” and/or “debunked” scientists. Covered over by multiple generations of secondary accounts, Hong’s own work exists, but also, and at the same time, does not <italic>quite</italic> exist. A both/and, rather than an either/or scenario. Indeed, if the metaphor of “deletion” best captures the latter scenario, in which something that once “existed” is destroyed, then perhaps the metaphor of the “vanishing” is best suited to explaining the peculiarly “in-between” status of Hong’s original account. Usually associated with the art, or the act, of the magician, to vanish is, according to the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>, to make something “disappear from sight” or “to become invisible.” But note: Neither of these processes implies any kind of destruction. This is apt. For Hong’s own account of his own actions is still there. And yet, having been spoken for, summarised, exaggerated, embellished, abbreviated, ridiculed and distorted by countless other, secondary accounts, the <italic>illusion</italic> of its non-existence has been established. For having created a very public, very convincing phantasm of “Hong, the bad scientist,” those summaries, exaggerations and embellishments have, in doing so, effectively <italic>vanished</italic> from sight the very primary data that, as I have attempted to demonstrate during this paper, can be used to call that phantasm into question.</p>

<p>That is, “fairly standard” given the claims made by those who study popular science writing: “many popular science books promote a version of science that is contrasted starkly with the ‘other’ of science – or at least the ‘other’ that popular science writers want to identify – namely, foolishness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510371436">Erickson, 2005</xref>: 148).</p>

<p>The approach in this section represents a basic form of transitivity analysis. The study of transitivity is concerned with “how actions are represented; what kind of actions appear in a text, who [or what] does them and to whom [or what] they are done” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510371436">Mills, 1995</xref>: 143). The distinction drawn between Actor, Process and Goal is adapted from Simpson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510371436">2004</xref>: 22–3).</p>

<p>The concept of focalisation, drawn from the field of narratology, suggests that all stories are presented in a text through the mediation of a particular “perspective.” The key question is always: “who is the immediate seer here …?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510371436">Toolan, 2001</xref>: 63).</p>
