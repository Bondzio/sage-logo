<p>Gentrification has been a phenomenon of urban development. Fifty years ago the British sociologist Ruth Glass created the term <italic>gentrification</italic>, triggering much research and discussion. These days there are more than forty monographs and edited collections on gentrification (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12470798">Lees, Slater, and Wyly 2010</xref>). The texts range from more than four decades of gentrification research—from the classical first paper by Ruth Glass in 1964 introducing and defining gentrification to recent research in 2008. This collection is based on topical works in which about 50 percent of the contributions were published after 2000. This enables readers to gain a good introduction to the recent key debates of gentrification. The selection contains texts by very important researchers in the gentrification debate: Rowland Atkinson, Tim Butler, Loretta Lees, David Ley, Neil Smith, and Sharon Zukin. These contributions provide a complete representation of theories and methods. <italic>The Gentrification Debates: A Reader</italic> is the second book published within a short time frame that provides a systematic collection of important articles on gentrification.</p>
<p><italic>The Gentrification Debates: A Reader</italic> shows a classical structure for many student readers. It starts with an eight-page overview of the book followed by a collection of 27 articles structured into four parts. Every part starts with a short introduction of about six to nine pages about the central question of the chapter. The introductions within the four parts follow the same structure. First, the editor, Brown-Saracino, provides a common point of view such as experiences in typical American towns, the media, TV, or novels—like Kathleen Hirsch’s “A Home in the Heart oft he City”; Denise Lehane’s “Mystic River” or Jonathan Lethem’s “Fortress of Solitude”—which will inspire readers to familiarize themselves with the aspects of gentrification. Then, Brown-Saracino outlines the theme of the particular part with regards to the content structure and then presents current debates. This is followed by a short introduction of the selected texts and their relevance to the gentrification discussion. The four introductions end with discussion questions and activities where students are invited to do fieldwork, such as conducting interviews or ethnographic observations in gentrification neighborhoods, to read documentaries about gentrification in novels or newspapers, and so on.</p>
<p>In Part I, “What Is Gentrification? Definitions and Key Concepts,” Brown-Saracino opens the discussion with questions about the definitions and key concepts of gentrification. The reader is not only exposed to the definitions themselves but also gains an interesting look at how definitions were created, that is, their implicit and explicit causes and the underlying processes. Thus, readers do not simply read the definition, but also learn about the techniques of creating definitions. It becomes apparent that definitions do not have to align with right–false dichotomies but rather on applications inside academic debates; they are linked to theory, methods, and also politically and ideologically. Brown-Saracino then includes her own preferred definition in the discussion, that is, that gentrification is “an influx of capital and resultant social, economic, cultural, and physical transformation and displacement” (p. 13).</p>
<p>In Part II, “How, Where and When Does Gentrification Occur?” the editor explores explanations of gentrification. Following a long tradition, she starts with the polar positions of production and consumption theory, and continues with the complementarities of both. Additionally, she explores answers to the question: “Why gentrification shows a global expansion?” Brown-Saracino posits that the main reasons for expansion in the past fifty years are the global circulation of capital and culture and, of course, the global urban strategy of revitalization as part of “global competition for resources between cities” (p. 67).</p>
<p>Part III, “Who Are the Gentrifiers and Why Do They Engage in Gentrification?” contains texts about the consumers of gentrification. To help the reader gain an idea of gentrifiers, Brown-Saracino calls attention to the extensive presence of the gentrifier lifestyle in media: newspaper, TV, and comedies. The selected texts show different ways of demographic characteristics of gentrifiers and their implicit connection with motives, sentiments, and relationships to place.</p>
<p>The question in Part IV is: “What Are the Outcomes and Consequences of Gentrification?” In the short introduction, Brown-Saracino gives a description of an imaginary walk to see the representations of gentrification: “carefully maintained streetscapes, high-end bistros, historically preserved homes, health food stores, and streets marked by expensive vehicles” (pp. 277–78). The selected texts give a deeper view to the visible results of gentrification. However, the results are not only the visible “landscape of gentrification”; there are also benefits and costs for residents, investors, and politicians. Most academic and political observers look only for positive or negative consequences of gentrification, but this is a simplification of polarization to discrete positions. Brown-Saracino captures a position beyond the colonization debate—gentrification is not a colonization of neighborhoods by new middle-class residents in every case. Indeed, gentrification can progress without losing sight of displacements and unacceptable costs for long-time residents.</p>
<p>At the end of the reader, Brown-Saracino provides a conclusion. Here, she shows why it is worthwhile to study the phenomenon of gentrification and debates about the process in academic and planning discourses. There are many possible answers to the currently many open theoretical questions. One way to answer these questions is through field research, as suggested by Brown Saracino. The reader closes with the reference section and an index.</p>
<p>This reader provides many important and excellent insights that make it worthwhile to use in graduate-level classes. <italic>The Gentrification Debates: A Reader</italic> is quite application-oriented and inspires a reader’s own observations, thoughts and questions. Brown-Saracino does not provide solutions; rather, she inspires the recipient to come to his or her own conclusions and thus creates discussions. In many ways Brown-Saracino caters to graduate students in geography, urban studies, urban planning, urban sociology, and urban anthropology, among other fields.</p>
<p>The overview of the book starts with a story about her first experiences with gentrification during her graduate years. This approach might help students to look for similar experiences, possibly gaining their own interests in the gentrification debate. The discussion questions and activities at the end of the introductions are helpful to increase the learning experience as well. An instructive example of this approach is the following exercise: “Imagine that you chair a committee of social workers, the directors of city agencies, and nonprofit administrators who share the task of addressing gentrification’s costs in your city. Your review research on gentrification suggests that gentrification’s outcomes are context-specific. That is, outcomes vary, within a set of parameters, from neighborhood to neighborhood. How would this acknowledgement influence your committee’s recommendations for addressing city-wide physical and social displacement? What neighborhood-level characteristics would you look for to help predict the services required in a given neighborhood?” (p. 282).</p>
<p>Brown-Saracino conducted ethnographic research about relations between authenticity and gentrification in Chicago and in a select number of New England towns, which form the basis for this reader as well as other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12470798">Brown-Saracino 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12470798">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there are some shortcomings. First, there is no historical overview of the gentrification debate, which would have been useful, including the model of waves of gentrification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12470798">Hackworth and Smith (2001)</xref>. There is also a lack of discussion about the global spread of gentrification. Brown-Saracino does not discuss commercial aspects and the symbolic dimension of gentrification. Also, she does not discuss the issue of anti-gentrification movements. These are only a few examples of aspects that should have been included.</p>
<p>In terms of academic scholarship, this book competes against <italic>The Gentrification Reader</italic>, edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12470798">Lees, Slater, and Wyly (2010)</xref>. The reader by Brown-Saracino is less comprehensive and not as sophisticated as the reader by Lees, Slater, and Wyly. However, this reader is well-arranged and more practical when it comes to students who will be able to see the practical relevance in daily planning and governing, inspiring them to explore local case studies, becoming more interested in gentrification.</p>
