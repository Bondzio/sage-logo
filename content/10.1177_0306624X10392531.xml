<abstract>
<p>A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was applied to data for 237 male participants (<italic>M</italic> = 31.93 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.64) in a prison-based substance abuse treatment program to study the integrity of the Stages of Change model of treatment readiness. Using the Stages of Change Questionnaire (STOCQ), participants were assigned to Contemplation (102), Action (118), or Maintenance (17) groups. A CART analysis then examined differences in the overall group profiles on the basis of scores on the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking, the Situational Confidence Questionnaire, and the Carlson Psychological Survey. The assumption of discrete stages of change was not supported. Alternative models are suggested: one based on states of change and one on personality characteristics. A focus on equal attention to both cognitive and behavioral aspects of substance abuse treatment readiness is suggested.</p>

<p>Treatment readiness is an important element in offender rehabilitation. Readiness for treatment is thought to rely on motivation to seek help, preparedness to engage with treatment activities, and how these factors affect treatment attendance, compliance, and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X10392531">DiClemente, Schlundt, &amp; Gemmell, 2004</xref>). The construct of treatment readiness has been explored historically in addiction literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X10392531">DiClemente et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X10392531">Freyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X10392531">McConnaughy, DiClemente, Prochaska, &amp; Velicer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X10392531">Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992</xref>) and somewhat more recently in anger management literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X10392531">Howells &amp; Day, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X10392531">Williamson, Day, Howells, Bubner, &amp; Jauncey, 2003</xref>). The general concept of addiction treatment readiness typically indicates a willingness or openness to engage in a particular process or to adopt a particular behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X10392531">Prochaska &amp; Velicer, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Several theoretical models have been used to describe the process of change in therapy. The most influential model of treatment readiness is considered to be the Stages of Change model (also known as the transtheoretical model of change) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X10392531">Prochaska and DiClemente (1992)</xref>. Their model proposes that individuals pass through identifiable stages of change as they move to resolve a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X10392531">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X10392531">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>). The first stage is Precontemplation, referring to individuals who do not wish to change their behavior or do not recognize a problem. The next stage is Contemplation, when people seriously intend to change their behavior; followed by Action, when people start to modify their behavior, experiences, or environment to overcome a particular problem; and finally, Maintenance, that is, maintaining accomplished behavior changes over time. Additional stages have been suggested, including Preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X10392531">Levy, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In support of discrete stages of change, numerous studies have identified a relationship between particular stages of change and treatment or change-related behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X10392531">Brogan, Prochaska, &amp; Prochaska, 1999</xref>). Moreover, there is some evidence that degree of behavior change appears related to pretreatment stage of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X10392531">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1992</xref>). However, the assumption that people proceed through a series of identifiable stages of change when dealing with a problematic behavior has been questioned (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X10392531">Armitage, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X10392531">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X10392531">Bunton, Baldwin, Flynn, &amp; Whitelaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X10392531">Herzog, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X10392531">Littell &amp; Girvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10392531">Sutton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306624X10392531">West, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X10392531">Whitelaw, Baldwin, Bunton, &amp; Flynn, 2000</xref>). It has been argued, for example, that it is not clear whether people follow this orderly progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X10392531">Davidson, 1992</xref>) and that the stages are not discrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X10392531">Davidson, Miller, &amp; Heather, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X10392531">Murphy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10392531">Sutton, 2001</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X10392531">Littell and Girvin (2002)</xref> argued that the different classification schemes were arbitrary and produced different results depending on the classification method applied. There is also some controversy relating to the underlying dimensions of Stages of Change, with some studies confirming the four-stage structure of the model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X10392531">Carney &amp; Kivlahan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X10392531">O’Hare, 1996</xref>) and others opposing the four-stage structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X10392531">Elder, de Moor, Young, &amp; Wildey, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X10392531">Miller &amp; Tonigan, 1996</xref>). In fact, several investigators have argued that a continuous model is more practical and may be more readily integrated with related concepts from other theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X10392531">Budd &amp; Rollnick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X10392531">Drieschner, Lammers, &amp; van der Staak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X10392531">Williamson et al., 2003</xref>). The present study informs the debate on the utility of the Stages of Change model and responds to the question of the relative contribution to offender treatment readiness of both intention and action.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy surrounding the Stages of Change model of treatment readiness and its wide application in the field of addiction, there has been relatively limited empirical use of the model in forensic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X10392531">Casey, Day, &amp; Howells, 2005</xref>). Some research has investigated the utility of the Stages of Change model in understanding change in violent offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X10392531">Howells &amp; Day, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X10392531">Williamson et al., 2003</xref>), sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X10392531">Kear-Colwell &amp; Pollock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X10392531">Tierney &amp; McCabe, 2002</xref>), and mentally disordered offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X10392531">McMurran et al., 1998</xref>). This research suggests that although the Stages of Change model might offer some value in explaining how treatment programs assist offenders in changing their behavior, the stage construct itself is unlikely to adequately explain the process by which offenders desist from offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X10392531">Casey et al., 2005</xref>). Other investigators have also questioned the utility of the stages of change model in assessing readiness to change in offender populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X10392531">Burrowes &amp; Needs, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretical issues aside, there is widespread support that offenders participating in drug and alcohol treatment are less likely to reoffend or return to prison than similar offenders who are not participating in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X10392531">Makkai &amp; Payne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X10392531">Taxman &amp; Thanner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X10392531">Thanner &amp; Taxman, 2003</xref>). Among nonoffender addicts, receipt of treatment has also been linked to lower levels of drug and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X10392531">Simpson, Joe, Rowan-Szal, &amp; Greener, 1997</xref>) and reduced offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X10392531">Hanlon, Nurco, Bateman, &amp; O’Grady, 1998</xref>). The high incidence of drug and alcohol use and recidivism among offenders raises multiple challenges for treating offenders with substance abuse issues, both in prison and in the community. Failure to address postrelease substance abuse greatly reduces the likelihood that released offenders will be able to reintegrate successfully into the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X10392531">Taxman &amp; Thanner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study applied classification and regression tree (CART) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X10392531">Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, &amp; Stone, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X10392531">Lemon, Roy, Clark, Friedmann, &amp; Rakowski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X10392531">Lewis, 2000</xref>) to existing data to study the integrity of the Stages of Change model of drug and alcohol treatment readiness. CART analysis is a nonparametric statistical procedure that identifies mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups of a population whose members share common characteristics that influence the dependent variable of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X10392531">Lemon et al., 2003</xref>). CART builds classification and regression trees for predicting continuous dependent variables (regression) and categorical predictor variables (classification). Put simply, CART analysis is a procedure to classify data and build decision trees and has the capacity to detect previously unknown relationships among variables. Unlike traditional regression procedures, CART has the benefit of being unconstrained by the assumptions underlying those procedures, is unaffected by outlying observations, does not require risk specification, and has the capacity to uncover complex interactions not detectable by a regression-based approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X10392531">Garzotto et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>CART analysis is an approach that is receiving increased application for the identification and description of numerous patient subgroups. For example, CART has been used to predict outcome following treatment among smokers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X10392531">Swan, Javitz, Jack, Curry, &amp; McAfee, 2004</xref>) and patients with acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X10392531">Rainer, Lam, Wong, &amp; Cocks, 1999</xref>) as well as identification of at-risk groups of harmful alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X10392531">McKenzie et al., 2006</xref>) and studies of gambling participation and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X10392531">Welte, Barnes, Wieczorek, &amp; Tidwell, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of both the wide usage of the Stages of Change Questionnaire (STOCQ) to measure treatment readiness, and the divergence of opinion related to whether the presumed stages are demonstrable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X10392531">Littell &amp; Girvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X10392531">Murphy, 2005</xref>), the present study used the STOCQ as a measure of offender readiness for substance abuse treatment in prison. In particular, CART analysis was applied to test the assumption inherent in the STOCQ that treatment readiness is a stage progression. To achieve this, CART analysis examined whether there were differences in the overall profiles of the STOCQ-derived Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance groups in terms of several psychometric measures (Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking [PICTS], Situational Confidence Questionnaire [SCQ], and the Carlson Psychological Survey [CPS]). There was a particular focus on cognitive styles and self-efficacy, given evidence for the role of cognitive variables in offender treatment readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X10392531">Ward, Day, Howells, &amp; Birgden, 2004</xref>). Finally, we do not conceive the PICTS, SCQ, and CPS as measures of treatment readiness; rather, these measures were selected on the basis that they may differentiate the stage groups assumed by the Stages of Change model. If treatment readiness was to occur in stages, it would be logical to assume that different psychological states are associated with those stages. That assumption is inherent in the theory as presented originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X10392531">Prochaska and DiClemente (1992)</xref>, and we have tested that assumption in this study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0306624X10392531">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All Victorian prisoners who had completed a 40-hour drug and alcohol treatment program over a 2-year period were included in the present study (<italic>N</italic> = 260). Twenty-three prisoners were later excluded from the study because they did not fit discretely into one stage according to their scores on the STOCQ (see Procedure section). The final sample comprised 237 male prisoners aged between 19 and 52 years (<italic>M</italic> = 31.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.64). The three prison locations from which the drug and alcohol treatment program operated were classified as medium-maximum security.</p>
<p>The majority of participants (73.0%) identified themselves as Australian (non-Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander); 7.60% were Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander; and 19.4% were identified as other ethnicity. Some 29.5% of participants reported they had a partner and 70.5% reported having no partner. Approximately one quarter (25.4%) reported that they had completed Elementary-Year 8, 24.5% had completed Year 9, 30.8% had completed Year 10, 16.8% had completed Year 11/12, and the remaining 2.5% had Advanced Qualifications. In terms of prior occupation, 25.7% fell within the Labourer/Related Worker category, 28.8% identified themselves as a Tradesperson, 25.7% reported that they were Unemployed, and 19.8% responded in the Other category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306624X10392531">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The dependent variable was the participant’s scores on the Stages of Change Questionnaire (STOCQ). The STOCQ consists of 32 items (8 items assigned to each of the four stages of Precontemplation, Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance) and requires the participants to indicate their level of agreement to each item on a Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). To score the STOCQ, a total was obtained from the eight items related to each of the subscales to yield a score (range of 8-40) for each stage. The psychometric properties of the STOCQ are well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X10392531">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X10392531">McConnaughy, Prochaska, &amp; Velicer, 1983</xref>). Good internal consistency has been shown with alpha coefficients ranging from .79 to .84. Pearson’s correlation coefficients have also indicated good separation between the stages and high correlations between stage items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X10392531">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The PICTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X10392531">Walters, 1995</xref>) is an 80-item questionnaire that examines the association between offenders’ substance use and attitudes, beliefs, and cognitive styles that support an evolving criminal lifestyle. Individuals rate each item using a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The PICTS comprises three validity scales, eight cognitive-style scales, four factor scales, two general content scales, and one special scale. Of interest to the present study were scores on the eight 8-item cognitive-style scales (Mollification, Cutoff, Entitlement, Sentimentality, Superoptimism, Power Orientation, Cognitive Indolence, and Discontinuity) as well as the Current Criminal Thinking content scale and the Fear of Change special scale. The PICTS has been shown to have good test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .73 to .93 after 2 weeks; <italic>r</italic> = .47 to .86 after 10 to 12 weeks), high internal consistency (α = .54 to .79), and acceptable validity (mean unweighted correlations of .12 to .20 with institutional adjustment/recidivism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X10392531">Walters, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The SCQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X10392531">Annis &amp; Graham, 1988</xref>) contains 50 items encompassing both intrapersonal (five subscales) and interpersonal (three subscales) subscales relating to the individual’s level of confidence in being able to resist the urge to use drugs and/or alcohol in given situations. The questionnaire asks individuals to imagine themselves in high-risk situations and to indicate on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 100 (<italic>very confident</italic>) how confident they are that they would be able to resist the urge to use drugs and/or alcohol in each situation. Scores for all subscales (Urges to Use, Testing Personal Control, Pleasant Emotions, Pleasant Time With Others, Unpleasant Emotions, Physical Discomfort, Conflict With Others, and Social Pressure to Use) were calculated by computing the mean confidence rating for items within each of the eight subscales. The SCQ is considered to have high internal validity, reliability, and predictive validity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X10392531">Annis &amp; Graham, 1988</xref>; P. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X10392531">Miller, Ross, Emmerson, &amp; Todt, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The CPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X10392531">Carlson, 1997</xref>) is a 50-item questionnaire that measures an individual’s use of drugs and/or alcohol and its relationship to offending, antisocial tendencies and self- depreciation. For the present study, three content scales were of relevance (Chemical Abuse, Antisocial Tendencies, and Self- Depreciation). On each of the dimensions, the participant is asked to choose a response that best relates to him from five differing levels of agreement with the statement. The CPS has good test–retest reliability for adult offenders (<italic>r</italic> = .87 and higher; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X10392531">Carlson, 1997</xref>), with similar findings among the adolescent male population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X10392531">DeFrancesco, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As part of the intake process for their prison-based drug and alcohol treatment programs, prisoners at various Victorian prison sites completed an assessment consisting of a clinical interview and a battery of psychological measures. This assessment process was completed prior to their acceptance and entry into the program and was obtained with the written consent of prisoners.</p>
<p>The data-mining software CART®, version 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X10392531">Salford Systems, 2003</xref>) that was used. CART is a decision tree that automatically sifts and sorts data to identify statistically significant patterns and relationships. The CART analysis can be summarized into four steps. The first step consists of tree building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X10392531">Lewis, 2000</xref>) which results in a maximal tree being produced. At this early stage, the tree may be difficult to interpret and more complex than is required to adequately describe the data. The second step consists of stopping the tree-building process. Here, the tree-growing methodology continues through each branch of the tree until a stopping rule is reached. The third step is tree “pruning.” This step creates a sequence of simpler and simpler trees, by cutting off (or deleting from the model) increasingly important nodes using the method of “cost-complexity” pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X10392531">Lemon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X10392531">Lewis, 2000</xref>). Pruning addresses the problem of overfitting the data that may arise for the initial tree to produce a smaller, more robust tree. The fourth step involves “optimal tree selection,” which produces a tree that fits the information in the data set but does not overfit the information. A misclassification rate is produced that shows how many cases were incorrectly classified in the overall tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X10392531">Breiman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X10392531">Steinberg &amp; Colla, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In other words, the CART approach uses recursive, partitioning methods to consider all variables and values on which it splits and sorts the sample, and based on misclassification error, chooses the best split among all variables. The CART software program determines the cut points on a mathematical basis. The value of the CART tool is that human judgment plays no part in the analysis. On the basis of scores for the variables on which each previous node split, participants are allocated to an outcome group (in this instance, contemplation/action/maintenance) based on the “terminal node.” The misclassification error is the percentage of participants incorrectly classified into the outcome group (e.g., classified as action when they are actually in maintenance). The terminal nodes comprise groups with particular characteristics and include the proportion of total cases meeting the defining criteria in question.</p>
<p>Prior to conducting the CART analysis, it was necessary to assign individuals to a stage group on the basis of their scores on the STOCQ. Assignment into groups was based on individuals’ scores for each of the four presumed stages of change. The stage with the highest score became the group into which an individual was placed, consistent with the instructions by the STOCQ authors for sorting respondents on the STOCQ. As there were no participants with a highest score for Precontemplation, participants were sorted into one of three stage groups (Contemplation, Action, or Maintenance) using STOCQ terminology. Participants who had equal highest scores for two or more stages or for nonsequential stages were excluded from the study (<italic>n</italic> = 23). One standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.50) was considered as the appropriate level of difference between stage scores for those scores to be treated as different. Given the above classification rules, the number of individuals included in the sample decreased to 237 from the original 260 (91% retention rate). The final group numbers were Contemplation (<italic>n</italic> = 102), Action (<italic>n</italic> = 118), and Maintenance (<italic>n</italic> = 17).</p>
<p>The next step was to determine whether there was a difference in the overall profiles between the Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance groups and to determine within-group differences. The CART analysis was conducted and produced a final tree showing each node, and the variable and value on which it split and sorted the sample into the two child nodes. On the basis of their scores for the variables on which each previous node split, participants were allocated to an outcome group (based on “terminal node”). Support of the stages of change model would be indicated by clear between-group differences and a high level of within-group homogeneity.</p>

<p>The classification of participants by CART into outcome groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>. Using five as the minimum number of cases in a terminal node, CART generated a tree with eight outcome groups rather than the expected three groups: three were classified as Contemplation, three as Action, and two as Maintenance groups.</p>

<p>The CART analysis revealed minimal differences between the Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance stage profiles based on a number of psychological variables. The differences found between the Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance groups were only in terms of degrees of difference in size of the group, rather than the considerable differences expected if these were discrete stages. There was no clear pattern of difference evident between the Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance groups and their STOCQ scores for each of the presumed stages. Further analysis demonstrated that the primary difference between the outcome groups was their scores on SCQ Unpleasant Emotions. Of the eight outcome groups, one Action group had a score greater than 93.00 on SCQ Unpleasant Emotions. The remaining seven outcome groups had scores less than or equal to 93.00 on SCQ Unpleasant Emotions, with three of those being Contemplation groups, two being Action groups, and two being Maintenance groups. When the outcome groups were further split based on their SCQ Unpleasant Emotions score and other variables, the sample as a whole demonstrated heterogeneity across a number of variables.</p>
<p>The differences evident between the eight outcome groups were based on scores for CPS (Self Depreciation), Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions and Physical Discomfort), and PICTS (Superoptimism and Fear of Change) rather than being based on stage classifications. This finding refutes the assumption of discrete stages of change in drug and alcohol treatment readiness. With such heterogeneity present in the overall sample, and minimal differences evident between the stages, the general profiles associated with Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance were further examined to ascertain if a unique profile existed for each outcome group as implied by the discrete stages concept of the STOCQ.</p>
<sec id="section6-0306624X10392531">
<title>Overview of Contemplation Stage Profile</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>, the CART analysis classified three outcome groups as Contemplation groups. All Contemplation groups were classified as such by CART with scores less than 93.00 on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions). Of the three Contemplation groups, two groups had individuals who had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of less than or equal to 94.00. These two Contemplation groups were further divided on the basis of their Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores, this time using the cut off score of 73.00. The Contemplation group that had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of less than or equal to 73.00 and had PICTS (Superoptimism) scores of less than or equal to 13.50 formed one group of 23 individuals, of which 47.8% were in Contemplation. This group is labeled C1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>. The other Contemplation group, which had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of greater than 73.00 and had CPS (Self Depreciation) scores of greater than 18.50, formed another group of 42 individuals, of which 59.5% were in Contemplation. This group is labeled C2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>. The remaining Contemplation group (labeled C3) had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of greater than 94.00 and a Self-Efficacy (Physical Discomfort) score of less than or equal to 74.00. This group contained 10 individuals, 90.0% of whom were in Contemplation.</p>
<p>Overall, scores on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions, Pleasant Emotions, and Physical Discomfort) and PICTS (Superoptimism) were important in the composition of the Contemplation groups. In short, the CART analysis established that a great deal of heterogeneity existed within the Contemplation groups themselves, with no definitive profile emerging to distinguish them from the Action and Maintenance groups. The high misclassification rate of 58.82% indicates that the concept of stages of change and the discrimination of individuals on a stepwise basis lacked evidentiary support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0306624X10392531">
<title>Overview of Action Stage Profile</title>
<p>Similar to the Contemplation groups, the Action groups’ scores on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions) played a major role in determining which additional factors influenced these CART groupings. The CART analysis produced three Action groups. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>, two groups had scores less than or equal to 93.00 on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions). Of these two Action groups, one group had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of less than or equal to 73.00, scores of greater than 13.50 on PICTS (Superoptimism) and scores of greater than 25.50 on PICTS (Fear of Change). This Action group is labeled A1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref> and contained 16 individuals, 68.8% of whom were in Action. The other group had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of greater than 73.00 and CPS (Self Depreciation) scores of less than or equal to 18.50. This group (labeled A2) contained 24 individuals, of whom 75.0% were in Action. The single Action group which had scores of greater than 93.00 on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions) contained 32 individuals, 68.8% of whom were classified as Action (labeled A3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, scores on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions, Pleasant Emotions, and Physical Discomfort), CPS (Self Depreciation), and PICTS (Superoptimism and Fear of Change) were important in determining composition of the Action groups produced by the analysis. Once again, the CART analysis established that a high degree of heterogeneity existed amongst the Action groups themselves. No definitive profile emerged to differentiate Action from Contemplation and Maintenance. The high misclassification rate of 54.23% is similar to that reported for the Contemplation groups, and this misclassification rate refutes the concept of stages of change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0306624X10392531">
<title>Overview of Maintenance Stage Profile</title>
<p>Analysis of scores for individuals whose highest scores were in relation to the Maintenance stage indicated that Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions) played a major role in determining which additional factors influenced these groups. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>, the CART analysis produced two groups that were classified as Maintenance groups, both of which had scores less than or equal to 93.00 on Self-Efficacy (Unpleasant Emotions). One Maintenance group, which had Self-Efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of less than or equal to 73.00, PICTS (Superoptimism) scores of greater than 13.50 and PICTS (Fear of Change) scores of less than or equal to 25.50 formed one group. This group contained 59 individuals, 15.30% of whom were in Maintenance, and is labeled M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306624X10392531">Figure 1</xref>. The other Maintenance group had Self-efficacy (Pleasant Emotions) scores of greater than 94.00 and Self-Efficacy (Physical Discomfort) scores of greater than 74.00. This group, labeled M2, contained 31 individuals, 25.8% of whom were in Maintenance.</p>
<p>Overall, the CART analysis revealed heterogeneity amongst the Maintenance groups as well, and no definitive profile emerged to differentiate Maintenance from Contemplation and Action. With respect to Maintenance, the misclassification rate was extremely high at 82.35% and was greater than those reported for Contemplation and Action. This provides additional evidentiary support that the notion of discrete stages of change for this sample was unfounded.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study investigated the integrity of the STOCQ and the Stages of Change model as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X10392531">Prochaska and DiClemente (1992)</xref> through the use of a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. More particularly, the investigation involved subjecting the data to a CART analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X10392531">Breiman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X10392531">Lemon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X10392531">Lewis, 2000</xref>) to test the assumption inherent in the STOCQ that treatment readiness occurs as a set of progressive stages. If the Stages of Change model were to be supported, it was expected that a clear profile for each stage group (i.e., Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance) would emerge from the CART analysis, together with a high level of within-group homogeneity. Instead, no definitive profile emerged to distinguish one stage group from another. The minimal differentiation between groups is a contraindication of discrete stages of change in drug and alcohol treatment readiness. In addition, the CART analysis established that a great deal of heterogeneity existed within each of the presumed stage groups. The high misclassification rates further refute the theory of discrete stages of change in drug and alcohol treatment readiness, at least for this sample.</p>
<p>The main proponents of the Stages of Change model have proposed that although stage status changes over time, at any given point in time a person can be assumed to be in a single stage; and hence, the stages are thought to be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X10392531">Martin, Velicer, &amp; Fava, 1996</xref>). Results of the present study do not support these assertions, and instead, add to the literature that suggests people do not proceed through a series of identifiable stages of change when dealing with remediation of a problematic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X10392531">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X10392531">Bunton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X10392531">Littell &amp; Girvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10392531">Sutton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X10392531">Whitelaw et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings suggest that the Stages of Change model oversimplifies what are complexities of behavioral change by imposing artificial categories, as others have suggested (refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X10392531">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X10392531">Davidson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10392531">Sutton, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>So if not “stages” of change and treatment readiness, then what alternative models are worth exploring? Implicit in our results is a suggestion that contemplation and action occur concurrently and in relatively equal measure in many cases. This suggestion is explored empirically in a companion article to this study that elaborates the concept of a States of Change model of drug and alcohol treatment readiness. Although the assumption of discrete stages was refuted in the present study, in developing an alternative paradigm, it will be important to first explicate and then test one or more States of Change model(s) across a range of participant groups and treatment environments. It is obviously important to test the validity of any continuous development models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X10392531">Budd &amp; Rollnick, 1996</xref>). It is also important for future research to address whether treatment readiness models, whether stage based or concurrent state based, can be generalized across environments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the investigation of treatment readiness in a context of other forms of addiction, such as nicotine, or other targeted interventions, such as weight loss, would be of significant interest and value to treatment programs and providers. If concurrent processes of thought and behavior are found to be evident with such general populations, the applicability of one or both of the present study’s models extends beyond a specific forensic population to a much wider general audience targeting everyday behaviors.</p>
<p>A very different alternative to either stages of change or states of change models is a personality-based approach to determining treatment readiness. In the present study, a great deal of the misclassification that was identified, as well as the high levels of heterogeneity between presumed stage groups and within those groups, was attributable to personality characteristics, which were assessed using a battery of other instruments. This suggestion is also explored empirically in a companion article to this study—an article that proposes a personality-based theory of readiness for change and treatment readiness in particular. Strong support for such a theory is implicit in the results of the present study.</p>
<p>Some cautionary notes are in order. Given that the present sample was entering into a drug and alcohol treatment program within the constraints of a prison environment, participant responses to items in the STOCQ may have been influenced by a desire to appear “treatment ready” because of issues associated with their involvement in the criminal justice system (e.g., coercion to participate or the motivation of parole). It may also be the case for some of the sample participants, all of whom were experiencing enforced abstinence, that their STOCQ responses could be somewhat unrealistic/optimistic, given their limited access to substances in the prison environment. Thus, the context of the prison environment means that this particular sample may have been influenced by other variables that have not been addressed in this study. In addition, the absence of so-called precontemplators may have affected results somewhat.</p>
<p>The results of the present study suggest that clinicians applying the Stages of Change model in a treatment context need to have an increased awareness that at least some individuals who are assumed on the basis of STOCQ scores to be in the state of contemplation are likely thinking and acting concurrently to make change and are, therefore, treatment ready, albeit to varying degrees. Moreover, adopting a common treatment goal and outcome measure based on moving individuals in a lineal fashion through the proposed stages may be redundant. Clinicians should consider concurrency of thought and action and focus on both cognitive and behavioral aspects of treatment readiness rather than attempting to move individuals from thought to action. These program and treatment implications illustrate the potential use of CART analysis beyond its value in theory testing.</p>
<p>CART methods are an increasingly attractive way to explore complex, nonlinear relationships. This approach has numerous advantages relative to other analytic techniques such as logistic regression analyses and mixture modeling. Unlike regression models, for example, the CART approach does not require linearity and additivity assumptions and is better able to uncover complex interactions that may not be detected by other methods. Although both of these approaches may be used for prediction and classification, CART is superior as a classification tool compared with parametric regression techniques and is more tolerant of missing data. As well, CART has the benefit of being easier to interpret and understand than the results of many other statistical methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X10392531">Johnson, Brown, &amp; Wells, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X10392531">Kuchibhatla &amp; Fillenbaum, 2003</xref>). The flexibility and graphical features of CART are also highly advantageous and may be particularly useful for decision making in clinical or applied settings such as substance abuse treatment programs. Future studies that examine the integrity of the stages of change model of treatment readiness may benefit from applying complimentary approaches such as CART, logistic regression, and mixture modeling, given that different information may be yielded from the varying analytic techniques.</p>
<p>Another completely separate issue relates to the multiple uses of CART analysis. In addition to the important contribution that CART analysis can make to theory testing as we have seen here, it is relevant to testing program logic and integrity if applied to stepwise programs. Given the fairly typical stepwise or stagewise structure of many prison- and community-based drug and alcohol treatment as well as other rehabilitation programs, application of CART analysis to test program logic (not outcomes) of treatment programs is suggested. CART analysis may also serve as a means of testing assessment tools that purport to identify stages of an individual’s development or progression in treatment. These additional potential applications of CART analysis should be investigated further.</p>
