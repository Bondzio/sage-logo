<abstract>
<p>In dogs, papillomaviruses are thought to cause oral and cutaneous papillomas and pigmented plaques. Eight canine papillomaviruses have been fully sequenced to date. Four of these canine papillomaviruses, including <italic>Canis familiaris</italic> papillomavirus (CPV)-3, CPV-4, CPV-5, and CPV-8, were amplified from pigmented plaques. Given the identification of several different canine papillomaviruses within pigmented plaques, it is likely that there are additional papillomavirus sequences that have not been previously identified. The aim of the present study was to amplify papillomavirus DNA from pigmented plaques and identify potentially novel papillomavirus sequences through nucleotide sequence analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify DNA sequences of the papillomavirus <italic>L1</italic> gene from 27 pigmented plaques. Identification of novel papillomavirus sequences was based on less than 90% shared DNA homology to any known papillomavirus. DNA from 10 different papillomaviruses was identified within the pigmented plaques, including 6 putative novel papillomavirus sequences. CPV-4 was detected within 41% (11/27) of the pigmented plaques, while CPV-5 was identified within 2 pigmented plaques and CPV-3 within a single pigmented plaque. A previously identified novel papillomavirus sequence was identified within 2 pigmented plaques. The remaining 11 pigmented plaques contained 6 papillomavirus DNA sequences that have not been previously reported. These putative novel PV sequences were most similar to the canine papillomaviruses that have been detected within canine pigmented plaques.</p>

<p>Papillomaviruses (PVs) are epitheliotropic, often species-and tissue-specific viruses within the family <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic>. They are circular, double-stranded DNA viruses with a genome of approximately 8 kb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref></sup> PVs are classified into genus, species, and types based on the nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame (ORF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712443360">2</xref></sup> The complete viral genome for 8 canine PVs has been identified. Canis familiaris papillomavirus ( CPV-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712443360">4</xref></sup>) is believed to cause oral papillomas, and CPV-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712443360">16</xref></sup> CPV-6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712443360">6</xref></sup> and CPV-7<sup>6</sup> were amplified from cutaneous papillomas. The remaining 4 canine PVs, CPV-3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712443360">14</xref></sup> CPV-4,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712443360">15</xref></sup> CPV-5,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712443360">6</xref></sup> and CPV-8,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712443360">7</xref></sup> were all amplified from cutaneous pigmented plaques. An additional novel PV sequence (GU220384) has also been detected within pigmented plaques from a dog.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712443360">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the identification of different CPVs amplified from canine pigmented plaques, it is likely that there are additional PV sequences that have not been previously identified. The present study aimed to detect and sequence PV DNA from cutaneous pigmented plaques and identify the associated PV or novel PV sequences through nucleotide sequence analysis.</p>
<p>The pathology archives from the Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital (VMTH) at the University of California, Davis (Davis, CA), IDEXX Laboratories Inc. (West Sacramento, CA), Veterinary Diagnostics (VDx) Veterinary Pathology Services (Davis, CA), Yager-Best Histovet (Guelph, Ontario), and an independent biopsy service (Venice, CA) were searched for surgical biopsy specimens from dogs with the following diagnoses: viral plaque and pigmented plaque. In the study, 27 biopsies from 24 individual dogs were identified and included. All biopsies had been routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE), and a 4-µm section cut for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The HE-stained sections were reviewed by 2 board-certified pathologists (Luff and Affolter) to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed using a horseradish-peroxidase staining method on 4-µm FFPE sections of tissue from each biopsy. A rabbit polyclonal antibovine PV<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638712443360">a</xref></sup> antibody against the L1 capsid protein was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:600 for 1 hr. The secondary antibody, biotinylated goat antirabbit IgG,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638712443360">b</xref></sup> was used at a dilution of 1:500 for 30 min. The positive control was an oral papilloma. Omission of the primary antibody served as the negative control.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from two 25-µm-thick sections of FFPE tissue from each case using a commercially available kit following manufacturer’s recommended protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638712443360">c</xref></sup> A 450-base pair region of the L1 ORF was amplified using a single set of degenerate consensus primers (MY09 and MY11).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712443360">9</xref></sup> PV DNA was not detected within 4 pigmented plaques (4/27) using the degenerate primer set. For these cases, specific primers for CPV-4 were used to increase the sensitivity for detection of PV DNA in these remaining cases. Specific primers for CPV-4 were chosen because this was the most commonly detected CPV based on initial sequencing results of the other 23 out of 27 pigmented plaques. The specific primers for CPV-4 have been previously published and amplify a 194-bp fragment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712443360">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Omission of gDNA template served as a negative control for all PCR reactions. The PCR reaction conditions used in the current study have been previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712443360">9</xref></sup> All PCR products were electrophoresed through 1.5% agarose gel and stained with a commercially available nucleic acid stain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638712443360">d</xref></sup> The PCR products obtained from every sample (including those generated with specific primers) were purified using a commercially available kit following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1040638712443360">e</xref></sup> and submitted to a commercial DNA sequencing laboratory following the laboratory specifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1040638712443360">f</xref></sup> The nucleotide sequences generated from the sequencing laboratory were routinely trimmed and edited using commercially available software.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1040638712443360">g</xref></sup></p>
<p>Identification of new PV types is based on &lt;90% shared DNA homology to any known PV type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712443360">3</xref></sup> Therefore, identification of the PV type associated with each pigmented plaque was defined as having &gt;90% shared nucleotide identity within the <italic>L1</italic> gene. If a PV sequence had less than 90% similarity with other PV types, this was considered to be a novel PV sequence. Pairwise nucleotide alignments were performed on all novel PV sequences identified in the current study and all known CPVs using commercially available software.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1040638712443360">g</xref></sup> A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with commercially available software.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1040638712443360">h</xref></sup> The phylogenic tree was based on an alignment of the novel PV nucleotide sequences identified in the present study and the most closely related CPVs.</p>
<p>Histologically, the pigmented plaques were characterized by locally extensive epithelial hyperplasia, marked orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, prominent clumped keratohyalin granules, and hyperpigmentation within the stratum granulosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712443360">Fig. 1A</xref>). Koilocytosis can be a subtle feature in pigmented plaques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712443360">5</xref></sup> and it was identified within only 3 biopsies in the current study. Viral inclusion can be identified in pigmented plaques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712443360">12</xref></sup> although this is not a consistent feature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712443360">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712443360">15</xref></sup> and it was not identified in any of the biopsies in the current study. The clinical history, including breed of dog and location of the pigmented plaque, for all cases is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638712443360">Table 1</xref>. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive nuclear staining in all pigmented plaques. In some cases, the staining was evident within the keratinocytes throughout the stratum spinosum in the proliferative epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712443360">Fig. 1B</xref>), while in other cases, there were only 1 or 2 immunoreactive keratinocytes along the periphery of the acanthotic epithelium.</p>

<p>DNA from 10 different PVs was identified within the pigmented plaques (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638712443360">Table 1</xref>). CPV-4 was detected in 11 out of 27 pigmented plaques, CPV-5 in 2 out of 27, and CPV-3 in 1 out of 27. PV DNA sequences with 99% identity over 342 base pairs to the partial L1 PV sequence (GU220384) previously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712443360">10</xref></sup> were detected in 2 out of 27 of the pigmented plaques in the present study (JQ040505). The 11 remaining pigmented plaques contained 6 previously unreported PV DNA sequences (designated novel CPV-A through F for the purpose of this study; listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638712443360">Table 1</xref>). The results of the percentage pairwise nucleotide identities between the 6 novel PV sequences identified in the present study and the most closely related CPVs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712443360">Figure 2</xref>. Novel CPV-A (JQ040499) is most closely related to CPV-3 over 355 base pairs, novel CPV-B (JQ040500) with CPV-4 over 359 base pairs, novel CPV-C (JQ040501) with CPV-5 over 373 base pairs, and novel CPV-D (JQ040503) with GU220384 over 364 base pairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712443360">10</xref></sup> Both novel CPV-E (JQ040503) and CPV-F (JQ040504) were most closely related to CPV-8 over 342 and 372 base pairs, respectively. The nucleotide sequence for novel CPV-E was identical to a currently unpublished nucleotide sequence listed in the NCBI database (JF418155.1).</p>

</fig>
<p>CPV-8 DNA was not detected within any pigmented plaque in the current study. However, the degenerate primers used were able to successfully amplify DNA from the most closely related CPVs, including the novel PV sequences, and it is likely that these primers would have been able to amplify DNA from CPV-8. In addition, when the degenerate primers were aligned with the published nucleotide sequences for CPV-8, CPV-3, CPV-4, and CPV-5, there are similar numbers of mismatches at similar locations between each of the target sequences and the primers. Given that CPV-3, CPV-4, and CPV-5 were successfully amplified with these mismatches, it is likely that these same primers should be able to amplify CPV-8. However, a coinfection with CPV-8 cannot be completely excluded.</p>
<p>A causal association between the PV detected and plaque formation cannot be definitively proven because PV DNA can be detected on nonlesional skin as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712443360">8</xref></sup> However, the presence of abundant PV L1 protein identified within the proliferative epithelium using immunohistochemistry is suggestive for causality. In addition, PVs on nonlesional skin are maintained at low copy numbers (when compared to the large numbers of viral particles present in a productive PV infection in a papilloma or pigmented plaque), making is less likely that a rare PV associated with nonlesional skin would be amplified over the abundant PV DNA present within lesional skin from a single biopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712443360">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, the study that detected PV DNA on normal skin extracted DNA from fresh samples, not FFPE biopsies, and the sensitivity for detection of a latent PV infection in formalin-fixed skin is unknown.</p>
<p>Classification of PVs into different genera, species, and types is generally based on the L1 nucleotide sequence identities, although interpretation is also based on genome organization and biology of the virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712443360">2</xref></sup> The 8 known CPVs identified to date are divided into 3 distinct genera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref></sup> CPV-1 and CPV-6 are classified into the <italic>Lambdapapillomavirus</italic> genus, CPV-2 and CPV-7 into the <italic>Taupapillomavirus</italic> genus, and CPV-3, CPV-4, CPV-5, and CPV-8 into the <italic>Chipapillomavirus</italic> genus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref></sup> Definitive classification requires sequencing of the entire genome and analysis of the <italic>L1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712443360">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712443360">2</xref></sup>; however, the partial L1 nucleotide sequences generated in the current study suggest the identification of 6 new CPV types. These 6 putatively novel CPVs are most closely related to CPV-3, CPV-4, CPV-5, and CPV-8 based on the results of the pairwise nucleotide identities and phylogenetic analysis. Similar to their most closely related viruses, these putatively novel viruses are all associated with pigmented plaques. Based on their similar sequence identity, shared tissue tropism, and clinical biology to CPV-3, CPV-4, CPV-5, and CPV-8, it is likely that these putatively novel viruses are within the <italic>Chipapillomavirus</italic> genus.</p>
<p>In conclusion, canine pigmented plaques were associated with a large diversity of viruses in the current study, including CPV-3, CPV-4, CPV-5, 6 novel PV sequences not previously reported, and a seventh putatively novel CPV identified in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712443360">10</xref></sup> These 6 novel PV sequences were most closely related to members of the <italic>Chipapillomavirus</italic> genus, all which have been identified in association with canine pigmented plaques.</p>
