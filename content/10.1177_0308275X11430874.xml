<p>In a recent article published in <italic>Critique of Anthropology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308275X11430874">Thelen, 2011</xref>), I tried to offer some explanations for the lack of impact studies of post-socialism have had on anthropological theory. To my own surprise, the article has prompted many reactions and I am grateful for the inspiring, suggestive and thoughtful comments that I have received over the past few months. I am especially thankful to Elizabeth Cullen Dunn and Katherine Verdery for their response to my article, which allows me to reiterate and clarify some of my central arguments.</p>
<p>In the article I argued that one reason for the limited theoretical impact was the combination of an ambivalent construction of the socialist Other with the dominance of an economic analysis of socialism in the late 1980s. These two factors shaped studies of post-socialism, which took as their starting point a regional definition of the area of interest and a specific view of socialism’s difference from western capitalism.</p>
<p>The dominance of an economic analysis is unusual for the discipline of anthropology. Such an analysis became possible in the field of (post-)socialism through the writings of Katherine Verdery in particular. Her studies deserve enormous credit for introducing the work of János Kornai (and that of other Eastern and Central European intellectuals) to a wider anthropological audience. There are some peculiarities, however, associated with the impact of his concepts in the field of (post-)socialism. The most significant is that the adaptation of his economic theory normalized capitalism, while socialism and its social relations appeared as the ‘deficient’ Other. Thus, in contrast to Dunn and Verdery, who state that: ‘The whole point in creating separate ideal types of socialism and capitalism was to enable understanding of socialism’s operation <italic>in its own terms</italic>, rather than through the Cold War prism’ (2011: 253, emphasis in original), I argue that – no matter what the intention may have been – the exact opposite occurred: using an economic theory that presumed the inefficiency of socialist institutions implicitly replicated the Cold War prism, resulting in a theoretical dead end.</p>
<p>But how was such a problematic account possible in a discipline that usually questions the reasoning of economists and why is the theory of socialism still important? These questions led me to consider the manner in which Kornai’s concepts were introduced and received in anthropology. The second peculiarity in this regard is the fact that his theory of economic shortage in socialism was most convincingly articulated through a fictive example invented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308275X11430874">Verdery (1996)</xref>. This stands in contrast to the usual mode of developing theoretical thoughts in anthropology – that is, on the basis of concrete ethnographic settings or situations. More important, however, is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308275X11430874">Verdery (1996)</xref> introduced Kornai’s theory not with the label ‘economic analysis’, but as ‘indigenous concepts’. This supposedly ‘emic’ view still matters as it not only survived the demise of state socialisms but became pervasive. Many earlier experts also shared an (often sympathetic) interest in socialism as a theoretical construct, but they still displayed some conceptual diversity (in the article I cited amongst others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308275X11430874">Burawoy and Lukács, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308275X11430874">Hann, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308275X11430874">Humphrey, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308275X11430874">Kideckel, 1976</xref>). Since the reforms even authors who work within quite different traditions – for example, using Foucauldian concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308275X11430874">Dunn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308275X11430874">Müller, 2002</xref>) – have tended to apply them only to analyse post-socialism not the preceding periods. In sum, it is not the interest in economic relations as such that I contest, but an uncritical deployment of a theory derived from the academic discipline of economics. To scrutinize such normative analyses might open up new paths to the development of anthropological theory even beyond an understanding of socialism as alternative modernity.</p>
<p>Thus my questioning of the extent to which Kornai’s scholarly identity as an economist has been overlooked in anthropology does not reject his ‘rootedness in Hungarian realities’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308275X11430874">Dunn and Verdery (2011: 252)</xref> claim. On the contrary, by seriously considering his personal development from ‘devoted Communist’ to dissident and professor at Harvard University, this contributes to my argument, as it is precisely at this point in his life (in the late 1980s) that his writings became influential. Moreover, this consideration has led me to think critically about the nature of anthropological evidence that accepts the viewpoint of one person (or one particular elite subgroup) without contextualization. My article suggests that thinking about this could open a route into more general methodological-theoretical reflections, thereby complicating the construction of the field and the ‘emic’ in anthropological research. This is a more general debate in our discipline in which theorizing about the ambivalent construction of the socialist Other, or, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308275X11430874">Hann (2010)</xref> ‘an anthropology in-between’, might have something to contribute.</p>
<p>The discursively constructed East–West divide has deep historical roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308275X11430874">Todorova, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308275X11430874">Wolff, 1994</xref>), which came to influence not only the way Marxist thinking was incorporated into self-representations of Eastern Europeans, but also into ethnographic descriptions of ‘them’ by western researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308275X11430874">Dunn and Verdery are thus only partially right when they argue that the radical distinction was ‘set by the people in socialist societies themselves’ (2011: 252)</xref>. Presupposing diversity, one aspect of our comparative tradition is to ground knowledge-making in specific places or incidents to show their diversity – as did the aforementioned early studies of socialisms. Another way of building theory is to examine the ways in which various categories are mutually constructed and translated by different actors (academics as well as leading national politicians and more marginal constituents of the population). These processes take place within ethnographic fields that, more often than not, stretch beyond political boundaries, as did the mutual mirroring of East and West during the Cold War period.</p>
<p>Instead, influenced by an economic analysis of the (deficient) efficacy of socialism, much of the ethnographic writing of post-socialist reforms took the ‘great divide’ for granted. This common grounding survived even after a normative twist took place through which the former ‘deficient’ social relations came to be seen as a (valuable) resource for a critique of neoliberalism in anthropology. This development, I argue, is linked to the anthropological tradition of emphatic hermeneutics (perhaps heightened by the fact that the field attracted many western writers generally sympathetic to the socialist project), which rendered the neo-institutional concept of path-dependency into a tool for anthropologists to contribute to post-socialist policy debates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308275X11430874">Dunn and Verdery may thus be right when they claim that it was politically important to use ‘the’ socialist experience as a means to fight ‘brutal neo-liberalism’ (2011: 253)</xref>. In terms of advancing anthropological theory it nevertheless represents a dead end.</p>
<p>In their concluding section <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308275X11430874">Dunn and Verdery (2011: 254)</xref> describe the fact that post-socialist anthropology is diversifying as a ‘happy circumstance’. In principle I would agree. But the verb ‘diversify’ still seems to indicate that we are starting from a common basis. Would it not be better to re-diversify that common ground first?</p>
