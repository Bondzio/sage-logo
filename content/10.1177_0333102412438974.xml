<p>I suppose that when a book edited by such distinguished people as the current editor of this journal, a past President of the International Headache Society, and other comparable contributors is sent for review, it should fall to the Book Review Editor himself to do the deed!</p>
<p>This is a timely book, as many of the recent advances in the world of headache have been linked to such topics as depression, stroke, persistent foramen ovale (PFO) and medication overuse. The book provides very comprehensive surveys of these topics, quoting recent references and concluding with well balanced advice that can be used to relate all this epidemiology to the individual patient. The authors are in favour of, for example, the generous use of antidepressants whenever these can be justified, proper attention to the commoner risk factors for stroke, and differentiation between migrainous and epileptic auras. Todd Schwedt and Jean Schoenen, after a very thorough review, remain sceptical about closure of a PFO until better trials have been completed. Silberstein is his usual masterly self in his advice about medication overuse headache. There is a good chapter discussing comorbidities in children.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, rather a thin book for its price but the concentration of wisdom is high enough to justify it. I am glad to have a copy on my shelves.</p>
