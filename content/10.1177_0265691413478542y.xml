<p>Victor Leontovitsch’s classic study of liberalism in Russia is required reading for historians of Russia, students of political ideas, and those interested in intellectual history. It is provocative, insightful and demonstrates great clarity of argument. The latter is due in no small part to Parmen Leontovitsch’s excellent translation, the first in English, which renders a detailed enquiry readable and lucid throughout. The book was originally published in German in 1957 and appeared in Russian in 1979 – no less a figure than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn sponsored the latter edition.</p>
<p>Russia is not usually associated with liberalism: the main value of the work comes by offering an original interpretation of an alternative political tradition within Russia. Influenced by Maurice Hauriou and Montesquieu, Leontovitsch offers a definition of liberalism based upon legal concepts of freedom of the individual and the structure of the state, divided between civil society, the administrative system and constitutional government. The central argument followed is that the failure of liberalism was an intellectual problem, resulting from insufficient development of civil liberty in Russia. This claim is profound and intelligently assessed, though the exact persuasiveness of the central thesis varies from section to section. The first part of the book, covering the history of liberalism from 1762 to 1855, is interesting primarily in the often intriguing reinterpretations offered of several major thinkers and statesmen (it is surprising to see Nikolai Karamzin discussed in detail in a history of liberalism) and the pace of the book through these chapters is swift.</p>
<p>The second part of the book, focusing on the development of civil liberty in Russia between 1856 and 1914, offers a more in-depth and coherent analysis, and represents a very strong and compelling argument. The chapters on the peasant question are especially original and insightful, and very persuasively demonstrate Leontovitsch’s central contention. Leontovitsch notes how the development of liberalism in Russia was fatally crippled by long-standing commitments to collectivism and paternalism in this sphere. The survival of rural peasant communes in particular inhibited the development of a wider consciousness of civic law. Leontovitsch reminds us of these contentions in a later discussion of the unity between reactionary right and left in the second Duma when defending the collectivist traditions of the peasantry and necessity of the survival of the <italic>mir</italic>, as opposed to the liberal ideas of individual autonomy propounded by the Octobrists. This represented the culmination of a failure to define and support the idea of individual freedom, as opposed to traditions of collectivism and radicalism. Additionally, Leontovitsch views the schism between conservative liberalism, which he describes as ‘true liberalism’, and left liberalism in the nineteenth century as fatal to the long-term development of a viable and desirable liberal alternative to unbridled autocracy.</p>
<p>The final part of the book assesses the development of political liberty. The contentions that the 1906 manifesto represented the monarchy ‘adopting liberalism as its own programme’ and that the convocation of the Duma was the start of ‘real freedom of expression in Russia’ are essentially credible, though Leontovitsch overstates the pace of progress and change. Whilst the Tsar’s powers were in principle limited by the shift to a semi-constitutional system, they were still undeniably impressive. Multiple dissolutions of the Duma and Nicholas II’s partial control of appointments to the State Council, show that he still had the decisive say in how Russia was ruled. Additionally, whilst by the early twentieth century Russia was moving towards a constitutional system, the author has already stated that the seeds for the demise of the liberal tradition had been sown much earlier – which somewhat detracts from the weight of the argument offered here. Left radicalism had by now taken up the struggle against autocracy in its most decisive formulation, occupying the space that Leontovitsch would rather have seen filled by a respectable and moderate liberal politics. By this stage liberalism, exemplified by the later <italic>zemstvo</italic> movement and <italic>beseda</italic> circles, was fragmented and its leaders divided and impotent. By defining liberalism along legal lines, rather than by social or even economic criteria, the work narrows its focus: it misses out something of the social and political effect of liberal ideas and statesmen on society at large.</p>
<p>In spite of this, the range and depth of Leontovitsch’s learning, his insights and probing questions on the nature of Russian liberalism make the work extremely satisfying. As Solzhenitsyn notes in the foreword, it has the quality of managing to shed light on many different subjects whilst sticking to a focused central discussion. The book should be applauded for encouraging readers to think widely about the applicability of terms such as liberalism in the Russian context. The endurance of strong central government in Russia today shows that Leontovitsch’s ideas still have much to contribute to our understanding of that country, over half a century on.</p>
