<abstract>
<p>Public administrators always seem to be looking for a fix to the field’s “big” problem of ineffective government. One popular solution was (and perhaps still is) New Public Management reforms based on market values. Collaborative Public Management and related suggestions emerged thereafter to return the field to its democratic roots. The problem is, though, that both these constructs are pegged as “new” when nothing particularly innovative exists. This article uses Baudrillard’s phases of the image to trace developments within two popular governance constructs, showing, chiefly, how phases can loop back when appropriate historical roots of the object (nostalgia) are revealed.</p>

<p>Public administration scholars and practitioners always seem to be looking for a fix to the field’s “big” problem of ineffective, inefficient, and bloated government. One popular solution was (and perhaps still is in some circles) New Public Management (NPM). NPM “is used mainly as a handy shorthand, a summary description of a way of reorganizing public sector bodies to bring their management, reporting and accounting approaches closer to (a particular perception of) business methods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711433406">Dunleavy &amp; Hood, 1994</xref>, p. 9). NPM supposedly connotes progress toward something better, toward some now-mythical way of organizing to legitimize public sector agencies, which are now copying and mimicking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711433406">Gore, 1993</xref>) private-sector, deemed-worthier counterparts.</p>
<p>As NPM faded (at least) from scholarly favor, other possible “solutions” emerged to replace the recommendations and “fix” public administration. Calls for New Public Service (NPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711433406">Denhardt &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>) and Collaborative Public Management (CPM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711433406">Cooper, Bryer, &amp; Meek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711433406">McGuire, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary, Gerard, &amp; Bingham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399711433406">Thurmaier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095399711433406">Vigoda, 2002</xref>) emerged to replace market-centric paradigms and return the field to democratic values. Underlying NPS and CPM is not only a restoration of democratic values but also citizen-centric ideals and cooperation among key stakeholders to foster collaborative governance. No matter the paradigm chosen—NPM, NPS, CPM—looking to history sheds light on the realization that none are particularly new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711433406">Frederickson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711433406">Garrett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711433406">Green &amp; Hubbell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711433406">Schachter, 2007</xref>). Each school of thought relies on particular imagery, slogans, and sayings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711433406">Miller &amp; Simmons, 1998</xref>) to foster a point of view and to gain acceptance within popular scholarship and practice as the new “one best way” to operate. Although images and buzzwords might be new, <italic>roots</italic> of the imagery, and subsequent principles based on them, have traditions that sometimes are hidden. Because of the image-laden nature, an exploration of the paradigms through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard’s (1994)</xref> phases of the image becomes possible for further deconstructing and critically examining the paradigms’ usefulness.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article, though, is not a straightforward <italic>progression</italic> of NPM and CPM through each phase nor is the central purpose to rehash what other scholars have already done. While certainly the article details these movements, the purpose of this article is to explore how Baudrillard’s phases of the image can loop from Phase 4 back to Phase 1, and the constructs are mechanisms by which to show a loop rather than linearity. Essentially, objects in Phase 4 of the image can potentially loop back to Phase 1 if image-laden layers are peeled away to reveal <italic>historical</italic>, nostalgic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>) roots. In this case, public choice theory and networks, for example, are some of the historical underpinnings. Scholars can benefit from such an analysis by seeing possibilities for the phases to form a loop instead of only a linear progression, whereas practitioners might benefit from understanding historical underpinnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711433406">Spicer &amp; Terry, 1993</xref>) of so-called “new” management and governance suggestions.</p>
<p>This article outlines the (re)development of NPM and CPM (related movements are included under each rhetorical umbrella) through phases of the image. It begins with a brief overview of NPM, CPM, and related movements to set the foundation. Next, the article introduces Baudrillard’s phases of the image, showing how each construct fits within that framework. Finally, concluding comments and implications are offered.</p>

<title>Constructs in Brief</title>
<p>As government grew, people clamored for efficient service delivery and quick response. Images of government as too big, unwieldy, plagued by red tape, and filled with inefficient bureaucrats won the day (as powerful narratives tend to do); so calls for reform began. Turning toward the private sector seemed like a logical step to find recommendations for fixing a government structure depicted as broken. Calls came to reinvent government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711433406">Osborne &amp; Gaebler, 1992</xref>), whereby government should espouse values of competition, customer service, and enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711433406">Gore, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711433406">Osborne, 1993</xref>). Reinventing government became a rallying call of sorts, a panacea that could fix public administration’s woes. Lumped under this rhetorical umbrella were NPM, Total Quality Management, managerialism, entrepreneurial government, and market-based public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711433406">Frederickson &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711433406">Lynn, 1998a</xref>). An overarching theme of these frameworks was to replace what many saw as an ineffective, outdated form of government with a new emphasis placed on competition, market values, performance, outcomes, efficiency, and effectiveness as key drivers for success. For ease of use and explanation throughout the article, NPM will be employed as the term of choice when referring to these types of business-based interventions.</p>
<p>While ideas sound rhetorically pleasing—banish bureaucracy, flatten hierarchies, empower employees, please customers, deliver efficient and effective service, and so on—scholars have taken issue with NPM as a whole, calling it ephemeral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711433406">Lynn, 1998b</xref>), postmodern symbolic politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>), old wine in new bottles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711433406">Frederickson, 1996</xref>), limited in scope and application to public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711433406">Ventriss, 2000</xref>), and cause of unintended consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711433406">Hood &amp; Peters, 2004</xref>). While there are several versions of NPM—economic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711433406">Aucoin, 1990</xref>) versus managerial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711433406">Lapsley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711433406">Osborne &amp; Gaebler, 1992</xref>) for instance—the term here is understood to mean movements within public administration that push for government geared toward market competition based on businesslike values rather than democratic values.</p>
<p>Once NPM and its associated movements began to fall out of favor in theory (Box, Marshall, Reed, &amp; Reed, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>), CPM emerged as one paradigm to (re)solve those concerns and bring back collaboration among myriad actors, not just top-level executives as NPM suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711433406">Garrett, 2010</xref>). It should be noted that literature <italic>specifically</italic> regarding CPM as a paradigm and movement is nascent, especially compared with literature regarding NPM. Though perhaps not using the label explicitly, scholars call for increased citizen engagement in a democratic space while still wanting administrative efficiency. That said, CPM is used here as an umbrella term for movements favoring increased interaction with stakeholders (be it government to government, government to citizen, government to business, or citizen to government) and returning to traditional values such as justice and fairness.</p>
<p>CPM “describes the process of facilitating and operating in multiorganizational arrangements to solve problems that cannot be solved by single organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary et al., 2006</xref>, p. 7). Tied into CPM is participatory governance, which is “active involvement of citizens in government decision making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary et al., 2006</xref>, p. 7). Collaboration, by its nature, should include measures of participatory governance. To wit, working together in groups that include stakeholders from beyond the official government apparatus is a way to solve so-called wicked problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711433406">Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973</xref>). Moreover, CPM recognizes that public organizations operate within interwoven and interconnected spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711433406">Agranoff &amp; McGuire, 2003</xref>), thus making efficiency a problematic central tenet of public administration once more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0095399711433406">Waldo, 1948/2007</xref>). Despite problems of efficiency that naturally arise from collaborative spaces, collaboration is seen as desirable for making decisions rooted in complex interorganizational structures more effective because of the potential for large buy in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711433406">Agranoff &amp; McGuire, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399711433406">Zavattaro, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Curiously, O’Leary and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">2006</xref>), along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711433406">McGuire (2006)</xref>, use a word often associated with government reinvention—<italic>steering</italic>. O’Leary uses it in the context of participative governance, whereby “<italic>governance</italic> means to steer the process that influences decisions and actions within the private, public and civic sectors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary et al., 2006</xref>, p. 7, italics in original). McGuire envisions CPM with the “government as steering policy making and execution, and thus is the entity through which collaborative public management occurs and management activity is channeled” (p. 33). This seems to be more than a rhetorical slip. Purposeful use of the word steering does not separate the NPM and CPM paradigms; instead, the linkage blends them further together via a language game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711433406">Wittgenstein, 1953/2001</xref>) that could bring about more similarities than differences between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711433406">Garrett, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted, participatory governance is part of collaborative efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711433406">Denhardt &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>). Participatory governance means meaningfully devolving some control back to the public, making them involved stakeholders rather than passive observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711433406">Fung &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). The latest tools to (supposedly) foster participation are web-based social media. No attempt here is made to delve into the emerging literature regarding social media, but the mention is included because government embrace of the tools is increasing at all levels to introduce collaboration and transparency. That said, early research indicates that perhaps the tools are not as collaborative as imagined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711433406">Brainard &amp; Derrick-Mills, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711433406">Hand &amp; Ching, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711433406">Rishel, 2011</xref>), thus leaving practitioners grappling for ways of <italic>being</italic> collaborative rather than simply <italic>appearing</italic> collaborative.</p>

<title>Paradigms Through Phases of the Image</title>
<p>This theoretical exploration puts the development and embrace of NPM and CPM (and related movements) through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard’s (1994)</xref> phases of the image, showcasing the potential for a return to Phase 1 from Phase 4. Phases of the image proceed as follows: Phase 1, image reflects a profound reality; Phase 2, image masks or denatures profound reality; Phase 3, image masks absence of profound reality; and Phase 4, image has no relation to reality whatsoever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>). Phases indicate a progression from the tangible and real to symbolic and possibly imaginary (simulation, a copy without the original intact). “When the real is no longer what it was, nostalgia assumes its full meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>, p. 6). When images take over for substantive reality, people hearken to the <italic>past</italic> (nostalgia) to find that reality and import it into the simulation, attempting to return meaning and reality to the object. Baudrillard continues, writing that there is an “impossibility of rediscovering an <italic>absolute</italic> level of the real” (p. 19, italics added). What the rest of this article shows is not an absolute reemergence of the real within NPM and CPM; instead, historical and theoretical underpinnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711433406">Lapsley, 2008</xref>) of each construct, once remembered (nostalgia) under the layers of imagery and postulation, can aid scholars and practitioners in uncovering intended suggestions of NPM and CPM by looping objects back to what were once concrete positions.</p>
<p>To explain further, NPM and its associated reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711433406">Frederickson &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>) became slogans and rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>) to indicate a commitment to change rather than, in some cases, actual movement. As such, NPM became part of a language game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711433406">Wittgenstein, 1953/2001</xref>) easily eroded by its foundation on fuzzy constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711433406">Green &amp; Hubbell, 1996</xref>). At its core, NPM amounted to a rehashing and reshaping of classical organization theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711433406">Aucoin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711433406">Box, Marshall, Reed, &amp; Reed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>) that espoused efficiency and effectiveness. CPM, too, suffered criticisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711433406">Garrett, 2010</xref>) for being too much like NPM based on underlying historical traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399711433406">Stout, 2006</xref>). No matter the paradigm—NPM or CPM—foundations remain present yet hidden. Constructs are repackaged and represented as something new that practitioners should embrace to “fix” the broken system. When looked at closely, behind NPM are classic organization theories; for CPM, it is networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711433406">Imperial, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711433406">Jones, Hesterly, &amp; Borgatti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711433406">Provan &amp; Kenis, 2008</xref>).</p>

Authors from each approximate time frame are included within the table, though the list is by no means exhaustive, nor at the time periods rigid. Perhaps, though, a better depiction might be to place the table in a circular pattern, with Phase 4 coming back to Phase 1.</p>

<p>Baudrillard’s phases of the image usually show a progression, as there is no going back to reality once an object enters the realm of simulation. Attempts might be made to artificially impart reality, but that only serves to build and foster the simulation. As NPM and CPM morphed into the hyperreal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>), proponents of each grasped for reality by going back to, and finding justification within, classical administrative theories they meant to displace.

Instead, the paradigms competed for space in the theoretical and practical realms.</p>

<title>Phase 1: NPM as Reality</title>
<p>NPM traces roots back to the Classical School of public administration theory as well as new institutional economics and managerialism in the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399711433406">1</xref></sup> New institutional economics centers on ideas such as public choice and principal-agent theories. These schools of thought emphasize interactions with key stakeholders and transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>). The rise of managerialism in the public sector came “in the tradition of the international scientific management movement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>, p. 6). Scientific management proponents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood (1991)</xref> continues, advocated principles such as portable management expertise, discretion to achieve results, and measurement of organizational outputs. Sometimes the value systems conflicted within the two schools of thought (decentralization vs. centralization, management vs. entrepreneurialism, control vs. delegation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711433406">Aucoin, 1990</xref>], etc.), leading to troubles implementing and interpreting NPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711433406">Aucoin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>). Once concerns were reconciled, prescriptions had a chance for implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711433406">Aucoin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In this phase, NPM reflected its intention to help and develop Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711433406">Arellano-Gault, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711433406">Manning, 2001</xref>) based on the early success of NPM in England and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>). Though it was around the 1970s and 1980s when NPM made its appearance in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711433406">Barzelay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711433406">Hood, 1995</xref>), people can look to ancient civilizations to find forerunners and precursors to modern-day NPM—“tax farming, venality and market-driven financial management” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711433406">Ma, 2003</xref>, p. 436). To illustrate, tax farming involved privatizing the tax collection function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711433406">Ma, 2003</xref>), and privatization played a key role in today’s reinvention/managerial movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of NPM in the first phase of the image—to develop and foster organizations—scholars study NPM’s effectiveness in a variety of fields. NPM is explored in nonprofit capacity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711433406">Bishop, 2007</xref>), education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711433406">Bottery, 1996</xref>), civil service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711433406">Christensen &amp; Lægreid, 1999</xref>), and public management in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711433406">Hood &amp; Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711433406">Riccucci, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399711433406">Terry, 1998</xref>). As NPM gained acceptance in praxis, scholars turned critical eyes to the construct, moving NPM into Phase 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095399711433406">
<title>Phase 2: NPM as Masking Reality</title>
<p>As NPM came into practice and prominence, it opened itself up for interpretations that take it beyond its original intent to help OECD countries. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711433406">Barzelay (2002)</xref> notes, NPM prescriptions acquired different meanings as they came into the public administration realm. Acquiring different meanings is emblematic of an object moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2. In Phase 2, the image masks a profound reality. Put differently, the image begins to subsume reality. NPM tenets suffered the same fate. Even though NPM prescriptions were embraced at practical levels, “the initial shape of the Westminster reforms that inspired the term will eventually be disfigured in the course of political succession” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711433406">Lynn, 1998a</xref>, p. 230).</p>
<p>As public administration as a field changed in the 1960s and 1970s, several schools of thought emerged to provide new theoretical directions. Some ideas included New Public Administration, communitarianism, and discourse theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>). Public administration itself seemed to be having an identity crisis—What are we? What do we want to be? What is the role of the administrator? Of the state? Scholars who developed New Public Administration after heeding Dwight Waldo’s call wanted change—change from social injustices to a more proactive government intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711433406">Frederickson, 1996</xref>). New Public Administration was intended as a paradigm change in the field, as was NPM. NPM caught on further and built wide support by using catchy slogans and images to mask reality—that perhaps bureaucratic interventions are not entirely bad and could solve government problems when operated effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711433406">Frederickson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, implanting NPM values into public administration erodes democratic values (Box et al., 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711433406">deLeon &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>), a critique seemingly ignored or forgotten when accepting what sounds better than “red tape.” Such language reoriented the field of Public Administration (PA), masking reality of original government intentions such as democracy, justice, and fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711433406">Ingraham &amp; Rosenbloom, 1990</xref>). As NPM gained favor, traditional ideals, values, and goals were pushed further from the fore.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In many respects, what are being conducted in the name of the NPM are in reality a redefinition of the role and purpose of government and, concomitantly, the emerging importance of market and instrumental values in ordering our political and social affairs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711433406">Ventriss, 2000</xref>, pp. 503-504)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence, NPM shifted from its original intention to an image-laden construct, masking reality in public administration. Writing emerged attempting to link values of social justice and equity to a certain kind of NPM, labeled <italic>economic-NPM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711433406">Arellano-Gault, 2010</xref>), further showing how constructs of networking, tradition, and public management began meshing together.</p>

<sec id="section5-0095399711433406">
<title>Phase 3: NPM and CPM Compete for Image Space</title>
<p>In Phase 3, NPM begins to mask the absence of profound reality, paving the way for CPM to emerge within the discipline. Here, NPM as a tool blurs further the lines between public and private organizations. NPM and related reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711433406">Frederickson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>) masked the absence of a profound reality in public administration by importing not only the rhetoric but also the values of business into the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711433406">deLeon &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>). Such changes are direct extensions and progressions from NPM in Phase 2. As public administration searched for a new identity amid NPM fervor, CPM was able to come about and further mask the absence of profound reality—give another lens through which to view principles of public administration.</p>
<p>NPM changed the rhetoric and practice of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711433406">Kelly, 2005</xref>). In Phase 3, NPM’s traction is solidified and accepted as an improved way of doing business (words chosen purposefully). Critiques of these business-based practices masked the absence of profound reality in public administration—what values and principles <italic>ought</italic> to serve as main guiding posts? If NPM was indeed nominated to paradigm status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711433406">Lynn, 1998a</xref>), then its job in this state <italic>should have been</italic> to mask this absence of profound reality by removing and replacing signs of public administration’s old reality, paving the way for a new reality. NPM’s reliance on business practices and its widespread public adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711433406">Gore, 1993</xref>) forced public administration into a sort of identity crisis. Do administrators want traditional values or business values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711433406">Box et al., 2001</xref>)? What value system and practices are “better”? As administrative practitioners and scholars sorted out these types of questions, NPM kept gaining acceptance and furthered its role as masking the absence of profound reality within public administration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711433406">Lynn (1998b)</xref> decries the celebration of NPM in the literature, noting that the construct actually praises
<disp-quote>
<p>a withering away of “direct bureaucracy” in favor of a “hallow state,” “virtual organizations,” and networked organizations, a shift of power from bureaucrats to citizens, a rebirth of community and of democratic accountability, the realization that incentives and competition are the guarantors of growth and efficiency when public resources are scarce. (p. 109)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The language is that of empowerment and progress yet inadvertently (or perhaps deliberately?) takes power away from citizens and puts it in the hands of newly defined customers and managers. Customers, the prominent rhetorical construction of government-service users in market models of governance, choose between competing government entities, leaving behind the one that does not meet his or her needs. Construction of citizens as customers is problematic, as it “prefers a government that responds to the short-term self-interests of isolated individuals (customers) rather than one that supports the pursuit of public interests publicly defined through a deliberative process (citizens)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711433406">deLeon &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>, p. 91). According to National Performance Review guidelines, government agencies should “set a goal of providing customer services <italic>equal to the best in business</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711433406">Gore, 1993</xref>, p. 44, italics in original). Business values, when viewed through the lens of better governance, mask the absence of profound reality—administrators and people no longer know what to believe so will naturally hinge onto the powerful symbols, as symbols often are easier to understand than facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>As NPM criticism mounted, the door opened for CPM to emerge as a cure for NPM’s ills. CPM, naturally, has collaboration at its core—bringing together key stakeholders to solve problems. Usually, CPM scholarship details government-to-government collaboration, leaving citizens out of the picture (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711433406">Cooper et al., 2006</xref>). Calls for collaboration in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095399711433406">Vigoda, 2002</xref>), as well as more service, less business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711433406">Denhardt &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>), saw CPM recommendations competing with those from NPM for prominence and acceptance within public administration—further masking public administration’s reality. Each movement relied on its own symbols to push a platform. NPM and CPM ideals, while jockeying for intellectual and practical space, masked the absence of a profound reality in public administration by <italic>both</italic> pushing out one outdated paradigm for another, newer, flashier, better one. “<italic>Public administration has never adequately come to grips with the problem of finding a legitimate place for itself in the American scheme of democratic governance”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711433406">McSwite, 1996</xref>, p. 198, italics in original). Therefore, competing paradigms emerge, further leaving the field grasping for identity.</p>
<p>Peeling back layers, NPM’s tenet of efficiency is technical efficiency, whereas CPM’s call for efficiency in networked spaces mirrors scholars imploring collaboration and public values in the name of substantive efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711433406">Rutgers &amp; van der Meer, 2010</xref>). Efficiency as a core value in public administration once again competed for space, simply under different monikers.</p>

<sec id="section6-0095399711433406">
<title>Phase 4: NPM and CPM as Simulation</title>
<p>Phase 4 is the final progression of the image from concrete to simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>). Phase 4 objects have little or no connection to reality. Forgetfulness and emptiness set in when the image itself becomes the powerful driver, rendering the referent unnecessary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard (1994)</xref> argues that imagery has replaced substance in several arenas, including religion, science fiction, and even history. With NPM pegged as symbolic politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>), its image-laden properties were put on full display. CPM still danced around NPM in Phase 3; however, in Phase 4, the two constructs shared more similarities than different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711433406">Christensen &amp; Lægreid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711433406">Garrett, 2010</xref>), turning them both into simulations of their original intentions—to help OECD countries and to replace market-centric models as the prevailing, people-centric paradigm in the field, respectively. Peeling back layers of each construct reveals deep-rooted historical traditions often cast aside in favor of flashy slogans. The historical roots show how phases of the image create a loop, rather than linear progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711433406">Christensen, Lægreid, Roness, &amp; Røvik, 2007</xref>), when delving into the prominent symbols and rhetoric. Extended, the implication of this is twofold: (a) phases of the image might not always be linear and (b) NPM and CPM can be useful to public administration when understood in <italic>historical</italic> context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711433406">Moe &amp; Gilmour, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer (2004)</xref> traces the history of ideas and finds several of NPM’s tenets have roots in purposive associations, “a collective enterprise that is driven by some set of substantive ends or purposes” (pp. 353-354) with a manager leading the charge and efforts toward overall goals of the state or organization. Purposive associations, as Spicer further explains, also have no qualms with exerting power when necessary to achieve their prescribed ends. Putting the reinventing movement through this purposive association lens, Spicer reveals more similarities than differences between the two. To wit, reinventors advocate steering rather than rowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711433406">Osborne &amp; Gaebler, 1992</xref>), with the intention that everyone should steer the proverbial ship in the same direction, toward purposive, mission-driven ends. (As noted above, some CPM scholars use the same steering wording, playing up the language game; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711433406">Wittgenstein, 1953/2001</xref>.) Recognizing the history of ideas is important, as reforms such as NPM and reinvention spring up “again and again as if they were entirely new and unrelated to any intellectual traditions in our past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>, p. 359).</p>
<p>Developmental history of NPM in the United States traces foundations to the Progressive Era and early public administration theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>). Taylor’s scientific management, along with the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, was the major theoretical driver of that time to heed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0095399711433406">Wilson’s (1887)</xref> call of making the business of government less unbusinesslike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>). Scientific management and the Bureau had the goal of efficiency at their cores. “Science was regarded as the method of understanding and controlling changes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711433406">Lee, 1995</xref>, p. 539). Managers, who came to prominence in this time to control the political spread of corruption, relied on the science of administration to cut out waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711433406">Arnold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711433406">Gruening, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711433406">Lee, 1995</xref>). Scientific ways of looking at organization were essentially performance measurements examining what is being done and how efficiently. Performance measures today, despite challenges, aim at achieving similar ends.</p>
<p>When NPM movements became so powerful, the risk was completely subsuming and forgetting public administration’s intellectual foundations. Business-based models of governance further blur lines between public and private sectors, and “the reasonable certainties of governmental administration are becoming uncertainties with decisions based more upon immediate political expediency and <italic>symbolic action</italic> rather than upon principles of effective governmental administration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711433406">Moe &amp; Gilmour, 1995</xref>, p. 142, italics added). NPM prescriptions eroded traditional public administration values in favor of corporate ones driven by imagery and symbols rather than practicable prescriptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711433406">Ventriss (2000)</xref> sums up the problem:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>If this assertion is correct, the more delicate (and troubling) issue is whether we are now in the midst of a public philosophy that promotes, for better or for worse, the mechanomorphic equation of human values with economic values, all for the purpose of achieving a view that supposedly integrates such factors as performance and statecraft.</italic> (p. 505, italics in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Phase 4, NPM prescriptions became a set of rhetoric rather than a set of principles. For example, with emphasis on measuring performance, there is risk that those supposedly rational tools become mythologized and symbolic within the organization. As such, “ritual aspects will be central, and controlling the evaluation will be important for strengthening legitimacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711433406">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>, p. 145). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox (1996)</xref> skewers the reinvention movement as postmodern symbolic politics, rooting his argument in postmodern changes in society, including production to consumption. People consume the latest and greatest products or ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1998</xref>), and NPM morphed into a commodity (trainers exist, consultants abound, etc.) sold as a cure-all. Through its commodification, NPM subjected itself to hyperreality, revealing its mythical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711433406">Christensen &amp; Lægreid, 2006</xref>). “Once a sign takes up permanent residence in hyperreality, any kind of reality which maybe called empirical loses influence over it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>, p. 257). Original OECD prescriptions became unimportant and unnecessary for NPM’s practical success. NPM and reinvention’s mantra of “works better and costs less” are akin, in Fox’s perception, to advertising slogans selling a product. Through internal inconsistencies, coupled with its rise to hyperreal image maker, NPM finds itself in Phase 4 of the image. Phase 4 means simulacrum, and this is the problem Fox elucidates—empty signifiers that guide the paradigm’s acceptance and implementation. As an attempt to overcome the perceived practical and theoretical shortcomings of NPM, CPM emerged, as was showcased in Phase 3. The trouble, though, is that CPM began in Phase 4 to <italic>blend</italic> with rather than eradicate NPM; such a shift was present in the whole-of-government approach to reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711433406">Christensen &amp; Lægreid, 2006</xref>). Within the whole-of-government approach, there is a recommendation to combine NPM practices with collaborative practices to, ideally, achieve a more well-rounded reform than each can provide on its own. Networks and collaboration alone have yet to transform the workings of public administration and have not delivered the desired democratic panacea described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711433406">Bingham &amp; O’Leary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711433406">Nickel, 2007</xref>). Therefore, constructs competed for image-driven spaces rather than policy-driven spaces, turning both into simulations of their former normative roots.</p>
<p>The constructs’ blending in Phase 4 shows the ability of regression within phases of the image, which naturally proceed step by step. Regression comes because core recommendations in each construct are linked to classical schools of public administration thought characteristics in Phase 1. While there is supposedly progress to something better, core elements of NPM are traced back to ideas such as scientific management and pure rationality, though modern interpretation differences regarding politics and rewards exist between the theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711433406">Schachter, 2007</xref>). NPM tenets are seen as “all hype and no substance . . . From this viewpoint, the advent of new managerialism has changed little, apart from the language in which senior public ‘managers’ speak in public. Underneath, all the old problems and weaknesses remain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood, 1991</xref>, p. 9). Furthermore, NPM’s “new” calls for efficiency have not only historical roots in public administration but also in Aristotle’s writings as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711433406">Rutgers &amp; van der Meer, 2010</xref>). In other words, underlying image-laden statements and platitudes, though, remains a solid public administration foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711433406">Moe &amp; Gilmour, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711433406">Rosenbloom, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711433406">Taylor, 1911/2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711433406">Taylor (1911/2010)</xref> advocates efficiency within the organization. NPM tenets do the same via performance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711433406">Bouckaert, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0095399711433406">Yang &amp; Hsieh, 2007</xref>), while placing distinct differences between management and workers. Taylor urges that “accurate records are kept of the amount of work done by each man and of his efficiency” (p. 23)—an early call for performance measurement. Modern-day managers “would subscribe to the principle of scientific decision making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711433406">Locke, 1982</xref>, p. 15) driven by constant data collection while recognizing the limits of rationality. Science, then, replaces manager’s gut reactions, past experience, hearsay, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711433406">Locke, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711433406">Taylor, 1911/2010</xref>). Similar parallels emerge between NPM and classic theories, including job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711433406">Locke, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711433406">Taylor, 1911/2010</xref>) and constrained/tempered humanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711433406">Karasek, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711433406">Ramos, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399711433406">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711433406">Taylor, 1911/2010</xref>). As scholars began chipping away at tenets of NPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711433406">Herzog &amp; Abel, 2009</xref>), image-laden properties, as well as current-day misinterpretations of classical public administration theory, became clearer. Each rehashing of ideas, presented as something new, pushed NPM further into simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>CPM, too, has its own classical roots, thus broadening the case for closing the phases loop. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711433406">Nickel (2007)</xref> notes, “there is nothing remarkably new in the current discussion of network governance except that their critical theory has become a legitimizer of that which they initially criticized” (p. 200). Underlying notions of CPM can be traced back to John Dewey and Mary Parker Follett (among others), interpreted through Chester Barnard, Dwight Waldo, and more, then again reinterpreted by contemporary scholars including Mary Timney, Ralph Hummel, David Farmer, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399711433406">Stout, 2006</xref>). Forming networks dates back to the early founding of America, but the language surrounding the embrace and resurgence of collective networks became stronger when failures within the NPM-driven market became more pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711433406">Bozeman, 2002</xref>). <italic>Citizen governance</italic> (another name for collaborative networks and participatory governance noted above) is itself a postmodern ideal, as “the term represents no actual social or political practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711433406">Miller &amp; Nunemaker, 1999</xref>, p. 303). Thus is highlighted the image-laden properties of citizen governance as a construct. Despite the criticism, scholars call for a return to democratic values within either the constitutional framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399711433406">Rosenbloom, 1987</xref>) or a service-oriented one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711433406">Denhardt &amp; Denhardt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary et al., 2006</xref>). Calls for network governance, citizen governance, and CPM hinge on rhetorical rather than practical promises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711433406">Lippmann, 1927/2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711433406">Fox &amp; Miller, 1997</xref>). Despite an entire issue of <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> in 2006 dedicated explicitly to CPM, not much of that work extended thinking in the area, left out the role of citizens, left unexplored collaboration in the policy process, and focused too much on civic engagement and networks rather than genuine collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711433406">Bingham &amp; O’Leary, 2006</xref>). A disconnect emerged and both constructs competed for rhetorical space. Collaborative prescriptions are supposed to bring back public interest but often are symbolic as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711433406">McSwite, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>NPM is an image-laden, sometimes “vacuous” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711433406">Ventriss, 2000</xref>, p. 506) construct that became the guiding light of public administration for the last couple of decades. Really, NPM has been around much longer in other forms such as public choice theory, economic theory, and other classical views of public administration. With NPM’s emergence and acceptance, scholars turned critical eyes toward the construct, its origins, and impacts, paving the way for another “new” paradigm to take over. CPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711433406">O’Leary et al., 2006</xref>) and its associated reforms emerged as the latest incarnation of network governance and as a replacement for the theoretically maligned NPM.</p>
<p>Tenets of each paradigm jockeyed for space in the theoretical and practical realms. Collaboration worked in practice but only when social constructivist elements were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711433406">Bryer, 2009</xref>). In other words, citizens and administrators act and react in collaborative networks depending on how each side <italic>perceives</italic> the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711433406">Bryer, 2009</xref>). Similar to NPM bringing about adversarial and distinct relationships between management and the workers, CPM does the same between administrators and citizens. Each paradigm, then, floats about in a hyperreal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711433406">Miller &amp; Fox, 2007</xref>) situation, clamoring for acceptance. They purport to be each different, yet they are theoretically linked via similarities between paradigms and to historical roots of public administration. Today, public organizations could go down several paths regarding NPM—full embrace, full rejection, or hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711433406">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>). Though no matter the path chosen (the authors do not advocate for one), symbolic and historical aspects always will be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711433406">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>), thus giving grounding to exploring the constructs through phases of the image—an image-based framework.</p>
<p>The purpose of the article is to show how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711433406">Baudrillard’s (1994)</xref> phases of the image leave room for regression instead of only progression. To achieve this end, the NPM and CPM constructs were employed, tracing each through phases of the image before peeling back images to reveal historical theoretical roots. When NPM lost connection to its original intention of helping OECD countries develop, scholars turned toward exploring impacts and implications of the movement. NPM prescriptions are tied to classic public administration theories, though favored anachronisms were empty imagery akin to advertising speak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711433406">Fox, 1996</xref>). CPM emerged as an antidote to the highly marketized model, so the two found themselves competing for space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711433406">McSwite, 1996</xref>) in Phase 3 of the image. In Phase 4, both constructs meshed together when theoretical layers were pulled back—each appearing as simulations of original intentions found in nostalgic roots. Thus, when each construct sheds image-driven precepts, scholars and practitioners alike can see (a) the constructs simply rehash, rather than extend, what has already been done in the academy, (b) historical associations within public administration are important to remember when implementing a tool, and (c) objects can perhaps regain some connection to reality when examined through a nostalgic lens. Explorations such as this can possibly help public administration scholars and practitioners move toward the type of democratic discourse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711433406">Miller and Fox (2007)</xref> envision.</p>
<p>Implications shed light on NPM and CPM as constructs that can mask and distort public administration realities (plural) as well as further hollow the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399711433406">Terry, 2005</xref>). Practitioners and theoreticians applying or studying each should keep classical roots in mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711433406">Spicer, 2004</xref>) when using recommendations. Administrators should not shy away from embracing NPM or CPM, but they should recognize both simply as tools with natural limits. Tools cannot fix all problems. Sometimes, multiple tools are needed.</p>

<p>I should note that scholars accept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711433406">Hood’s (1991)</xref> article as the “start” of New Public Management as a paradigm in public administration. In that same article, though, Hood extends the logical foundations further into history, and other authors have done the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711433406">Lapsley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711433406">Ma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711433406">Schachter, 2007</xref>). Therefore, I use the historical associations—NPM as developing Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries—as the beginning, as Phase 1.</p>
