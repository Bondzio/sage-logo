<abstract>
<p>This article investigates how sensitive relative worth of product requirements in quality function deployment (QFD) is to different rating scales and/or worth-calculation methods used. The two most popular rating scales and worth-calculation scales are identified from the data of 295 QFD matrices published in conference and journal articles (called empirical QFD), and the sensitivity of relative worth in these empirical QFD (measured by probabilities of large changes of relative worth) is studied by switching rating scales and/or worth-calculation methods. The results suggest that relative worth does not significantly change when a worth-calculation method is fixed. In contrast, if a worth-calculation method is changed, large changes may occur. These large changes are more likely in QFD relationship matrices with small numbers of rows and columns less than or equal to six. These results may imply that designers need to commit to a worth-calculation method when they use information from QFD to make their design decisions. If designers commit to a worth-calculation method, any design decisions made based on relative worth are less likely to be impacted from the use of a rating scale.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quality function deployment (QFD) is a popular design tool in concurrent engineering and product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12442411">Clausing, 1993</xref>). Among many QFDs, “House of Quality,” or QFD I, is one of the most popular QFDs. One of its objectives is to map customer requirements (CRs) (or customer needs and customer attributes) to product requirements (PRs) (or engineering metrics and engineering characteristics) and to calculate their relative worth. A large relative worth indicates that a PR is important in satisfying CRs. The QFD in the left-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12442411">Figure 1</xref> is an example of QFD I that consists of nine components: CRs, importance of CRs, PRs, a relationship matrix, worth of PRs, relative worth of PRs, target values of PRs, a correlation matrix, and a competitive benchmarking assessment. In a QFD relationship matrix, degrees of correlations between CRs and PRs are first assessed using symbols representing categorical scales, such as None (blank), Small (Δ), Medium (O), and Large (<inline-graphic id="img1-1063293X12442411" xlink:href="10.1177_1063293X12442411-img1.tif"/>), and then the categorical scales are converted to numerical rating scales. Examples of rating scales are linear 1-2-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12442411">Akao et al., 1990</xref>) and 1-3-5 scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12442411">Mitsufuji et al., 1990</xref>) and exponential 1-2-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12442411">Maekawa and Ohta, 1990</xref>) and 1-3-9 scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12442411">Clausing, 1993</xref>). When the linear 1-3-5 scale is used, Δ (small correlation) is converted to 1, O (medium correlation) to 3, and <inline-graphic id="img2-1063293X12442411" xlink:href="10.1177_1063293X12442411-img2.tif"/> (large correlation) to 5. Similarly, when the exponential 1-3-9 scale is used, Δ is converted to 1, O to 3, and <inline-graphic id="img3-1063293X12442411" xlink:href="10.1177_1063293X12442411-img3.tif"/> to 9.</p>

</fig>
<p>Once categorical scales are converted to rating scales, worth of PRs is calculated from importance of CRs and ratings in the relationship matrix. Two QFDs in the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12442411">Figure 1</xref> illustrate examples of worth-calculation methods called in this article as <italic>weighted sum</italic> (WS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12442411">Akao et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12442411">Mitsufuji et al., 1990</xref>) or <italic>allocated sum</italic> (AS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X12442411">Lyman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12442411">Maekawa and Ohta, 1990</xref>). In the WS method, worth of a PR is defined as a weighted sum of ratings in the corresponding column of the QFD relationship matrix, where importance of CRs is the weight. For example, when the linear 1-3-5 rating scale is used, the worth of the PR<sub>1</sub> is 51, which is calculated as 9 × 5 + 6 × 1 = 51. In the AS method, ratings in a row of a relationship matrix indicate contributions of each PR in satisfying a CR; thus, importance of a CR is allocated in the row proportional to these contributions. Then, the allocated importance in each column is added to find the worth of each PR. For example, when the linear 1-3-5 rating scale is used, the importance of CR<sub>1</sub>, 9 is allocated to PR<sub>1</sub> and PR<sub>2</sub> proportional to the degrees of correlations (or contributions). The importance of CR<sub>1</sub> allocated to PR<sub>1</sub> is 4.5 because 9 × (5/(5 + 5)) = 4.5. Similarly, the importance of CR<sub>3</sub> allocated to PR<sub>1</sub> is 1 because 6 × (1/(1 + 5)) = 1. The worth of PR<sub>1</sub> is the sum of the allocated worth 5.5 (= 4.5 + 1).</p>
<p>Once the worth is obtained, the relative worth is calculated by normalizing the worth of PRs, as shown in the two QFDs in the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12442411">Figure 1</xref>. The relative worth of PRs (hereafter, simply referred to “relative worth”) differs when different rating scales and worth-calculation methods are used. For example, in comparing the relative worth in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12442411">Figure 1</xref>, relative worth decreases from 0.24 to 0.20 for PR<sub>1</sub>, decreases from 0.40 to 0.36 for PR2<sub>1</sub>, increases from 0.25 to 0.29 for PR<sub>3</sub>, and increases from 0.12 to 0.18 for PR<sub>4</sub>. Thus, the <italic>change in relative worth</italic> (hereafter, referred to “change”) may be used to measure sensitivity of relative worth due to switching rating scale, worth-calculation method, or both.</p>
<p>Although many research projects have proposed improvements of QFD and integrations of QFD in product design and development (a parallel deployment of multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X12442411">Prasad, 2000</xref>), an integration of cost optimization with QFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X12442411">Iranmanesh et al., 2005</xref>), an integration of QFD in the strategic planning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X12442411">Killen et al., 2005</xref>), an application of the axiomatic design method in QFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12442411">Goncalves-Coelho et al., 2005</xref>), a use of analytic hierarchy process to improve calculations of CR importance in QFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12442411">Yung et al., 2006</xref>), a use of the interpretive structural model to incorporate interdependency of CRs in QFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X12442411">Lin et al., 2006</xref>), an integration of QFD in perceptual evaluation of system component concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12442411">Takai and Ishii, 2006</xref>), and an application of the gray theory to improve calculations of CR importance in QFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12442411">Chen et al., 2011</xref>)), few studies investigate the sensitivity of relative worth on rating scales and/or worth-calculation methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12442411">Olewnik and Lewis (2008)</xref> select an 8 × 9 QFD from a conference article, use simulation to randomize rating scales while fixing worth-calculation method to the WS method, and show that the averages of relative worth do not significantly depend on the choice of rating scales. In contrast to the past study, this article investigates impacts of both rating scales and worth-calculation methods on relative worth in a large number of QFDs published in journal and conference articles (hereafter, called “empirical QFDs”). The empirical QFDs are analyzed to find two most popular rating scales and two most popular relative worth-calculation methods, and to calculate relative frequencies of degrees of correlations (e.g. None, Small, Medium, and Large) in the most popular categorical scale. Then, rating scales and/or worth-calculation methods in the empirical QFDs are switched in order to study sensitivity of relative worth on rating scales and worth-calculation methods. The remainder of this article consists of the following sections: section “Empirical QFD analysis” presents an analysis of the empirical QFDs, section “Sensitivity analysis” analyzes sensitivity of relative worth in the empirical QFDs, and section “Conclusion” concludes the article.</p>

<title>Empirical QFD analysis</title>
<p>To study sensitivity of relative worth, 295 empirical QFDs are collected from conference and journal articles. The sizes of these 295 QFD relationship matrices are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1063293X12442411">Figure 8</xref> in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1063293X12442411">Appendix 1</xref>: the minimum number of rows is one (1 × 2 matrix), and the minimum number of columns is two (1 × 2, 2 × 2, and 4 × 2 matrices); the maximum number of rows is 45 (45 × 14 and 45 × 26 matrices), and the maximum number of columns is 59 (13 × 59 and 34 × 59 matrices). Among these QFDs, 283 QFDs are complete in the sense that they contain all the information necessary to calculate the worth of PRs; that is, CRs and their importance, PRs, and correlations in relationship matrices.</p>
<sec id="section3-1063293X12442411">
<title>Rating scales</title>
<p>Among 283 complete QFDs, rating scales are specified in 274 QFDs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12442411">Figure 2</xref> compares relative frequencies of rating scales used in these QFDs. Ignoring the None category that corresponds to 0 in all scales, a rating scale is defined as a linear scale when the rating increases linearly such as 1-3-5 and defined as an exponential scale when the rating increases exponentially such as 1-3-9. Linear scales are used in 15% of QFDs (41 out of 274), and exponential scales are used in 83% of QFDs (228 out of 274). Other rating scale used are 1-3-10 in one QFD, 1-3-5-9 in one QFD, 1-3-6-9 in two QFDs, and ±(1-3-5-9), in which both positive and negative rating scales are used in the QFD relationship matrix, in one QFD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12442411">Figure 2</xref> further summarizes different types of linear and exponential rating scales used in the empirical QFDs. Among linear rating scales, 1-3-5 is the most popular scale, appearing in 49% of linear rating scales (20 out of 41). Among exponential rating scales, 1-3-9 is the most popular scale, appearing in 97% of the exponential rating scales (222 out of 228). Three-point rating scales are the most popular scales, used both in linear and exponential rating scales.</p>

<p>Sensitivity is defined in this article as the probability of observing <italic>large changes in relative worth</italic> (hereafter, referred to “large change”) when switching rating scale, worth-calculation method, or both. A large change is defined as a change smaller than or equal to −0.1 (≤−0.1) or larger than or equal to +0.1 (≥0.1). A <italic>probability of large change</italic> is defined as the proportion of large changes in a distribution of changes. In the relative frequency distribution shown by the solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12442411">Figure 5</xref>, this probability corresponds to a sum of area <italic>a</italic> (under the curve and below −0.1) and area <italic>b</italic> (under the curve and above +0.1). In the cumulative frequency distribution shown by the solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12442411">Figure 5</xref>, this probability corresponds to the proportion of data <italic>a</italic> plus <italic>b</italic>. As the dashed curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12442411">Figure 5</xref> indicate, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are smaller if changes are concentrated near zero; that is, a relative frequency distribution is tighter, and a cumulative frequency distribution is steeper. Thus, small probability of large change is used to assess that a QFD is less sensitive to the switching of rating scale and/or worth-calculation method.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article investigated how sensitive relative worth of PRs was to the use of different rating scales and/or worth-calculation methods. In this study, 295 QFDs published in conference and journal articles (called empirical QFDs) were analyzed in order to identify the two most popular rating scales (linear 1-3-5 and exponential 1-3-9), two most popular worth-calculation methods (WS and AS), and relative frequencies of categories in three-point rating scales (e.g. None, Small, Medium, and Large). A large change of relative worth was defined as a change smaller than or equal to −0.1 (≤−0.1) or larger than or equal to +0.1 (≥0.1). A probability of large change was defined as the proportion of large changes in a distribution of changes.</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis of the empirical QFDs indicates that relative worth is less likely to significantly change if worth-calculation method is fixed to either to AS or WS. This result may imply that designers need to commit to either AS or WS method when they use information from QFD to make their design decisions. If designers commit to either AS or WS method, any design decisions made based on relative worth are less likely to be impacted from the use of different rating scales. In contrast, if designers do not commit to a worth-calculation method and change between AS and WS, relative worth may significantly change and the optimum design decision may differ. This is particularly true when rating scale is changed simultaneously with worth-calculation method. Furthermore, large changes are more likely in QFDs with small numbers of rows and/or columns (≤6). Thus, when designers use QFDs with small numbers of rows and/or columns, they need to carefully choose and commit to rating scales and worth-calculation methods.</p>
