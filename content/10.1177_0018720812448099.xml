<abstract>
<p>In this commentary, the author reflects on the articles chosen for the special section on communications analysis. These articles problematize communication and raise an interesting set of questions for both human factors and communication scholars to ponder. In the end, both sets of scholars seek the same goal: How do we better examine communication to improve it? Problematizing communication requires scholars to challenge their fundamental assumptions about the phenomenon as well as to tease out the distinctions of methodological approaches typically used by both human factors and communication scholars. Human factors scholars tend to favor forms of communication in which technology or task roles control who can communicate and how. Communication scholars tend to favor contexts in which information flows more freely with fewer explicit restrictions. Creating opportunities to collaborate in research on the communication process may create the best understanding of technology that can better serve our understanding of communication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Communication, a collective activity that requires coordination in both content and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812448099">Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812448099">Macmillan, Entin, &amp; Serfaty, 2004</xref>), is required in technology-enhanced environments when information is distributed and actors must problem solve or coordinate tasks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812448099">Keyton and Beck (2010)</xref> have argued that there is significant conceptual overlap between a macrocognitive frame and a communication (discipline) perspective as well as significant distinctions. For example, the former emphasizes shared mental models, whereas a communicative analysis emphasizes message exchange among communicators and message interdependence as an artifact of shared meanings and shared mental models. Both human factors and communication scholars are interested in what human actors say, and both assume that messages actors send are goal directed. Finally, both seek to uncover patterns of talk that might prove to be effective or ineffective. This special issue on communication analysis raises an interesting set of questions for both human factors and communication scholars to ponder. In the end, both seek the same goal: How do we better examine communication to improve it?</p>

<title>Problematizing Communication</title>
<p>Human factors scholars are beginning to problematize the role of communication in dyads and in team cognition processes, and this special issue is an example of that research.</p>
<p>Problematizing communication requires scholars to challenge their fundamental assumptions about the phenomenon as well as to tease out the distinctions of methodological approaches. As a result, scholars look “in between” the spaces among conceptualizations and operationalizations rather than making broad generalizations. The articles accepted for publication in this special issue represent diverse views of <italic>communication</italic> from diverse disciplinary perspectives and, in this way, problematize communication for readers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812448099">Cavicchio and Poesio (2012)</xref> take up the challenge of helping us to identify and understand the influence of emotion on cooperative communication in dyads. In this study, communication was examined by tapping into cooperation. Specifically, when participants added more information than what was asked for, cooperation was achieved. Participants’ facial expressions (i.e., nonverbal communication) and heart rate varied among conditions. Not surprisingly to any of us who get frustrated, higher heart rate was associated with lower levels of cooperation. Furthermore, facial expressions in the form of smiles were related to cooperation. Analyses suggest that the combination of a smiling facial expression and lower heart rate is best for predicting cooperation, whereas heart rate is a better index of not cooperating.</p>
<p>These findings, I believe, are secondary to the simple coding scheme the authors developed for facial expressions. Others should be able to reliably replicate their coding scheme, and this scheme could help researchers focus on when, and potentially why, actors communicate cooperatively and examine whether smiling is a precursor to or an outcome of cooperation. The next step would be to develop facial recognition technology that can identify the range of facial expressions and to move the task into more normative instruction-giving/instruction-receiving situations. Communication scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812448099">Robin Nabi (2010)</xref> argues for taking a discrete rather than dimensional emotion perspective if the goal is to link emotion with cognitive appraisal to understand how actors’ goals lead to action readiness.</p>
<p>Examining a greater diversity of emotions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448099">Calix, Javadpour, and Knapp (2012)</xref> provide an automated methodology for detecting emotion from text and speech features. This study, however, focused on recorded single-actor or scripted multiactor situations. Interestingly, analyses revealed that positive rather than negative emotions were easier to detect. With more than half of sentences identified as neutral and deleted from further analyses, the text-based accumulated sentiment composition features were more effective than other classification methodologies for analyzing the five emotion classes of happy, sad, angry, surprised, and afraid. When moving from text to speech (in this case, episodes of <italic>Grey’s Anatomy</italic>), however, short sentences (three or fewer words) were excluded; the support vector machine model revealed that speech was a better test of emotion detection than was text without interaction (i.e., children’s stories).</p>
<p>The authors suggest that these results are useful as a baseline for emotion detection, especially for longer-length texts that demonstrate accumulated sentiment. The authors also note a limitation; that is, their method predicted only one emotive class per sentence, whereas actors can invoke multiple emotions simultaneously. Human–computer interaction systems need to be developed to identify emotional states in naturally occurring interaction; this research presents the basis for a machine learning model for doing so.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812448099">Gorman, Cooke, Amazeen, and Fouse (2012)</xref> tackle the most complicated of communication contexts—that of team interaction. Working from foundations of recurrence analysis and information theory, the authors analyze conversations among three-person teams. The authors found that communication patterns in teams for which membership did not change became more habituated and rigid. Teams into which new members are introduced were discovered to be more flexible and better at information exchange that coordinates members’ tasks. Their results, they suggest, indicate that mixing team membership throughout a series of similar team tasks shifts something fundamental in team learning and development.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812448099">Gorman et al. (2012)</xref> conclude with an interesting thought question: Team interaction is neither deterministically structured nor random. Asking how can teams acquire flexibility yet use stable interaction processes, the authors suggest that there is a dynamic interchange between team interaction and task environment such that interaction is flexible at a local level, whereas repeated, similar tasks provides a level of stable goals. Acknowledging that informational content of interaction sequences can convey the degree of uncertainty, but not meaning, the authors suggest that their discrete recurrence methods could be automatically applied to automatically generated team interaction data. The value of doing so, they argue, is that this automation could identify those interaction sequences that require deeper-level analyses of content to deduce meaning—a task that will be difficult to automate. These scholars are not alone in their vexation about team interaction. Communication scholars have debated the theoretical nature of group or team communication and what counts as evidence of group outcomes (see special issue of <italic>Human Communication Research</italic>, April 2009, Volume 35, Issue 2). These articles may help to inform one another.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812448099">Stevens, Galloway, Wang, and Berka (2012)</xref> proposed to study the “when” of teamwork interactions—that is, they used physiological measures as an indirect identifier of the occurrence of team cognition. Using teams of 11 and 12 members in a submarine piloting and navigation simulation, electroencephalographic data were captured to identify alertness, engagement, and mental workload. They used these data to create synchrony pattern profiles. The authors admit that states identified through neurophysiologic synchronies data have not led to identifying patterns indicating when a team is fully engaged or fully unengaged. Their third hypothesis aimed to link neurophysiologic synchronies expression (NS_E) and speech. The authors report that state transitions occurred “around blocks of ideas or discussion units” (p. 497) but were not linked to a specific speaker. In summary, the authors conclude that “changing levels of NS_E entropy suggests that periods of decreased entropy represent times where the team is experiencing stress” (p. 500)—but the locus of that stress could be variable.</p>
<p>These findings can be applied to situations in which communicators use codified and trainable styles of communicating. But how could these findings be applied to situations in which interaction is less structured (no assigned roles and/or for a more abstract goal) and more dynamical (free flowing with respect to topic)? This study may hold the key to helping us understand why members believe shared meaning has occurred but have difficulty locating exactly what that meaning is. Coordinating these efforts with communication scholars, particularly, Joe Bonito (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812448099">Bonito &amp; Meyers, 2011</xref>), could be especially fruitful.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448099">Khawaja, Chen, and Marcus (2012)</xref> examine the potential of using linguistic cues as evidence of cognitive load and hypothesize that working collaboratively with high-cognitive-load tasks, group members will speak more with each other to manage the high task complexity. As they argue, cognitive tasks require more communication or active thinking processes. As an example, use of more agreement expressions, such as “okay,” indicate low-cognitive-load tasks, whereas disagreement among team members is expected when task complexity increases. The authors also expected that pronoun use (single vs. plural) would differ in these conditions.</p>
<p>Experienced team members worked collaboratively in a control room to carry out training exercises composed of complex bushfire management tasks that lasted 5 hr. Each task had low and high levels of task demand as well as incident escalation. Transcribed team interaction was coded for nontask, routine task, challenging task, and very challenging task messages. The authors found that word count was not distinguishable between low and high cognitive loads; however, number of words per sentence was significantly higher for high- versus low-load tasks. As hypothesized, higher level of cognitive load was associated with decreased agreement and increased disagreement. Perhaps not surprising, team members used significantly more singular pronouns with low-load tasks than with high-load tasks; conversely, they used significantly more plural pronouns with high-load than with low-load tasks.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that these findings coupled with automatic speech recognition could help in identification of groups that needed extra support to manage cognitive load—or, in my view, the switch from singular to plural pronouns may indicate team members’ recognition of a state in which teamwork is acknowledged as needed among members. Group communication scholars have paid very little attention to linguistic cues, such as pronoun use (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812448099">Gonzales, Hancock, &amp; Pennebaker, 2010</xref>). However, group communication scholars’ reliance on transcripts makes this type of analysis possible, which would extend the reach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448099">Khawaja et al.’s (2012)</xref> findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448099">Pfaff (2012)</xref> examined stress response in dyads in the role of either information manager or resource manager. Manipulating stress and mood while participants played the NeoCITIES simulation, the author examined underlying reasons for changes in team performance. In these “simple and to the point” (p. 564) verbal exchanges, Pfaff found that information transfers and requests increased with time pressure, information requests were negatively correlated to teams’ task scores, and anticipation of action was higher than information requests in happy versus sad conditions. Not surprisingly, positive mood enhanced team awareness, whereas sad mood reduced it.</p>
<p>What these teams of authors took on is not methodologically trivial, but did they study communication? Too frequently, studies of communication represent the phenomenon as information (message sent = message received; see the transmission model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812448099">Shannon and Weaver, 1949</xref>). But this model is not how humans process information as communication. Rather, humans use a sender ↔ receiver model, in which meaning is negotiated simultaneously among team members (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812448099">Keyton, Beck, &amp; Asbury, 2010</xref>). From this perspective, meaning is worked out by communicators in the context in which the conversation occurs. Human communicators rely on interaction, interdependence, and both explicit and implicit coordination and collaboration to construct meaning. With this definition in mind, these articles range in their examination of symbols, messages, and meanings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812448099">Cavicchio and Poesio’s (2012)</xref> study of emotion was examined aurally—that is, what emotion could be detected from talk? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812448099">Calix et al. (2012)</xref> examined emotion as heart rate and facial expressions and its relationship to cooperation, as evidenced by messages that shared information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812448099">Khawaja et al. (2012)</xref> examined word (or symbol) choice through the use of personal and plural pronouns as well as message length. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812448099">Stevens et al. (2012)</xref> examined patterns of speech. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812448099">Pfaff (2012)</xref> examined single messages in chat logs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812448099">Gorman et al. (2012)</xref> examined patterns of who speaks. Across these analyses, little information is provided at the interaction level; that is, what messages are being sent and received, and how do interactants work out shared meaning (or not) with those messages? Admittedly, team (and individual team member) performance data are useful, but is that utility limited when we have little access to the messages that produced the performance? Turn the question around. What do we seek to improve? Is it heart rate, use of facial expressions, use of emotive nonverbals, patterns of who talks to whom? Or do we seek to improve people’s abilities to share information and act on information in a productive manner in concert with others?</p>
<p>If we are trying to capture and analyze information, then we are doing a good job. On the other hand, if we are intending to capture and analyze meaning, then we are trying to measure something for which our methodological tools are inefficient and ineffective. As a result, the technologies used in these articles give indications of and about communication but do not reach the communication-as-meaning level.</p>
<p>Why does meaning matter? As argued elsewhere, a fully developed communication perspective “must be based on symbol production, reception and usage; conveyance and reception of messages; and the <italic>meanings that develop from those messages</italic> [italics added]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812448099">Keyton et al., 2010</xref>, p. 274). Dyads and teams cannot create a sufficient level of shared meaning without exchanging verbal or nonverbal messages. Thus, meaning is the construct that requires investigation and exploration. Philosophically and theoretically, meaning can be examined with the use of social interaction models (e.g., the theorizing of George Herbert Mead, Manford Kuhn, and Erving Goffman and their colleagues and successors) to provide an explanation for how messages develop into meaning and become shared among interactants. Human factors scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812448099">Warner, Letsky, &amp; Cowen, 2005</xref>) argue that the communication process is dynamic and highly influenced by context and sequence. They suggest that the interdependent activity rather than the transmission activity should be the focus of communication analysis and that some attention should be paid to the degree to which interactants are able to produce shared meaning efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>In these studies, the authors used various forms of technology to discover message interdependence, emotional states, nonverbal cues, physiological states, and linguistic forms. In the preface, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812448099">Cooke, Duchon, Gorman, Keyton, and Miller (2012)</xref> argued that communication studies, such as in this special issue, are ways we can understand reasoning and decision making and that findings from such studies can be used for assessment, training, and design of complex sociotechnical systems. I wonder whether the data, such as described in this special issue, are the <italic>communication</italic> data needed to accomplish these objectives. Are researchers drilling down to what <italic>can</italic> be captured or drilling down to <italic>what</italic> should be captured? Do the technologies described and used here detect and interpret communication in the same way as a human actor would? If some linguistic, nonverbal, and emotional cues are beyond the awareness of people actively engaged in group problem solving, then what do we hope to gain by making these identifications in controlled settings? Yes, they can be automatically monitored and assessed by others, but it is another step to having interactants use this information more directly.</p>
<p>Finally, better comparisons among, and greater integration of findings across, human factors and communication scholarship could be gained if we had better models of <italic>interactivity</italic>, as “human communication processes and outcomes are expected to vary as a function of the degree of interactivity afforded and/or experienced” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812448099">Ramirez &amp; Burgoon, 2004</xref>, p. 439). Human factors scholars tend to favor forms of communication that are controlled by technology (who can talk to whom and when) and roles (who has specific information to share), whereas communication scholars tend to favor contexts in which information flows more freely with fewer explicit restrictions. Finding a middle ground may not be satisfying to either set of scholars, but creating opportunities to collaborate may create the best understanding of technology that can better serve our understanding of communication.</p>
