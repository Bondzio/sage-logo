<abstract>
<p>The post-colonial face of Poland is rather problematic. Nationalistic right-wingers started using interpretations applying the post-colonial theory, and the theory itself seems to put little resistance to this type of appropriation. Rather than acknowledging such state of affairs as the fate of every idea falling into the hands of the natives, in this paper I would like to treat the problems of Polish post-coloniality as a very interesting test, both for the theory itself and for the analyses of the Polish reality. I shall compare the cases of nationalistic misuse with a more “mainstream” approach to the issue of applicability of the post-colonial theory to the situation in Eastern Europe, and particularly to the situation in Poland. As I shall try to demonstrate, this comparison will reveal many disturbingly common threads—which in my opinion are unjustified assertions and conclusions—resulting not only from errors in reasoning but the shortcomings of the theory itself.</p>

<title>The Uncanny Rising of the Word “Post-colonial”</title>
<p>We are used to the post-colonial countries referred to in post-colonial jargon (and usually from the perspective of post-imperial metropolises) as the places, which are a scene of certain “identity confusion,” and at the same time, which make an effort to “write back to the centre.” In this sense, post-coloniality may become a condition destroying set hierarchies, eradicating binary divisions, and undermining various universalising narratives; on the other hand, eulogists of post-coloniality are often accused of closing their eyes to real effects, here and now, of the empire’s actions. Let us for the time being leave aside the arguments about post-coloniality and post-colonial theory. Here is Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of one of the major parties, the Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Law and Justice), who as prime minister made the following statement about the state of the country before he took over power: “The Polish state has up to now been some gigantic scandal, a sort of, let me put it to you, something post-colonial and soft.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0888325412448473">1</xref></sup> After the lost election, he characterised the country ruled by the rivalling, more centrist Platforma Obywatelska (Civil Platform) as “a German-Russian condominium.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0888325412448473">2</xref></sup> He sees the greatest merits of his party and his government in stubborn attempts to resist the ever re-emerging powers of the Empire: Germany and Russia, eternally hostile to Poland, as well as the European Union, which constantly needs to be reminded of the due respect for Poland.</p>
<p>Here is the poet Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz, winner of the most prestigious literary prize—the Nike. He depicts Poland’s historical situation as that of a land lacking independence, one of the post-colonial countries, and in such countries “the occupiers—colonisers still possess huge influences: they control the economy, their special services are still in operation. A post-colonial country has post-colonial literature and post-colonial (imitative) film art. Its newspapers are post-colonial, post-colonialism lurks in the heads of its inhabitants (the natives). It conducts post-colonial politics as well—it continues to serve and try to win over its former occupiers-colonisers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0888325412448473">3</xref></sup> It can easily be guessed that only Jarosław Kaczyński and his party represent Rymkiewicz’s interests, “[and] this means that it represents the interests of all Poles who wish for the same things as myself—i.e. all those who want to live in independent Poland. There is only one such party in Poland today.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0888325412448473">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word “post-colonial” in that sort of context does no longer relate (as one might expect) to Kaczyński’s and Rymkiewicz’s obsession, but it becomes the worst of invectives: a description of an attitude which is obsequious, servile, and self-belittling, leading to dishonourable behaviours, such as collaboration, cowardice, and treachery. It is the description of a situation, from which we should break to independence. As a negative point of reference, at the same time the word becomes a serious reinforcement for the right-wing, nationalistic narrative.</p>
<p>Neither Jarosław Kaczyński nor Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz are niche figures in Polish public life. Their statements, behind which stands the authority of the leader of the largest opposition party (Kaczyński) and the nimbus of the award-winning and widely read poet (Rymkiewicz), are reproduced by the media, reflecting convictions of some Poles and shaping those of others. That is why I would like to give some thought to such unexpected fate of the term <italic>post-colonialism</italic>. Where did Kaczyński and Rymkiewicz get the idea in the first place, of the theory that, after all, as inspired by Marxism and the post-structural theory, is associated with all things both Kaczyński and Rymkiewicz emphatically renounce? Why does it arrive to Poland in this particular form: as an aberration of nationalism and martyrdom? How did it become practically monopolised by the political right? How did this “hostile takeover” take place, and what kind of misuse are we dealing with?</p>
<p>We ought to start with Clare Cavanagh and Ewa Thompson, who were the first to start writing about Poland as an interesting and important area of post-colonial studies. Both authors—Cavanagh in her article “Post-colonial Poland”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0888325412448473">5</xref></sup> and Thompson in her book <italic>Imperial Knowledge</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0888325412448473">6</xref></sup> —begun with a question why the post-colonial studies conducted in different centres had not related in any way to the countries of the so-called Second World, that is, those whose experience of being subjects of an empire was shaped in relation to the Soviet Union, as well as—in a broader historical perspective—to pre-revolution Russia and other occupiers. Both researchers are of the opinion that the Marxist heritage of the post-colonial theory was to blame: if the Soviet Union was to be the realisation of the Marxist ideal, it is in a way “improper” to hold it accountable for its inglorious imperial past. Such bias significantly narrows down the research area of the theory and makes it incapable of undertaking a true “pan-European critique of great powers,” as Cavanagh puts it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0888325412448473">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>How do the researchers define Polish post-coloniality? The “impressive post-colonial credentials”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0888325412448473">8</xref></sup> consist of the entire history of Poland as a country constantly invaded, partitioned, and occupied; a country whose citizens were transported, deported, and persecuted for being Polish and denied any respect whenever they wished to express and cultivate their Polish identity. Those post-colonial credentials can be reduced to the equation: 123 years under partitions + 6 years of war + 44 years of political dependence. The result of this equation is Poland’s present situation.</p>
<p>Such stance, though disputable (and, indeed, I shall dispute it a bit further on), does not necessarily lead to visions of martyrdom and persecution. Nevertheless, it coincides with a fairly well-established conviction, according to which Poland has been surrounded by enemies waiting to destroy its sovereignty and honour and—still according to the same conviction—some Poles have been tempted to collaborate and sell their own country. Particularly Ewa Thompson is eager to prove that the memorable 173 years continue to greatly influence our reality. She reckons that even today our country must fight for its position undermined by global powers—particularly those wishing the knowledge about the condition of the empire’s subjects to remain obscured from the public. Poland has to struggle against obduracy of corrupt elites, more interested in the approval of the world’s mighty than in seeking real independence.</p>
<p>The struggle to recognise Poland as a post-colonial country becomes a struggle to correctly identify the other side of the colonial relation. That side seems to be first and foremost Russia. Ewa Thompson devoted her book “Imperial Knowledge”—a fundamental text for most researchers of Polish post-coloniality—to the analysis of the imperial discourse present in Russian literature and aimed at supporting the superpower policy of czarist Russia and then the Soviet Union. According to Thompson, this discourse is created in opposition to the West as well as “to the history sustained by the efforts of those whom Russia had colonized.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0888325412448473">9</xref></sup> ( Its aim is, on one hand, to justify the conquests, and on the other—to make them invisible. The fact that Russia is not present as an accused on the pages of so many articles and books devoted to post-colonial research is a sign of its success in this field.</p>
<p>From this picture, in which Poland is a post-colonial country (because of 123 + 6 + 44), and Russia (as well as Germany) is a (post?)imperial one, it is difficult to draw conclusions different from those made by Jarosław Kaczyński and Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz. One might start to wonder how easily the post-colonial critique, often accused of introducing too much relativity in its assessment of the situation after colonialism, of fuzzing antagonisms in the name of the cult of diversity and of consensualism venturing into the abstract, can be harnessed into projects constituting an absolute negation of all of the above. As I am going to demonstrate, post-colonial critique as conducted by Ewa Thompson is most of all a gross misuse. Still, in her writing we may find several motives which, amazingly, meet the motives present in more mainstream ways of carrying out post-colonial critique. I shall prove this by comparing her texts with the essay by David Chioni Moore titled “Is the Post- in the Postcolonial the Post- in the Post-Soviet? Toward a Global Postcolonial Critique,” which can be considered representative also of mainstream post-colonial theory, that is, the section focusing its analyses on the relations “between the richest countries and the countries of the Third World.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0888325412448473">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In other words, my task will be to prove that (1) the vision of Russia, on which Thompson based her analyses was built on prejudice, and the post-colonial critique connected with Orientalisation becomes its own contradiction; (2) the proposition to broaden post-colonial studies by including a reflection on the fate of the countries formerly under the dominance of the Soviet Union may in fact mean narrowing the field of research—the “post-” in “post-Soviet” is not the same as the “post-” in “post-colonial.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0888325412448473">
<title>Vilifying Russia</title>
<p>The main rhetorical figure on which Thompson bases her work is the antithesis. Although she underlines that “the world has never been divided into two neat compartments, West and non-West,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0888325412448473">11</xref></sup> on the pages of her book she creates a world with a very clear division. On one side, next to the West, there are the countries conquered by Russia, and on the other there is Russia itself, becoming a negative, monstrous reflection of its adversary. In the face of this basic difference, all differentiation between the West and the countries conquered by Russia fades.</p>
<p>Thompson relates mainly to the Western and Russian imperialism, which in theory should exonerate her from accusations of bias. However, as it turns out, imperialisms are not at all equal. Trying to find differences between the two types of imperialism and establish their possible influence on omitting the Second World in post-colonial theory, she writes that “in contrast, Russian imperialism was too self-conscious, too nervous about itself, too manipulative in promoting Russian culture, and too poor epistemologically to produce ideas and followers in the cultural sphere.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0888325412448473">12</xref></sup> Meanwhile, “Western imperialism offered the native elites a wealth of European intellectual traditions: indeed, postcolonial studies originated simultaneously at Western universities and in subaltern countries.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0888325412448473">13</xref></sup> The objective of such figure is obvious: to demonstrate the impassable gap between the sphere of Western culture and Russia. Even the not-so-glorious products of the former are infinitely better than analogical phenomena in the East: “Perhaps Russian imperialism failed because it relied more and longer on soldiers and cannons than had the Western enterprise, and because it did not succeed in replacing cannons with ideas.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0888325412448473">14</xref></sup> Russian imperialism did manage to win new territories, “The inordinate territorial appetite of the Russians was also to blame to lack of success in assimilating minorities; there is just so much that a relatively weakly developed culture can absorb and make its own. Most of all, Russian culture lacked a firm philosophical base, which the West so abundantly possessed and which served as an excuse for its ‘civilising’ conquest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0888325412448473">15</xref></sup> Hence, the Russian culture is by its nature incapable of accepting the post-colonial theory: “The category of Orientalism that Said reshaped and reinterpreted engendered a variety of studies that make sense on the level of abstraction barely accessible to those who like to have their concept in plain view. Postcolonial theory draws on numerous postmodern philosophical and psychological sources, and this heritage accounts for some of the resistance to it among the more traditional Russian writers. With the exception of formalist and structuralist episode (never fully integrated into the critical mainstream), literary criticism in Russia has seldom attracted novel ideas, preferring rather to draw from well-established models.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0888325412448473">16</xref></sup> Well, how possibly could the <italic>noblesse</italic> do service to Russia?</p>
<p>The change of discourse concerning Russia—the transformation “from a backward Other into ‘almost one of us’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0888325412448473">17</xref></sup> is reported with a passion of an exposer of great deception. What do you mean they could be one of us? Why, their imperialism does not even come close to ours! They were not even able to produce a theory critical towards their own imperialism. Even if they had some contact with our science and art, with our civilisation, it was superficial and full of effort—in fact, it was a fantasy of the rulers and the elites constituting but 1 percent of the population, rather than the expression of the nation’s spirit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0888325412448473">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, after even the most cursory read of Edward Said’s work, such statements coming from someone calling herself a post-colonial researcher (i.e., critical of all types of Orientalising practices) will prove to be a shocking reproduction of the Orientalising template. For Thompson, Russia is the Orient exactly in the meaning used by the scientists, politicians, and artists described by Said.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0888325412448473">19</xref></sup> It is the antithesis of “our” world. It is infinitely worse (even the things “we” do wrong, Russia does wronger). Although it is subjected to essentialising, its essence has practically no positive quality—as manifested not only by the atrocities of Russian imperialism but also by the fact that everything Russia creates is actually an imitation of the achievements of the West. It is also a mystery—however, interestingly, Thompson interprets the fact that the West considers Russia a mystery, as capitulation of the West, leaving “to the Other the authority to decide who the Other should be”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0888325412448473">20</xref></sup> —a completely “unimperial” gesture, according to the author, and readily used by Russia. How does Thompson cope with such fundamental contradiction in her argument? As in the case of Russia’s “mystery,” she blames Russia itself for all Orientalisation, reasoning that this image is the reality, and even if it is not, then Russia, in its perfidy, created it for certain benefits.</p>
<p>Russia—as the East, the mythical Sphinx, the mystery incomprehensible to reason—has been, and still is, Orientalised. Nevertheless, it is obvious one cannot undertake post-colonial critique using Orientalising prejudice and anti-Russian phobias. It is equally obvious that a post-colonial critique relating to Russia and Russian imperialism, which disregards the fact of such Orientalising practices, becomes a critique out of the context of reality. Lack of both those statements discredits post-colonial publications by Ewa Thompson, as contradictory to themselves, as well as to reality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0888325412448473">
<title>Does Post-colonial Equal Post-Soviet?</title>
<p>Let us move on to the next question, that is, to the consequences of the proposition to enrich post-colonial studies by adding a reflection on the fate of the countries, which remained under the dominance of the Soviet Union, and particularly—Poland. Is it possible for such reflection (this time not repeating the mistake of vilifying Russia) to broaden the field of research? Can “post-Soviet” be easily translated into “post-colonial”? Is Poland post-colonial, and does a positive answer to this question result from a positive answer to the earlier one?</p>
<p>To tackle those issues, one must consider two questions. The first relates to validity of the comparison between the Soviet Union’s policy towards the countries remaining under its influence and the western imperialism and the countries subjected to its power. Can we really compare histories of the subjects of the Eastern and the Western empires? The second question boils down to deciding whether the essence of Polish post-coloniality (as I do not want to discuss other countries of the former Eastern Bloc) really is the relationship with Russia, or perhaps completely different relationships, shaping this post-coloniality in a completely different manner.</p>
<p>Both topics are discussed by David Chioni Moore in his essay “Is the Post- in the Postcolonial the Post- in the Post-Soviet? Towards a Global Postcolonial Critique.” He positively answers the title question: yes, Russian colonialism had different faces; yes, it is necessary to introduce the concept of “reverse cultural colonisation,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0888325412448473">21</xref></sup> which problematises the issue of Orientalisation of Russia; yes, it is necessary to notice anti-colonial ideals and actions of the Soviet Union—but at the same time “it should be clear that the term ‘post-colonial,’ and everything that goes with it—language, economy, politics, resistance, liberation and its hangover—might reasonably be applied to the formerly Russo- and Soviet-controlled regions post-1989 and -1991, just as it has been applied to South Asia post-1947 or Africa post-1958. East is South.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0888325412448473">22</xref></sup> On the basis of the history of the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, Chioni Moore creates a universal model of post-coloniality, the elements of which (domination and decisive political influences of a foreign empire, economic exploitation, imposition of ideals concerning the correct way of living, refusing the right to sovereignty and even to cultivating tradition and using own language, persecution of dissidents, and after liberation—continuing political and economic influence of the colonisers and certain identity confusion among the “natives”) are shared by countries like Ghana or Ivory Coast and the likes of Poland and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Into this universal model you can fit (depending on your preference) any country that has ever been invaded, conquered, and exploited (and there is no country that has not, as Chioni Moore emphasises, 111–12). This leads to an inconvenient result, namely, to the conclusion that practically every place on Earth can be considered post-colonial. Chioni Moore tackles this inconvenience by proposing that we should not ask whether a particular country is post-colonial, but rather “if postcolonial hermeneutics might add richness to studies of place or literature X, Y or Z.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0888325412448473">23</xref></sup> This way, certain general knowledge on the abstract mechanisms of post-colonialism can allow for detailed analysis of any place in the world, with all its particular characteristics.</p>
<p>We can see now, how broadening the research field—by subsequent countries touched by the stigma of colonialism, and consequently the entire world—leads in fact to narrowing of research horizons and ambitions. It does not allow for relating to global interdependencies and tendencies making imperialism and colonialism possible. It makes it impossible to indicate their origins. The causes and effects of colonial policies of western superpowers and Soviet totalitarianism can suddenly be flattened to a single, common model. It seems that everybody to the same extent is or was a subject of an abstract force, which may manifest itself slightly differently on the formal level, but its nature remains unchanged since the Roman conquests and Ghengis Khan, through the colonisation of Africa and partitions of Poland, to the Second World War and the war in Chechnya. All you can do in this situation is to focus on the effects of this force and the devastation it caused to the identities of its victims. The victims are not differentiated in any way—as Ella Shohat wrote, “The critical differences between the Europe’s genocidal oppression of Aboriginals in Australia, indigenous peoples of the Americas and Afro-diasporic communities, <italic>and</italic> Europe’s domination of European elites in the colonies are leveled with an easy stroke of the ‘post.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0888325412448473">24</xref></sup> Thus the post-colonial theory stops being a theory and starts resembling a certain system of beliefs in the centre of which there is an unchangeable, but unknowable, power.</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be really malicious of me to assume that this was also the objective of Kaczyński, Rymkiewicz, Ewa Thompson, and their followers in the manner of describing Polish post-colonialism. Clearly, they do not mean any other countries subjected to the influence of the empire but this particular country and this particular empire. Paradoxically, they use the relativising effect of the post-colonial theory to take a position justifying expressions of their nationalistic phobias. They include Poland and other countries from the area of influence of Russia and the USSR into the family of post-colonial countries not to immerse themselves in postmodernist identity of diversity, but to prove that this eastern empire is the proper empire, and the entire sting of criticism ought to be directed against it.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the effects of the empire’s activity, that is, to post-colonial mentality found in the Poles both by Chioni Moore (writing about Central Europeans in general) and by Ewa Thompson. This mentality for Chioni Moore is one of the two characteristics of the post-Soviet region, which justify calling it “post-colonial.” It is created on the basis of the universal post-colonial “tensions between the desire for autonomy and a history of dependence, between the desire for autochthony and the fact of hybrid, part-colonial origin, between resistance and complicity, and between imitation (or mimicry) and originality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0888325412448473">25</xref></sup> These tensions cause all sorts of compensative behaviour—either towards the colonial model, or towards own proposed originality. However, interestingly, “this postcolonial compensatory tug plays out differently in post-Soviet space, since postcolonial desire from Riga to Almaty fixates not on the fallen master Russia but on glittering Euramerican MTV-and-Coca-Cola beast that broke it. Central and Eastern Europeans type this desire as a return to Westernness that once was theirs. . . . It is, in circular fashion, a postcolonial desire, a headlong westward sprint from colonial Russia’s ghost or grasp, that prevents most scholars of the post-Soviet sphere from contemplating ‘southern’ postcoloniality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0888325412448473">26</xref></sup> Therefore, the more we want to be described as post-colonial, the more we are so, and the term itself suddenly begins to exist as an accusation and a stigma—”post-colonial” mentality is simply “native mentality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0888325412448473">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Let us, nevertheless, focus on the post-colonial, post-Soviet desire directed towards the “glittering Euramerican MTV-and-Coca-Cola beast.” For Moore, this is the clearest example of our post-colonial compensative behaviours: we want the West, because we do not want the East, with which our true post-colonial reaction takes place. Our obstinate joining in with the West, our proving that we have belonged to it for millennia, as well as our making it the centre of all things desirable (with an important role of MTV and Coca-Cola, which I shall mention later on), is a result of hysterical escape from feeling subjugated to Russia.</p>
<p>It is an explanation very similar to the concept created by Ewa Thompson. According to her, “in the territory of the Russian/Soviet empire, the colonised did not respect the colonisers—on the contrary: they often patronised and looked down on them. . . . Russia lacked that sense of civilisation competence, which the public in the countries colonised by Great Britain or France granted, however reluctantly, to conquerors of their countries. Consequently, in Poland there emerged a concept of a surrogate hegemon, i.e. the Mythical, Wise and Morally Ordered West, the measure of progress and carrier of enlightened ideals, administrator of the periodicals where you can complain about your own, democratically functioning country [tracing cases of complaints against one’s own country in foreign periodicals is a sort of obsession for Thompson<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0888325412448473">28</xref></sup>]. Relating (in Polish political debates in the early 21st century) to intellectual authorities of the West means voluntary submitting to the Other in a situation, where you are no longer forced to remain peripheral.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0888325412448473">29</xref></sup> The post-colonial mentality of Polish elites, “queuing for approval,” originates from the submission to Russia, the hegemon proper, although, according to the author, unworthy of the respect deserved by Great Britain and France. This submission (Thompson goes as far as to use the expression <italic>subaltern</italic> to describe the elites [<italic>sic</italic>]) results in a mental disposition, which makes the elites reproduce this submission in a new political situation.</p>
<p>Our admiration for the West, our obstinate emphasising that we belong to it, and most of all the desire to find ourselves in the western paradise of consumerism (Thompson 2008), which organises our desire, and the standards of which are supposedly different from those “of the communist times”—is all this really an expression of the stigma of our submission to Russia and possibly of our wishing to avoid it? Perhaps creating such elaborate explanatory constructions is not necessary at all. Perhaps the matter is a lot simpler. Perhaps we want the West, because we want the West. Perhaps the “glittering Euramerican MTV-and-Coca-Cola beast” affects us exactly in the same way as millions of other inhabitants of the Earth, from the First, the Second or the Third World.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0888325412448473">30</xref></sup> Perhaps there is only one world and its present (and probably past) shape is defined by global capital, emerging anew in different forms, dividing countries and regions into the advanced and the backward ones, the enlightened and the barbaric, adding to the differences in economic conditions and positions in the international division of labour, of the very important surplus of civilisation and cultural prestige (or its lack), sanctifying the standards of commodity fetishism, supplementing colonialism with neocolonialism—and facing different reactions and forms of protest, which often replicate the imperial brutality.</p>

<title>Polish Entanglement—What Cannot Be Forgotten When Talking about Polish Post-coloniality</title>
<p>If, indeed, such is the situation, then Polish post-coloniality needs to be presented in a completely different light. It might turn out that it is defined not only by 123 years of dependence under partitions (etc.), but that the question is far more complicated, and many other factors need to be considered, signifying that Poland cannot always be placed on the side of the post-colonial division reserved for victims. I would like to draw attention to the following facts:</p>
<list id="list1-0888325412448473" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Poland’s complicated position in the globalised world. The distance from “proper” Europe and differences in standards of living are still felt. At the same time, Poland as an EU country is a destination for thousands of economic refugees from Europe, Asia, and Africa; it remains a green island with magnificent GNP amidst the global economic crisis; has impressive results of the PISA tests and its inhabitants are well educated; it commissions production of various products from China and India; it hosts the headquarters of the Frontex agency; and sends soldiers to Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. In this context, writing about post-colonial Poland as a victim of the Eastern empire becomes a misuse: it obscures the present comfortable position of Poland in the world of global capital and relieves it of its responsibility for participation in modern acts of (neo)imperialism and (neo)colonialism.</p></list-item>

The first problem are the reasons and effects of serf economy, which developed in Poland simultaneously with the imperial conquests conducted by the countries of Western Europe, and was meant to answer similar needs: intensification of agricultural economy resulting from increased demand for grain export, which brought about a sort of agricultural factories, with forced labourers—serves—as the workforce. The choice of this particular model (rather than external colonisation) decided about Poland’s place on the fringes of advanced, capitalist Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0888325412448473">31</xref></sup> Also, it determined the enduring division of the Polish society into the “masters” (<italic>pany</italic>) and the “boors” (<italic>chamy</italic>). The lines of this division were identical with the division into the “civilised” and the “ignorant,” the exploiters and the exploited, the cultured and those making unreasonable demands, etc., thus reproducing the template of Orientalisation. Let us only add that it was the imperial authorities that banished serfdom in Poland.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The concept of internal colonisation can also be used with regard to complicated relationships between the inhabitants of the Eastern areas of the Second Republic. Here, social and class divisions were superimposed on the differences of nationality and religion. Colonisation proves to be Polonisation, authority always has the face of “masters” and Catholics, while the “rabble” are Orthodox, Ruthenian people. According to the most outstanding researcher of this phenomenon, Daniel Beauvois, the backdrop of this conflict was the possession of land, and the actors were the Polish gentry (major and minor), the Ukrainian people, and the czarism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0888325412448473">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third dimension of the internal colonisation is connected with the system transformation and the inequalities it produced. Said’s Orientalism managed to adjust to the new social and economic reality, which led to—as Michał Buchowski writes—”an automatic association of the characteristics considered positive by the dominant culture with the West, capitalism and progress, and the characteristics considered in this cultural order to be negative with the East, communism and backwardness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0888325412448473">33</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list2-0888325412448473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Conviction of Poland’s exceptionality as a bulwark of civilisation. According to this conviction Poland defends the European civilisation against the spate from the East: be it Haydamaks, Turks, Bolsheviks, or illegal immigrants. It becomes a border between European law, order, and reason and Eastern (Russian) lawlessness, disorder, and irrationality. One variant of such thinking is the idea of Poland defending Europe against the civilisation of death, which is an expression of the West’s corruption (Poland, however, in this mission is not an emissary of the East, but the last faithful knight of the Latin civilisation).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4. Polish sense of inferiority and lesser worth, resulting from not belonging to “proper” Western Europe of advanced capital. This is connected with real civilisation underdevelopment in comparison to Western Europe and the United States. Poland is supposed to be underdeveloped not because of various coinciding social, economic, political, and historical circumstances but due to the alleged nature of the people who live here, shared by all inhabitants of the East. The Poles, as Slavs, become the Other of Europe; their secondary status, in turn, becomes a justification and a pretext for various civilisational endeavours, exploitation, and sheer conquest. On one hand, it causes resentment, and on the other, the conviction about civilisational backwardness becomes internalised and the resulting self-stereotype traps Polish identity in endless comparisons with the West, and inside a situation where we have become “strangers to ourselves,” as Maria Janion put it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0888325412448473">34</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5. The Borderland (Kresy) and the myth of the Kresy. The term <italic>kresy</italic> derives from military terminology; it denotes an area of contact with enemy forces and the place where the chivalrous identity of a true Pole was forged—consequently, the term reveals the relations of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0888325412448473">35</xref></sup> The mythologised Kresy becomes a deposit of priceless and endangered Polish identity. Polish patriotism, born in the Borderlands, is founded on a myth, according to which the Homeland is always in danger, it needs to be defended, and the defence is the task of her righteous sons. Kresy therefore form a militarised, masculine, aggressive identity of a true Pole, convinced that he carries a civilising mission. Based on this conviction, Polonisation here meets colonisation (Beauvois 1994).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another explanation of the idea of Kresy is certainly more popular: it is “the land of childhood years,” a fulfilled dream about peaceful, multinational Republic. The myth stems mainly from Romanticism, aimed at soothing the battered Polish soul. Both variants of the Borderland myth are aimed at justifying or masking the dominating and in essence colonising Polish presence in the East.</p>
<list id="list3-0888325412448473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>6. The Jewish question and the memory of Shoah—and not only because one of the explanations of the genocide is that it was the final consequence of the sequence: capitalism—imperialism—fascism. Although in the world of real conflict for imperial interests Poland’s position was rather insignificant, the prewar history of Polish anti-Semitism is full of motives linking it to the contradictions of the capitalist system, as well as with economic conflicts for which anti-Semitism and the dreams of imperial Poland it generated (see also p. 8) were to serve as a sort of discharge.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Polish Jews—treated as strangers, vilified, and Orientalised—both before and after the war were accused of “occupying” Poland, as alleged capitalists (the stereotype of a Jewish exploiter) as well as communists (the stereotype of żydokomuna). It is therefore necessary to link this vision of the imminent “flood of Jewishness” with real relations of domination in the Polish society and to explain how the anti-Semitic view of the world can function as an occasion to discharge and mask real antagonisms; it will be equally important to analyse “suspicious descent as a category of Polish culture”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0888325412448473">36</xref></sup>—a category connected with fantasies of cleansed and homogeneous national substance, which reflects a neurotic reaction to difference. It is also significant that it was the Holocaust that changed Poland from a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country into a monolith.</p>
<list id="list4-0888325412448473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>7. Expulsions and “returning” to the Recovered Territories, signifying the great undertaking of the post-war revision of borders, and national composition of Poland. The revision was dictated, among other things, by the fantasy about a homogeneous country (as far as nationality is concerned, as well as religion and culture), unambiguously declaring itself on the side of the innocent victims of the Second World War.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All transfers of population of this kind (and I mean not only transporting the Germans out, but bringing in repatriates from the East to take their place) require analysing the mechanisms that led to them as well as their consequences. This concerns both their real dimension (historical, political, and social conditions) and the fantasy one. The emerging fantasy geography is particularly interesting—the overlapping maps, changing names of towns and villages, traces of earlier inhabitants, ruins.</p>
<p>The issue connecting the Polish memory of the Shoah and the expulsions is the problematic status of the Poles in relation to the exterminated Jews and the Germans who were driven out. Neither the Shoah nor the expulsions were a Polish initiative, yet it would be difficult to view us solely as witnesses, innocent and unable to help.</p>
<list id="list5-0888325412448473" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>8. The history of attempted “classic” colonisation, understood as conquering remote, exotic lands with the hope of participation in the capitalist game for new sources of raw materials, cheap labour, and markets. The colonial idea emerged in the nineteenth century as a way of obtaining independence for Poland under partitions. In the independent state, it was resurrected by the Sea and Colonial League, trying to use the new distribution of mandates in Africa and South America to take over the former German colonies by Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0888325412448473">37</xref></sup> The motivation here were the attempts to cope with the supposed surplus population, which was a euphemistic term for anti-Semitic conviction about excessively fast population growth among the Jewish minority (that is where the slogan “Jews to Madagascar” originated from), or about the vast numbers of the unemployed. Another important motivation were the attempts to return Poland to a position of global superpower.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What is important, however, is not the citizenship of a colonial empire, but whether colonial ideals are developed. If the most popular Polish writer remains Henryk Sienkiewicz, then we must have produced a certain mental map,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0888325412448473">38</xref></sup> on which we place ourselves very close to the colonisers. Behind such shape of the map stands a “post-colonial set of fantasies,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0888325412448473">39</xref></sup> that is, the collective world of imagination, which can be established even if it was never supported by actual colonisation. Participation in reproducing this “post-colonial set of fantasies” created an opportunity to join the winners of the colonial race. It manifested itself (and still does) as a co-creation of the colonial discourse—Eurocentric, Orientalising, and racist.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that the conviction that the essence of our post-coloniality is our relationship with Russia is just another manifestation of the phenomenon of Polish obsession with innocence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0888325412448473">40</xref></sup> Joanna Tokarska-Bakir writes about it in the context of Polish–Jewish relations. Charges concerning anti-Semitism are met with Polish stubborn attempts to prove that the problem is not the anti-Semitism itself but making charges of it, that is, the accusers are being accused. This is accompanied by emphasising actual and supposed Jewish offences, in other words “confessing other people’s sins.” Perhaps it would be a good idea—both in the case of Polish anti-Semitism and Polish post-coloniality—to deal with our own sins?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0888325412448473">
<title>Problems with Theory</title>
<p>Let us go back to the post-colonial theory and its “hostile takeover.” In this text I have shown the two ways (Thompson’s and Chioni-Moore’s) of using this theory, defining Polish post-coloniality as its relations with Russia—czarist and Soviet—and I have come to the conclusion that both those ways are misuses, and that they require making significant omissions in the description of reality. That is why now, instead of just proposing the existence of some orthodox version of the theory the deviations from which we have just encountered, I should be dealing with the theory itself. Perhaps it is the theory that is doubtful, and not its interpretations.</p>
<p>Objections to the post-colonial theory are not new. Made mainly from Marxist positions, they concern the place of the theory in the world of globalised capitalism, comfortable harmony with this world, abandoning the ambitions to create a consistent program of protest that would not get stuck in ambiguities, fuzzing the category of subject and the concept of authorship, preferring the cultural over the economic and social, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0888325412448473">41</xref></sup> It is possible to say that Chioni Moore—complication of the Polish situation I have described apart—simply does not step beyond the limitations of the theory. The theory itself is ambiguous in relation to the attempts at creating a consistent narrative about imperialism, defining it mainly in cultural terms (proving its existence by indicating the “post-colonial mentality”!) and insufficiently focussing on analysing material things (not problematising by Moore of the “glittering Euramerican MTV-and-Coca-Cola beast” is the best example of that).</p>
<p>Is it those shortcomings of the post-colonial theory that create gaps for interpretation aberrations, such as Ewa Thompson’s constructions or elaborations on them by Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz and Jarosław Kaczyński? I believe this is indeed the case. We could see how both manners of using the theory, although with very different backgrounds, meet in the key moments of argumentation. They omit the same circumstances and contexts. In the face of such surprising accordance, we should ask whether using the post-colonial theory as a useful tool for reading reality is not, by any chance, pointless. Perhaps it is simply not worth it?</p>
<p>I find that the only honest negative answer to this question came from Peter Hallward, the author of the book <italic>Absolutely Postcolonial: Writing between the Singular and the Specific</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0888325412448473">42</xref></sup> For him, post-coloniality becomes a certain limit, a tendency, in confrontation with which it is possible to formulate principles susceptible to authentic universalisation, that is, to conduct a “global critique of superpowers” by taking concrete positions, taking sides, involvement, confrontation, by the fact that we are the ones creating our history, even if we don’t do it in circumstances of our choosing. Still, such use of the post-colonial theory means a complete break with the earlier practice of it. Perhaps this path is worth pursuing.</p>

<p>Let us note that Chioni Moore starts to use the word “post-colonial” in a manner very similar to Thompson, Kaczyński, and Rymkiewicz. We may all be post-colonial, but some of us are somehow more post-colonial than others. The “them-postcolonials” cannot cope with the empire with dignity, they get involved in post-colonial compensatory struggle, they have identity problems and, most of all, problems with admitting they are post-colonial. As we can see, the mechanism of defining victims by stigmatising them and then victimising them is not only the ailment of ours—the unruly natives.</p>

<p>One can have different possibilities of fulfilling one’s love for Coca-Cola. In the mid-1980s in Poland, a very popular hobby among teenagers of my generation was collecting empty Cola, Fanta, Sprite cans, etc. and then exhibiting them on a shelf or a desk. The lucky privileged ones acquired them “naturally,” that is, by buying them for dollars in special Pewex shops, drinking the contents and proceeding to compose a display; the less affluent ones had to, e.g., get on international trains between the stations of Warsaw West and Warsaw Central and ask passengers if they had any unwanted rubbish. The cans shone brightly with a glow of the desired West, and brought prestige on the owner of the exhibition. How much does it say about the life in communist Poland, how much about the nature of capitalism as a system generating desire, and how much about the object of this desire?</p>

<p>The fascinating book by Anna Sosnowska, <italic>Zrozumieć zacofanie. Spory historyków o Europę Wschodnią (1947-1994)</italic> (Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Trio, 2004) presents four models of explaining Polish underdevelopment, prepared by social historians Marian Małowist, Witold Kula, Jerzy Topolski, and Andrzej Wyczański. The models place the issue of serf economy in the centre of the enquiry about Poland’s position in Europe during the continent’s transformation from feudalism into capitalism. According to Marian Małowist’s model, Poland belongs to the part of Europe that became an internal colony supplying the West with cheap (thanks to the serfdom of peasants) corn. According to Małowist, the strongest antagonism characterises not the relationship between the masters and the serfs but the latter ones and the economic elite of the developed countries (Polish masters are reduced to the role of intermediaries—colonial compradors). Let me remind that Marian Małowist cooperated with Braudel and that he provided inspiration for Immanuel Wallerstein.</p>
