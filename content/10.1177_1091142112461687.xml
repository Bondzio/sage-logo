<abstract>
<p>Tax amnesty programs have exploded in popularity among cash-strapped states since the beginning of the Great Recession. Though many scholars have been interested in the long-term tax compliance effects after amnesty programs, this article is the first to consider short-run compliance effects just prior to a known amnesty—a moral hazard effect leading to strategic delinquencies. Evidence of this is detected from year-over-year tax revenue change in quarters just prior to an amnesty program. Regression analysis on pre-amnesty periods for state tax amnesty programs between 1982 and 2011 indicates that states experience higher pre-amnesty revenues when recent delinquents are excluded from amnesty participation. The point estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) indicated that about 4.3 to 6.4 percent of an average amnesty’s recovery came from strategically delayed payments, whereas IV/2SLS put the range at 12.9 to 16.5 percent.</p>

<p>The consequences of tax amnesties have drawn considerable attention from public finance scholars interested in tax compliance. Though potentially representing large infusions of cash to governments desperate for revenue, of paramount concern has been whether such programs represent a “penny-wise but pound-foolish” policy approach to revenue generation. In addition to retrieving unpaid liabilities from delinquent accounts, the tax amnesties can potentially entice evading taxpayers to voluntarily join the tax rolls. However, the amnesty could also increase the delinquency rate among future taxpayers who infer the programs to be a reoccurring phenomenon. Taxpayers can hardly be blamed for making such an inference; the most recent decade (2000–2010) saw more tax amnesties than in the previous two decades combined, and many of these were from states offering repeat programs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1091142112461687">1</xref>
</sup> Though states often try to combat this expectation with promises of amnesties being “onetime only” events to be followed with more vigorous post-amnesty enforcement and stricter penalties, it is often difficult for current policy makers to make credible commitments to the actions of their future counterparts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1091142112461687">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While scholars will likely continue to gather evidence on post-amnesty compliance and its long-term effect on revenue collection, this article seeks to examine the consequences of a short-run source of moral hazard that has previously gone unnoticed in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1091142112461687">3</xref>
</sup> Regardless of taxpayers’ long-run expectations of the likelihood of future amnesties, in the short-run these programs are foreseeable through the policy process. Concern over the fairness in offering amnesty to any form of lawbreaker generates controversy, and tax law is no exception. This results in the process of enacting a statewide tax amnesty becoming a readily foreseeable and transparent event. For instance, Delaware’s 2009 tax amnesty program was included in Governor Jack Markell’s successful gubernatorial campaign platform in 2008.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1091142112461687">4</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, marketing campaigns ahead of the amnesty program are considered necessary as the means to informing taxpayers of the opportunity to participate and therefore maximize collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1091142112461687">Mikesell 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091142112461687">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1091142112461687">Parle and Hirlinger 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy debate, administrative preparation, and marketing efforts result in a period of time prior to the actual execution of the amnesty where households and firms can account for it in their tax planning. Consider the hypothetical case of a firm interested in a short-term, and often high-interest, loan from a financial intermediary. If an amnesty is on the horizon, then the firm could instead refuse to remit their biweekly/monthly (depending on the state and size of the firm) tax payments for sales and withholdings, use that money in lieu of the loan, and then repay it during the amnesty period. This would effectively treat the government as a competing, and often interest-free, lender to other financial intermediaries. Similarly, an individual with like circumstances may simply not file or delay paying their end-of-year tax bill if given the opportunity and knowledge of the upcoming amnesty. It is conceivable that such strategic tax planning could be commonplace and significant in amnesties, and there is some limited anecdotal evidence to this point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1091142112461687">Ritsema, Manly, and Thomas (2003)</xref> analyzed the written comments from participants in the 1997 Arkansas amnesty program, which required a statement from the taxpayer explaining the reasons for their delinquency. Although the intended meaning is unclear, nearly half (44 percent) of the responses described “intentional” reasons for tax delinquency. Accounting consultants often advise their clients to not immediately self-report if they discover they hold a nexus in a particular state, but rather to look for amnesty opportunities (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091142112461687">Fleming 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that this concern leads states, at least in some of their attempts, to exclude the recently delinquent from being eligible for the amnesty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1091142112461687">5</xref>
</sup> This exclusion does not constitute a free lunch, as the trade-off is forgoing the taxpayers who coincidentally become delinquent just prior to an amnesty offering, but would be willing and able to become current via the amnesty program. In this article, this group is referred to as the incidentally delinquent, whereas the group which engages in tax planning will be hereafter referred to as the strategically delinquent.</p>
<p>Excluding recently delinquent liabilities from amnesty eligibility affects both the incidentally and the strategically delinquent taxpayers, and therefore reduces the potential pool of amnesty applicants. For the strategically delinquent, this exclusionary period allows the state to collect a liability earlier and with lower administrative cost, but comes at the sacrifice of the incidentally delinquent. This suggests that, as with most issues that involve law and justice, efficiency may not be the only relevant consideration. The US legal system is arguably inefficient in the sense that it does not attempt to minimize the sum of type I and type II errors in determining guilt. Instead, by putting the burden on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the justice system implicitly considers the conviction of innocents to be a much more significant error than allowing the guilty to retain their freedom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1091142112461687">6</xref>
</sup> In terms of tax amnesties, it could be argued that deterring the strategically delinquent is normatively more important than excluding the incidentally delinquent. Still, in making such a determination, it would be informative for policy makers to know just how commonplace strategic delinquency is by means of its effect on revenue collections.</p>
<p>This article attempts to estimate the existence and extent of strategic tax delinquency in response to upcoming tax amnesties. This is done by explaining year-over-year changes in per capita state tax revenues in the quarters immediately preceding tax amnesty programs. After controlling for other relevant determinants, the main variables of interest relate to whether or not those who become delinquent during the pre-amnesty period remain eligible to participate in an upcoming amnesty. The exclusion increases revenue collections in pre-amnesty quarters by a margin that is substantively significant, and therefore suggests a deterrent effect on strategic tax planning. The result is robust to model specification, alternative dependent variable definitions, and limiting the sample to states with similar tax structures. The strongest findings are found when potential endogeneity in the use of the exclusion is treated with instrument variable estimation.</p>

<title>Empirical Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1091142112461687">
<title>Identification Approach</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091142112461687">Allingham and Sandmo (1972)</xref> model of tax evasion informs the incentives created by tax amnesty programs to motivate the empirical approach of this article.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1091142112461687">7</xref>
</sup> In this model, taxpayers’ reported income is directly related to the probability of detection and the penalties imposed if they are caught. Consider first an amnesty program that would occur in the next period and carries no complementary enforcement policy changes, so the penalties from evasion in the current period decline. In this instance, any taxpayers with a positive discount rate can increase the present value of their wealth by underreporting their taxable liabilities or likewise delaying fixed payments (i.e., negative cash flows) into the future. If this same amnesty program restricts participation eligibility to only those who were delinquent prior to the program announcement, that is, prior to the current period, then there is no gain to delaying a tax payment or under reporting tax liabilities beyond what already exists in the program’s absence. On the other hand, if the amnesty program permits participation among all delinquents prior to the program’s execution, then delaying tax payments carries a more positive net present value to strategic delinquency than would occur in the absence of the amnesty. The identification of strategic tax delinquency behavior, therefore, will come from comparing revenue collection when upcoming amnesties exclude new and recently delinquent tax liabilities (<italic>Exclude<sub>i,t</sub>
</italic>) to those which do not.</p>
<p>The empirical model can begin with a specification designed to explain pre-amnesty quarterly tax revenue collection per capita for state <italic>i</italic> in period <italic>t</italic>, <italic>R<sub>i,t</sub>
</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091142112461687">Le Borgne (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091142112461687">Mikesell and Ross (2012)</xref> have demonstrated that, over time, amnesty periods have increasingly followed recessionary periods of fiscal stress, which suggests that control variables for business-cycle effects (<bold>
<italic>X<sub>i,t</sub>

While post-amnesty enforcement programs would be irrelevant to a strategic tax evader looking to delay their tax payments until amnesty, post-amnesty enforcement would affect the general return to all forms of evasion, which may confound the results if the correlation between the exclusion variable and the post-amnesty programs is not zero.<sup>

<title>Why Do Some Amnesty Programs Exclude the Recently Delinquent?</title>
<p>Ideally, for the purpose of our study, the exclusion of the recently delinquent would be a randomly assigned feature of the amnesty program. The second best case is that the <italic>Exclude</italic> variable is exogenous to the model specified in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1091142112461687">equation (3)</xref>, so that it is not endogenously determined by the change in pre-amnesty tax revenue. Specifically, if states perceive that the announcement of the amnesty will spur strategic delinquency among the population and become more likely to adopt the exclusion, then it would introduce a negative bias in the coefficient on <italic>Exclude</italic>, and cause it to underestimate the level of strategic delinquency. In other words, the nature of the endogeneity problem works <italic>against</italic> ordinary least squares (OLS) detecting the hypothesized behavior. As such, the main results of the article begin with OLS as the more conservative test, and then repeat the analysis with instrument variable estimation.</p>
<p>Understanding why some programs exclude the recently delinquent can be informative of the potential for endogeneity in the <italic>Exclude</italic> variable, as well as what possible instruments might be valid. In the course of our research, we were never able to uncover any public discussion of this exclusion in the context of strategic delinquency, even when it was determined by legislative statute to authorize the amnesty program, suggesting that such behavior is likely not considered. Instead, most discussion concerns whether the administrative personnel can simultaneously process delinquent claims and execute the amnesty program. Delinquency-collection programs and staff are most active on new accounts, and typically spend fewer resources chasing older accounts. When recent delinquents are eligible for the amnesty, staff from collection departments can wind up devoting resources to pursuing overdue taxpayers who have already applied for amnesty. This requires greater coordination between the regular collection staff and those of the amnesty program to help identify which accounts have applied for amnesty, as well as those whose applications are likely to be approved. Furthermore, the preparation and marketing of an amnesty program often involves generating lists of known-but-uncollected accounts. This list serves the dual function of providing a targeted population for direct mailings of amnesty notices, and allowing administrators to gauge program needs pertaining to staffing and resource allocation. For these reasons, states tend to anchor the exclusion date to significant points in the fiscal or tax administration year, such as July 1, April 1, or January 1. </p>
<p>Aside from administrative issues, the other theme that appears in determining the exclusion of the recently delinquent is a mimicry-of-features behavior among the states. There is a notable tendency for states to repeat either the policies of their previous amnesty offering, or to mimic another state’s recent program. For instance, in 2010 when Pennsylvania would once again exclude the recently delinquent, their after-action report simply notes that the program was modeled after its 1995 predecessor, and there is no discussion of maintaining the normal flow of delinquent revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1091142112461687">Pennsylvania Department of Revenue 2010</xref>). Similarly, the after-action report for the 2005 amnesty program in Indiana indicates that the other program features were based on a case review of ten recent amnesty programs in other states, adopting advice they received from administrators in those states on running the program without overburdening the existing staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091142112461687">Indiana Department of Revenue 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the exclusion is motivated by administrative issues like marketing and staffing, or by mimicking previous programs, the policy of excluding the recently delinquent from amnesty participation appears to be random with respect to the potential for strategic delinquency and the year-over-year change in tax revenues. Again, to the extent this is not true, OLS will be biased toward finding no strategic delinquency.</p>
<p>This administrative burden as a determinant of the exclusionary period motivates the choice of instrument variables used for IV/2SLS estimates. While there are no data we are aware of that informs a state’s administrative capacity, we can look to other variables which are known to have some relationship to state administrative burden and resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1091142112461687">11</xref>
</sup>  States have historically piggy-backed their tax compliance efforts off the federal government’s audit process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091142112461687">Dubin, Graetz, and Wilde 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1091142112461687">Birskyte 2008</xref>), so states that have routinely been among the most audited are less reliant on their own administrative systems for compliance. The only major available data on federal audits by states come from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse of Syracuse University between 1997 and 2001, so we adopt the dummy variable approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091142112461687">Mikesell and Ross (2012)</xref> in estimating the amount of amnesty recovery, coded “1” if a state averaged a top-fifteen ranking in federal audits between 1997 and 2001. Additionally, having a corporate income tax is another state characteristic which increases administrative burden because states conduct audits and help identify nexus. Being a historically high audit state (<italic>High Audit</italic>) and not having a corporate income tax (<italic>No CIT</italic>) are both negatively correlated with the use of an exclusionary period prior to amnesty. The use of these dummies is intended to instrument for the use of the exclusion.<sup>

</sup> Data definitions are discussed in the Data and Identifying Relevant Periods Prior to Amnesty subsection and first-stage instrument variable diagnostics are reviewed with the results in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section5-1091142112461687">
<title>Data Considerations in Model Derivation</title>
<p>This section discusses the implications for model choice in employing total per capita tax revenue for the dependent variable. States are often selective in declaring which tax bases qualify for amnesty. For instance, sales tax or corporate income tax liabilities might be excluded from eligibility. Even when states announce that “all” taxes are eligible, as is common in policy there are many footnotes to these proclamations that exclude particular taxes or types of taxpayers from amnesty. As a first pass, the definition for estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1091142112461687">equation (3)</xref> will use only changes in revenues that are derived from taxes unambiguously eligible for the state’s amnesty program, hereto referred to as “amnesty eligible revenue.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1091142112461687">13</xref>
</sup> This carries the advantage of only looking at revenues that will ultimately be allowed to participate in the amnesty, though the definition is not likely collectively exhaustive and misses some revenues which are eligible. A natural alternative would have been to employ control variables for the types of taxes that are omitted from the amnesty program, but there was not enough commonality in the type of taxes being excluded across amnesties to produce estimable coefficients.</p>
<p>As a second pass to estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1091142112461687">equation (3)</xref>, changes in total tax revenue collections will be employed as the dependent variable. There are three primary reasons to consider total revenue as the dependent variable as opposed to the amnesty eligible counterpart. First, it will include revenues which may be eligible for amnesty, but are not statutorily clear enough to be included the first proposed measure of “amnesty eligible.” Second, in the delinquency calculus, there may be complementary effects between taxes. That is, taxpayers who engage in strategic delinquency to participate in the tax amnesty for some taxes might become delinquent in additional taxes as well. Similarly, taxpayers with a questionable nexus in a state can face multiple taxes, but they might be more likely to come forward during an amnesty, even if that amnesty does not encompass their entire delinquent tax burden.</p>
<p>The third reason pertains to the role of accounts receivable and how the Census of Governments surveys state revenue sources. One of the largest determinants of tax amnesty collections is whether taxes in accounts receivable are eligible in the amnesty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091142112461687">Mikesell 1986</xref>). These amnesty collections from taxpayers in accounts receivable are largely illusionary in terms of recovered funds, as the state tax administrators were already aware of the amount owed, had an identified taxpayer, and were capable of taking action to collect the unpaid liabilities. When states collect through accounts receivable, it is categorized as miscellaneous general tax revenue for the period. Since the money does not get identified by the original delinquent tax, it will be missed by amnesty relevant revenue measures if the amnesty only applies to particular taxes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1091142112461687">
<title>Data and Identifying Relevant Periods Prior to Amnesty</title>
<p>To our knowledge, there is no database identifying relevant restrictions in the eligibility period for state tax amnesties. As such, we relied on a multitude of sources in collecting this data: state statutes, tax administration press releases, newspaper articles in LexisNexis, and correspondence with state tax administrators.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1091142112461687">14</xref>
</sup> As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142112461687">table 1</xref>, of the 106 amnesty programs in the data set, 81 of them excluded the recently delinquent. The earliest exclusion comes in North Dakota in 1983, the second year in which states started offering tax amnesties and within the first five amnesties overall. In 1984, four of the seven state amnesties carried an exclusionary period. Among states offering amnesties repeatedly, they largely appear to copy whatever they did in the previous amnesties in terms of creating exclusions for the recently delinquent, which is not particularly surprising since states often model their programs on their previous experience. When they do change over time, more often than not they are adding exclusionary periods to the programs, though this is not always the case. Louisiana and New York both excluded the recently delinquent in their earlier amnesties but not in a later program.</p>

<p>Of the amnesties that excluded the recently delinquent, the duration of this exclusion also varied from 0.2 to 3.0 years prior to the amnesty’s starting date, with the mean exclusionary period lasting 0.8 years. The mean exclusionary period is somewhat skewed upward with a median duration of 0.67 years, and twenty amnesty programs excluded those who became delinquent more than one year prior to the beginning of the program. States tend to anchor the exclusion date to July 1, April 1, or January 1, all of which tend to be significant dates for the fiscal or tax administration year. This is supportive of the earlier observation that the exclusion period is often determined on the basis of administrative record keeping rather than on foresight of strategic tax planning.</p>
<p>The remaining significant issue in identifying the treatment effect is defining the relevant periods prior to an amnesty. It would be expected that the behavioral response of strategic tax planning would be between the amnesty start <italic>and</italic> the point in time in which the taxpayer could reasonably count on the amnesty actually occurring. In recent amnesties, the political debate, legislative process, and administrative preparation cumulatively appear to take several months to a year prior to the actual implementation of the amnesty period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1091142112461687">15</xref>
</sup> The Pennsylvania 2010 amnesty was on the faster side with about six months between authorization, although this short notice may be misleading as the program was part of a budget bill whose controversial spending cuts delayed its passage more than 100 days from the budget due date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1091142112461687">Murphy 2009</xref>). Indiana’s 2005 program was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Ways and Means Committee on January 6, more than nine months before the program began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091142112461687">Indiana Department of Revenue 2006</xref>). Ohio’s 2012 general tax amnesty program was first introduced to the fiscal 2012–2013 budget bill twelve months prior to the amnesty start date. After reviewing Lexus-Nexus newspaper articles from the 1980s, it is our impression that the process unfolded over a similar time frame in the cases of the earliest amnesties as well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1091142112461687">16</xref>

</sup> For instance, New York’s 2005 amnesty did not exclude the recently delinquent, whereas the 2003 program in North Dakota only excluded those within three months of the amnesty. The other states in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1091142112461687">table 2</xref> exclude the recently delinquent for at least six months. If the data set is limited to the two quarters (within six months) prior to the amnesty, the estimation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1091142112461687">equation (3)</xref> would pick up the variation coming from New York being considered an “Exclude” in both periods and North Dakota being considered an “Exclude” in <italic>t</italic> − 2 only, while all the others take “Allow” values. If the data set is expanded to being within three calendar quarters of the amnesty period, New York and North Dakota would continue being “Exclude” counterfactuals, but it would also add the Indiana 2005 amnesty that only excluded those becoming delinquent in the first two quarters from participation.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1091142112461687">Figure 1</xref> provides a bar graph comparing the means of these quarters, both with and without the exclusion. In a simple comparison of averages, amnesty programs excluding the recently delinquent in a given quarter experience higher growth rates than states that do not. The exception is in the quarter immediately prior to the amnesty, where those without the exclusion have a higher average growth rate. One possibility for that kind of effect is that it actually takes time to become delinquent in the eyes of the state tax administration. A firm or household deciding to intentionally become delinquent and pay later in the amnesty period would be less likely to have the time to be far enough “past due” in order to be eligible as a delinquent account.</p>

<p>Turning attention now to other controls employed in the regressions, year fixed effects are included to help reduce national fluctuations not specific to the state, and quarter fixed effects are included because tax administration constraints are often thought to vary across the year.

<p>Five amnesty programs were eliminated from the data set because they occurred within two years of a previous amnesty program in the same state, which confounds the revenue collection data for the year-over-year revenue change variables. There was also missing quarterly data for the amnesty eligible revenue (subcomponents of total revenue) that caused a loss of eight and twelve observations in the nine- and twelve-month samples of data, respectively. Another twenty-six amnesty programs are missing because we could not verify post-amnesty interest and penalties. An earlier version of this article excluded the post-amnesty variables and included the amnesties with missing post-program features, yet the results were substantively similar.<sup>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1091142112461687">Table 4</xref> provides the result of estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1091142112461687">equation (3)</xref> over quarters within nine and twelve months of an amnesty period’s starting date.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1091142112461687">20</xref>
</sup> The first-differenced measure of revenue collections are those derived from taxes which were eligible for amnesty, as described in the Data Considerations in Model Derivation subsection. To gauge the robustness of the findings, specifications differ with the inclusion of the business cycle control variables of per capita income and unemployment rate, as well as quarter and year fixed effects, but the “main” results include all of these controls appearing in columns F and L. Reported in parentheses are the heteroscedastic robust standard errors clustered by state and quarter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1091142112461687">21</xref>
</sup> All specifications control for whether the amnesty program was accompanied with a state program to either increase penalties and interest (<italic>Post Penalties</italic>) or some other enforcement (<italic>Post Enforce</italic>) program, which range from having the predicted positive effect on revenues to no effect. The main variable of interest is <italic>Exclude</italic>, which is the dummy variable identifying if a newly delinquent taxpayer would be excluded from participating in the amnesty. As hypothesized earlier in the article, a positive coefficient on <italic>Exclude</italic> is taken as evidence that taxpayers are more likely to stay current on their tax bills when they are not eligible for amnesty (<italic>Exclude</italic> = 1). Alternatively stated, they are more likely to strategically become delinquent when the upcoming amnesty will allow them to participate (<italic>Exclude</italic> = 0).</p>

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1091142112461687">table 4</xref>, the sign across all specifications is consistent with the hypothesis that there is strategic tax planning, as the coefficient on <italic>Exclude</italic> ranges from 0.020 to 0.066. For ease of interpretation, these estimates are compared to a pre-amnesty period that would otherwise experience a 1 percent increase in revenue collection from the previous year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1091142112461687">22</xref>
</sup> Looking first at the sample limited to quarters within nine months of amnesty, the point estimates of the main results in column F indicate that excluding the recently delinquent would increase amnesty eligible revenue collection rates by 0.041 percent. Expanding the sample to twelve months, the point estimate of the main result in column L suggests the exclusion creates a 0.064 percent increase. Both of these results are statistically significant at the 5 percent level.</p>

<title>Results with Total Tax Revenue as the Dependent Variable</title>
<p>In the <italic>Why Do Some Amnesty Programs Exclude the Recently Delinquent?</italic> subsection, the argument was made for the use of amnesty relevant tax revenue as the first metric for testing the presence of strategic tax delinquency. This section uses the more expansive measure of total tax revenue per capita. It is possible there are spillover effects with respect to delinquency, that is, a taxpayer finds it in their advantage to become delinquent in all taxes if they are to be delinquent in any, which may help them avoid detection, although it is also possible this would only add more noise to the regression error. One final additional advantage of this measure is that the coefficients can be compared to the average amnesty recovery as a share of state total tax revenue, which was 0.7 percent during this period.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1091142112461687">Table 5</xref> presents the results for the same specifications from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1091142112461687">table 4</xref>, but with this alternative dependent variable. The results are similarly consistent with strategic delinquency, but with slightly smaller coefficients and generally lower statistical significance levels owing to the fact it is including revenues which rely upon spillover delinquency into noneligible revenues. The main results of 0.030 in column F and 0.046 in column L represent 4.3 and 6.4 percent, respectively of the average amnesty recovery.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The announcement of an amnesty period potentially allows unknown tax evaders to voluntarily reveal themselves to the authorities in the near future, ideally for the purpose of becoming permanently compliant taxpayers. Much of the policy concern and attention from academics has been in the ability of the amnesty to permanently improve long-run compliance, as it may have the unintended consequence of revealing tax evasion as a profitable pursuit or by causing the perception that amnesty will be a frequently reoccurring phenomenon (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091142112461687">Alm, McKee, and Beck 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091142112461687">Luitel and Sobel 2007</xref>). This article suggests that another possibility is that an announced amnesty will cause some compliant taxpayers to become temporarily delinquent, effectively treating the state as a short-term loan officer. In doing so, this article also contributes to the broader literature on strategic tax planning and delinquency.</p>
<p>To study this moral hazard problem, this article makes use of variation in amnesty eligibility exclusion periods, which is generally a short time prior to the amnesty’s beginning for which a taxpayer cannot become delinquent and still participate in the amnesty. If these exclusions prevent some taxpayers from becoming strategically delinquent, their quarterly state tax revenues during pre-amnesty periods should be greater than those which do not carry such an exclusion.</p>
<p>In all cases, the first-differenced regression estimates provided signs that are consistent with the behavior of strategic tax planning. Though statistical significance is sensitive, the magnitude and direction of the effect across different model specifications, sample choice, and revenue definition in the dependent variable are robust. The point estimates from OLS indicated that about 4.3 to 6.4 percent of an average amnesty’s recovery came from strategically delayed payments, whereas IV/2SLS put the range at 12.9 to 16.5 percent.</p>
<p>If states wish to deter strategic tax planning and maintain constant revenue collections, then excluding new delinquents appears to be a successful strategy. Alternatively, if the cost–benefit analysis on a potential amnesty program is being conducted, then the results also imply that the new revenue estimate should be discounted by 4 to 16 percent. The results are the strongest in examining the revenue from tax instruments eligible for amnesty, suggesting that policy makers are not experiencing a spillover of delinquencies by limiting amnesty offering to certain types of tax instruments.</p>
<p>The trade-off to the policy of excluding the recently delinquent, of course, is that taxpayers who would become delinquent even in the absence of the amnesty are also not capable of participating. Since the cost of the exclusion is forgoing incidentally delinquent taxpayers, this article’s estimates also provide a normative benchmark as the cost of their exclusion. Future research might examine the size of the group behaving strategically relative to the group which enters delinquency for reasons independent of the amnesty.</p>

<p>This article deals exclusively with state governments, which have been running temporary amnesty programs since 1981. The US Bureau of Internal Revenue did operate a “permanent amnesty” program at the federal level from 1919 to 1952 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091142112461687">Andreoni 1991</xref>, 144). Many states also have a voluntary disclosure program that forgives criminal prosecution to self-reporting evaders. The Multistate Tax Commission also operates a Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program that permanently runs in place to allow a non-filer to negotiate a settlement for back liability for taxpayers with nexus in multiple states.</p>

<p>To be clear, the exclusion applies to the age of the unpaid liability, rather than the point in time when a taxpayer first became delinquent. For example, a taxpayer’s income tax bill may be due in March or April for income earned in the previous calendar year, and so they would not become delinquent until thirty to sixty days after that tax bill’s due date. However, the taxpayer’s ability to participate in the amnesty would depend on whether the liability’s calendar year is eligible.</p>

<p>An IV/2SLS approach was attempted with program mimicking intuition described by program administrators. The instruments tested included the use of an exclusion in a previous program, and the share of the amnesty programs which excluded the recently delinquent in the most recent year with an amnesty. Though these instruments were statistically significant determinants of excluding the recently delinquent, they failed every traditional instrument diagnostic test. For instance, the <italic>F</italic>-statistic on the exclusion of the instrument was less than 2 in all specifications, and Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests for endogeneity failed to reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity with <italic>p</italic> values in the range of .30 to .90.</p>

<p>Most amnesty programs are legislatively authorized, but a few have been at the will of tax administrators or at the request of the state executive branch. However, even in these cases, it is clearly not a politically opaque process, but one that seems to occur with the permission or cheerleading of major political actors.</p>

<p>For example, the New York 1985 amnesty was formally introduced to Legislature in February, passed in April, and executed in November (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091142112461687">Gargan 1985</xref>). Virginia’s legislature authorized an amnesty that began February 1, 1990, in a bill that passed in March of the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1091142112461687">Virginia Department of Taxation 1989</xref>). </p>

<p>Also attempted where some controls for additional state characteristics introduced ad hoc to the first-differenced model, such as whether or not the state had previously executed an amnesty program before and whether or not they had a voluntary disclosure program. Their effect was substantively small with very low <italic>t</italic>-statistics, suggesting their potential influence was a fixed effect and therefore mitigated by the first differencing.</p>

<p>Limiting the data to quarters within six months of an amnesty yields results that are very similar to the reported values within nine months, but with smaller <italic>t</italic>-statistics. They are omitted for space but are available upon request.</p>

<p>Clustering standard errors is used to mitigate cross-sectional and or/or serial correlation, such as that documented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091142112461687">Gow, Ormazabal, and Taylor 2010</xref>. Stata code used to cluster standard errors came from “cluster2” program by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1091142112461687">Petersen (2009)</xref> and “ivreg2” program by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091142112461687">Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2010)</xref>.
