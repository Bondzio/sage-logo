<abstract>
<p>This article explores how 14 diverse, Canadian activist–facilitators working in international development experience and understand <italic>critical reflection</italic> as a component of participatory methodologies in facilitation practices. The findings, based on my doctoral study, demonstrate that although critical reflection is often discussed as integral to participatory approaches of facilitation using critical pedagogies, understandings and experiences of what that means in practice vary. For example, study participants often expressed practicing critical reflection through technical-rational approaches and seldom distinguished between critical reflection, reflexivity, and reflection. The findings illustrate three main challenges to applying critical reflection in practice: (1) time and value given to critical reflection; (2) institutional requirements; and (3) personal vulnerability. The results have implications for critical feminist pedagogies, including the development of critically reflective practices that challenge dominant ideologies and hierarchical power structures. The study demonstrates lessons for deepening pedagogical practices around critical reflection and reflexivity.</p>

<title>Critical Reflection in the Work of Activist–Facilitators</title>
<p>How do women’s rights and gender equality activists<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1541344613488834">1</xref>
</sup> understand and apply critical reflection in their facilitation work? This was one of the key questions in doctoral study, <italic>Toward transformative learning and a transnational feminist pedagogy: Experiences of activist-facilitators working in development </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541344613488834">Hanson, 2009</xref>). The study critically examines the nonformal education and facilitation practices of activists involved in advocating for women’s rights and gender equality in the context of transnational development work.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1541344613488834">2</xref>
</sup> This article explains aspects of that study, as they relate to critical reflection. It begins by introducing the study and explaining the relevance of critical reflection to the field of literature on critical and feminist pedagogies—or more specifically, participatory methodologies. The findings are then presented using quotes from the study participants in order to demonstrate and draw conclusions about how critical reflection is understood in practice. I conclude by suggesting areas to inform further research.</p>
<p>Most of the workshops facilitated by the study participants can be described as nonformal learning or training about gender awareness or women’s rights or the integration of these themes into other areas of work. The training workshops can vary in length from one day to ongoing series of training sessions that are part of a larger international development project. Additionally, some study participants worked with labor or social movements within Canada; all had experience facilitating in local and international contexts. As a feminist educator<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1541344613488834">3</xref>
</sup> with experiences working locally and internationally for women’s rights and gender equality, I was keen to learn about critical feminist pedagogies<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1541344613488834">4</xref>
</sup> in practice—specifically the use of participatory processes that are assumed to have both personal and social transformation potential—in the context of nonformal adult education. At the interface of transformative learning, participatory development, and activism, there is an assumed convergence of beliefs based on social transformation and the elimination of inequalities. In the interview excerpt that follows, for example, a transformative learning process of facilitation is described by Alicia:<disp-quote>
<p>I was working with a team of women from South America and Central America on the issue of violence against women. There were strong tensions due to differences in race, class, politics and whether or not each woman considered herself a feminist or not. In order to resolve the tensions, we spent a lot of time sitting together around the table listening to each other. In the end, our shared understanding of what we were to cover in the workshop broadened. Violence against women had to be defined in broader terms. It had to be defined by the women. The women from South America, who had lived more years in Canada, were more focused on domestic violence; while the Central American women, who were recent refugees, were focused on the violence women experience in war and at the hands of repressive governments. In the end, the analysis for both groups shifted as they listened to each other …. The trick is to keep it [workshop content] broad enough to be inclusive of different realities … to include different perspectives and then find a shared focus of attention.</p>
</disp-quote>This quote from Alicia illustrates some of the complex and intersecting concepts explored by activist–facilitators working in international development, such as place, position, and power.</p>
<p>I define the research paradigm as feminist because of its concern with lived experience, difference, reflexivity, action, and emotion. From my own experience, I queried how critical reflection informed facilitation practices and how power is recognized in relationships between the facilitator and the learners as agents of transformation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire (1970</xref>) speaks about a reciprocal relationships and <italic>co-intentionality of practice</italic> between learners and instructors, but feminists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613488834">Goldstein (2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541344613488834">Lather (1993)</xref> point out that power dynamics in practice often involve educators speaking to learners about power dynamics in society, without fully interrogating the “ways in which they [educators] too are complicit in the dominant culture forms and practices that continue to marginalize their students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613488834">Goldstein, 2007</xref>, p. 19). These authors, along with feminists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344613488834">Lykes and Coquillon (2007</xref>), challenge critical reflection that is conceptualized as static or detached by the learning dynamic itself, and place more attention on critical reflection in praxis through a reflexive position. Therefore, transformative models of education often suggest using participatory methodologies, which require that facilitators and participants embrace a process of naming issues in order to transform power relations or challenge conditions of oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613488834">Brookfield, 2000</xref>). Lykes and Coquillon, for example, note a particular concern of feminist thought and notions of transformation—that is, it is only possible with praxis—a process of critical reflection and action informed by theory wherein the learner and facilitator deepen the process about <italic>conscientization</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1541344613488834">5</xref>
</sup> of circumstance and <italic>their</italic> respective position within it. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541344613488834">Caffarella and Merriam (2000</xref>), experience, meaning making, and critical reflection are key components of transformative learning.</p>

<title>Conceptual Understandings and Feminist Positions</title>
<p>An extensive literature search by D’Cruz, Gillingham, and Melendes (2007) reiterates that, despite different definitions, the concepts of reflection, reflexivity, and critical reflection are sometimes used interchangeably. Reflexivity and critical reflection, however, are frequently treated as interrelated in that critical reflection on action can often lead to a questioning of power and social relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613488834">Jacobs (2008</xref>) proposes that the act of reflection as an individual act of introspection can lead to looking outward at the social, cultural, or historical context that shapes oneself, thus becoming an act of reflexivity. Reflexivity more specifically addresses the position of the educator in relation to place, power, and representation because it challenges the actors to critically reflect on their position individually and socially (D’Cruz, Gillingham, &amp; Melendes, 2007). It is the questioning of relations of power and knowledge in these concepts which is essential to transformative theories of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613488834">D’Cruz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613488834">Gray (2007</xref>) distinguishes between <italic>reflection</italic> as a personal process that “mediates between experience, knowledge and action” (p. 495) and <italic>critical reflection</italic> as “incorporating a focus on the questioning of assumptions and social rather than individual perspectives, as well as attention to the analysis of power relations” (p. 496). Some literature suggests practitioners actually resist critical perspectives on reflection and an analysis about how power relationships are apparent in learning situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613488834">Hoffman-Kipp, Artiles, &amp; Lopez-Torres, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613488834">Jacobs, 2008</xref>). Many feminists using critical pedagogies, however, point out that educators are frequently “implicated in the very structures they are trying to change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344613488834">Ellsworth, 1992</xref>, p. 101). As a feminist educator, I questioned this paradox, that is, how facilitation practices assist in creating conditions for transformative learning, and conversely, how they contribute to dominant knowledge systems. The springboard for this study involved reflection on my personal decadelong history with critical pedagogy, participatory development, and ongoing explorations into theories and practices of transnational feminism.<sup>

<title>Situating Critical Pedagogy and Practice in the Literature</title>
<p>Critical reflection on experience and the role it plays in community transformation is considered one of the major contributions from the field of adult education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541344613488834">Ewert &amp; Grace, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613488834">Brookfield (2000</xref>, p. 33) described a key tenet of a critically reflective practice as one which focuses on adult educators as inquirers into their personal practice and politics. He explains that such practices ask educators to examine “the social function of adult education (particularly unchallenged dominant values and social systems) and the way their own practice reproduces patterns of inequity.”</p>
<p>Freire’s influence on understanding the relations and dynamics between critical reflection and transformative education is widely discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613488834">Brookfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613488834">Cranton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344613488834">Darder, Baltodano, &amp; Torres, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541344613488834">Lather, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344613488834">van Woerkom, 2008</xref>). Critical reflection, conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire (1970</xref>) in his seminal work <italic>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic>, is envisioned as the creation of a space for generating new knowledge about how lived experiences can become more democratic, more participatory, and more dynamic. Freire was concerned about how individuals internalize oppression, how they arrive at critical consciousness or awareness about that oppression, and then, how they act, ostensibly through praxis, to transform inequitable power relations. His discussion of the <italic>co-intentionality of practice</italic> by facilitators and learners assumes an interactive engagement, where reflection,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1541344613488834">7</xref>
</sup> in a dialectical relationship with theory and action, is an essential component of praxis in the world. He states:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is only when the oppressed find the oppressor out and become involved in the organized struggle for their liberation that they begin to believe in themselves. This discovery cannot be purely intellectual but must involve action; nor can it be limited to mere activism, but must include serious reflection: only then will it be a praxis.… Reflection—true reflection—leads to action. On the other hand, when the situation calls for action, that action will constitute an authentic praxis only if its consequences become the object of critical reflection. (pp. 47–48)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Reflection is described as critical, as in this example, when there is a change in individual perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541344613488834">Mezirow, 1991</xref>) or when it leads to social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613488834">Brookfield, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire, 1970</xref>) or a combination of individual change leading to changes in social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344613488834">Fook, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The wealth of literature on critical and feminist pedagogies attests to the dynamic evolution of transformative approaches to learning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613488834">Gore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541344613488834">Darder et al., 2003</xref>). Not surprisingly, the discourse about critical and feminist pedagogies overlaps and intersects as one informs the other. There is no single unity in understanding these terms; rather, they are “complex and fragmented” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541344613488834">Gore, 2003</xref>, p. 332).</p>

<title>Conceptual Understandings of (Critical) Reflection</title>
<p>While planning an adult education handbook, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344613488834">Wilson and Hayes (2000</xref>) asked each contributing author to frame their discussions around critical reflection on the topic. They noticed that opinions varied widely, and they concluded that “many of us in adult education do not engage frequently or easily in critical reflection on our beliefs and practices” (p. 666). They were additionally concerned that when people are asked to reflect critically on their practices in retrospect, it makes the process too <italic>technorational</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1541344613488834">8</xref>
</sup> and fails to capture the human emotions in context. Importantly, they note that academic and institutional culture is one of the obstacles:
<disp-quote>
<p>The lack of time and rewards allocated for such reflection are symptomatic of a broader institutional culture that continues to be enmeshed in technical rationality. A critically reflective approach to practice threatens to challenge the status quo in such institutions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344613488834">Wilson &amp; Hayes, 2000</xref>, p. 669)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This perspective is reiterated by a study on interprofessional learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541344613488834">Karban &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>) where a gap was reported between learners who engage in technical–rational approaches and others who intentionally work toward transformative education goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541344613488834">Cranton (2006</xref>) explains this dynamic here:
<disp-quote>
<p>Critical reflection is the central process in transformative learning. Clearly, not all reflection leads to transformation; we can question things without changing them. To be transformative, reflection has to involve and lead to some fundamental change in perspective. (pp. 79–81)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some authors use the term conceptual slipperiness in discussing the term <italic>critical</italic> as it relates to thinking, reflection, and pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541344613488834">Burbules &amp; Berk, 1999</xref>), especially when there is an emphasis in reporting on outcomes and lessons learned rather than the complexities of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613488834">Brookfield (2008</xref>), who describes critical reflection as “conveniently vague” (p. 11), suggests that more examples of critical reflection in practice are required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1541344613488834">
<title>Detaching Critical Practice From Critical Pedagogy</title>
<p>Literature about critical reflection as it relates to critical pedagogy often focuses on the learners and ignores the role of the educator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613488834">Gruenwald, 2003</xref>). This incongruent position raises questions. Without critical reflection on the part of an instructor, how are practices of hegemony interrogated or changed? How is complicity in replicating existing practices and ideologies recognized? How does the activist–facilitator perpetuate dominant knowledge and power structures, and how do they simultaneously and differently resist propagating “regimes of truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541344613488834">Foucault, 1980</xref>)?</p>
<p>Feminist author, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613488834">Gore (1993</xref>), suggests that although critical pedagogues such as Giroux and McLaren provide hopeful visions of democratic societies, they fail to actualize that vision because they focus on “pedagogy as politics” (p. 42) instead of pedagogy as practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613488834">Goldstein (2007</xref>) reiterated this paradox by acknowledging that as a grad student she had “grasped what we, as critical educators, were supposed to do, but was unable to put the theory into practice … I could practice ‘critical theory’ but not critical pedagogy” (p. 17). She cautions about contradiction in this position by saying educators internalize the theory, but neglect to “interrogate the ways in which they too are complicit in the dominant culture forms and practices that continue to marginalize their students” (p. 19). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613488834">Goldstein (2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541344613488834">Ellsworth (1992</xref>) importantly demonstrate a gap in praxis or a lack of reflexivity on the part of practitioners or more worrisome, a detachment between critical theory and practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1541344613488834">
<title>Critically Reflective Facilitation: Relating Theory and Practice</title>
<p>With an emphasis on reporting about technical aspects of learning, frequently required by funders, the role of critical reflection as a way of achieving a deeper understanding of the determinants of social change is further diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541344613488834">de Groot &amp; Maarleveld, 2000</xref>). In the context of participatory, international development practices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541344613488834">de Groot (2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344613488834">Chambers (2005</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541344613488834">Matlanyane Sexwale (1996</xref>) all argue for a more reflexive practice on the part of facilitators. Matlanyane Sexwale says simplifying the complexities of facilitation is harmful to goals of equality because tools and frameworks which are globalized and “popularized and sometimes made imperative by funding agencies and the development industry … are seldom subjected to theoretical and political interrogation but, rather commonly, they are evoked and sanctified” (p. 60). Using her doctoral work in Africa as the context for her comments, de Groot similarly asks for a critical perspective on facilitation work and an examination of the paradoxes within. She writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>… facilitators are critical variables in the success of participatory interventions addressing complex issues, involving multiple interrelated factors and actors.… Therefore, an important step for facilitators who are serious about participation is not to reach for the latest handbook on participatory techniques, but to clean up their own act by critically reflecting on their own assumptions, values, interests and practices. The uncritical application of “participatory” methods in facilitation may “get things done” but may also reinforce the very practices that in theory they were meant to change. (p. 190)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541344613488834">Chambers (2005</xref>) adds that the transformative potentials of development are possible only when participation and critical reflection are positioned as central to the process. In many respects, the process of conducting interviews with activist–facilitators who constantly cross-national, cultural, ideological, and pedagogical borders involves a search for a transformative practice. The quest is, however, not straight forward as the literature cautions.</p>

<sec id="section7-1541344613488834">
<title>Study Relevance</title>
<p>Although the literature asserts that praxis informed by critical reflection is essential for transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541344613488834">Arnold, Burke, James, Martin, &amp; Thomas, 1991</xref>), it also indicates the practice of critical reflection is nuanced. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu (2006</xref>, p. 184) suggests that critical reflection in participatory processes is “seldom questioned or examined,” while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613488834">Jacobs (2008</xref>) notes that technical reflection is more common than critical reflection. Jacobs states that by neglecting critical reflection in practice one ignores how learning fits “within a wider social, political and cultural context” (p. 228) which can contribute to an “apolitical, liberal humanist world view” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541344613488834">Hoffman-Kipp et al., 2003</xref>). While critical reflection is considered “central to many theories of higher-level learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344613488834">van Woerkom, 2008</xref>, p. 3), literature on how critical reflection is experienced or understood by facilitators is modest, particularly, as it relates to nonformal education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613488834">Jacobs, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613488834">Brookfield (2008</xref>) notes that while an abundance of empirical work has been done on the subject of transformative learning, “few actual case studies exist of critical reflection in practice” (p. 95). This study made an attempt to fill that gap by asking how critical reflection is understood and experienced by educator–facilitators; how critical reflection leads to transformation; and how it informs pedagogy. For facilitators or educators using delivery methods inspired by popular education<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1541344613488834">9</xref>
</sup> and participatory methodologies, there is an assumption that transformation is the ultimate goal. This assumption emerges from the critical theories that inform critical and feminist pedagogies and suggest that when learners start to name or interpret their world, they enter into critical awareness of the world which can lead to social change and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire, 1970</xref>). By further exploring the meaning and practice of critical reflection, I attempted to deepen the analysis around the practice of critical reflection and avoid the simplification of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu (2006</xref>) refers to as the “nuts and bolts” approach. By directly relating the phenomenon of critical reflection to the practice of facilitators working across transnational borders, I hoped to inform critically reflective facilitation with firsthand narratives from experience.</p>

<p>The process of finding study participants was initially conducted by sending posters via e-mails to international development organizations and networks. Many participants were referred by others. The study participants were a diverse group of 14 Canadian women (no men inquired) whose experiences as facilitators of women’s rights and gender equality workshops or training programs varied. Participants varied in age from their mid-20s to mid-60s. Some had worked primarily for unions or nongovernmental organizations, while others had worked primarily on bilateral, government-funded projects or for agencies of the United Nations. All the study participants had some postsecondary education; about one third had training in popular education methodologies. Participation in the study included the requirement that participants were engaged in using participatory methodologies in their facilitation practice. Participatory methodologies were broadly understood as framed within critical and/or feminist pedagogies or popular education.</p>

<title>Adapting Study Methods</title>
<p>This inquiry is rooted in a transnational feminist pedagogical perspective that draws on several intellectual traditions. This perspective recognizes and elaborates on poststructural thought to the extent that it demonstrates the very act of speaking about an experience, culturally, and discursively, constitutes that experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541344613488834">Maynard &amp; Purvis, 1994</xref>). The researcher, therefore, enters the research, aware of their situated position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541344613488834">Ramazanoğlu &amp; Holland, 2002</xref>) and their task in listening and interpreting participant experience, including how it is framed by dimensions such as culture, race, ethnicity, and place: “Their descriptions are, at the same time, a construction of the events that occurred, together with an interpretation of them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541344613488834">Maynard &amp; Purvis, 1994</xref>, p. 23).</p>
<p>Through the 14 unstructured interviews and two focus groups, the study participants were questioned about pedagogical experiences and political aspects of their facilitation work. This work was later supplemented by written reflections. The questions remained flexible to respond to participant responses as they arose and as a result, the dialogue was more like a conversation. For example, questions about critical reflection frequently resulted in long pauses from the participants; accordingly, I invited participants to add written statements to supplement their oral responses. Because the written responses seldom distinguished between reflection and critical reflection, the data reported do not clearly identify which kind of reflection the participants are referring to.</p>
<p>After the first focus group, several participants suggested that I be a participant in the study and I agreed to do so. I provided the study questions to a colleague at another university who interviewed me. The focus groups, held in Vancouver and Ottawa (Canada), provided an unusual opportunity for the activist–facilitators, many of whom work as consultants and feel isolated in their work, to come together as a community of practice. It also provided opportunities to share personal experiences working in development with larger concerns about pedagogical practice. Several of the focus group participants knew each other from previous work and this collegiality along with the sharing of food created a relaxed atmosphere. In total, 9 of the 14 study participants participated in the focus groups. All of the participants were individually interviewed. The rich data from the interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and sorted thematically. The findings related to critical reflection are presented here with pseudonyms used to protect the identity of the participants.<sup>

<title>Findings of the Study</title>
<p>The findings of the study support much of the literature. Although the data suggested that collaborations between educators and co-facilitators and advocating critical reflection as a personal and a professional practice increase the likelihood of critical reflection as a pedagogical practice, the findings also point to major challenges in application of critical reflection in practice.</p>
<sec id="section11-1541344613488834">
<title>Critical Reflection as a Pedagogical Practice</title>
<p>Activist–facilitators overwhelmingly recognized the importance of critical reflection in a facilitation practice; however, they seldom differentiated between reflection and critical reflection, and more often than not, their responses were at a technical–rational level which can be differentiated from a perspective of <italic>praxis</italic> in its attention to techniques rather than more ethical or political questions. Rather than explaining a deliberate process of integrating theory and practice toward achieving praxis, or a way of analyzing assumptions or power relations (two important distinctions), participants described reflection at a technorational level by saying that it made them think about “what went well” and “what had to change.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541344613488834">Jacobs (2008</xref>) likened this to a form of resistance or an anxiety about change. Only one participant mentioned praxis. A few participants linked theory and practice and Kayla noted the importance of “the theory [being] embedded in the practice, and not the other way around.” The majority of the study participants linked critical reflection to some kind of assessment of the work, that is, something that took place <italic>after</italic> a workshop.</p>
<p>In the interview process, the participants confirmed the integral role of critical reflection to the work of facilitators and learners in the development process. Yet, when asked to provide examples of using critical reflection in facilitation practices, the responses included pauses, laughter, sighs, and reluctant comments about how important it is. Responses frequently focused on the learners not on facilitation practices. Participants felt that the critical reflection enhanced the process in various ways and as Carmin put it, “I don’t think that a lot of training or facilitation objectives are actually achievable without critical reflection.” Participants lamented, however, that critical reflection was seldom part of the process and, according to Kate, this affected a deeper analysis of the process:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a movement within all of the internal agencies toward results based management, and how that intersects with pedagogy. What counts again is what’s visible. The action part of education is what matters. The reflection part is gone and I think that connects to the analytical absence we discussed earlier. (Kate)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One participant suggested that critical reflection for learning and facilitation differed and while she acknowledged that the facilitator is also a learner, she said critical reflection on the facilitation of training event itself requires more of a conscious effort. She also discussed the importance of being in the moment and continually reflecting on design, process, intent, and choices during and after the workshop:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve never done a workshop where I haven’t learned something new. Like this workshop—a different way of seeing something, something new. The work for me is what keeps me in the work. But that for me is different than critical reflection on my practice … You really have to consciously decide to build that in. (Carol)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Importantly, study participants, like Carol, who were grounded in popular education methodologies were more likely to speak about critical reflection as an ongoing process and of the need to be perceptive in the moment.</p>
<sec id="section12-1541344613488834">
<title>Collaboration Helps</title>
<p>Several participants noted that, other than journaling, well-developed examples on how to practice critical reflection are not widely known. Communicating with others about an experience was an important way for many activists to exercise critical reflection. This occurred by meeting with another facilitator or with a team. Carol, for example, discussed how sharing stories from the field was an important pedagogical way to engage in critical reflection. She described one experience as being retreat-like—“We would work separately, then come together. We would share food for a few days. It was like a little retreat.” On some occasions, study participants explained critical reflections were part of the process, but they lamented that it could have gone farther. The following is an example of a team approach, described as <italic>grupitos</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was so rich. There are a number of us that still get together often. Not necessarily as a big group. It’s sort of <italic>grupitos</italic>—clusters of people.… On another level, but on a deeper level of critical reflection, I don’t think I have many opportunities to do that anymore because with somebody you don’t know and with whom you’re facilitating for the first time, you just go so deep in terms of reflection after your work. Maybe we just don’t allow time. (Carol)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When critical reflection was requested or built into assignments, either by another party or through a mutual understanding between facilitators, it was considered a rich learning experience. Examples of critical reflection intentionally considered part of facilitation and learning process, however, were few. Other examples, including conversations and formal writing, illustrate a different way critical reflection was practiced:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think what worked really well was facilitating with—and being able to sit down afterwards and say, “Let’s talk about what happened at that workshop.” Saying things like, “When we were co-facilitating and you said this, I felt that it set up a real power imbalance in the co-facilitation.” Saying that versus carrying it around with you makes us so much more conscious about what we do—when do we step in, when do we step out, all of those things. It made us better facilitators. And then writing made us think more deeply about the process. (Patti)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Levels of trust in the relationships also seemed to determine the depth of reflection. Examples that included team or collaborative approaches were common. However, this was not uniform; several participants preferred a more private reflection. The responses also illustrated how working with others is dependent upon relationships—the more familiar people were with each other, the farther the analysis and practice of critical reflection went. There were occasions, however, when the relationship was operating simply on a technical-rational basis; that is, discussions of power dynamics and a decentering of the facilitation practice was not present.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1541344613488834">
<title>Critical Reflection Is a Personal and a Professional Practice</title>
<p>Participants understood that critical reflection was a way of improving their own personal and professional practices and self-growth. As one participant expressed, “[It] will make your actions more thoughtful, more strategic, and more careful” (Yvonne). Others called it an honest assessment of self or a “reflection on choices” (Sara). One participant called it a “systematic, structured process of reviewing, reflecting on and critically analyzing experience with the specific purpose of learning from it, to become more effective” (Carmin).</p>
<p>The study participants defined critical reflection as a way of assessing the process dynamics, the facilitator–participant relationships, and the impact of their work. The emphasis on self-improvement or techniques expresses a technical-rational understanding of critical reflection. Yvonne, for example, noted the process of monitoring for participant engagement and responses was also a way of improving oneself as a facilitator. For several participants, it was not only a question of asking, “What am I doing and for whom?” but also questioning the ethics and politics of the work. Actually questioning the power relations in the facilitation process was a way of defining critical reflection as an aspect of praxis. Alicia gave an example of this when she said, “Critical reflection is the process of coming to understand an experience within the context that is shaped by power relations.” Jennifer linked it to the paradox of being a feminist working in mainstream development and said:
<disp-quote>
<p>[it’s like] trying to meet both needs [donor and self] and not trying to feel like someone who has compromised my own beliefs too much. Wanting to shake the earth and only making a ripple in the puddle… that’s how critical reflection feels to me. (Jennifer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several study participants defined critical reflection as a <italic>process</italic> of examining assumptions, choices, and interventions. In this way, both big political or ethical questions about the work being done and smaller questions about the strategy, techniques, and so on, were presented. As one participant put it, “It means not taking anything for granted” (Rachel). Participants also suggest that the process is continuous and once you choose a direction as a facilitator, then critical reflection “adds to the atmosphere of openness, encourages deeper analysis of facilitator-participant dynamics, and helps keep facilitators from getting into well-worn ruts” (Michele). Although participants understood a deeper analysis was frequently required for critical reflection, they acknowledged that an analysis of power relations was not common. Ultimately, one participant suggested, critical reflection and analysis function on making a difference which, albeit slowly, works to achieve change. She elaborated through retelling a story about a Nicaraguan acting troupe:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the end, one of the people in the audience said, “How do you keep doing that work? It is so hard and so awful! He [the actor] responded by saying, “I’m glad you asked that, because we always analyze what happens to us, so we will understand it, and because of that we know that the timeframe for change we’re working on is a 200-year one, so every step we take means those who come after us don’t have to take it.” That illustrates for me why critical reflection matters so much in work for a better world—it helps people locate the little bit one of us can do in the wider context of space and time for change, seeing clearly without losing hope. (Carmin)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As illustrated in Carmin’s story above, critical reflection contributes to a vision of change; such a change often involving relationships with oneself and others; a relationship central to facilitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1541344613488834">
<title>Challenges in the Pedagogical Practice of Critical Reflection</title>
<p>The findings of the study illustrate that the three main challenges in applying critical reflection in practice were (1) the need for time and value given to critical reflection in practice; (2) absence of institutional reporting; and (3) personal vulnerability. First, participants felt there was a lack of time and a sense that agencies did not value critical reflection. A sense of pessimism about institutional willingness to engage in critically reflective processes was dominant. For example, Patti said:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have this 12-hour thing, this 24-hour thing that ticks at us all the time and we’ve got funders asking for a different kind of relationship. It’s not about things being meaningful in people’s lives. It’s about an output at the end. Seldom do we have people who understand that need for critical reflection participating in that event. All of those things have to work in tandem or synchronously.… We pay lip service to it but I don’t know how much we practice. (Patti)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly citing time factors, Carol noted the contradictions in the practice of critical reflection stating the following:
<disp-quote>
<p> … being a facilitator—having to take on so many roles that you can’t reflect in that moment because there’s just no time. There is a real contradiction in terms of the amount of critical reflection and analysis that we do in our own practice—both the design and the actual facilitation—and what we preach to other people that they should be doing in their own practice, lives, or whatever it is that they’re trying to deal with. (Carol)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Jennifer noted that institutional obstacles related to time limits and funding pressures to produce outputs rather than reflect on process, create a disconnect between personal politics and institutional demands:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you’ve got globalization’s tentacles creeping further and further into more remote areas, what sort of power do these farmers have? … I think there is a naivety in some of the approaches we propose or put forward … I constantly reflect critically on the “gender training” I do in terms of, “Am I really getting people to question the status quo or is this just a blip on the screen that won’t make a difference a week from now?” There are the donor requirements for a workshop, and then there is what I really feel. (Jennifer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For some participants, a lapse of time was useful and enriching as they were more likely to realize the value of an experience. There was a clear difference in the way participants explained critical reflection as responding “in the moment” and taking time to reflect about the facilitation practice.</p>
<p>Participants felt that critical reflection made them more responsible for their actions—in many cases, this meant taking care of themselves and their activism within organizational structures and institutional practices that were not conducive to this practice. Sara discussed the importance of asking questions and using agency as a way to encourage praxis:
<disp-quote>
<p>It means that I take time to pause to assess the rationale and assumptions behind my actions in relating to others. I reflect on the truths or texts … I place emphasis on the questions and on the ways in which I contribute to group conversations. (Sara)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A second obstacle was reporting requirements by project funders. Participants expressed resentment that a funder’s demands or even willingness to accept that material affected their ability to report on it. Participants said projects not funded by bilateral or multilateral funding institutions are more likely to be accommodating of critical reflections in the discourse. Carmin illustrates this dilemma when she responds saying the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>We cannot get it through [the organization]. The more Politics, the more political the process, the less success we’ve had in getting any kind of critical reflection or even willingness. We were told <italic>they’d</italic> [<italic>sic</italic>] re-write anything we wrote anyway.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Third, study participants spoke of a sense of vulnerability and fear of critical reflection, in part due to their isolation (as consultants or as gender advisors on a project). When study participants associated critical reflection with criticism, their expressions of vulnerability were transparent. When critical reflection was associated with theories of transformative pedagogies and professional growth, however, those feelings were less evident.
<disp-quote>
<p>Critical reflection helps me improve workshop structures and dynamics.… It also lets me look at myself within a larger context, and grasp what I can influence and what I cannot influence. Critical reflection helps me grow as a person. (Rachel)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Within the context of doing participatory development, Kayla expressed a different emphasis on how she practices critical reflection. She reiterated the importance of using theories of transformation and participation to inform her work. She explained that having a base in theoretical knowledge helped her understand the constraints and enabled her to conceptualize facilitation in ways that are more dynamic and that questioned assumptions around privilege. This view was not explicit among the other participants.</p>

<title>Discussing the Results</title>
<p>Participants both understood and practiced the concept of critical reflection in very diverse ways—in fact, for some, the concept of critical reflection seemed very personal and not always part of a pedagogical practice; having more to do with introspection. In this way, their conceptualization was closer to reflection than critical reflection as distinguished by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541344613488834">Fook (1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541344613488834">Gray (2007</xref>). According to critical and/or feminist pedagogies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344613488834">Lather, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541344613488834">Lykes &amp; Coquillon, 2007</xref>), critical reflection is key to praxis and transformation. About half of the participants in the study linked critical reflection to transformation.</p>
<sec id="section16-1541344613488834">
<title>Applying Critical Reflection</title>
<p>One of the key research questions in this study was how activists understand and experience critical reflection. During the interviews, I realized that very few of the study participants are comfortable answering questions about critical reflection. For example, Alicia started by saying, “I’m not critical of myself, okay. Oh no, not me!” The initial reluctance to respond may result from discomfort with the term, or from a gap between theoretical knowledge and the actual practice of critical reflection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344613488834">Wilson and Hayes (2000</xref>) echo this absence, blaming institutional restrictions and hegemonic practice. My experience with activist–facilitators resonates with theirs and with Carol’s comment about contradictions “in terms of the amount of critical reflection and analysis that we do in our practice—and what we preach to other people.”</p>
<p>After the interviews, 10 of the 14 participants provided written follow-up to questions about critical reflection; participant responses varied significantly. Conceptions of critical reflection as part of pedagogical practice tended to be clearer, although not uniformly, among those with a background in popular education. For others, the response was more technical–rational, a type of assessment rather than a consideration of social and power dynamics in the facilitation process. Participants frequently described critical reflection using a technical-rational response, that is, asking “what went well” and “what had to change.” This correlates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344613488834">Wilson and Hayes (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541344613488834">Karban and Smith (2009</xref>) who found that supports, conditions, and conceptual clarity around critical reflection vague. While noting the importance of clarity around concepts such as critical reflection and reflexivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541344613488834">D’Cruz et al. (2007</xref>) suggest “a lack of clearly defined boundaries in abstract concepts is acknowledged as an important part of theory development” (p. 74).</p>
<p>The findings demonstrate how the politics, theories, and ideologies surrounding pedagogical practices are not always clear. For example, the different ways participants discuss the concepts of “participatory” and “critical reflection” are noticeable. The literature suggests a couple of reasons for this phenomenon. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344613488834">Brookfield (1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344613488834">van Woerkom (2008</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541344613488834">Lather (1998</xref>), there are ideological and political reasons to explain why critical reflection is conceptualized vaguely and diversely. Although the nuanced understandings of the terms may suggest a lack of theoretical understanding, many study participants lamented a lack of time or supports to interrogate complicity in producing dominant forms of knowledge. Perhaps, this outcome suggests why study participants working in academia or in social justice organizations were more apt to speak about applying critical reflection than participants working on contracts with mainstream or national organizations. The study, therefore, suggests a need for collaboration between individuals representing various diverse organizations and perhaps a deeper understanding of pedagogical knowledge aimed at transformation.</p>
<p>Institutional demands were cited as a major barrier to applying critical reflection. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541344613488834">Chiu (2006</xref>) and supported by the study participants, the demands to produce outcomes at the expense of participatory processes presented an oft-identified obstacle to applying critical reflection. Similarly, the technical reporting did not support, and sometimes actually discouraged, aspects of critical reflection. Clearly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541344613488834">Wilson and Hayes (2000</xref>) state, institutional culture does not promote a critical analysis because it might pose a threat to existing hierarchies. Chiu and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613488834">Hickey and Mohan (2004</xref>) note that even in documenting participatory research results, critical reflection gets lost in the reporting on outcomes versus process; it becomes a technical fix instead of a transformative process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541344613488834">Hickey and Mohan (2004</xref>, p. 13) also point out that while not all adult education is about transformative learning, similarly, not all development is about “transforming existing patterns of power relations.” Although it is possible some participants had personal goals of achieving transformation, the suggestion that institutions are a major obstacle to critical reflection is still problematic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541344613488834">Brookfield (2008</xref>) suggests that educators need to deliberately uncover and challenge not only their assumptions but also interrogate the ways in which they replicate inequities or are complicit in hegemonic practices? Although participants acknowledged paradoxes between their ideals and practices, the linking of personal politics of facilitation to critical reflection in practice deserves additional attention.</p>
<p>Understanding the theory behind critical reflection made the participants more likely to embrace a reflexive practice, to conceptualize facilitation as dynamic, and to continuously examine relationships between facilitators and learners, including the co-intentionality of practice as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire (1970</xref>). Ironically, much of the literature on critical pedagogy in nonformal learning begs for examples of practices of critical reflection applied by educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541344613488834">Goldstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541344613488834">Gore, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541344613488834">Gruenwald, 2003</xref>). This is especially true in regard to the dearth of literature on developing a critically reflective facilitator practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541344613488834">Brookfield [1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541344613488834">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541344613488834">2005</xref>] notwithstanding). This study starts to fill that gap.</p>
<p>The most common way that participants discussed applying critical reflection was through co-facilitation or collaborative mechanisms built into their practice which often included informal time together. When critical reflection was apparent, participants were able to give examples of facilitation practices that challenge dominant hierarchies and forms of knowledge. Frequently, however, participants found themselves embroiled in “quick fix” approaches to development (often encouraged by funders) and technorational responses to critical reflection. Responses that illustrate dualistic perspectives—such as what worked and what did not—while common, are part of the technorational responses critiqued in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541344613488834">van Woerkom, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1541344613488834">
<title>Looking Back, Looking Forward</title>
<p>Overall, study participants have nuanced and diverse conceptions of critical reflection. Some participants see critical reflection as intuitive, others as a technical–rational process, and still others as a part of pedagogical praxis; the borders between these categories are never fixed. Crossing borders and understanding structural and institutional barriers to engaging in critical reflection are important for activist–educators who support transformative learning. While understanding the barriers is important, perhaps even more important is theoretical development about the application of critical reflection in participatory methodologies.</p>
<p>Although many participants were vocal about contradictions they experienced between how they envisioned working within development and how they felt compelled to meet institutional demands, they often noted institutional obstacles to applying critical reflection. From a feminist perspective, this limitation raises concerns. How does a feminist practice in transnational development justify the absence of a power analysis in a learning event? How do activists working in development use critical reflection to disrupt institutional norms and hierarchical environments? Further documentation of knowledge about feminist and critical pedagogic experiences is suggested; perhaps, using methods such as case studies or narratives.</p>
<p>The study suggests there are times in activist–facilitator work in nonformal education where embracing a critically reflective position can potentially influence process and impact. A reflective position may further address not only inequities in content but also in pedagogical practice and personal politics, even though paradoxes appear to be an inevitable part of the practice. Finally, if, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541344613488834">Rogers (2006</xref>) proposes, approaches using critical reflection and reflexivity can enhance transformative lifelong learning, then each step toward understanding critically reflective facilitation makes the possibility of transformation, albeit modest, that much more probable.</p>

<p>The concept of conscientization or <italic>conscientização</italic> (Portuguese) was originally used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire (1970</xref>) to refer to the process of developing a critical consciousness about one’s position in the world.</p>

<italic>Transnational feminism</italic> includes the deconstruction of identity boundaries and moving toward a discovery of interconnections; recognizing inequities exist between individuals, places, and other representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541344613488834">Mackie, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Freire’s use of reflection in this quote represents a dynamic and fluid relationship between action and theory that leads to consciousness-raising. Reflection here is not instrumental reflection because it examines assumptions and politics in the learning encounter.</p>

<p>By technorational, I refer to a focus on techniques and activities that would increase effectiveness or help meet the stated goals of the activity (which may be predetermined and not always the goal of the participants), not on the role of emotions or an analysis of power relations in a learning situation.</p>

<p>Popular education is inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541344613488834">Freire (1970</xref>) and critical pedagogy. Simply put, it involves sharing personal experiences and then working collectively through praxis to find solutions to real-world problems using methodologies that involve active participation inspired by theory.</p>

<p>Other findings related to power and position: how activists identify possibilities and paradoxes in their work; and opportunities for personal or social transformation. These themes are not discussed in this articles except where they intersect with findings on critical reflection.</p>
