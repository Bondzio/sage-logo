<p>In <italic>Understanding Community Colleges</italic>, coeditors John S. Levin and Susan T. Kater have collected and organized works that provide readers with a thorough understanding of recent scholarship concerning community colleges. The contributors to the Levin and Kater volume approach their topics through a variety of lenses. They offer historical perspectives but also assessments of their topics in view of the current educational environment.</p>
<p>An overarching theme of this collection is the need for additional scholarly research regarding the institutions’ challenges and accomplishments. The authors of the various chapters have not only presented their topics in an informative and engaging manner but also concluded their discussions with questions that will support extended dialogue. The book seems likely to encourage additional contributions in the topic areas covered—specifically, from a theoretical perspective in an effort to inform practitioners, administrators, and policymakers about the actual behaviors and conditions of community colleges. The book’s 15 chapters have been written by 20 leading community college scholars. Readers of the <italic>Community College Review</italic> will be familiar with all of them. I only mention some of these authors and chapters below to provide readers with a succinct sampling of the book. However, every chapter makes a significant contribution, and informed readers will enjoy them all.</p>
<p>The book begins with a useful historical framework for approaching subsequent chapters. This framework provides readers with a helpful perspective to understand the contributions of community colleges. The volume is then organized into what the editors describe as an “organic theoretical structure” (p. xii) with four main sections. Section 1, “The Core: Community Colleges and Their Students,” begins with a historical perspective of the multiple missions of community colleges, providing an explanation of how the idea of comprehensiveness has developed over time. Ken Meier, former vice president of student learning at College of Marin and a former senior administrator at Bakersfield College, leads off the mission discussion and provides a thorough account of how community colleges have adapted over time to offer a comprehensive curriculum while responding to specific community needs. Meier concludes his chapter by asking readers to ponder whether aspects of the current community college offer clues as to what the institution will become in the future.</p>
<p>Chapters in Section 2, “Institutional Issues for the Community College,” address operational and environmental issues of program planning, management and leadership, governance, and funding community colleges. David Ayers and Michael Ayers begin the discussion with a work titled, “Planning Programs for Community College Education,” which examines program planning in community colleges from cultural, political, and economic viewpoints. The authors suggest a direction for research on program planning and pose discussion questions on human capital theory and what strategies scholars may recommend for addressing learner needs. Specific questions posed by the authors include, “What are learner needs and what strategies do scholars recommend for addressing these?” and “Are there ethical considerations in program planning, and, if so, what are they?” (pp. 116-117).</p>
<p>Section 3, “Economic and Workforce Development,” examines various perspectives on the vocational education mission of community colleges. Debra Bragg leads off this discussion with a chapter, “Career and Technical Education,” which examines the evolution of the vocational mission of community colleges along with an analysis of federal support for this function over time. In Section 4, “The Future: Community College Leadership and Scholarship,” the book concludes with John Levin’s contribution titled, “Understandings of Community Colleges in Need of Resuscitation: The Case of Community College Faculty.” Here, Levin notes that we still lack a clear understanding of the evolution of community colleges and that there is still no “organizational saga” that has been developed or nurtured. Levin observes that the lack of such narratives helps explain why community colleges are often misunderstood entities, and face a mix of praise and criticism across American society.</p>
<p>In summary, each of the 15 chapters offers an in-depth analysis of specific topics that range from the multiple missions of community colleges, the environment in which they operate, governance, finance, student demographics, student development, teaching and learning, policy, and workforce development. Theoretical perspectives applied by the various authors include critical theory, social theory, institutional theory, and organizational theory. Overall, the chapters provide readers with a thoughtful and comprehensive account of community colleges in the United States.</p>
<p>While the chapters in this book are diverse in their content, they should be easily accessible to experienced practitioners and graduate students. All chapters begin with a concrete foundation and entrance point for the subsequent discussion. The reader is then presented with a detailed exploration of the topic, issues, and trends that have been addressed in previous research, along with a discussion of relevant issues and challenges. This approach is used throughout the book and should be very effective in creating interest for further research on the presented topics. Faculty teaching in higher education graduate programs should find the text especially useful. It could easily be used in graduate seminars focusing on the development of future researchers or those seeking to prepare future community college leaders. Campus reading groups would also enjoy spending a semester with the book as it offers insights that would be appreciated by community college faculty, staff, and administrators.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Levin and Kater have produced a volume that steers away from a one-dimensional or simplistic account of the community college. The American community college is an educationally complex institution, and it has been assigned social and economic responsibilities by a wide range of interests in the society. The editors and authors have illuminated these responsibilities and, in the process, shown us why the challenges and problems of the community college extend beyond its campus boundaries and should be a priority for every American committed to democracy and education.</p>
