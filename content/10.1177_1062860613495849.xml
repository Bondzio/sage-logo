<p>Activity in the College</p>
<p>The American College of Medical Quality Visit us at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acmq.org">www.acmq.org</ext-link></p>
<p>We have seen some progress in our early committee work at the college. It’s really too soon to share much detail, but I am very impressed with the energy and commitment of the leaders and members of these various groups. I think it is helping us this year to focus on our strategic direction with our committee work; thus, the four major committees are membership, marketing, education at the annual meeting, and alternative education.</p>
<p>I can share with you that we have early sponsorship interest and partnership possibilities. We have begun to discuss the format of our own annual conference that we are planning in March of 2014 in Alexandria, VA. And we are planning some offsite activities as well during the annual conference. We have hired a firm to redesign and refresh/update our website and its functionality. We are looking into restarting our webinar offerings.</p>
<p>In collaboration with David Mayer, MD, of MedStar Health, we are sponsoring a resident to attend the Telluride Patient Safety Roundtable and Summer Camp in Telluride, CO, this summer; and again in August, two medical students will be sponsored to attend the Patient Safety Roundtable and Summer Camp in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>I will have more details to share about the annual meeting progress and other activities in the next journal update.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to join these committees and their work in progress should contact Andrew Jerdonek at PAI &lt;<email>ajerdonek@paimgmt.com</email>&gt; and he can connect you to the desired committee chair.</p>
