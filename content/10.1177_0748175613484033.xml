<p>Recently, researchers of issues relating to mental health have paid much attention to the role of emotion regulation or emotion dysregulation in mental disorders, mental health, and quality of life. In particular, several researchers and theorists agree on the idea that emotion regulation is an essential component of mental health and that emotion dysregulation will make a person more vulnerable to various forms of psychopathology and mental disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175613484033">Cicchetti, Ackerman, &amp; Izard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175613484033">Davidson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175613484033">Gross, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175613484033">Gross &amp; Munoz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175613484033">Kring &amp; Bachorowski, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on a review of the existing literature on various conceptualizations and measurements of emotion regulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref> proposed a comprehensive definition of emotion regulation. They view it as a multidimensional construct involving the following dimensions: (a) awareness and understanding of emotions, (b) acceptance of emotions, (c) ability to control impulsive behaviors and engage in goal-directed behaviors when experiencing negative emotions, and (d) ability to use situation-appropriate emotion regulation strategies flexibly to modulate emotional responses. On the basis of their integrative conceptualization of emotion regulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref> developed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), a comprehensive measure that adequately assesses both general and specific aspects of difficulties in emotion regulation. The validation of the scale demonstrated high internal consistency, good test–retest reliability, and adequate construct and predictive validity in a sample of racially diverse but predominantly European Americans participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004</xref>). A series of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal axis factoring method of extraction and promax oblique rotation were used to identify the underlying dimensions of emotion regulation as assessed by the DERS. Both scree test and examination of the interpretability supported a six-factor solution representing (a) nonacceptance of emotional responses (NONACCEPTANCE), (b) difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviors when experiencing negative emotions (GOALS), (c) difficulties controlling impulses when experiencing negative emotions (IMPULSE), (d) lack of awareness of emotional responses (AWARENESS), (e) lack of clarity of emotional responses (CLARITY), and (f) limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective (STRATEGIES).</p>
<p>All of the DERS total scale and 6 subscales have demonstrated good internal consistency, and its total score was moderately correlated with the level of posttraumatic symptoms for each racial group in a sample of White, Asian, and Black American trauma survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175613484033">Fuchs, Barrett, &amp; Roemer, 2006</xref>). Most of the DERS subscales, except for the AWARENESS subscale for the White and Asian samples and the GOALS subscale for the Black samples, were significantly associated with each other.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of scale development is determining the validity of factor structures as representations of a particular construct. Factor analysis of the DERS is a useful and necessary method to identify the underlying dimensions of emotion regulation as assessed by this scale. Furthermore, analyzing the factor structure of constructs allows researchers to understand the interrelationships of the dimensions and to explore the differential roles of several dimensions of emotion regulation in psychopathology or mental health. There are a few studies that have examined the DERS factor structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref> were the first to provide data on the factor structure of the DERS. As explained, they supported a six-factor solution. The findings reflect a multifaceted definition of emotion regulation involving six separate (albeit related) factors. In other words, these results suggest that the four dimensions originally proposed for the conceptualization of emotion regulation can be reconceptualized as six distinct factors (i.e., nonacceptance, goals, impulse, awareness, clarity, and strategies).</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175613484033">Paulson et al. (2007)</xref> based on DERS data reported the results of EFA using the principal axis factoring method of extraction and promax oblique rotation from a sample of Asian/Asian American undergraduate students (<italic>n</italic> = 353). Five of the six factors of the DERS in this sample were comparable to those obtained with the original sample. However, items from the limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective in the original sample did not load on any of the factors within the study sample. Instead, a new factor indicative of a lack of emotional self-efficacy emerged in the Asian/Asian-American sample.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho (2007)</xref> examined the factor structure of a Korean translation of the DERS (K-DERS) in two independent samples of Korean undergraduate students. The results of EFAs using the principal axis factoring method of extraction and direct oblimin rotation revealed a six-factor solution identical to the one reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref>. However, the item composition of some of the factors in the K-DERS is slightly different from that in the original DERS. In the initial EFAs of the 36-item K-DERS, Item 17 was eliminated because it loaded on the corresponding factor in the direction opposite to the theoretical expectation and its corrected item–total correlation was also negative. In subsequent EFAs using the 35-item K-DERS, based on an examination of a scree plot and the interpretability of each solution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho (2007)</xref> chose the six-factor solution comprising only 30 items, which were found to load on the same factors between the two samples.</p>
<p>In the six-factor solution from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho’s study (2007)</xref>, the items loading onto two separate factors, AWARENESS and CLARITY, seem to be similar in their contents. Particularly, both of them correspond to the proposed dimension of awareness and understanding of emotions, one of the dimensions of emotion regulation as conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref>. In fact, the correlation pattern among the DERS subscales based on the results of the factor solution as well as the item wording of each factor in the DERS provide useful information about the nature of the AWARENESS factor. In the original DERS, the AWARENESS subscale was not significantly associated with the GOALS subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .08, <italic>ns</italic>), and its correlations with the other DERS subscales were relatively low (<italic>r</italic>s = .14–.22, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01), whereas it was moderately associated with the CLARITY subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). On the other hand, correlations among the other four DERS subscales (NONACCEPTANCE, GOALS, IMPULSE, and STRATEGIES) were significant (<italic>r</italic>s = .32–.63, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). Similarly, in the K-DERS, the AWARENESS subscale was not significantly associated with other DERS subscales (<italic>r</italic>s = −.02 to .12, <italic>ns</italic>), except for the CLARITY subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In contrast, correlations among the other four DERS subscales were significant (<italic>r</italic>s = .32–.68, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). Furthermore, among the items designed to measure difficulties in the proposed dimension of awareness and understanding of emotions, all reverse-worded items except Item 17, which was deleted from the K-DERS, loaded on the AWARENESS factor, and all positively worded items loaded on the CLARITY factor in the K-DERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The aforementioned review suggests that the AWARENESS factor and CLARITY factor in the K-DERS do not represent two distinct underlying constructs but rather derived constructs based on the wording of the items. Specifically, the two factors may represent a single construct assessed by two sets of items that used different methods (i.e., straightforward and reverse-scored). Thus, for the K-DERS, a correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items may be more appropriate than the correlated six-factor model, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer’s (2004)</xref> original conceptualization—the fact that the Awareness and Clarity factors seem to be similar in their contents but opposite in their item wordings and empirical results with respect to correlation pattern among the six factors.</p>
<p>Most studies examining the latent structure of the DERS, thus far, have used only exploratory methods for the derivation of the factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175613484033">Paulson et al., 2007</xref>), and a few research studies have offered a confirmatory test of the factor structure of the DERS. Toward the completion of this study, two studies using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were reported. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175613484033">Perez, Venta, Garnaat, and Sharp (2012)</xref> showed that the six-factor structure of the DERS fit the data from a sample of adolescent inpatients adequately. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175613484033">Bardeen, Fergus, and Orcutt (2012)</xref> provided support for the adequacy of a revised five-factor model of the DERS in which the AWARENESS dimension was removed, based on their CFA results in a large sample of female undergraduate students. However, the key question as to whether the AWARENESS factor of the DERS is distinct from the CLARITY factor in terms of substantive meaning or whether one of the two factors simply represents an artifact of response styles associated with the wording of the items has not been addressed yet. Therefore, the composition of the factor structure remains unclear and possible misinterpretations of data may occur. One of the ways to address this problem is to analyze the DERS factors with a systematic method that includes examination of factor structure validity.</p>
<p>The CFA approach has several advantages over EFA procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175613484033">Feldman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175613484033">Floyd &amp; Widaman, 1995</xref>). First, the adequacy of a hypothesized factor model can be tested in CFA, whereas no test of the model is possible with EFA. Second, whereas EFA is data-driven and determined by arbitrary statistical constraints, CFA is theory-driven and imposes substantive constraints on the solution. Finally, different models resulting from competing hypotheses can be compared directly with one another using CFA, whereas this is not possible with EFA. Specifically for this study, the CFA approach is useful in evaluating whether factors associated with straightforward and reverse-scored items are substantively and meaningfully distinct or substantively irrelevant artifacts.</p>
<p>Item wording and response is relevant to determining factor structure and validation of adequate distinctiveness. Data from self-report measures, widely used in the fields of clinical or social and personality psychology, has illustrated the tendency to respond to items in a way independent of the intended content. Researchers have reported ample evidence of method effects based on scales consisting of both straightforward and reverse-scored items, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175613484033">Rosenberg’s (1965)</xref> Self-Esteem Scale (SES;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175613484033">Marsh, 1996</xref>), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613484033">Brown, 2003</xref>), original and brief versions of the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175613484033">Rodebaugh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175613484033">Weeks et al., 2005</xref>), and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175613484033">Rodebaugh, Woods, Heimberg, Liebowitz, &amp; Schneier, 2006</xref>). The CFA results of the SES, PSWQ, and SIAS indicated the superiority of a unidimensional model with method effects associated with the negatively worded items to the two-factor model. For the brief version of the FNE, the fit values of the two models were found to be roughly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175613484033">Weeks et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, the research objective was to reevaluate the factor structure of the K-DERS, guided by the prediction that the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items would be conceptually and empirically more suitable than the correlated six-factor model. To this end, we used CFA of the K-DERS in a sample of Korean undergraduate students.</p>

<title>The Korean Version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale</title>
<p>The original DERS is a 36-item self-report measure that assesses difficulties in emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004</xref>). Participants are asked to rate how often each item applies to themselves on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with 1 being <italic>almost never</italic> (0% to 10%) and 5 being <italic>almost always</italic> (91% to 100%). In the initial EFA and reliability analysis of the 36-item version of the K-DERS, one item (Item 17 in the original DERS) was eliminated because, unexpectedly, it loaded onto the corresponding factor in the opposite direction, and then its corrected item–total correlation was also unexpectedly negative. Therefore, the final version of K-DERS consists of 35 items. In subsequent EFAs of the 35-item K-DERS, a scree test and interpretability of each solution indicated a six-factor solution comprising only 30 items. Five items in the first factor reflected “impulse control difficulties,” 7 items in the second factor “lack of awareness of emotions,” 8 items in the third factor “nonacceptance of emotions,” 3 items in the fourth factor “lack of emotional clarity,” 6 items in the fifth factor “limited access to emotion regulation strategies,” and 4 items in the sixth factor “difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behavior.” Ten items are reversely recoded, and higher total score indicates greater emotion dysregulation. The K-DERS used in this study demonstrated good internal consistency, test–retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, criterion-related, and predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 18 was performed to investigate the factor structure of the K-DERS. To evaluate whether the AWARENESS and CLARITY factors represent an artifact of response styles associated with the wording of the items, we compared two models: the six-factor model specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho (2007)</xref> and the five-factor model with a method factor.</p>
<p>Because the maximum likelihood estimation procedures used in this study can produce distorted results when the normality assumption is severely violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175613484033">Curran, West, &amp; Finch, 1996</xref>), the normality of each variable was investigated in terms of its kurtosis and skewness. According to the guidelines of severe nonnormality (i.e., skew &gt;2; kurtosis &gt;7) proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175613484033">West, Finch, and Curran (1995)</xref>, the normality assumption of all the variables was well met.</p>
<p>In CFA, the degree of correspondence between any particular model and the data can be assessed using several goodness-of-fit indexes. Because the chi-square fit index is highly sensitive to sample size, we evaluated models using comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), which are relatively independent of sample size. Values of .90 or above for CFI and TLI and values of RMSEA of .08 or smaller indicate good fit.</p>
<p>Given that some subjects (less than 5%) did not respond to some items, this study employed full information maximum likelihood estimation, which has been found to be very efficient for incomplete data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175613484033">Schafer &amp; Olsen, 1998</xref>) because listwise deletion can result in biased parameter estimates due to nonrandom attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175613484033">Arbuckle, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The CFA results revealed that the correlated six-factor model had an unsatisfactory fit: CFI = .883, TLI = .860, and RMSEA = .067 (90% confidence interval [CI] = .062–.072). In contrast, the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items provided acceptable fit: CFI = .909, TLI = .891, RMSEA = .059 (90% CI = .054–.065).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748175613484033">Figure 1</xref> presents the path diagram of the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items of the K-DERS. All the correlations between the five factors including awareness and understanding of emotions (UNDERSTANDING) factor were statistically significant and ranged from .27 to .71 (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). With the exception of Items 6, 8, and 34, most of the items significantly loaded on their related factors (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01), suggesting that these items were all valid indicators of their respective factor. Because Items 6, 8, and 34 showed low factor loadings, the items need to be evaluated further using other sample data. If the items continue to demonstrate poor loadings, they can be modified in terms of item content and/or removed from the scale given that the UNDERSATNDING factor has more items, compared to other factors. In addition, the seven reverse-worded items originally belonging to the AWARENESS factor all significantly loaded on the METHOD factor (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the first to test the factor structure of the K-DERS, particularly whether the AWARENESS factor is distinct from the CLARITY factor in terms of substantive meaning or whether one of the two factors is an artifact of response styles associated with the wording of the items, using CFA. Based on the results, the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items was supported. The main reasons for supporting the new model over the six-factor model are as follows: First, the CFA results revealed that the correlated six-factor model specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho (2007)</xref> had an unsatisfactory fit but that the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items provided acceptable fit. The results suggest that the covariances among the items belonging to the AWARENESS and CLARITY factors in the K-DERS are best explained by a single underlying construct. Second, although refuting previous conclusions that the factor structure of the original DERS or K-DERS consists of six separate factors including the AWARENESS and CLARITY factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175613484033">Paulson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748175613484033">Weinberg &amp; Klonsky, 2009</xref>), the results from this study are consistent with the broad literature attesting to the presence of method effects in assessment instruments entailing a combination of straightforward and reverse-scored items (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613484033">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175613484033">Marsh, 1996</xref>). If these effects are not modeled in factor analyses of such instruments, the factor structure of the responses to the instruments can be confounded or obscured by method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175613484033">Tomas &amp; Oliver, 1999</xref>). Finally, the five-factor model with a method factor also provides support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer’s (2004)</xref> original conceptualization that both the factors correspond to the proposed dimension of awareness and understanding of emotions. In other words, these results suggest that there may not be a difference between being attending to and aware of emotional responses and having a clear understanding of the nature of these responses.</p>
<p>There are several implications of our results. First, this is a multicultural assessment study, as validating various language versions of common assessment instruments is an important step in increasing the multicultural relevance in psychological practice. More specifically, if the converging evidence that emotion regulation difficulties comprise five conceptually distinct factors is accumulated, clinical assessments should aim to cover all of these latent factors, to provide a comprehensive assessment of emotion regulation difficulties.</p>
<p>Second, considering that attention to emotion regulation difficulties is a central focus of an acceptance-based emotion regulation intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175613484033">Gratz &amp; Gunderson, 2006</xref>), exploration of the dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties using the K-DERS might be useful in treatment planning for identifying specific targets for acceptance-based emotion regulation intervention. In general, the availability of five subscales allows researchers and clinicians to examine each respondent’s scores profiles, which might be more informative than a single score. Additionally, counselors can use the instrument to help track their clients’ improvement on the emotion regulation difficulties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, results of the present study suggest potential targets for treatment. Clients with emotion regulation difficulties may benefit from treatments that facilitate the ability to attend to and be aware of emotional responses and have clear understanding of the nature of these responses. This is an important skill for the clients to learn early in emotion regulation interventions (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484033">Barlow et al., 2011</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484033">Barlow et al. (2011)</xref>, the ability to objectively observe and understand emotional responses as they are occurring in the moment will allow the clients to identify and modify their maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. However, awareness and clarity by themselves do not guarantee that one will employ adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Several researchers and counselors emphasize that it is a particular quality of emotional awareness and clarity (accepting/compassionate) that is clinically relevant (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175613484033">Barlow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175613484033">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175613484033">Hayes &amp; Feldman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175613484033">Roemer et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175613484033">Hayes and Feldman (2004)</xref> suggest that mindfulness may facilitate adaptive emotion regulation, perhaps particularly through the cultivation of compassionate awareness. Conversely, effective emotion regulation may also help decrease judgment and criticism of emotional experiences, thus promoting this aspect of mindfulness.</p>
<p>Finally, the results of the present study will contribute to further investigating the differential role of the five dimensions of emotion dysregulation in clinical problems or well-being, as well as their longitudinal and prospective ability to predict mental health.</p>
<p>The limitation of the current study is that the sample consisted of only Korean undergraduate students. Because culture may influence the modulation of emotional responses, the generalizability of the results of the present study may be limited. In fact, several researchers have provided evidence of East Asian and Western cultural differences in emotional responding and emotion regulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175613484033">G. Cho, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175613484033">Kitayama, Mesquita, &amp; Karasawa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748175613484033">Tsai, Levenson, &amp; McCoy, 2006</xref>). Cultures emphasizing the maintenance of social order tended to have higher scores on suppression, and reappraisal and suppression tended to be positively correlated. In contrast, cultures minimizing the maintenance of social order tended to have lower scores on suppression, and reappraisal and suppression tended to be negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175613484033">Matsumoto, Yoo, &amp; Nakagawa, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the current study did not replicate using Western samples the result that the five-factor model with a method factor was supported, we evaluated the two models specified on the basis of the EFA results using the original 36-item DERS reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref>. This model evaluation could not demonstrate cultural differences in the factor structure, but it was possible to show whether the five-factor model with a method factor was better in model fit than the six-factor model, even when the original 36-item DERS reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer (2004)</xref> was used for CFA. The results revealed that the correlated six-factor model provided a poor fit to the data in the current study: CFI = .813, TLI = .784, and RMSEA = .076 (.072–.080). The correlated five-factor model with a method factor showed better fit values: CFI = .846, TLI = .820, and RMSEA = .069 (.065–.073). This result shows that regardless of which items (i.e., items used for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175613484033">Gratz and Roemer [2004]</xref> or items used for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175613484033">Y. Cho [2007]</xref>) are used, the five-factor model with a method factor can be supported. However, to investigate cultural differences, replication of these findings across different cultural samples, such as Western samples, is necessary. It would be also of interest to determine whether method effects in psychological assessment instruments are moderated by salient dimensions or subgroups (e.g., less evident in nonclinical vs. clinical samples; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175613484033">Brown, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Further research is also needed to analyze the wording effect when the K-DERS is associated with other variables. If method effects are present in the scale, as the evidence suggests, then correlation, multiple regression, and path analyses may confound substantive factors with wording effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175613484033">Tomas &amp; Oliver, 1999</xref>). These biases can lead to misleading results and interpretations and are difficult to assess unless method factors were explicitly modeled.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the CFA results of the K-DERS provide support for the correlated five-factor model with a method factor for reverse-worded items. Particularly, these findings suggest that the AWARENESS factor of the K-DERS reflects a blend of the proposed dimension of awareness and understanding of emotions and method effects associated with reverse-worded items. Moreover, our results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of assessing and testing emotion dysregulation in clinical research and practice.</p>
