<abstract>
<p>This study engaged parents to develop concise, informative, and comprehensible text messages for an immunization reminder system using Human Factors techniques. Fifty parents completed a structured interview including demographics, technology questions, willingness to receive texts from their child’s doctor, and health literacy. Each participant was assigned to one user-centered design test: card sort, needs analysis, or comprehension. The majority of respondents were female (90%), White non-Hispanic (62%), and averaged 29 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5). Nearly all (96%) had “adequate” health literacy. The card sort, an activity in which end users organize information into categories, identified six pieces of critical information. These were compiled into eight example texts, which were ranked in the needs assessment. The top two were assessed for comprehension, with 100% of participants able to understand the content and describe intention to act. Using user-centered design methods, the authors developed concise, informative text messages that parents indicated would prompt them to schedule their child’s immunization appointment.</p>

<p>Immunization schedules can be difficult for parents to remember because of their complicated nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111420866">Hillenbrand &amp; Karin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111420866">Massoudi, 2003</xref>). However, appointment reminders have increased adherence to immunization schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111420866">Irigoyen, Findley, Earle, Stambaugh, &amp; Vaughan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111420866">Stehr-Green, Dini, Lindegren, &amp; Patriarca, 1993</xref>). The surge of mobile phone use, even among low-income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111420866">Blumberg &amp; Luke, 2008</xref>), suggests that text messages might be a feasible pathway for reminders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111420866">Vilella et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, recent studies have demonstrated parents’ willingness to receive text message reminders for immunizations for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>) and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111420866">Kharbanda, Stockwell, Fox, &amp; Rickert, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The preferred content of such reminders has been reported as varied based on ethnicity and the preferred style is short, simple, and personalized messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111420866">Kharbanda et al., 2009</xref>). Taking into consideration the 160-character limit of a text message, it is clear that additional research including the application of Human Factors (HF) techniques is needed to identify the optimal information structure to enhance parental understanding and increase immunization rates.</p>
<p>HF testing of usability is “a systematic way of observing actual users trying out a product and collecting information about the specific ways in which the product is easy or difficult for them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111420866">Dumas &amp; Redish, 1993</xref>, p. 12). Using user-centered design (UCD) principles, information about a specific product can be collected from actual users on realistic tasks to measure effectiveness, optimize usability, and assess attitudes and responses from intended users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111420866">Bastien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111420866">Stone, Jarrett, Woodroffe, Minocha, 2005</xref>). UCD has been used to develop text messaging software for an adolescent diabetes management system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111420866">Waller, Franklin, Pagliari, &amp; Greene, 2006</xref>) and Computerized Provider Order Entry systems for preventing adverse drug events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111420866">Beuscart-Zéphir, Pelayo, &amp; Bernonville, 2010</xref>). Our primary measurable objective was to assess whether user testing results in high levels of parent comprehension of text messaging reminder content.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Parents were recruited from two Midwestern pediatric clinics in Spring of 2010. Eligibility criteria included the following: (a) parent (or caregiver) of a child 2 years or younger, (b) 18 years or older, (c) use a mobile phone for text messaging, (d) English speaking, and (e) able to consent. Participants received a $35 gift card. Approval was obtained from two local institutional review boards.</p>
<p>After consent, demographic information was collected based on the Centers for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2008brfss.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2008brfss.pdf</ext-link>). Interview questions included experience with and current use of technology, willingness to receive text messages from their child’s medical providers, and barriers to receiving such messages. The Short Version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111420866">Baker, Williams, Parker, Gazmararian, &amp; Nurss, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants engaged in an observational task analysis where they received and replied to a text message using their personal phone. Two raters categorized participant’s self-report and observed texting ability based on three tiers: (a) declarative knowledge—participant’s concept of text messaging and the basic steps involved are not well organized and task performance is awkward; (b) procedural knowledge—rules can be recalled and used with greater efficiency; and (c) automaticity—requires little conscious attention and performance is quite rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111420866">Wickens, Lee, Liu, &amp; Becker, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1090198111420866">
<title>UCD Testing</title>
<p>Each participant (<italic>n</italic> = 50) was assigned to one UCD test based on order of interviews. Sample sizes were selected to ensure saturation of responses and adequate detection of usability problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111420866">Nielsen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111420866">Virzi, 1992</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1090198111420866">
<title>Card sort</title>
<p>Card sorting is a validated technique for developing information structures, commonly used to evaluate website information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111420866">Corry, Frick, &amp; Hansen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111420866">Nielsen, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111420866">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111420866">Wood &amp; Wood, 2008</xref>). Index cards displayed 20 pieces of immunization information determined by an expert panel. The first 15 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111420866">Macefield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111420866">Nielsen, 2004</xref>) grouped the cards into three categories: (a) critical information, (b) appropriate additional or clarifying information, and (c) unnecessary information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090198111420866">
<title>Needs analysis</title>
<p>The next 15 participants further clarified the ideal information structure for text message immunization reminders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111420866">Macefield, 2009</xref>). Based on information theory, which seeks to identify the ultimate data compression, this process involved prototype testing information structures identified from the card sort task. Critical information identified in the card sort was combined in several ways to fit within the 160-character restriction. Participants were asked to rank order these eight messages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090198111420866">
<title>Comprehension testing</title>
<p>Once optimal information structure was identified, 20 participants engaged in comprehension testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111420866">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111420866">Macefield, 2009</xref>). The process was similar to that used for prescription drug labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111420866">Webb et al., 2008</xref>). Two messages were presented in random order. Participants read the example text messages and explained the content. Two researchers assessed the responses for participant comprehension; 80% indicated acceptable message content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111420866">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198111420866">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All analysis of interview data was computed using SPSS Version 17, except the card sort data. Frequencies were reported for categorical data and means with standard deviations for continuous data. Interrater reliability was assessed by Cohen’s Kappa, and disagreements were corrected by consensus. Self-report and observed skills were also compared using Cohen’s Kappa. Kendall’s <italic>W</italic> for comparison of ranks was computed for the needs assessment. For the card sort, data analysis using Microsoft’s UXSort software resulted in a dendrogram and category frequencies.</p>

<p>Participant comments suggested a simplified message was preferred; however, the word <italic>Reminder</italic> at the beginning of the message would ensure the message was read. For example, one parent said, “If I saw the word <italic>Reminder</italic> at the beginning, it would get my attention. I would be like, hey, this must be important.” In addition, parents did not feel the need to know extra information regarding the immunizations; one stated, “I don’t need to know which dose they are getting, I have faith the doctor knows which shot it is!” whereas another said, “I believe in shots so I don’t need to know what they are for, if I need extra info I can call in or ask at the appointment.” In addition, parents appreciated the use of words such as <italic>please</italic> and <italic>thank you</italic> in the message, as they made the messages seem “friendlier, so I would be more likely to call right away.”</p>

UCD has been implemented in the development of websites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111420866">Corry et al., 1997</xref>) and cellular phone software (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111420866">Waller et al., 2006</xref>) and are being increasingly applied to the health care arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111420866">Bastien, 2010</xref>), for example, to ensure medical devises are not error prone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111420866">Beuscart-Zéphir et al., 2010</xref>). However, the use of these methods to evaluate health communication messages is relatively novel.</p>
<p>Using HF methods allowed for the optimization of the structure of the text messages, which is especially important considering the 160-character limit. By allowing parents, the end user, to engage in UCD activities, we have increased understanding of which information is considered essential by frequent text messages. Of the six critical pieces of information identified, most may have been determined without using parent input, such as date immunizations are due. However, it is possible some critical elements may have been overlooked. Even more likely, the text message could have been made too complex by including specific content regarding vaccine names, vaccine-preventable diseases, or other information deemed unnecessary by parents.</p>
<p>In an era of personalized medicine and deep-tailoring approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111420866">Suggs &amp; McIntyre, 2009</xref>), it may seem counterintuitive to attempt to identify health communication content that endeavors to be “one size fits all.” However, the role of this HF evaluation was to allow us to identify and remove all nonessential information to provide short, simple messages without a lot of additional and distracting elements. Using HF techniques to develop short, simple messages, we were able to create two messages that resulted in comprehension by all of our participants.</p>
<p>By using UCD to winnow out the nonessential elements, we were left with six immunization-schedule-related components that parents desired. Both child’s name and child’s age are important in helping parents identify which child, if they have more than one, the reminder is for. In addition, personalization has been identified as a key factor in improving response rate to surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111420866">Dillman, 2000</xref>) and may in fact increase the likelihood a parent will respond to a text message. The inclusion of a “general reminder” that the child is due for immunizations lets the parent know why their child needs to see the doctor and should help convey the importance of the appointment. Providing the clinic telephone number serves the function of minimizing steps for the parent to respond. Not only does the parent not have to look up the phone number, but many of today’s cellular phone systems can autodial a number in a text message. In addition, providing the physician’s name can help the parent provide the clinic with the necessary information to ensure continuity of care by increasing the chances of seeing the same doctor when using a group practice. Finally, parents indicated a need for the date that immunizations are due. This functions as a deadline for parents and gives a concrete time frame for making the appointment.</p>
<p>The structured interviews also revealed additional components that parents identified as important in text message reminders. The word <italic>reminder</italic> at the beginning of the message may serve as an alerting function. According to cognitive theory, alerting increases vigilance and increases response speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111420866">Fan et al., 2009</xref>). This may be especially important for those parents who report receiving hundreds or thousands of texts per week. Finally, parents identified the importance of politeness cues, such as “please” and “thank you,” in the text messages. According to social exchange theory, politeness cues help show positive regard and can enhance the interaction; inclusion of these terms has been shown to increase survey response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111420866">Dillman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, our results suggest that parents who currently use text messaging are very interested in receiving text message immunization reminders, which support findings in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111420866">Kharbanda et al., 2009</xref>). Our participants were young and skilled at texting, and they used text messaging as a regular form of communication. This is in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111420866">Kharbanda et al. (2009)</xref>, who found that parents (<italic>n</italic> = 28) who participated in focus groups and interviews were able to receive text messages but not able to reply and reported their texting frequency at once per week or less. However, participants in their study had an average age of 45 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9) and at least one child aged 10 to 19 years.</p>
<p>The limitations of these findings, and our process, come from our study population and the self-reported nature of the data. Our parents, who come from a single Midwestern urban center, had higher education and health literacy levels than expected, spoke only English, and were very proficient with text messaging. This may limit the effectiveness of a text message reminder system if the intervention group differs. Therefore, further study should assess the comprehension of the identified text message content by populations with less text messaging experience, with marginal or low health literacy, as well as of varied ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>) and language. Future studies should ultimately evaluate whether text message immunization reminders, that have been developed using HF principles, improve adherence to childhood immunization schedules.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because of the complicated nature of the child immunization schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111420866">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 2009</xref>) and the penetration of mobile phones among hard-to-reach populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111420866">Blumberg &amp; Luke, 2008</xref>), text messaging may be a successful strategy to increase immunizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111420866">Vilella et al., 2004</xref>). Using UCD testing, short, specific text content was identified that should result in high levels of comprehension and intention to act. Our next step will be to assess whether such a text message reminder system actually improves immunization rates.</p>

<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>The use of HF techniques in the development of provider–patient communication can be useful for developing succinct, informative messages. This is especially important when using a technological avenue for communication, such as text messaging, that limits the amount of content that can be included. With only 160 characters, it is impossible to include all the potential immunization information that a provider might feel is significant. However, studies have suggested that parents often believe that immunizations cause ill health and have concerns regarding short- and long-term adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111420866">Mills, Jadad, Ross, &amp; Wilson, 2005</xref>). It is of utmost importance to provide parents with accurate information regarding the need for their child to be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases. A text message appointment reminder is not the appropriate venue for this, and anticipatory guidance needs to be given by providers in a more appropriate setting.</p>
<p>Parents have also cited confusion regarding the immunization schedule as a barrier to timely vaccination for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111420866">Mills et al., 2005</xref>). Text message immunization reminders are an appropriate venue for helping parents to know when their child is due for immunizations. In addition, text message immunization reminders are strongly endorsed by parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111420866">Ahlers-Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111420866">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111420866">Kharbanda et al., 2009</xref>), and with many new programs available to connect text messaging to electronic medical records, immunization providers should consider this cost effective alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, practices should understand the importance of implementation science in extending the reach of evidence-based medicine through emerging personal technologies. This study was a key step in the development of a text message immunization reminder program. Because of the use of HF techniques in this developmental stage, it is anticipated that a future study to examine the impact of text message reminders on immunization rates will be stronger because of the user input that helped design the messages. Other practices should consider using empirically validated methods, such as HF UCD, and parent participation in creating the optimal message content for communication. This is especially true when using new communication technologies.</p>
