<sec id="section1-1352458511434066">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Immunogenicity of recombinant interferon-β (IFN-β) is a known complication in the therapy of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that can interfere with efficacy are quantified using in vitro bioassays; however, these assays do not reveal the immunogenic state of the patient and are not predictive of treatment outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511434066">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Assessment of the impact of NAbs on IFN-β responsive cells and signalling pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with phospho-specific flow cytometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458511434066">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>PBMCs from 10 IFN-β-treated patients with RRMS, two untreated patients, and two healthy controls were re-stimulated in autologous sera and media with a serial dilution of IFN-β (0–8000 U/ml) and levels of phosphorylation of STAT1/3/4/5/6 transcription factors were quantified in PBMC subtypes (NAb titres 0 to &gt; 6000 neutralizing units). Data was subjected to principal component analysis, Hotelling’s <italic>T</italic><sup>2</sup>, and partial least squares analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511434066">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Three significantly distinct clusters of individuals were revealed in autologous sera: therapy-naïve and healthy, treated NAb-negative, and treated NAb-positive. Compared with controls STATs signalling patterns were modulated in treated NAb-negative patients and inhibited in all treated NAb-positive patients independently of NAb titres. In media no clustering of patients could be found. The predictability of NAb titres based on the phospho-flow data was 74%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511434066">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Phospho-specific flow cytometry can delineate subset-specific cell responses that can act as surrogates for NAb exposure in blood. Immunogenic effects alter the response in primary cells even at low NAb levels. Cell line-based immunogenicity testing is not readily transferable to the immunogenic response in patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recombinant human proteins are used extensively to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434066">1</xref></sup> Many preparations are immunogenic, but the consequences are complicated, disease specific, and patient specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434066">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511434066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511434066">5</xref></sup> Type I recombinant human interferon-beta (IFN-β) is used as a disease modifier in the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and therapy systemically affects immune system functions and responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434066">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511434066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434066">8</xref></sup> Treatment slows the progression of RRMS in a subset of patients, and the occurrence of anti-IFN-β neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can interfere with the response to therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511434066">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511434066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511434066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511434066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511434066"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511434066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511434066">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anti-IFN-β NAbs can be detected in relative simple screening assays; however, the association between NAb data obtained from in vitro bioassays and IFN-β therapy efficacy is not linear or consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511434066">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511434066">17</xref></sup> The fundamental problem is that evaluation of immunogenicity based on in vitro bioassays does not reveal the biological effect of the NAbs in the particular patient, meaning that, at least in part, the impact of NAb level is subject to individual patient metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511434066">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511434066"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511434066">20</xref></sup> Evaluation of NAbs effects in vivo by investigating treatment-induced gene expression changes in blood cells of patients with RRMS has been difficult to interpret due to the complex activation of hundreds of genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511434066">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511434066">22</xref></sup> Over the years a system has evolved whereby patients who are positive for NAbs are categorized depending on in vitro NAb titres; treatment decisions are based on titre categorization and on clinical aspects of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511434066">23</xref></sup> It is clear that a critical prerequisite for personalized medical decisions is a patient-specific assay that reveals immune function of IFN-β by measuring the effects NAbs exposure has on the status of primary IFN-β responsive cells and relevant signalling pathways, rather than measuring NAb titres in cell line-based assays.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the immunogenic alteration in immune state in individual patients could be explored by re-stimulating primary cells of treated patients with IFN-β in autologous sera and by quantifying the activation of the IFN-β-Janus kinase signal transduction and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway with phospho-specific flow cytometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511434066">24</xref></sup> Within minutes, seven STATs transcription factors, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6, can be phosphorylated at specific tyrosine or serine residues in response to stimulation with IFN-β, and a cell type-specific pattern of activation determines cell fate. IFN-β stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) initiates phosphorylation of STAT family members by forming receptor complexes at the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434066">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511434066">25</xref></sup> Phosphorylated STAT molecules then form homo- or heterodimers, and influence transcription in a manner dependent on the responsive state of the particular cell. Highly specific monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated STAT molecules combined with those that bind cell surface markers are used in multiplexed phospho-specific flow cytometry to measure relative single-cell signalling activity in immune cell subtypes within PBMCs without separating the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511434066">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511434066">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Patients and in vitro NAb titres</title>
<p>Sera of a consecutive cohort of IFN-β-treated patients were analysed for the presence of NAb with the in vitro MxA protein induction ELISA and categorized as NAb-negative (&lt; 20 NU/ml), NAb-positive low to medium (20–300 NU/ml), or NAb-positive high (≥ 300 NU/ml) according to the Kawade formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511434066">28</xref></sup> The data were confirmed using the in vitro Mx1 mRNA quantitative PCR bioassay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511434066">29</xref></sup> In all assays IFN-β-1a (Avonex, Biogen, Inc.) was used for stimulation of cells. Ten IFN-β-treated NAb-positive patients, two patients with RRMS who had not been treated with IFN-β and two healthy volunteers were included. Blood samples were drawn when the patients with MS were clinically stable.</p>

<title>Phospho-specific flow cytometry in primary patient immune cells</title>
<p>A rigorous protocol was followed for collection (CPT BD 8 ml Vacutainer, 362782), cryopreservation (ProFreeze NAO Freezing medium 2×, 12-769E, Sigma), and thawing of PBMCs. Samples were taken at least 12 h after the last IFN-β injection. PBMCs were only used for phospho-flow if viability was at least 90%. At the same time blood was collected in additive-free glass BD vacutainer tubes (368430), and sera stored at -20°C. Available monoclonal antibodies (BD) to intracellular phosphorylated signalling STATs were optimized for activation by IFN-β; antibodies used included tyrosine phosphorylated pSTAT1 (Y701) Alexa-647 (612597), pSTAT6 (Y641) Alexa-488 (612600), pSTAT5 (Y694) Alexa-647 (612599), pSTAT3 (Y705) Alexa-488 (557814), pSTAT4 (Y693) Alexa-488, and serine-phosphorylated pSTAT3 (S727) Alexa-647 (558099). In order to distinguish major cell subtypes in PBMCs, fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to phenotypic markers for T cells and B cells, CD3-PE (555333) and CD20-PerCp-Cy5.5 (558021), respectively, were employed. Monocytes were identified in forward and side scatter plots. PBMC counts per final staining were 0.5–1 million. The protocol used for multiplexed PBMC phospho-flow analysis was previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511434066">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511434066">26</xref></sup> The experiment consisted of two stimulation conditions in the form of serum-free media and sera where autologous PBMCs were activated in parallel with a serial dilution of IFN-β concentrations, and unstimulated samples were used to determine basal phosphorylation levels. Data of activation of the IFN-β signalling pathway in serum-free media served as signalling pattern evaluation in cell subtypes and as control for the stimulation in autologous sera. For the stimulation of PBMCs in serum-free media, X-Vivo 15 (BioWhittaker) with gentamicin (04-418Q) was used; for the stimulation in sera, a 1:1 dilution of autologous sera with X-Vivo 15; IFN-β-1a (Avonex, Biogen, Inc.) was used for stimulation of cells.</p>
<p>Preliminary experiments in PBMCs showed that activation of STATs by INF-β followed a typical dose–response curve with a signalling maximum at 1000–2000 IU/ml of INF-β. The serial dilution of IFN-β concentrations ranged from no stimulation to 8000 IU/ml; the highest concentrations were used in patients with high NAb titres. For each sample, 50,000 ungated events were collected on the FACS Calibur dual-laser cytometer (BD). The instrument’s performance was monitored by Ultra rainbow particles (Spherotech, URFP-30-3) and BD Calibrite Beads (345036, 349502, 340487). For electronic compensation BD compensation beads (552843) were used.</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458511434066">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>FACS data were analysed in FlowJo (Tree Star) and/or Cytobank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cytobank.org/">http://www.cytobank.org/</ext-link>, and median fluorescent intensities (MFI) were exported to Microsoft Excel. Fold changes in phosphorylation (MFI<sub>stim</sub>/MFI<sub>unstim</sub>) were calculated for each cell type and IFN-β concentration in serum-free media and autologous sera. This data set was used for further analysis and heat maps. The dose–response curves up to 2000 U/ml IFN-β were interpolated, modeled by fitting a sigmoid function to the dose–response and missing stimulation dilutions were estimated from the fit. Data was subjected to Partial Least Square analysis (PLS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in software R for statistical computing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). PCA was used to reduce dimensionality of the data set and find clusters of patients with similar signalling patterns. PLS was used to explore the correlation of the ex vivo flow cytometry data with the NAb titres obtained in vitro. For heat maps, Multi Experiment Viewer (MeV, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tigr.org/software/tm4/mev.html">http://www.tigr.org/software/tm4/mev.html</ext-link>) was used.</p>

<p>Workflow diagram.</p>
<p>PBMCs and sera of subjects were collected simultaneously and processed. Cells were re-suspended in serum-free media or autologous sera (diluted with media 1:1), transferred into tubes, and stimulated with IFN-β at concentrations ranging from 0–8000 IU/ml. One tube for each treatment (black) was left unstimulated and was used to determine basal phosphorylation levels. Thereafter cells were fixed, permeabilized, and aliquots transferred into tubes for staining with three antibody master mixes containing cell surface markers and phospho-STATs antibodies as indicated. Single cells were then analysed by flow cytometry. FACS data were gated on cell subtypes within PBMCs: T cells, B cells and monocytes. Positive cells were analysed for phosphorylation of STAT molecules. The median fluorescent intensities were based on 2000–40,000 single-cell measurements depending on cell type. Overlaid histograms show the dose-response of STAT1 phosphorylation in PBMC subtypes of a RRMS patient with low NAb titre after stimulation with indicated concentrations of IFN-β. Black histograms show the unstimulated samples corresponding to basal phosphorylation levels. In autologous sera, STAT phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of NAbs. When the entire data set is represented in heat maps, the general decrease in phosphorylation and activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway is clearly visible in autologous sera.

<p>The sensitivity of the assay was explored in samples from a RRMS patient with very low NAb titre, NU = 17/ml. The STAT1 activation in PBMC subtypes for this patient is shown in overlaid histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511434066">Figure 1</xref>. The range of signal activation of STAT1 in serum-free media in T cells ranged from 1.7-fold increase at 15 IU/ml to 7.8-fold increase at 2000 IU/ml of IFN-β relative to levels in the unstimulated sample, with a plateau reached at about 1000 IU/ml. In autologous sera, however, STAT1 was not phosphorylated when cells were stimulated with 60 IU/ml IFN-β, although the inhibition by NAb was overcome at 2000 U/ml IFN-β. Thus, even very low NAb titres impact the signalling potential of immune cells.</p>

<title>Patient clustering driven by sera composition and STAT1</title>
<p>To identify features of STATs signalling associated with PBMC subtypes and IFN-β concentrations, a PCA algorithm was used to evaluate the two stimulation conditions, autologous sera and serum-free media, separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511434066">Figure 2(a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511434066">2(b)</xref>). Graphic representations show subject distribution and variables separated by cell type (B cells, T cells, monocytes). Three patient clusters were prominent in sample distribution of autologous sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511434066">Figure 2(a)</xref>): NAb-positive (pink and red), treated and NAb-negative (blue), and untreated (green). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511434066">Figure 2(a)</xref>, the blue lines in monocytes and T cells, representing STAT1, show the most pronounced spread compared with other STAT molecules and contribute more than other variables to the variation in principal component (PC) 1 and PC2. Since PC1 and PC2 represent 92.1% of the variation in the data set, patient clustering is highly driven by STAT1. The two highest stimulation concentrations add similar information to the clustering and are the IFN-β concentrations where maximum phosphorylation was achieved at the plateau of the dose–response curve for healthy individuals. Therefore, measuring STAT1 phosphorylation at 1000 IU/ml IFN-β may suffice for the identification of RRMS patients with suboptimal JAK/STATs signalling most likely due to immunogenic effects of IFN-β treatment. Furthermore, the PCA reveals the importance of STAT5 and STAT3 in the clustering of untreated and treated NAb-negative patients, indicating that measurement of STAT3 or STAT5 in addition to STAT1 phosphorylation levels improves the probability of defining a signalling signature for patients with an optimal therapy response.</p>

<p>Principal component analysis separated by treatment: sera and media.</p>
<p>PCA of dose–response curves are represented separately for the two stimulation conditions, autologous sera and serum-free media. Subjects are colour-coded based on NAbs titres: green, untreated; blue, treated NAb-negative; pink, treated NAb-positive low-medium; red, treated NAb-positive high. The loading plots, which contain information about the variables for the corresponding PCA space, are separated according to cell type. Within these plots the various STATs signalling molecules are colour-coded and the serial dilutions of IFN-β concentrations are identified by increasing triangle sizes and connected with lines, thus representing the phosphorylation and thereby activation of a particular STAT molecule at a particular IFN-β stimulation concentration. Variables contributing very little to the PCA are plotted around the centre and variables that contribute most are plotted around the borders. a) Subject clusters are readily identifiable in data from assays in autologous sera. Independently of titres, all patients with NAbs form a tight cluster (pink and red). Untreated patients and healthy individuals are shown in green and NAb-negative patients in blue. In monocytes and T cells, STAT1 phosphorylation (represented with the blue line) is a major contributor in separating patient clusters. The Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test showed significant differences among the three groups in the PCA, but no difference between IFN-β-treated patients with low/medium or high NAb titres. b) No clustering of patients was detectable in assays in serum-free media. pS1: phospho-tyrosine STAT1; pS3: phospho-tyrosine STAT3; pS4: phospho-tyrosine STAT4; pS5: phospho-tyrosine STAT5; pS6: phospho-tyrosine STAT6; pSS3: phospho-serine STAT1; PC: principal component.</p>

<p>The Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test showed significant differences among the three subject clusters. Untreated patients and healthy controls (green) were significantly different from treated patients who were NAb-negative (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001577; blue), from treated patients who were NAb-positive categorized as low/medium (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000562; pink), and from treated patients who were NAb-positive categorized as high (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001466; red). Treated patients in the NAb-negative group (blue) were significantly different from treated patients with low/medium NAb titres (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009595; pink) and high NAb titres (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007966; red). The IFN-β-treated patients with low/medium (pink) and high (red) NAb titres were not statistically different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4042), confirming that the signalling pattern was similar in all IFN-β-treated patients categorized as NAb-positive. Adjusting the <italic>p</italic> value for the Bonferroni correction (to 0.0083) made some differences less pronounced; this is attributed to the small sample sizes in some groups. In PLS analysis, there was a 74% predictability of in vitro obtained NAb titres based on the phospho-flow data, showing that these two measures are not completely correlated.</p>
<p>PCA analysis of serum-free media data served as a control for the stimulation in autologous sera and revealed no clear stratification of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511434066">Figure 2(b)</xref>). This showed that the composition of sera in patients is the critical component for the identification of immunogenicity.</p>

The signalling pathway inhibition in some patients in the low/medium NAbs range was overcome by the stimulation with relatively high IFN-β concentrations of 2000–8000 IU/ml. These IFN-β levels were considerably higher than those found in the sera of IFN-β-treated RRMS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511434066">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511434066">31</xref></sup> Heat maps of patients with RRMS who had been treated with IFN-β, but were NAb-negative are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511434066">Figure 3(b)</xref> (blue roundels).

<p>Although the experiment was not designed to test for a treatment effect per se, our data indicated that the signalling potential response pattern of STAT molecules within the IFN-β pathway was significantly affected by the IFN-β therapy regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511434066">Figure 3(b)</xref>). For example at 2000 IU/ml re-stimulation with IFN-β, T-cells of IFN-β treated patients with RRMS who had no measurable NAbs in sera showed about a two-fold reduction in signalling activation/phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3 and STAT6 in autologous sera when compared with the data from untreated patients. In monocytes from treated patients, the reductions of STAT5 and STAT3 phosphorylation were less pronounced and STAT1 activation was slightly increased compared with data from untreated patients, and B cells showed a reduction of STAT3 and STAT6 activation, but not STAT5 activation. Thus, cells of patients with RRMS appear to respond to IFN-β therapy with changes in the activation potential of specific STAT molecules in immune cell subtypes; these alterations presumably affect the sensitivity of these cells to the medication. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511434066">Figure 3(d)</xref> heat maps showed consistent cell type-specific signalling patterns for the stimulation in serum-free media for all individuals. Phosphorylation of serine STAT3 could be measured in monocytes, but not in T cells and B cells, while phosphorylation of STAT4 was only present in T cells. Data from these subjects demonstrated that the response to IFN-β was present in all individuals when sera containing inhibiting factors such as NAbs are removed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The immunogenic effects of IFN-β therapy in primary immune cells from IFN-β-treated and untreated patients with RRMS who manifested a broad range of anti-IFN-β NAb titres were evaluated using a single-cell multiplexed flow cytometry-based technique. Although cell culture bioassays can identify the presence of an immunogenic response in patients, these types of assays do not reveal immunogenic effects in specific individuals. In patients with RRMS treated with IFN-β there was a discrepancy between the categorization of NAb-positive patients based on in vitro NAb titres and the immunogenic effect on the IFN-β/STAT signalling pathway measured in primary cells of the patients. Immune cells from NAb-positive patients in both the low/medium and high titre categories showed a significant loss in the signalling potential of the IFN-β/STATs signalling pathway. The data revealed that immunogenic effects do alter the response in primary cells even at low NAb levels, and confirmed that cell line-based immunogenicity testing is not readily transferable to the immunogenic response in patients, especially in the lower ranges of NAb titres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511434066">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The extent of inhibition of STATs signalling activation in immune cells of IFN-β-treated RRMS patients with low NAb titres was surprising, but clearly confirms the importance of NAbs in patients. Our data suggest that there is no biological cut-off for the immunogenic effect of NAb in the IFN-β therapy system below which primary immune cell responses are not altered. The inhibitory effect of low NAb titres could be compensated for by increases in the IFN-β concentration in some patients, but increasing IFN-β concentrations in already NAb-positive patients may lead to side effects, and the consequences of maintaining an active immune response to the drug may be metabolically costly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511434066">33</xref></sup> Thus, under physiological conditions it is unlikely that IFN-β-responsive cells in blood of patients with RRMS respond normally to IFN-β therapy or endogenous IFN-β in the presence of NAb at any titre. The results support the notion that even low NAb titres are of clinical concern; NAbs may persist for years after therapy cessation, and have been shown to inhibit endogenous IFN-β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511434066">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511434066">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies on gene expression changes after IFN-β administration identified the inducible IFN responsive gene myxovirus-resistant protein A (Mx1) as a surrogate biomarker for the biological effect of IFN-β in whole blood. Induction of Mx1 expression is type-one IFN-specific and correlates with NAb titres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511434066">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511434066">37</xref></sup> The data presented here on cell subtype-specific STATs phosphorylation after ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMCs with IFN-β support the NAb effect seen on Mx1 expression in whole blood from patients. Evidence for a link between cell type-specific gene expression changes and cell type-specific STATs phosphorylation has been shown in whole blood of healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511434066">38</xref></sup> However, whether cell type-specific STATs activation can be directly correlated with gene expression changes of Mx1 in whole blood remains to be elucidated in a future study.</p>
<p>The whole-cell phospho-flow assay described here can both detect NAbs and reveal the biological effect of NAbs in primary cell subtypes. Furthermore, the data indicate that the assay may be used to delineate an optimal treatment response signalling pattern, making it possible to identify patients who will respond to INF-β treatment. The major advantage of this assay is that the impact of NAbs on the INF-β signal transduction pathway is measured through a functional test of signalling molecule activity in primary cells. In this manner the assay is patient specific, and thereby allows for clinical management to be accomplished based on functional activity and not just levels of NAbs.</p>
<p>Finally, a longitudinal study may reveal how signalling network potentials in PBMCs subtypes are affected by disease course and therapy, and provide new mechanistic insight on IFN-β efficacy and immunogenic effects in individual patients. Notably, in PBMC from MS patients, distinct clinical disease characteristics could be linked to abnormal gene expression levels and STATs phosphorylation potentials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511434066">39</xref></sup> For example, in PBMCs from MS patients with severe exacerbation or continuous clinical progression, lower expression levels of IFN inducible genes compared with stable MS could be connected to suboptimal phosphorylation potential of serin727–STAT1. In MS, where the pathogenesis is poorly understood and the disease may be skewed towards different phenotypes from onset, phospho-specific flow cytometry in primary cells may be a reliable tool for monitoring disease patterns and therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511434066">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data indicate that the single-cell phospho-specific assay can be made simple and robust, and will benefit patient health while reducing costs. The results from re-activating cells of IFN-β-treated RRMS patients in autologous sera showed that measuring only STAT1 in monocytes at a single IFN-β concentration that induces maximum signal induction in healthy cells was sufficient to identify patients with an inhibition of the IFN-β/STAT pathway. The aim in the near future is to adapt this assay to whole blood. Such an approach will further reduce the steps and costs of the assay, and samples could be integrated into routine diagnostic blood cell analysis by flow cytometry.</p>
