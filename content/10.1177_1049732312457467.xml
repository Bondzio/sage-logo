<abstract>
<p>Coordinator-based osteoporosis (OP) screening programs for fragility-fracture patients in orthopedic environments improve rates of OP testing and care, but there are still gaps in care. The purpose of this study was to understand the process by which patients decided whether to proceed with OP testing or care within these programs. Twenty-four fragility-fracture patients in the OP screening program at a large, urban, university hospital in Canada participated in one of five focus groups. Focus group transcripts were sorted and coded. Links between themes were developed to generate a description of the process leading to successful initiation of OP care after a fragility fracture. To initiate OP testing and care, patients had to both comprehend the link between their fragility fracture and OP, and make an action-oriented appraisal of what action to take. Several modifiable facilitators and barriers influenced the process between screening and undergoing OP testing and initiating treatment.</p>

<body>
<p>Osteoporosis (OP) is a disease that slowly diminishes the strength of cortical bone. It is estimated that OP affects 21.3% of women and 5.5% of men more than 50 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312457467">Berger et al., 2010</xref>). OP renders the bone more susceptible to fracture when exposed to forces that would not fracture normal-strength bone, such as a slip, trip, or fall. These fragility fractures account for 80% of fractures in women more than 50 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312457467">Bessette et al., 2008</xref>). Having a fragility fracture doubles the 10-year risk for another fracture, putting these patients at higher risk for additional fractures. The most devastating fragility fracture is a hip fracture, which carries a 20% first-year mortality rate and a high degree of morbidity, including diminished quality of life and loss of ability to live independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312457467">Bliuc et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312457467">Johnell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312457467">Papaioannou et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinical trials have shown that pharmaceutical treatment with bone-sparing agents taken regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312457467">Siris et al., 2009</xref>) can reduce the risk of fractures by half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312457467">Cranney, Tugwell, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312457467">Cranney, Wells, et al., 2002</xref>). Despite this evidence and clinical practice guidelines in several countries that define optimal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312457467">Brown &amp; Josse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312457467">Javid, Thien, &amp; Hill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312457467">Lewiecki &amp; Watts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312457467">National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312457467">Papaioannou et al., 2010</xref>), only about 20% of patients receive testing or treatment for OP after a fragility fracture to prevent additional fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312457467">Elliot-Gibson, Bogoch, Jamal, &amp; Beaton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312457467">Foley, Foster, Meadows, Baser, &amp; Long, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312457467">Giangregorio, Papaioannou, Cranney, Zytaruk, &amp; Adachi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312457467">Sale, Beaton, Posen, Elliot-Gibson, &amp; Bogoch, 2011</xref>). Several approaches to overcome this gap in the implementation of guidelines and evidence have been described. They ranged in intensity from mailed reminders to patients and/or their physicians regarding testing and care, to very intensive programs in which dedicated staff facilitated testing and/or educational and pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312457467">Bogoch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312457467">Chevalley, Hoffmeyer, Bonjour, &amp; Rizzoli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312457467">Harrington, Barash, Day, &amp; Lease, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312457467">Majumdar, Beaupre, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312457467">McLellan, Gallacher, Fraser, &amp; McQuillian, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our center developed a dedicated staffing approach in 2002 to identify patients and facilitate testing, referral, and OP treatment if indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312457467">Bogoch et al., 2006</xref>). Such models have demonstrated improved OP care rates (Bogoch et al.; Majumdar, Beaupre, et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312457467">Majumdar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312457467">Sale et al., 2011</xref>) and a cost benefit for hip fractures prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312457467">Majumdar, Johnson, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312457467">Sander, Elliot-Gibson, Beaton, Bogoch, &amp; Maetzel, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, not all high-risk patients with an indication for treatment received care, leaving room for additional efforts to improve uptake of evidence-based OP care (Majumdar, Beaupre, et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312457467">Majumdar et al., 2008</xref>). To date, few studies have focused on the patient’s perspective as a way to understand the health behavior changes inherent in getting a fragility-fracture patient on OP care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312457467">Sujic, Gignac, Cockerill, &amp; Beaton, 2011</xref>). The objective of this study was to interview patients at risk for an additional OP-related fragility fracture and to understand their experiences of OP awareness, diagnosis, testing, and treatment within the context of a coordinator-based system in an orthopedic fracture clinic setting. We also sought to identify factors associated with the successful uptake of testing and treatment recommendations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312457467" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this study we used focus groups and approached the analysis from a constructivist grounded theory perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312457467">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). Like grounded theory, this approach depended highly on the methods of open and then axial coding by finding links between open-code themes, constant comparisons to find exceptions and rules, and the development of a framework—in our case, the pathway to OP care for the patients—from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312457467">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). From its constructivist roots, in this approach, the researcher’s role is recognized in the shared construction of the meaning of the story. This type of analysis was well suited to the study of processes of care and has been widely used in health behavior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312457467">Charmaz, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312457467">Salt &amp; Peden, 2011</xref>). We chose to use focus groups rather than individual interviews because we were interested in allowing the interactions between participants to guide and inform the understanding of common vs. divergent experiences in the process of OP care after a fracture.</p>
<p>We recruited women 40 years and older and men 50 years and older who had experienced a low-trauma or fragility fracture and who had been screened through the osteoporosis care program at our hospital 3 to 9 months prior to recruitment. Fragility fracture was defined as a fracture that occurred as a result of a slip, trip, or fall from standing height or less. We excluded participants if they were unable to participate in the focus group in English, or if they had significant physical or cognitive impairment. Patients were contacted by phone by the original screening coordinator who had met them in the fracture clinic. This coordinator asked about their interest in talking to research staff about participating in the study. The research staff then contacted patients who expressed a willingness to discuss the study and sent them a study information sheet and a consent form. They also booked the patients into the focus group sessions. We obtained approval from the hospital’s research ethics board prior to commencement of the study.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312457467">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Focus groups were facilitated by a trained, independent facilitator who was provided with a set of guiding questions developed by the research team. The following themes were explored: (a) patients’ knowledge and perceptions of OP and its diagnosis and treatment, before and after their fracture; (b) patients’ descriptions of how they learned about OP—the source of information, forces that influenced their perceptions of OP, and timing of when they decided to act on this; and (c) patients’ experiences and perceptions of barriers to and facilitators of OP awareness, testing, and treatment. Patients also completed a 1-page survey with their age, gender, description of fracture, and testing and treatment information. All focus groups were audiotaped and both the study coordinator and the facilitator took notes at each session. Members of the study team (Rebeka Sujic and Dorcas Beaton) and the facilitator had a debriefing session after each focus group to agree on the main themes that arose from the session and to consider any themes that should be explored in subsequent focus groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312457467">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The audiotapes of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim, and any identifying information was removed. The study coordinator verified transcripts against the original tapes. Data were transferred into NVivo-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312457467">QSR International, 2002</xref>), a computer software program that facilitates the analysis and sorting of qualitative data. Four study team members (Kristin McIlroy, Rebeka Sujic, Dorcas Beaton, and Joanna Sale) independently coded each transcript. Coding was open; i.e., blocks of meaningful text were highlighted and labeled or coded by each team member. We defined codes and shared findings at a group meeting that took place after the coding of each focus group session. A coding manual was built and was revised with each subsequent focus group. Once initial coding was completed, we used axial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312457467">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312457467">1995</xref>) to identify main themes and subthemes and to link them with other related codes; for example, things that might have led up to or followed an event. The relationships between the codes were recorded in notes and in the NVivo database, which also provided a graphical representation of the emerging set of relationships. We recoded all transcripts at the end of the study to ensure that the final codes had been applied to all transcripts. We reached consensus on the key findings and a graphical representation of them.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 24 patients (18 women, 6 men) participated in five focus groups. All participants had experienced at least one fragility fracture within the previous 12 months, consisting of 14 wrist fractures, 7 shoulder fractures, 2 hip fractures, and 1 pelvis fracture, and were provided with education and a referral for a bone mineral density (BMD) test by an OP screening coordinator based in the fracture clinic. Of these, 22 patients reported having had a BMD test. Twenty patients reported receiving treatment for OP in the form of vitamin D and/or bisphosphonates, including 9 patients who reported specific treatment with bisphosphonates. The average age of the participants was 64.2 years (range 47 to 80).</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312457467">
<title>Core Finding</title>
<p>The core finding in our analysis was that patients described a common experience in the process that led to them going for OP testing and care (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312457467">Figure 1</xref>). Patients described a specific moment of awareness of the link between their fracture and underlying issues of bone health. We called this the “Aha!” moment. This moment was a turning point in patients’ understanding of their bone health and future fracture risk. It was immediately followed by an action-oriented appraisal of what to do to mitigate their risk. Once this awareness and appraisal had taken place, patients were more likely to proceed to BMD testing and, in some cases, OP pharmacotherapy. These three phases of awareness, appraisal, and action comprised what most participants described as the essential elements of their pathway to OP testing and care, which we have labeled the “main pathway.”</p>

<p>The “Aha!” type of awareness was critical to initiating the main pathway. Its absence was often accompanied by the patients’ active rationalizations regarding the cause of their fracture and denial that it could be because of weakened bone. Patients offered elaborate descriptions of how “anyone would have broken something” if they had fallen in a similar manner. The absence of awareness was also associated with a perceived lack of need for subsequent testing or treatment: “I thought it [testing and treatment] was unnecessary. I didn’t see a need. I knew that I broke it, not because it was a weak bone; it’s just the way I fell.” Another participant stated, “It’s not something I would think of doing. Why would I want to? It’s only my doctor [telling me to], or if I broke my wrist again. Otherwise, it’s not a priority.”</p>
<p>Participants described their awareness as having occurred at a single point in time. This turning point was not part of a prolonged decision-making process or a set of stages such as those described by the Stages-of-Change Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312457467">Prochaska et al., 1994</xref>), but rather was characterized by a sudden awareness:
<disp-quote>
<p>I knew it was something to be reckoned with, not ignored. I had thought, “My three breaks are normal because I rush a lot,” and [the coordinator] pointed out to me that that just doesn’t happen. When I fell down, it was slippery, and so I thought it was an accident. So it was very interesting to me that they said, “No, [you are] over fifty and therefore you should check that out,” because I would not have related the two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants’ descriptions also suggested mechanisms that led to this point of awareness. Participants who experienced the transition to an awareness of their fracture risk rarely described it as an external cognition alone, but more as a synthesis of information from their own or a family member’s past. These predisposing factors—factors that Badley might label the “scene setters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312457467">Badley, 2008</xref>)—usually defined a source of information that participants could pull together to make sense of themselves as having a fragility fracture. For example, some patients mentioned being aware of OP because of their mothers, and this helped them relate to the possibility of having this disorder: “I knew a fair bit about osteoporosis. My mom had it. She was shrinking away.” This same factor, however, sometimes had a negative impact on individual patients’ recognition of their bone disease. For younger participants, who did not wish to align themselves with an “older person’s” disease, the experience of their mothers did not improve their own awareness:
<disp-quote>
<p>My mother was diagnosed with osteoporosis when she was in her early seventies. She had a fracture in her back. Other than her telling me, “You have to be careful,” I know it is serious, but it’s [an] older people’s disease.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still others synthesized the pattern in their own lives:
<disp-quote>
<p>And they said would I go to the bone density clinic, and I said, “Yes.” I’ve had this tendency. I broke this arm three to four years ago. And then before that, I had broken my shoulder. And I broke my ankle many years ago. So I thought it was a good idea to go. And I take Prednisone [medication]. They [steroid medications] tend to damage your bones, so I’m very interested in this program.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The turning point was therefore a synthesis of immediate issues, i.e., their fracture, with efforts to make sense of it. Initially, sense was made by describing the fall in detail and the mechanisms that would have led anyone to have a fracture. After synthesizing family history, personal information, and information from friends and other influential persons, the patients’ cognition was changed, and they subsequently linked their fracture and underlying bone health. This “Aha!” moment was then immediately followed by the second phase: the appraisal of what to do. The appraisal usually led to action through one of two psychological forces: the fear of a future repeat fracture, or conversely, in a more positive way, the desire for healthy aging, free of future fractures. The fear of future negative consequences was demonstrated in these statements: “The fracture has completely altered my life. I am terrified of falling and I feel like an old person. I now walk with my head down all the time.” Fear was also a motivator for another participant:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m on treatment right now, so obviously I have decided and the factor can be summed up in one word: fear. Fear of what would happen if I didn’t. How many bones I’d break. Would I be all bent over with osteoporosis?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The desire for a positive future outcome was expressed as follows: “I want to be able to continue to travel. Vanity. I want to look good, feel good.”</p>
<p>Appraisal involved thinking about and assembling various pieces of information to form a coherent action plan: “And after I broke my shoulder I did decide I had to get more serious, and I got into the issue with vitamin D.” The participants said that the information they were seeking needed to be immediately accessible and clear. The majority of people moved through this process of sorting through information after they became aware of the link between their fracture and bone health. We called them seekers because they actively sought information to manage a health issue: “You have to ask the questions. I’m the one who’s always pushing. I had to ask for my first bone density [test] because my doctor didn’t believe I needed to do anything, and I was well over 50.” From another participant we heard the following: “I would like to see someone sit down and interpret this for me, because I like to learn, not just say, ‘You have osteoporosis.’” Family physicians were a valued source of information, and one participant emphasized the importance of asking questions:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of people don’t ask questions. If the doctor says, “Your bone density is fine,” everything’s fine. I want to know more than that, and I ask a million questions, and he knows. I write them down before I go, and I take a list, and he says, “What’s on the list today?” And my doctor is very good about answering all my questions. But you have to ask the questions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, a group we labeled nonseekers readily followed their health care provider’s recommendations—or absence of recommendations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312457467">Figure 2</xref>). Nonseekers tended to depend on the forces within the health care system, such as the health care provider or infrastructure, to guide their health-related behaviors. They waited for a health care provider in the system to identify the need for a test, or the need for therapeutic intervention, and readily complied with physician recommendations. To progress to testing and treatment, nonseekers did not need to have the “Aha!” experience, nor struggle with what action to take. They reported simply following their physician’s medical advice: “I would say you either trust your doctor or you don’t. Based on past experience . . . Dr. [name] was pretty good, and I pretty well follow his advice.” They also described why they waited for their doctor to raise important issues: “I’m not the reader type so, you know, if you can talk to me about it, I will listen. I don’t do a whole lot of the self-help stuff.” Nonseekers described trust and faith in their care providers and described relying on this trust for decisions about testing and treatment.</p>

<p>Seekers and nonseekers: Two patterns in which patients manage their health care decisions</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312457467-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>An important barrier to undergoing testing and treatment for both nonseekers and seekers was the patients’ perceptions of the importance placed on testing and care by their primary care physicians. If patients perceived that their providers did not see OP as important, they were less likely to be tested, because they felt that the issue of OP and fracture risk was therefore not an issue for them: “I figured [my doctor] would tell me what I need to know. I don’t actively look for osteoporosis information because I’ve been going for regular annual check-ups. I figured people would tell me what I need to know.” Patients waited for the physician to endorse specific actions: “If my doctor thought it was something I should have done, I would do it.” This type of response placed the responsibility for action primarily on the health care practitioner. In some situations, both seekers and nonseekers achieved the targeted outcome of OP testing and possibly treatment. However, the large gap in the health care system’s ability to identify all fragility-fracture patients and ensure guideline-based OP care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312457467">Sale et al., 2011</xref>) leaves those patients dependent on the system, i.e., the nonseekers, at a great disadvantage compared to the more self-reliant seekers.</p>

<title>Moderating Factors</title>
<p>The focus groups also revealed factors influencing each of the stages of the main pathway. These factors are described below in terms of the predominant way they influenced participants’ progress through the pathway. For example, the cost of medications and whether drugs were covered by insurance might have influenced patients’ decisions or their likelihood of getting care, but this was not described as influencing their sudden awareness. We tried to align the factors with what the participants described as their point of influence. Some were barriers to and others were facilitators of initiating OP investigation and treatment.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732312457467">
<title>Barriers to and facilitators of the “Aha!” moment</title>
<p>Awareness of the link between the fracture and bone-health issues was influenced by three moderating factors: (a) the role of the primary care physician in enabling this awareness, (b) experiences with diagnostic BMD testing, and (c) interpretability of the test results. In many cases, the coordinators sent the patients back to their primary care physician for OP testing and management, including pharmacotherapy if indicated. The patients depended on their health care providers to take on OP management, but often perceived them to be too busy to do so: “It’s hard to remember what you want to ask at that exact moment and they [the doctor] are walking out of the door.” Still others sensed resistance to the patient raising questions regarding OP:

<p>It [OP] was never discussed in a medical check-up. [Now] I go to see a doctor with a list and I say to her, “Do you hate people who come in with a list?” and she says, “Yes,” [laughter] and I try to keep it quite short if I can.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The primary care physician was the hub of care for many of the participants, and the doctors’ responses to the need to look at OP as a causal factor might have influenced the likelihood of the individual patient receiving guideline-based care. If the primary care physician was not on board, the patient would not have received the order for BMD testing.</p>
<p>Another barrier was a lack of understanding of what is involved in the process of having a BMD test and apprehension regarding it. Patients reported not knowing what to expect prior to a BMD test; they thought it was a more invasive procedure than it actually was. They advised us to clarify that the BMD test is a simple test so that patients would be more likely to attend it: “I didn’t know what to expect. I can’t remember too much. It was noninvasive.” Another patient advised, “Tell people that it’s a simple test. It takes about two minutes. You stay in your clothing.” Ease of access to BMD testing was raised as a facilitator, likely because most of the study participants lived in a large urban center where many BMD testing clinics were available: “I think they make it convenient. There are a lot of clinics, and it was very simple; nothing like going for a mammogram.”</p>
<p>The third barrier that influenced whether the pivotal shift in awareness took place was the uncertainty surrounding interpretation of the BMD test results. Patients were often unable to describe the meaning of their test results or the results themselves: “But they never tell you what your particular results are and what they mean. They just [say], ‘Well, you seem that you’re at significant risk for osteoporosis.’ What the [expletive] does that mean?” Another was advised not to be concerned about a low BMD result:
<disp-quote>
<p>The bone scan came back. The doctor said it was fine. I said, “Well, it looks like I might have a higher than normal risk,” and she said, “Statistically. It’s only a statistic. Don’t worry about it.” So, basically, I went away thinking everything was hunky-dory [good] for me until the X-ray showed it actually wasn’t.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Barriers to and facilitators of appraisal/deciding what to do</title>
<p>The next phase in our pathway was the appraisal of what to do after the participants realized they could be at risk. The patients described an immediate need to figure out what to do once they had the information. We identified four factors that influenced appraisal: one facilitator and three barriers. The OP screening coordinator was described as a reinforcement for awareness and was seen as a facilitator of positive appraisal for several reasons. The coordinator was perceived to have access to accurate information that was personalized and relevant for the patient, and also scheduled BMD tests, provided guidance, and followed up with patients: “What I like is that they [screening coordinators] take the time with you. You don’t feel hurried or rushed.” Another participant found that the coordinator provided a link to all of the necessary activities:
<disp-quote>
<p>[The coordinator] was right on top of the situation. For instance, when I went to the fracture clinic the first time, [coordinator] came and asked a few questions and suggested that I have a bone density test. And she made arrangements right then and there. And I went right from the fracture clinic and had a bone density test done, without any waiting or any appointments, the same day, and to me that was rather amazing. Also, she did do a follow-up and in a very short time by contacting me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The cost of medications (i.e., drug coverage) also influenced uptake of OP therapy. At the time of this study, prescription drugs now considered “first-line” treatment were not covered under the senior citizens’ drug benefits plan in our province except under certain circumstances, such as having a low-trauma fracture. Cost was therefore eliminated by the low-trauma fracture, and the fracture ironically was seen as a means to access more effective medications: “So it was worth breaking a bone? . . . In that sense. I wasn’t happy that I broke a bone, but I couldn’t afford to do it [pay for medication] on my own.” Appraisal was also influenced by competing demands. Other medications and other health conditions were noted as barriers to starting OP treatment: “Something will get me at some point. You need to weigh them [medical conditions] out.” Participants who had to take concurrent medications for other conditions also saw those as a barrier: “I am already on a lot of medications.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most modifiable barrier was the perceived lack of clarity around what actions to take. Patients often found themselves exposed to conflicting information regarding OP care, which blocked their ability to make an informed decision. Patients juggling several unclear options were less likely to engage in appropriate treatment: “I am going insane, and my hands are full of little scraps of paper with what different people have told me to take.” In a situation of confusion, participants opted for doing nothing: “I thought maybe I should start taking calcium, but then you read so many things. Don’t know which brand is right, so I wasn’t taking anything.” In our final model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049732312457467">Figure 3</xref>), we illustrate the main pathway for seekers and nonseekers, the barriers and facilitators, and the predisposing factors in what we think best represents the patient’s process in decision making around OP testing and care following a fragility fracture. The main pathway is led by an awareness or “Aha!” moment followed by an action-oriented appraisal and related actions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study has shown that most patients had to first understand the link between their fragility fracture and an underlying bone-health issue, as well as the fact that this placed them at greater risk for another fracture, before they could consider actions to mitigate the risk. Once aware, they made an action-oriented appraisal about what action to take. Optimally this action would be BMD testing to complete the full risk assessment, and pharmacotherapy when indicated. Patients in this study described a number of factors that acted as barriers to or facilitators of initiating this process. Many of the barriers could be modified and might offer an avenue to diminish the current gap in OP intervention after fragility fracture in future programs and research.</p>
<p>The first step of our main pathway has been mentioned in other publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312457467">Meadows &amp; Mrkonjic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312457467">Meadows, Mrkonjic, &amp; Lagendyk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312457467">Meadows, Mrkonjic, Petersen, &amp; Lagendyk, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312457467">Meadows and colleagues (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312457467">Cadarette, Gignac, Jaglal, Beaton, and Hawker (2007)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312457467">Giangregorio et al. ( 2008)</xref> previously described the centrality of the patients’ understanding or misunderstanding of their fracture risk, as well as underlying bone-health issues in terms of uptake of evidence-based care. Our work expands on this finding by linking this awareness with an immediate action-oriented appraisal. This additional information has important implications for patient education and OP care delivery. Whereas facilitating a positive appraisal after a patient accepts the link between the fragility fracture and OP is an important step in OP management, we suggest that, based on our findings, the best time for education delivery is immediately after the patient understands this link.</p>
<p>Patients described a number of factors that acted as barriers to or facilitators of this process: physicians being “too busy” to discuss OP, accessibility of BMD testing centers, competing demands, lack of drug coverage, and a perceived lack of clarity about testing and treatment throughout the process. Several researchers have examined barriers and solutions to successful OP management from the health care provider’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312457467">Jaglal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312457467">Kaufman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312457467">Simonelli, Killeen, Mehle, &amp; Swanson, 2002</xref>); however, few have asked patients for their opinions. Meadows and colleagues reported failure of communication as a persistent barrier to OP treatment, as described in interviews conducted with women aged 45 to 65 years at 0, 3, and 12 months following a fragility fracture in an urban Canadian center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312457467">Meadows, Mrkonjic, O’Brien, &amp; Tink, 2007</xref>). Similarly, in our study, patients felt they had inadequate time to address their concerns with their doctors. Some patients reported receiving conflicting information about the meaning of a low BMD test result. Patients’ perceptions of their current bone health did not necessarily correspond to the most recent BMD test results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312457467">Sale, Beaton, Bogoch, Elliot-Gibson &amp; Frankel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312457467">Jaglal and colleagues’ (2003)</xref> study involving health care providers echoed many of the issues raised by the focus group participants in our study. Their analysis of focus groups consisting of Ontario family physicians revealed that family physicians lacked a rationale for testing and were confused about the recommended management of OP. Some of the principal barriers to OP care raised by the physicians in that study were also described by the patients in the focus groups: patients having other competing health conditions, interpretation of BMD test results, and lack of knowledge regarding appropriate treatment and follow-up. These concerns might all result at least in part from the constraints of limited time and competing demands of the physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312457467">Jaglal et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, although patients are reliant on their doctors for directives regarding OP care, many physicians experience much the same uncertainty about the management of OP as their patients.</p>
<p>Based on the information provided by the focus group participants, we created a model to describe these fragility-fracture patients’ paths to health care utilization and guideline-based pharmacotherapy. Our model has components consistent with the Andersen Model of Health Care Utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312457467">Andersen, 1995</xref>). The participants identified a number of factors that acted as facilitators of or barriers to OP testing and treatment at a health care system level, a health care provider level (i.e., a primary care physician or rehabilitation staff), and at a personal level.</p>
<p>Our findings center on the patient as a key agent for change and are consistent with published models of health behavior change. For example, the “Aha!” moment combined with the immediate need for information to make an action-oriented appraisal is similar to the “teachable moment” heuristic described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312457467">McBride, Emmons, and Lipkus (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312457467">Monti et al. (1999)</xref>. The teachable moment occurred when the fragility fracture, a cueing event, was associated with emotional arousal, new appraisal of personal risk and potential outcomes, and a redefinition of sense of self (McBride et al.). If a teachable moment is in place, this heuristic proposes an increase in the likelihood of subsequent behavior change. This is consistent with what the patients described to us. The teachable moment heuristic also includes the critical timing element and proposes that the best time to influence fragility-fracture patients’ beliefs and attitudes toward their future bone health is shortly after their fracture. This is also consistent with our findings.</p>
<p>The Health Belief Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312457467">Becker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312457467">Janz &amp; Becker, 1984</xref>) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312457467">Brewer, Blake, Rankin, &amp; Douglass, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312457467">Montano, Kasprzyk, &amp; Taplin, 1997</xref>) both support the centrality of the patient’s perception of need to formulate the intention and personal motivation to change a behavior—in our case, uptake of OP care. Linking our findings to these models will help us to look for factors that we could modify within our program and to anticipate the likely impact of interventions to improve these factors.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study. Patients were sampled from only one center, and we excluded those physically unable to attend the focus groups as well as those with cognitive deficits or language barriers that would prevent them from participating. We speculate that some of the reported barriers and facilitators were context-dependent and might be specific to our coordinator-based screening program; however, programs of this type are being recognized as efficacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312457467">Ashe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312457467">Ashe, McKay, Janssen, Guy, &amp; Khan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312457467">Majumdar, Beaupre, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312457467">Majumdar et al., 2008</xref>) and are increasingly employed in postfracture settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312457467">Ashe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312457467">Che, Ettinger, Liang, Pressman, &amp; Johnston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312457467">Levasseur et al., 2007</xref>; Majumdar, Beaupre, et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312457467">McLellan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312457467">Vaile, Sullivan, Bennett, &amp; Bleasel, 2007</xref>). Finally, there was insufficient discussion within the focus groups about which elements influenced patients’ adherence with treatment, an issue that is key to realizing the benefits of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312457467">Cadarette &amp; Burden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312457467">Papaioannou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312457467">Papaioannou, Kennedy, Dolovich, Lau, &amp; Adachi, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are the reliance on and analysis of the patients’ perspectives on the process of obtaining OP testing and care. We used rigorous qualitative analyses, with four coders for each transcript and extensive discussions of arising themes. Several components of our findings were supported by existing OP literature, but were placed in a new context. The final model developed in our study has also generated new themes to be further explored in future research. This might include how to enable an “Aha!” moment in patients, and how to effectively deliver information to patients in a timely manner after they experience this awareness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have learned that to improve uptake of OP testing and care, we might best focus on enabling patients’ awareness of their need for that care and match that awareness with the delivery of immediate, relevant, and accurate information by someone within the health care system; in our case, the OP screening coordinator played that role. In addition, we have identified modifiable barriers, such as confusion surrounding BMD result interpretation, perceptions of physicians’ disinterest in OP, and some inaccurate health beliefs. These could be addressed to potentially improve the number of patients tested and treated for OP after a fragility fracture, perhaps through the application of health-behavior-change models that seem to fit with the perceptions of the participants in this study.</p>
