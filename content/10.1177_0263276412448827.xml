<abstract>
<p>This article seeks to address how topological approaches to cultural change might be combined with ethnographic analysis in order to suggest new ways of thinking empirically about the dynamic political and moral spaces that infrastructural systems create and sustain. The analytical focus is on how diverse notions of relationality and connectivity are mobilized in the production of infrastructural systems that sustain the capacity of ‘state-space’ to simultaneously emerge as closed territorial entity and as open, networked form. The article seeks to establish that the differences and discontinuities inherent in all spatio-temporal relations might productively be considered as ‘intervals’ that both separate and connect across time and space. The notion of an infrastructural system as an interface that conjures both topological and topographical space is the idea that I set out to explore.</p>

<p>In this article I consider how topological thinking might inform a critical ethnographic analysis of how infrastructural systems come to constitute state-space, both as material relational form and as abstract potential. Infrastructural projects such as the large-scale road construction programmes that I have studied in Peru<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412448827">1</xref></sup> are clearly linked to the territorializing practices of state-making and the study of the emergence of such systems offers a vantage point from which to explore the ways in which particular spatial configurations facilitate the exercise of power. As ordering projects these infrastructures open up the possibility for thinking through the specific ways in which ‘state-space’ and ‘territory’ are conceptually conflated, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412448827">Brenner and Elden (2009)</xref>, and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412448827">Brighenti (2010)</xref> in their respective reflections on the work of Henri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412448827">Lefebvre. Lefebvre (1991</xref> [1974]) was interested in challenging the ‘transparency’ or taken-for-grantedness of state-space, and called for a critical analysis of the specific practices and processes through which an acceptance of generic or abstract space is achieved. There are many ways in which this agenda has been taken up in recent years, in what Brenner and Elden refer to as a ‘veritable outpouring of innovative theoretical and empirical work devoted to denaturalizing the historical and contemporary geographies of state power’ (2009: 355). But they also note that less attention has been paid to the ways in which ‘territory’ signals a historically and geographically specific form of political organization and political thought’ (2009: 355). Brighenti’s work on the ‘territory effect’ takes up this challenge and demonstrates an important theoretical and descriptive commitment to ‘reveal the permanent tension between, on the one hand, procedures of stabilization, order, consensus, hegemony, pre-assignment and, on the other, the irreducible plurality of each territory, necessarily mirrored in every territorial constitution and regime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412448827">Brighenti, 2010</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>The irreducible plurality of infrastructural spaces has been explored by scholars of science and technology studies interested in the multiple material, financial, technical, political and social relations that infrastructural spaces ‘bundle together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412448827">Collier, 2011</xref>). The memorable accounts of the unexpected consequences and contingent effects of state-sponsored infrastructural projects which such scholarship have produced exemplify how these complex relational spaces carry ‘invisible trouble’ within themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412448827">Star and Lampland, 2009</xref>) and register the inherent instabilities and fluctuations that their multiple components entail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276412448827">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The idiom of the topological offers a language for articulating the instabilities and fluctuations of state territory in explicit contradistinction to the topographical or metric idioms deployed to conjure more static notions of state-space. Topographical idioms mobilize the coordinates and metrics of fixed spatial geometries that allow the size of a territory to be measured or the distance between centre and periphery to be calculated, giving singular and absolute depictions of the space in question. In topographical mapping, the boundaries of state power appear as commensurate with a clearly defined territorial boundary, and such categorical mappings are echoed in the spatially nested structures of administrative divisions (in Peru these would be departments, provinces, districts and communities). Topological idioms, by contrast, focus on how ‘power relationships are not so much positioned in space or extended across it, as compose the spaces of which they are a part’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412448827">Allen, 2011</xref>: 284). The topological approach thus draws attention to the spatial figures where insides and outsides are continuous, where borders of inclusion and exclusion do not coincide with the edges of a demarcated territory, and where it is the mutable quality of relations that determines distance and proximity, rather than a singular and absolute measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276412448827">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The move to topological thinking in the contemporary social sciences has come by diverse routes. Mathematical explorations of non-Euclidian geometry have provided some of the concepts, and the empirical world of continuous calculation has prompted the current interest in the ways in which ‘number-work’ shapes contemporary life beyond any stable sense of metrics. My core interest here concerns the question of how material infrastructures of state participate in the enduring contradictions and controversies over how state-space is imagined and produced. However, the historical entanglements of modern states with calculative practice is self-evident when considering the development of infrastructural systems – whether we think of roads, railways and canals, or of information networks, transactional data or the multiple sensors built into the fabric of modern cities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276412448827">Sloterdijk (2009)</xref> has argued that the 20th century was marked by an increasing and recursive awareness of relativity and perspectival difference. Such awareness heralded an increased strategic attention to the productivity of such difference, which has been mobilized in forms of warfare, of trade, of political and economic life, relational modes of action, or ‘environmental thinking’ that have transformed the conditions of modern life in dramatic ways. The background material conditions of such transformations are also the subject of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412448827">Thrift’s (2004)</xref> analysis of how the world of continuous calculation might be producing new kinds of spatial awareness. Thrift’s analysis has suggestive implications for those interested in the spatial dynamics of infrastructural systems. The growth of calculation marks the emergence of the modern state, from early state interest in ‘synoptic facts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412448827">Thrift, 2004</xref>: 588), statistical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276412448827">Porter, 1995</xref>) and the topographical ‘gridding of time and space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412448827">Thrift, 2004</xref>: 589; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276412448827">Pickles, 2004</xref>). The contemporary state, while still utterly reliant on its calculative powers, is of course also thoroughly engaged in ‘environmental thinking’ in Sloterdijk’s terms. Quantitative methods are now routinely used to engage, rather than resolve, ambiguity and uncertainty. Thrift argues that this move, which we might describe as the emergence of a more pervasive topological orientation, involves the recognition of a more plastic sense of space and time, of relative space, of constant mobility and of perpetual change. Such recognition does not displace the centrality of calculative reason. On the contrary, Thrift argues that ‘relative space’ relies on ‘absolute space’ for its existence (2004: 597), and that ‘the fine grid of calculation’ has made the intrinsic multiplicity and differentiation of absolute space explicit (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448827">Brenner et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article I set out to fold these discussions of shifting spatial imaginaries into an analysis of how it is that state-space is apprehended in daily life in places where the tensions between absolute and relative space have become evident in the confrontations over resource extraction, and in the dramatic reconfiguration of value that global markets in minerals and hydro-carbons have brought to previously marginal rural areas. I am especially interested in the particular ways in which the contemporary commitment of the Peruvian state to neoliberal values has drawn attention to the ‘variable openness’ of state-space and in how it is that state-space is apprehended as both grounded and mobile, simultaneously continuous and discontinuous, specific and generic.</p>
<p>To approach these questions, I draw on current ethnographic work on state-space and road construction in Peru, and more particularly on the relationship between the notion of state-space as an abstract, future-oriented relational ordering and the road system as a network form that is designed to integrate state-space across different scales. I have found that a ‘topological’ approach to road systems offers some interesting possibilities over the idea of road systems as imposed grids which integrate state-space through the connective force of a network (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412448827">Knox et al., 2006</xref>). This latter more topographical understanding underpins the most common approach to road networks, which tend to be considered primarily in relation to a model of change as exception and as technologically driven.</p>
<p>‘Roads’ are not very promising topological objects, they do not conjure the image of plasticity and continual change that topological approaches are generally concerned with. And while those who attend to roads as sites of ethnographic enquiry certainly recognize their intrinsic multiplicity, they are not usually thought of in this way (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412448827">Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412448827">Dalakoglou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412448827">Harvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412448827">Kernaghan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448827">Klaeger, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448827">Moran, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412448827">Thévenot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412448827">Sinclair, 2003</xref>). Roads are practical spaces, background spaces indeed that we trust to hold their form and leave us to go about our business. Road systems are infrastructures that are explicitly constructed with a view to stabilization, to the fixing of unstable terrains, and to the demarcation of specific routes between points. They are built to connect places and, in large-scale public works of the kind I study in Peru, they are built to draw together otherwise disparate spaces and populations. In this sense they might be imagined as overcoming rather than manifesting difference. And yet such a description of what roads do relies on a very static notion of state-space, and a very singular and linear understanding of what and how a road network integrates. In what follows I present four ethnographic perspectives on roads as controversial and unsettling state-spaces. Taken together these perspectives challenge the self-evident plausibility of a topographic orientation to infrastructural systems and show how a topological approach might reconfigure how we imagine such infrastructures in relation to the exercise of state power.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412448827"><title>Longing for Connection – Roads as Social Generics</title>
<p>In 1999 President Fujimori of Peru had signed a new Forest Law as part of an ongoing strategy to promote bilateral agreements with Brazil, particularly with respect to the search for oil and the development of hydro power. Within this agreement there was a commitment to the improvement of the transport infrastructures, which included provision for the asphalting of a stretch of existing road which would extend the transcontinental network and ultimately offer Brazil a route to Peru’s Pacific ports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412448827">Harvey and Knox, 2008</xref>). But Fujimori never followed through on this commitment. His priorities were focused elsewhere as he struggled to alter the constitution to secure himself a third term of office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412448827">Crabtree, 2006</xref>). By 2000 he had fled the country and an emergency interim government was trying to stabilize a volatile situation of deep-seated corruption in a country only recently emerging from over a decade of war between the state and the Maoist guerrilla movement of the Shining Path. It was only after Fujimori had left the country that the people of Ocongate (a small town in the southern Peruvian Andes where I have been working on and off since 1983) found out about the legal provision for a road. The agreement was about to expire. A few key local actors began to petition the government and eventually on 11 September 2001 – when the eyes of the world were turned elsewhere – they managed to gather around 4000 protesters and occupy a bridge not far from the highland city of Cusco, effectively blocking one of the key arterial highways of southern Peru. Their demand was that the new government commit the funds and build the road. The protest was effective. The government agreed to extend the timeframe of the Forest Law and funds were committed to the building of the Inter-Oceanic highway.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to know how much effect their demonstration had on those empowered to fund such projects. But the demonstration left its mark on those who participated. When people told me about the occupation of the bridge the event was framed as a heroic claim on the state – they stressed their determination and their success in working to ensure that the new road would not bypass their town. They spoke of their passionate longing for this road as a way to improve their everyday lives. They talked about the dust that they were forced to swallow, and of the risk to their lives every time they travelled. Their accounts of the demonstration graphically described how they had chained themselves to the bridge, how they slept in the open air without food, how they mustered the support not only of the other communities along the route but also of the powerful miraculous Christ figure whose shrine is located in the sacred mountains that dominate the landscape in this region</p>
<p>The passionate desire for the road seemed to align local interest to a general enthusiasm for road construction – embraced not just by the governments of Brazil and Peru, but supported by multilateral lenders such as the World Bank. All these agencies, local and global, mobilize a thoroughly topographical justification for road building programmes, repeating the idea that political and economic stagnation stem from a missing relation, a gap, that is felt to impede progress. In this mode of reasoning, networked connectivity, economic progress and democratization are understood to be mutually constitutive. The formula has driven investment in Latin American road construction programmes since the 1920s, when roads emerged as the technology of choice for the consolidation of the modern state, whose resources and capacities for action were tightly tied to US ambitions to expand markets and export cultural and political orientations beyond its own sovereign territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412448827">Salvatore, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In Peru the road building programmes were played out as a technological confrontation with the natural world, a drama enhanced by established (topographical) imaginaries of a divisive and racialized national geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412448827">Orlove, 1993</xref>): a narrow coastal strip, divided from the resource-rich Amazon forest by the huge barrier of the Andean mountain range. The new roads were designed to cut through these barriers, meeting the interests of banks, governments and local people, all equally invested in the idea of connectivity as public good, a way to increase the circulation of raw materials, commodities, people and information for the benefit and progress of all.</p>
<p>In the first decade of the 21st century, the Inter-Oceanic highway was also justified in these terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412448827">Llosa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412448827">Paredes, 1992</xref>). However, road construction projects exceed single scales of integration, with political and moral consequences that are highly disruptive of the ambition to use such systems to create integrated and homogeneous social space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412448827">Thévenot, 2002</xref>). In Ocongate the ways in which a need for a new road surface was imagined had little to do with the macro-economic ambitions of Brazil, the development of the Amazon region or the integration of the Peruvian state. From the perspective of the campaigners their protest for the road was a bid to change their conditions and expectations of life, to reconfigure how they connect to others. Their protest was not radical. They were calling on the state, as righteous citizens, to remember their condition and to fulfil the constitutional obligation to ensure parity of inclusion through the provision of a stable and reliable ‘state-space’. Their pasts and their futures were at stake, and in this grabbed space of opportunity their demand was for an engineering solution: they wanted a fast, reliable, asphalt road which would address <italic>their specific condition</italic> of geographic isolation and marginality <italic>and</italic> make their space continuous with and equivalent to other spaces in the more developed regions of the country to meet an imagined generic standard. Ultimately, they were looking for transformations in their daily lives and were less invested in the logics that drove the move, at another scale, to develop market potential by ensuring networked connectivity. In fact they were somewhat sceptical about the integrative capacity of the road, schooled in the experience of differential inclusion. They knew that their town was not remote to those with expensive vehicles, they knew that the engineers could get back to the east coast of Brazil in less time than it took them to travel a few hundred kilometres down the road in old trucks and buses. Nevertheless, it was clearly politically expedient to play up the image of a homogeneous and bounded isolation to bring the much desired road their way – by packaging the problem in the right way, as an instance of topographical exclusion, they could get a solution to other problems that nobody else is interested in.</p>
<p>What I want to draw out from this account is the way in which the road operates as a social generic that overcomes the historical and geological specificity of place in two distinct ways. First, in relation to the ways in which roads appear as standard forms, as social generics of the one-size-fits-all variety. But they are also social generics of another kind, that rather than taking standard form are more virtual, under-specified, not-yet specific. They thus appear as both solution and open-ended possibility, a technical fix and an opening to the contingent effects of environmental thinking.</p>
<p>In accounts of networked connectivity it is common to find that the ways in which connectivity is achieved matters less than connectivity itself – in network thinking the relation itself is not what’s interesting. And since the relation is taken for granted, there is a tendency to think of networks via an inventory approach – the connection is either on or off – you are in the loop or out of it. We are familiar with this trope from Castells’ work on the network society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412448827">Castells, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412448827">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412448827">1998</xref>) and from the ways in which this framing has been rhetorically adopted by the World Bank and by governments and local councils across the world eager to enhance their own connective presence, or to get their citizens to join up to the market, to e-governance, to community building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412448827">Green et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the innovative connections that such networks have enabled (and to which I return shortly), the preoccupations that this emphasis on connectivity produces tend to play into the notion that the absence of a specific connection is somehow tantamount to an absence of relationality per se. This attitude was certainly characteristic of campaigners for the road in Peru, who were terrified of being left out of the loop. Tremendous effort was put into trying to find out exactly where the new road was going to go – with many people deeply concerned about the possibility of further marginalization should the road not run more or less past their front door!</p>
<p>By contrast to the standard one-size-fits-all and fixes-all generic produced in response to the perceived gaps in the network that have to be bridged to ensure appropriate participation – there is the other social generic which is not ‘empty’ but merely ‘under-specified’. This under-specified generic is similar to Marc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448827">Augé’s (1995)</xref> notion of the non-place. Augé’s non-places are spaces of transit in which no lasting social relations are established. Non-places are the spaces of super-modernity such as airports, motorways, hypermarkets, designed to maximize circulatory flows. And while some complain of the impersonality of such environments, Augé points out that it is their generic qualities that open up the promise of utopian futures, for, as non-places, they are also cast as spaces of potential, in which relations are not yet prescribed or symbolized – free zones for adventure and creativity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412448827"><title>Roads as Topological Spaces</title>
<p>One of the attractions for me of topological thinking comes from the way in which the topological figure can hold the under-specified generic and the specific together, as exemplified by Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412448827">Cache’s (1995)</xref> topological description of Lausanne. In his description of the emergence of this city Cache tracks the ways in which the urban space takes shape and transforms over time. He describes the multiple vectors, the intersecting architectural framings, and the mutating, relational, social spaces – the folding of material and symbolic space, of geology and history, of past and present. In this way he conveys how urban spaces have geological, social and temporal specificity in relation to the durational abstract potentiality of Lausanne’s topology.</p>
<p>I had been alerted to these kinds of relations from my work with civil engineers working on the roads of Peru. They taught me about the dynamic tension in their work between generics and specifics as they deployed various standard techniques of transformation in relation to specific material worlds. Engineers engage the dynamic properties of material spaces. On the one hand they seek to stabilize materials through the deployment of metrics – materials are gathered, tested, modelled, retested, their material properties all carefully measured defined. But this work of definition then becomes a future-oriented speculation – the capacities of materials are calculated with respect to less certain measures – starting with the available time and money for the realization of the project – but extending also to all the possible conditions which the asphalt surface might engage in the future. In this sense it is self-evident to an engineer that roads are provisional structures – they require constant attention and repair – their construction and maintenance is a balancing act and their resilience will depend on many things which are carefully taken into account when they are built – and others which are entirely unexpected and to which the road surface has to adapt. Engineers thus constantly work between the one-size-fits-all generic of the technical fix – deploying standard formulas, techniques and materials, and the specificity of the material and social conditions that constitute the grounds of possibility for their work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412448827">Harvey and Knox, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note here – following Cache – that the road has a virtual quality that exceeds any particular configuration. The specificity of a site will be integral to the infrastructure that emerges, but this actualization is a singular and provisional end-point, the outcome of an intervention that manages to fix things for the moment, by limiting or reducing the scope of other possible mutations. But if we follow a more topological approach and hold to the notion of road systems as open mutating structures – we are left with the question of how it is that these now apparently fluid spaces are so compelling as the means to integrate social entities such as states or regions. My argument thus far has suggested that while roads might connect things up, this connection does not necessarily involve any particular sense of integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412448827"><title>Confrontation and Territory Effect</title>
<p>In 2009 a group of indigenous people near the Amazonian town of Bagua blocked a road to draw attention to the fact that the state had failed to consult them about the sale of oil concessions granting (foreign) oil companies the right to explore on their territories. International laws, to which Peru is a signatory, require the state to ensure indigenous participation in the re-designation of their territories. At the same time the state is the legal proprietor of the subsoil and had enacted specific decrees in parliament to open up the subsoils to international capital. In 2009 the President was determined to further his politics of free-market liberalism and refused to negotiate with local people. The army fired on protesters from the air and protesters attacked police on the ground. There were deaths on both sides. As in the previous example, protesters had forced their presence on the state, making themselves visible by the blocking of a road. But this time the response was brutal. The road effectively corralled the protesters, making them visible to a vengeful state that refused to engage in the discussion of who has the right to make a living from this place and how. The President of Peru, Alan Garcia, argued that the nation could not be held back by the selfish acts of a minority. He declared the categorical identity of Peru as that of a mining nation, and articulated his responsibility to enable the nation to realize its potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448827">Drinot, 2011</xref>). The killings provoked an international outcry. Images of the desperately uneven confrontation circulated from cell phones to computers and all kinds of media outlets. Garcia’s attempts to impose a mining identity on the complex and variegated space that we call Peru was challenged and the integrity of the national space became less obvious, momentarily de-stabilized. It was not simply that the protesters had been discounted – treated as disruptive criminals, rather than as organized citizens. It was also that the Amazon forest was seen as a space that counted for many other people around the planet who were anxious both about the expansion of mining interests and the effect of extractive capital on a shared ecosystem.</p>
<p>It is clear from this example that connections are not that straightforward. Here there is already a road and it is causing problems. The connection has not simply failed to bridge the gap, if anything it has exacerbated it. And in the process it is clear that the gap is not constituted by a missing relation but by a tension in the network. The connection is threatening, drawing in unwelcome modes of integration. Not everything in the network is of a kind, flows are disrupted and the state moves in to clear the way. But it is not that clear any more who is inside and who is outside the network or rather which network. Interior and exterior perspectives fold into each other, intersecting and challenging any stabilization of value. As in the first example, the local confrontation plays out the complex dynamics which inflect Peru’s international relations, extending possibilities for both capital growth and for ecological futures, while at the same time insisting on sovereign rights to allow and/or to curtail such flows.</p>
<p>In short, taken together, these two ethnographic perspectives show that the confrontations taking place on these roads are not fights over pre-existing territories as configured in models of competing interests. They are more importantly confrontations over what these places might become, specific struggles in which the future is folded into the present, and where anticipated futures bring forward past experience in ways that conflate the specific and the generic. The collaborations and collusions entailed in these movements are important. There are no clear lines of differentiation. State actors, engineers and local people all know (through specific relational dynamics) that roads are not simply delivering state-space in the sense of a stable topographic network. For all the planning and the blueprints, road construction only partially delivers a transparent territory effect. In fact, the idea that roads are built to fill in the gaps between places can only figure as a plausible account after the event. Rather than plug gaps, or create gaps, what these infrastructures do is transform relational fields. Thus, if we approach roads topologically we begin to identify relational scenarios where the plugging of a gap does not bring closure but opens other relational possibilities.</p>

<p>My third ethnographic figure is drawn from the Huayllaga region of central Peru described by anthropologist Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412448827">Kernaghan (2009)</xref>. The road that Kerhnaghan describes was originally built as part of an ambitious infrastructural state initiative to connect the diverse regions of the Peruvian Amazon to coastal urban markets. During the 1980s the Huallaga region became an important stronghold of the Maoist guerrillas as a strategic space from which they could disrupt the flow of goods from the guerrilla-friendly illegibility of the Amazonian frontier. The road was the only way into this region and so the guerrillas systematically undid the road. Those who did travel the road were liable to be taken hostage and forced to help them dig it up, scar its surface, dismantle the many bridges. Their sabotage mounted an effective challenge to the power of the state to maintain its interconnected territory. They used the road to show that the state was a spent force, unable to act. Some years later, when the war had played itself out, the state demonstrated its recovery by repaving the road – a gap was plugged. But this act of repaving opened new possibilities. The wonderful flat surface of the new road proved ideal for drug traffickers to land their small planes. It allowed them to appear and disappear in the coca-producing regions using state-space in ways that evade state control. Again the state responded. The challenge was to think of a way to keep the road open while closing it to aircraft. The solution was to build short concrete walls at regular intervals along the straight stretches of road. Cars can zigzag round these walls (although not without considerable danger and subsequent loss of life) but the planes could not negotiate them. The drugs trade fell off – and the region reverted to one of abandonment and poverty, open to the possibilities of new politics of integration and still one of the most volatile regions in the country.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Huallaga region, marginality no longer appears as a function of a missing physical connection but invokes the contentious relational value of specific connections or the lack of them. As in Bagua, where the state’s intention to open a connection for capital was disrupted by the fact that the land was already occupied by citizens supported by international social movements from across the world, here too international vectors threaten the precarious self-image of the state as an identifiable and singular entity. The combined presence of transnational corporations and indigenous peoples unhinges the smooth relation between capital flow and public good. What is left now of the notion of an infrastructural system?</p>

<sec id="sec5-0263276412448827"><title>Blockage, Stagnation and Emergent Positioning</title>
<p>Road construction on the new Inter-Oceanic highway linking the highlands of Peru to the Brazilian border was well under way when the Ocongate protest happened. Indeed the progress was what brought the problem to light. After much debate it had been agreed that the new road would not cut through the centre of the small and densely populated Andean town. Instead it would run around the edge, opening up a new space between the houses and the river, ensuring that the town square remained intact. Some agreed that this was the only way. Others were disappointed. They knew that even this minor detour would effectively preclude the traffic from stopping. There was little advantage to them. Nothing would change. And this was the problem. The road was supposed to change things. In the campaign to bring the road to the town much had been made of the ways in which asphalt concrete would put a stop to the dust – the dust that they had to swallow when they travelled, the dust that swirled in clouds around moving vehicles and, in particular, the dust that the school children were forced to inhale in and around their playgrounds. The schools lie to one end of the town and became a focal point for local protest. The townspeople asked the construction company to asphalt an extra stretch of road – the stretch that ran past the school. This short stretch had come to index a future that teetered between progress and stagnation – it had always been assumed that the new road would come this way. The company refused. From their perspective, they had to work to a tight budget and a tight schedule. The works that they were contracted to deliver could not be diverted to deal with every local concern along the way. Ocongate was just one point along a 700 km stretch of a route where the affective force of deprivation and expectation would constantly generate demands. But their refusal made no sense to local people. The construction company was there. They had the materials and the machinery. The short stretch would hardly detain them and people knew that in other circumstances deals were struck, other modes of compensation or equivalence were conjured to allow the works to proceed. And so the director of the school organized the parents to march on the construction camp demanding that the engineer in charge of the works negotiate with them. There were hundreds of people and from inside the camp it felt as if they were under siege. Inside they were scared. Outside people were angry but they had no real sense of being on a demonstration – they wanted to talk. They were told that the engineer had gone to the city but that he was on his way back and would speak to them when he arrived. What actually arrived were bus loads of special forces, armed police who dispersed the crowd with tear gas and batons – pursuing the parents along the streets and into their homes. The protesters clung to their designation as parents in their accounts, to emphasize that they had protested, as before, as citizens, family members, women and children alongside the men. But this time their blockade was treated as an attack. The police force was brought in to protect the public works and the private company contracted to deliver them.</p>
<p>Fortunately nobody was killed. But the incident was hugely significant in the unfolding relationship between the company and local residents. From that point on the construction camps were patrolled by armed guards. The local police were formally subcontracted to protect the company. The lines of protection and of threat were articulated in ways that located public interest firmly on the side of the corporation. As in Bagua, the road that they had longed for and campaigned for so ardently had opened them to capital in ways that they had not anticipated. The new connectivity turned out to involve a militarization of their immediate environment, a closing off of rights to peaceful protest, and a closing off of expectations of protection from the local police. The road and its promise of productive connectivity had become a space that amplified social discontinuity. The anxieties about the future folded back into the present and provoked both the demonstration and the armed response.</p>
<p>In this folding the road also emerged as a site through which an implicit politics of scale became explicit. From the beginning the expectations for this road configured the space as a site of convergence, where the slippage between the ambition for intercontinental connectivity seamlessly morphed into the site of local development and improvement. But the ‘win-win’ formula collapsed as, in the process of construction, the company felt itself compelled to explicitly impose a scale at odds with that which would enable local people to feel that this project might, in the end, have something to do with them.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0263276412448827" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The article has explored the ways in which shifting perspectives from the roadways of Peru offer us a way of thinking about how infrastructural systems create and sustain dynamic political and moral spaces. The idea has been to look in detail at the specific relational discontinuities that roads (as state-spaces) actualize. I have argued that it is not sufficient to think about such discontinuities as simple gaps, or breaks in a network. Rather, I have argued that such discontinuities might more productively be approached as intervals, a space-time that marks difference rather than absence. In such spaces of difference and ambiguity movement becomes visible, and plasticity is made explicit.</p>
<p>My account also raises questions about how such awareness emerges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412448827">Thrift’s (2004)</xref> argument about the effects of continuous calculation on contemporary spatial awareness resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276412448827">Sloterdijk’s (2009)</xref> recent work on environmental thinking. Both authors are concerned to trace a material history of unfolding uncertainty, ambiguity and destabilization as internal to the development of modern technological rationalism. The perspectives presented here support these accounts, but they also question the conditions under which the productivity of difference becomes explicit. Notions of movement-space are themselves open and multiple, and have histories that are not confined to ‘encounters’ with continuous calculation. They might equally emerge through other modes of disruption and consequent controversy, and topological understandings of movement and of multiple perspectives are thus as relevant to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412448827">Cache’s (1995)</xref> history of Lausanne or my studies of the roads of Peru as they are to the effects of contemporary computing capacity.</p>
<p>The power of topological approaches in this respect lies in the attentive orientation toward the specific relations in play and to the specific transformations between generics, abstractions and particulars through which open-ended topological dynamics become, albeit momentarily, actualized as topographical arrangements or a territory effect in which difference loses its sense of dynamic potential. It is important to emphasize that the terms of this continual movement between the topological and the topographic holds no intrinsic value. States, protesters and people going about their everyday lives all engage with and reproduce notions of absolute and of relative space. My particular interest in state-space emerges from the ways in which this tension, or point of ambiguity around the folding of topographical and topological imaginaries, is mobilized in particular circumstances and with specific effects.</p>
<p>Infrastructural systems offer a way into these debates, as Star (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412448827">1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412448827">Lampland and Star, 2009</xref>) has long argued. Road systems are state infrastructures that simultaneously occupy specific and generic space, transcending local conditions, yet only ever engaged through local conditions; designed with an eye to the future but grown on established relational terrain and thereby carrying forward both the strengths and limitations of where they came from. In this respect we might think of the infrastructural qualities of roads as pertaining to how they make up and undo state-space through the ways in which they both posit and unsettle territories and populations, work across local, national and international spaces of law, history and aspiration, bringing past and future, interior and exterior together in ways that topological approaches help us to identify.</p>
