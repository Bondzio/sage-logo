<abstract>
<p>The Internet and Web 2.0 technologies [i.e., (micro-)blogs, wikis, social networking sites, Voicethreads, etc.] allows today’s students to access mathematics and other general education curricula like never before. Since they already have the expertise in using the Internet, digital technologies, and other media compared to previous generations, it is imperative that teachers and students access these technologies to increase students’ understanding of and connections with the general education mathematics content. This article will discuss: (1) the mathematics performance of secondary students with disabilities; (2) technologies available for use in secondary mathematics classrooms; and (3) Web 2.0 tools that secondary students with disabilities can access and use in their mathematics classrooms and/or at home.</p>

<p>The emphasis on inclusion of students with disabilities has brought about significant changes to how students with disabilities are able to access the general curriculum. Students with disabilities have historically been offered few instructional resources that provide such access and alignment with instruction offered in the inclusionary setting. However, with authorizations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451213480032">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451213480032">No Child Left Behind Act (2002)</xref>, providing access to the general education curriculum and improving achievement for students with disabilities have become primary goals. In spite of those efforts, students with disabilities continue to struggle with the general education curriculum.</p>
<p>For students with disabilities to meet high academic standards and fully demonstrate their conceptual and procedural knowledge and skills in the content areas, specifically mathematics, not only must their instruction incorporate supports and accommodations, but teachers and students must identify and use technology resources and tools that enable them to be successful in the general education classroom.</p>
<p>Educators should allow students to access and use the Web 2.0 technologies to increase their access to the general education curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451213480032">Dyment, O’Connell, &amp; Boyle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451213480032">Heafner &amp; Friedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451213480032">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM, 2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451213480032">Sheehan &amp; Nillas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451213480032">Souter, 2001</xref>). This article addresses the problems facing secondary students with learning disabilities in mathematics, offers Web 2.0 tools as one possible solution for increasing access to and learning of mathematics in the general education classroom, and finally suggests some Web 2.0 technologies that secondary students can access on their computer, iPad, iPhone, iPod, or any other Internet-capable device.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451213480032">
<title>Mathematics and Students With Disabilities</title>
<p>The math performance of secondary students in the United States raises much concern, and the achievement of secondary students with disabilities raises even more concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451213480032">Maccini, Gagnon, &amp; Hughes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451213480032">Maccini, Strickland, Gagnon, &amp; Malmgren, 2008</xref>). Students with math disabilities exhibit a wide range of math difficulty, including an inability to understand (a) the meaning of numbers and their quantities, (b) basic operations of addition and subtraction, and (c) complex problems such as multiplication, division, and more abstract problems. Their inability to understand math concepts prevents them from remembering and building on them to master more complex problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451213480032">Genden, 2010</xref>). These math difficulties can, and often do, prevent students with disabilities from participating fully in general education mathematics classrooms. And for those for whom traditional mathematics instruction is not working, other innovative methods (e.g., Web 2.0 tools) should be utilized.</p>
<sec id="section2-1053451213480032">
<title>Technology in the Secondary Mathematics Classroom</title>
<p>Technology integration is vital to the national and global success of today’s and future students. In a position statement in 2008, NCTM stated,<disp-quote>
<p>Technology is an essential tool for learning mathematics in the 21st century, and all schools must ensure that all their students have access to technology. Effective teachers maximize the potential of technology to develop students’ understanding, stimulate their interest, and increase their proficiency in mathematics. When technology is used strategically, it can provide access to mathematics for all students. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451213480032">NCTM, 1989</xref>) and the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451213480032">NCTM, 2000</xref>) identified technology as an essential tool for teaching and learning, and the NCTM recommends that technology be used wisely by well-informed teachers to support mathematical understanding.</p>
<p>These statements are not lost on researchers as they have long been interested in exploring the potential for digital technologies to transform mathematics teaching and learning. But despite all the enthusiasm regarding the potential benefits of technology in math classrooms, there is still some debate as to whether technology is effective. Regardless, there are a number of different technologies currently being used in mathematics classrooms with varying degrees of success. For example, calculators and other technological tools, such as computer algebra systems, interactive geometry software, applets, spreadsheets, and interactive presentation devices, are vital components of a high-quality mathematics education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451213480032">Goos &amp; Bennison, 2008</xref>). The programs and technology tools currently used in the classrooms by teachers are wonderful, but they just might not be enough to engage and motivate today’s mathematics generation.</p>
<p>Although technology in the mathematics classroom is not new, as calculators have been used for quite some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451213480032">Clements &amp; McMillen, 1996</xref>), newer technologies not only allow students to select the appropriate problem-solving strategy but also allow teachers to interact instructionally with students (e.g., interactive whiteboards) to create environments that encourage student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451213480032">Emron &amp; Dhindsa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451213480032">Kennewall, Tanner, Jones, &amp; Beauchamp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Today’s students may require more than the traditional forms of technology integration to understand mathematical concepts. Therefore, mathematics education must change to meet the needs of the students. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451213480032">Clements and McMillen (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451213480032">Johnston and Cooley (2001)</xref> noted, teaching should be integrated with technology and emerging models of learning to transform education. They suggested how this might look to teachers and students using different technologies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451213480032">Table 1</xref> provides examples of what merging technology with models of teaching and learning in mathematics could look like. For secondary students with disabilities, the integration of these Web 2.0 technologies could be the difference between success and failure in the general education classroom.</p>

<title>Web 2.0 Tools and Mathematics</title>
<p>Today’s “web natives” are adept at accessing any and everything on their handheld devices and computers—anytime and anywhere. For this reason, and with an increase in the development of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g., interactive, online software applications), students are now able to access online mathematics tools (e.g., using their iPhones, iPads, iPods) to further assist them in their attempts at accessing the general education mathematics curriculum. In addition, the students who resist traditional pencil and paper ways of doing math will be motivated to use these technologies as they are already good at it.</p>
<p>In 2001, Souter reported that the positive effects of mathematics and technology instruction (i.e., computer-mediated learning) were becoming more prevalent in today’s mathematics classrooms. She advocated replacing those traditional, boring worksheets with software that is one-on-one, is self-paced, and provides immediate feedback to remediate deficiencies and enhance student understanding.</p>
<p>With technology, mathematical concepts can be understood in several different ways—using pictures, representations that don’t require language, interactive math tools, graphs, colored squares, multimedia presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451213480032">Raines &amp; Clark, 2011</xref>), games, simulations, and number lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451213480032">Klopfer, Osterweil, Groff, &amp; Haas, 2009</xref>). Technology enables students to use a variety of media and formats to apply, evaluate, synthesize, and communicate information and ideas effectively to multiple audiences. Interactive math tools, digital photography, and spreadsheets should be used in the classroom because they are tools that provide concrete ways to explore abstract concepts, enhance success for visual learners, promote higher-order thinking skills, and deepen understanding.</p>
<p>Finally, the National Education Technology Standards of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451213480032">International Society for Technology in Education (2007)</xref> assert that using technology (a) motivates students to learn, (b) helps students complete tasks that might bore them if done with pencil and paper, (c) provides creative ways to solve problems, and (d) offers a risk-free learning environment for students to explore the world of mathematics. Technology encourages students to become active learners with a quest for knowledge and to assume responsibility for that learning.</p>
<p>Not all the research on technology use in the mathematics classroom is positive. Rarely is this true for any tool for teaching and learning, but what is agreed on is the potential for the use of technology to transform how teaching and learning are accomplished. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451213480032">Table 2</xref> for a list of some of the many Web 2.0 tools available to assist secondary students in increasing their math skills and their understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of the Internet and Web 2.0 tools has affected the educational process in the way teachers teach students and the way students access information for their classes. Because of this, it is so easy to get caught up in the hype of the “toys,” “tools,” latest and greatest websites, and/or the flash of something new. So that we don’t get caught up in the hype, it is important to make sure that students are making the connections to the curriculum standards through seamless integration of technology. It’s important that teachers, as well as students, identify the information resources and tools (e.g., Web 2.0 and traditional) that are most effective for them. This then places some of the responsibility on the students to access the tools when and where (school or home) needed to complete their mathematics homework and other tasks.</p>
<p>The Internet resources in this article are just suggestions and are in no way an exhaustive list. Technology is changing so quickly, and one site that is available one month may not be available the next. Therefore, it is critical that students and teachers find those sites that are consistently updated—as well as ones that provide enough curricular materials to fit their needs.</p>
<p>As well, it is the responsibility of the teachers and students to continually update their bookmarks with the tools that are appropriate for their specific needs. Finally, although the use of technology to support students’ mathematics and other content-area learning is encouraged, it should not make traditional instruction unessential. A balanced approach to traditional and technology instruction is probably the best approach.</p>
