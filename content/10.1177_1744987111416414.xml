<p>Recent years have seen increasing calls for the need for interprofessional learning (IPL), either due to conclusions that failures in care were caused by professionals having limited knowledge of each other’s roles, or limited willingness or confidence in working together. It has also at times been put forward as a more cost-effective way to teach ‘related’ professionals for example in health and social care. It appears at times there is an irrational belief in IPL as a panacea that will overcome many of the other problems that contributed to major failings in care, such as limited supervision, resources and lack of clear leadership that often contribute to poor care.</p>
<p>In many ways the emphasis on IPL is a development of the earlier emphasis on interprofessional team working, fuelled in part by a belief that if professionals were educated together then this would improve the quality of the service they provided. Indeed, the requirement for interprofessional education is a major requirement of the recently revised Nursing and Midwifery Council <italic>Standards for Pre-registration Nurse Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111416414">Nursing and Midwifery Council 2010</xref>). However, the evidence that interprofessional teamworking delivers more effective care is not robust and is in many ways more of a belief or ideological position than evidence based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111416414">Barr 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The authors of this article have usefully highlighted what they consider to be the limited ‘evidence’ of the effectiveness of IPL, and in doing so, they have created a useful point to pause and reflect on why there is such as emphasis on the need for interprofessional education. Two key challenges are highlighted by the authors, are how can it be demonstrated that IPL is a more effective means of education and what is the impact on care provided. These are important questions to ask, however, as with all research projects, the research design needs to be consistent with the aims of the project and focused on being able to establish the impact, either through measurement or other feedback.</p>
<p>Within this review there is a focus on quantitative measurement, and the conclusion is made that the impact of IPL is ‘essentially unproven’. This review is clear that on the basis of the studies reviewed the impact of IPL is not proven, however, neither is it unproven and as the authors acknowledge the Cochrane position that ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’. This article clearly highlights the need to further develop research that is more robust and provides clearer information at the post-registration level on the impact of IPL.</p>
<p>I support the need for this area of research to be developed and find it insightful that the authors note the potential limitations of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in this area. Educators involved in the delivery of IPL and people who pay for this should ask what the benefits are for the students, educators and people who use or receive health and social care services. However, the information sought should not be limited to that which can be measured quantitatively and focused on cause and effect. Through adopting a wider range of research approaches the range of benefits can be explored and when more fully understood then measured more effectively.</p>
<p>At this point it is possible that the delivery of IPL does not have a direct impact on the care provided, but that is not to say it is not a worthwhile development in health and social care education if it has an indirect impact, improves the knowledge and skills of professionals and prepares the ground for further developments. Research into IPL needs to be more clearly focused on the aims of IPL and seek to determine whether these aims are met and how education can be improved. The starting point for this should be a clear statement of the aims of IPL, as this would provide a useful starting point to bring about some consistency in this area of research.</p>
<p>The authors make an observation that the studies reviewed have been undertaken by the people delivering IPL and highlight the need for steps to be taken to ensure robust studies are undertaken and the risk of bias is managed effectively. This point is clearly stated and managing the risk of bias is important in all studies, however this does not mean people delivering education should not evaluate it. To follow this approach to its conclusion would support the position that no one who delivers an intervention should evaluate it. I find that position impossible to support for three main reasons; first, it implicitly challenges the integrity of all researchers; second, people who deliver innovative interventions are often the people with detailed understanding of the topic and well placed to evaluate it (providing they do so robustly); and, third, to impose such a restriction that one cannot evaluate their own work, I believe would result in an unnecessary reduction in the amount of research completed. The point about the need for robust research is important, for all research, but caution is needed in assuming that just because someone was not involved in a project they are necessarily more independent and without bias, this may or may not be the situation. All researchers need to mindful of the potential biases and manage this risk transparently.</p>
