<p>The political debate surrounding teacher quality and the effectiveness of teacher education programs has reached new heights over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith &amp; Fries, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904812472725">Weiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904812472725">Wiseman, 2012</xref>). The current debate, however, is not a new one. Rather, it is an extension of an ongoing national policy debate about teacher education policy that has existed since the 1960s when the federal government began to closely examine whether federal funds for public endeavors were producing desired outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0895904812472725">Rossi, Lipsey, &amp; Freeman, 2004</xref>) and scholars began to study whether teachers impact student learning, and if so, how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812472725">Arnold, Denemark, Nelli, Robinson, &amp; Sagan, 1977</xref>), with answers to these questions varying (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904812472725">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904812472725">Jencks, Smith, Acland, &amp; Bane, 1972</xref>). Since that time, the empirical literature has grown exponentially, with it by and large converging on the conclusion that teachers do matter. However, conflict remains around how teachers matter and what type of preparation for teachers is likely to contribute to their effectiveness. For example, although some research has shown that on average, preparedness, effectiveness, and retention are higher for new teachers who have completed preservice programs than for new teachers who received less preparation prior to entering the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904812472725">Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904812472725">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904812472725">Clotfelter, Ladd, &amp; Vigdor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, Holtzman, Gatlin, &amp; Helig, 2005</xref>), other studies have concluded that preservice teacher education programs matter little, if any, to how effective a teacher is in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904812472725">Ballou &amp; Podgursky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904812472725">Kane, Rockoff, &amp; Staiger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0895904812472725">Walsh, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>With significant advances in understanding the importance of teacher quality, there have been several policy initiatives, such as the Carnegie Task Force on Teaching as a Profession and the founding of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards that have attended to the inputs and processes of teacher education (e.g., recruitment, selection, retention; the content, experiences, and requirements of preservice preparation programs; accreditation and certification; mentoring new teachers; and continuing professional development). There has also been a focus on student outcomes, specifically, student achievement as a primary indicator of teacher effectiveness. However, over the past decade the focus on outcomes has intensified, as evident by calls for and, in some instances, the systems where teachers are evaluated on the basis of student outcomes.</p>
<p>This focus on holding teachers accountable for outcomes, accompanied by the plethora of research on teacher education and modern advances in technology facilitating the ability to gather, store, analyze, and link student data across P-20 educational settings and beyond, has brought about increased interest in assessing the effectiveness of teacher education programs based on outcomes as well. Approaches to outcomes-based accountability for teacher preparation programs have fallen into one of four main categories: (a) evaluation based on the achievement scores of students taught by program graduates, (b) evaluation based on teacher candidates’ demonstration of research-supported teaching behaviors, (c) evaluation of teacher candidates during their preparation period based on how students perform in response to their teaching, and (d) evaluation based on how students perform in response to programs graduates’ teaching during graduates’ early years of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith &amp; Powers, 2010</xref>). Different forms of accountability models for teacher preparation programs now exist in several states, including Texas, Florida, and Ohio. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond (2010)</xref> remarked of this heightened attention to teacher preparation:
<disp-quote>
<p>For teacher education, this is perhaps the best of times and the worst of times. It may be the best of times because so much hard work has been done by many teacher educators over the past two decades to develop more successful program models and because we have just elected a president of the United States who has a strong commitment to the improvement of teaching. It may equally be the worst of times because there are so many forces in the environment that conspire to undermine these efforts. (p. 35)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some argue that forces that Darling-Hammond references are motivated by politics rather than authentic concern for improving teacher effectiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith and Fries (2001)</xref>, for example, have characterized the current national debate as being embedded within two overlapping, simultaneously competing, and even at times contradictory larger national agendas: “The agenda to professionalize teaching and teacher education, which is linked to the K-12 standards movement” . . . [and] “the movement to deregulate teacher preparation, which aims to dismantle teacher education institutions and break up the monopoly of the profession” (p. 3). This professionalism–deregulation debate, or P-D debate as termed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904812472725">Fenstermacher (2002)</xref>, has been carried out through scholarly writing and research, the media, local boards of education, state legislatures, Congress, and the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this keen focus on the effectiveness of teacher education was forecasted decades earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812472725">Arnold et al. (1977)</xref>, who remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>Public demands for accountability, combined with the awakened interests of teachers and the press upon school systems and colleges for better utilization of resources, will continue and expand the already significant development of personnel development centers or other collaborative mechanisms for improving the education of teachers. (p. 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This study examines the extent to which the factors that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith and Fries (2001)</xref> highlighted a decade ago and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812472725">Arnold et al. (1977)</xref> pointed out more 35 years ago are transpiring in our contemporary. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904812472725">Kingdon’s (1984)</xref> multiple-streams model, this study examines the political dimension of teacher education accountability policy, with specific attention to the policy formation of teacher education accountability initiatives formulated in the past few years. This study is important because “if we do not fully consider the political dimension, the ways we think about teacher education will be partial and distorted, and our efforts to intervene in the policy and practice of teacher education will be less effective and salutary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904812472725">Ginsberg &amp; Lindsay, 1995</xref>, p. 4). To situate our analysis, the next section of the article provides an overview of federal involvement with teacher education and describes the theoretical framework guiding our analysis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0895904812472725">
<title>Federal Government Involvement With Teacher Education and Teacher Quality</title>
<p>The federal government’s interest in teacher education and teacher quality began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but this early involvement was largely limited to financial support for teacher professional development in targeted areas and in response to identified areas of national importance and perceived national crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904812472725">Cohen-Vogel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>). As illustrated by federal attention to teacher quality and training after the launch of Sputnik, during the cold war, and following the release of the Reagan administration’s <italic>A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform</italic>, teacher education and teacher quality began to make routine appearances on the federal policy agenda beginning in the latter half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904812472725">Cohen-Vogel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>). The circulation of education reform documents during the 1980s, like <italic>A Nation at Risk</italic>, set the stage for reform conversations and federal policy response to come in the following decades. During those years, education leaders, including leaders of national associations of colleges of teacher education, began to endorse the adoption of a systemic education reform agenda and national standards, and as pressure increased for students to be held accountable to world-class, uniform, national standards, so did the pressure increase for holding teachers and teacher education programs accountable for student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0895904812472725">Weiner, 2000</xref>). That type of pressure in part led to the eventual reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) with significantly strengthened accountability provisions for teacher education programs.</p>
<p>National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future (NCTAF) 1996 report made bold recommendations for increased scrutiny of teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0895904812472725">National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, 1996</xref>). The report proposed that by 2006 every student would be provided with “what should be his or her educational birthright: access to competent, caring, qualified teaching in schools organized for success” (p. 10). As evidenced by their subsequent policy response in the reauthorization of the HEA in 1998, federal policy makers gleaned five key messages from that report:</p>
<list id="list1-0895904812472725" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) more people must be recruited into teaching,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(b) teachers are not well prepared in the subjects they are expected to teach,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(c) teacher education is disconnected from the needs of K-12 schools and from collegiate arts and sciences units,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(d) the regulation of teacher preparation and licensure works against teacher quality, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(e) presidents of institutions of higher education with teacher education programs pay little attention to these units. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>, p. 30)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Ideas about the revision of the teacher education provision of HEA to address issues raised in the NCTAF report emerged not only from Congress but also from education organizations and the U.S. Department of Education. Although the details of proposals for improving teacher education varied considerably, there was an apparent agreement on two points: (a) the recruitment of teachers should be addressed, and (b) support for colleges of teacher education should be linked to their partnership with K-12 schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>). The teacher education provisions of the HEA that resulted proved to be quite controversial, with Congress showing a willingness to “intervene in the affairs of institutions of higher education as never before” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904812472725">Cohen-Vogel, 2005</xref>, p. 31) to improve teacher quality.</p>
<p>A new Title II of the HEA to address teacher education was divided into a section for categorical programs for partnerships and states, and a section for mandatory accountability requirements for states and institutions of higher education. The whole of Title II accomplished three general aims; it (a) authorized programs to recruit persons into the teaching profession, (b) supported partnership arrangements between higher education institutions and K-12 schools for teacher preparation, and (c) gathered data on the teacher education system as a way of holding the system accountable for the quality of teachers entering the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, Title II required states and colleges of teacher education receiving federal funds either directly or indirectly through HEA to provide the U.S. Department of Education with data on teacher preparation standards and licensure procedures. Through whatever state agency tasked with teacher licensure and/or teacher education program approval, states were required to send
<disp-quote>
<p>(a) the information they receive from institutions of higher education; (b) a description of licensure requirements and the extent to which K-12 standards and teacher licensure requirements are aligned; (c) the percentage of teaching candidates who passed each required teaching license examination; (d) the pass rate scores on these exams disaggregated by education school, college, or program; (e) the number of licensure waivers granted each year, disaggregated by low- and high-poverty schools; (f) a description of alternate routes to teaching and the percentage of teachers licensed through such routes; (g) the criteria used by the state to evaluate or approve education schools, colleges, or programs; and (h) the name of any institution denied state program approval. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904812472725">Earley, 2000</xref>, p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An emphasis on improving the quality of teachers continued into the George W. Bush administration but with a decreased emphasis on pedagogical training for teachers. Bush administration Secretary of Education Rod Paige called for the redefinition of teacher preparation and credentialing to place greater emphasis on subject matter knowledge and less emphasis on education coursework, making student teaching and attendance at schools of education optional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904812472725">Kaplan &amp; Owings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904812472725">Paige, 2002</xref>). Paige’s views are evident in the <italic>highly qualified</italic> provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). In fact, NCLB’s primary mechanism for improving teacher quality was an insistence that teachers demonstrate mastery of the subject matter they teach.</p>
<p>It is within this complex political milieu with increasing involvement of the federal government in teacher education that this study aims to describe how teacher education accountability continues to occupy space on the federal agenda. The next sections describe the theoretical framework we draw upon to guide our analysis and explain the methods we used to gather and analyze data.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework: Kingdon’s Multiple-Streams Framework</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904812472725">Ginsburg and Lindsay (1995)</xref> have pointed out, there is a political dimension to teacher education policy formation. “Policy formation in teacher education is political both in the sense of individuals and groups exercising power, but also in the sense of material and symbolic resources being distributed (to individuals, groups, communities, nations, etc.)” (p. 6). This political dimension is particularly evident when considering how the answers to a series of questions influence the distribution of both power and material resources:</p>
<list id="list2-0895904812472725" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Where should (pre-service and in-service) teacher education programs be located, in terms of institutions and communities?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From what sources and at what amount should teacher preparation programs be funded?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who should be enrolled in teacher education and for how long?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what knowledge and perspectives should students in teacher education programs be or not be exposed?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who should determine the curricular content and the evaluation procedures employed in the programs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who should be employed as instructors in teacher preparation programs and how should they be prepared, selected, and supervised?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who should administer and evaluate teacher preparation programs? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904812472725">Ginsburg &amp; Lindsay, 1995</xref>, p. 6)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This study pays particular attention to the final question that attends to the evaluation of teacher education programs.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of policy development, policy processes must be examined through the lenses of theoretical frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904812472725">McDonnell &amp; Elmore, 1987</xref>) that allow researchers to describe, understand, and evaluate governments, policies, processes, systems, and behaviors. For this study, we rely on a framework that is widely used to describe policy formation—agenda setting and alternative specification—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904812472725">Kingdon’s (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">1995</xref>) multiple-streams framework. An extension of the garbage-can model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904812472725">Cohen, March, &amp; Olsen,1972</xref>), Kingdon’s framework conceives of the policy formation process as composed of three streams—problem, policy, and politics—that largely develop and operate independently. However, when a compelling problem emerges or when certain changes in the political stream occur—a policy window briefly opens and policy entrepreneurs couple their solutions to problems or take advantage of the political climate and bring about the convergence of the three streams, and an issue rises to the top of the governmental agenda.</p>
<p>Because educational policy scholars have used MSM to describe decentralization of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904812472725">McLendon, 2003</xref>), social promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904812472725">Brown, 2007</xref>), diversity in Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0895904812472725">Stout &amp; Stevens, 2000</xref>), reading policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0895904812472725">Young, Shepley, &amp; Song, 2010</xref>), and governance structure in Chicago Public Schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904812472725">Lieberman, 2002</xref>), applying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon’s (1995)</xref> framework to study teacher educational policy will allow us to not only understand the processes, systems, and behaviors involved in the development of teacher education accountability policy but also systematically discern which aspects of teacher education accountability policy formation are similar or different to other policy processes within the education domain.</p>
<sec id="section3-0895904812472725">
<title>The Problem Stream</title>
<p>The problem stream is the process in which societal conditions become recognized as problems by policy makers through three mechanisms: indicators, focusing events, and feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon, 1995</xref>). Indicators assess the magnitude of the condition. When conditions are severe or circumstances have changed significantly, the public and policy makers see the condition as a problem. Crises or disasters, popularization of powerful symbols, or personal experiences of policy makers are seen as focusing events that capture the attention of the public and policy makers. The feedback that officials receive from constituents or program evaluators about the performance of a program, notably a failure to meet goals or the presence of unanticipated consequences, can also change policy makers’ perceptions of a societal condition, leading them to conclude that something should be done to change the condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0895904812472725">
<title>The Political Stream</title>
<p>Three mechanisms within the political stream—swings of national mood, organized political forces, and events within government itself—can contribute to an issue becoming prominent on the governmental agenda. Policy makers’ sensitivity to changes in the national mood—political climate or the presence of a broad social movement—can lead to the promotion or demotion of an issue’s prominence on the policy agenda. Also, policy makers’ perceptions of the level of support or opposition of organized political forces (i.e., parties, legislative politics, and pressure groups) can influence the prominence of an issue on the agenda. The last mechanism within the political stream, events within the government, involves the turnover of key personnel or shifts in the jurisdictional boundaries of government officials that lead to the eminence of an issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0895904812472725">
<title>The Policy Stream</title>
<p>At the heart of the policy stream is a set of solutions—policy alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon, 1995</xref>). Many solutions are floating around a “policy primeval soup,” where “they bump into one another, they combine with one another; some survive, some die out, and some survive quite different from their origins” (p. 131). The solutions that do make their way out of the policy community and surface on the policy agenda do not do so in a manner that reflects rational decision-making processes based solely on the content of the ideas. Policy entrepreneurs who advocate for particular initiatives “soften up” the policy community to improve the receptiveness of their ideas. Specific characteristics of an alternative—technical feasibility, value acceptability, and absence of anticipated future constraints (i.e., budget constraint and public acquiescence)—also enhance its likelihood of floating to the top of the soup. After ideas survive these criteria, they make it onto a short list of ideas. Eventually, consensus spreads through a policy community, and an agreement on solutions or proposals is reached.</p>

<sec id="section6-0895904812472725" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We examined public documents related to teacher education initiatives, such as legislation, newspapers, press releases, and journal articles, to answer our research question: How has teacher education accountability come to be so prominently featured on the governmental decision agenda in recent years? To complement the data from these sources, we used this archival data to identify government policy actors, interest groups, and scholars who were closely associated with the issue to serve as informants to supplement our initial findings. After policy actors were identified, we sent them emails requesting their participation in an interview. The email explained the purpose of the research, specified the interview questions, and included an informed consent statement ensuring confidentiality (<italic>n</italic> = 6; response rate = 40%, 6 out of 15). A standard open-ended, structured interview schedule, loosely adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon (1995</xref>, p. 235), served as the primary data collection instrument.</p>
<p>We reviewed the archival documents and the six interview narratives or field notes from the interviews with the informants to discover themes related to the research questions. We used both inductive and deductive coding to analyze the data.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The findings indicate that there is no one specific event or person solely associated with the prominence of teacher education accountability policy on the federal governmental decision agenda. There are many forces at play, but by and large it is multiple, complementary energies that have created what some respondents termed “the perfect storm” and what Kingdon considers a coupling of the streams or a policy window. Organized according to Kingdon’s framework, we discuss the various elements that contribute to the prominence of teacher education accountability on the government decision agenda. Paraphrases and quotes of both archival data (e.g., legislation and journal articles) and informants’ remarks are included in our narrative to provide a rich, textured description of the policy milieu that has buoyed teacher education accountability policy to the forefront of the federal education policy agenda.</p>

<title>Problem Stream</title>
<p>Within the problem stream, indicators, feedback, and focusing events played a role in driving teacher education accountability to the forefront of governmental decision agenda. Generally, there was consensus that low student achievement (the primary indicator),especially for disadvantaged students and students of color, is a concern for the nation. There was also significant agreement that improving teacher quality is vital to increasing student achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904812472725">Ballou, Sanders, &amp; Wright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904812472725">Hanushek, Kain, &amp; Rivkin, 1998</xref>). However, there was some disagreement about what policies and practices support teacher effectiveness. Divergent views about what pre- and in-service endeavors contribute to teacher quality have led to critique of traditional, higher education–based teacher preparation programs, and both proponents and opponents of traditional preparation programs (TPP) declare that empirical research (the secondary indicator) supports their conclusions. Supporters of TPP programs believe that teacher preparation is related to teacher practices, teacher effectiveness, and teacher retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904812472725">Clotfelter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904812472725">Kaplan &amp; Owings, 2003</xref>), and reforming these programs—through increased regulation and modifications to curriculum requirements, such as changes in subject matter requirements, clinical experiences, and exposure to strategies working with diverse learners—will improve teacher effectiveness. Advocates of higher education–based programs also contend that there is wide variation in the quality of teacher preparation programs, and legitimate critique of a subset of programs that are in fact ineffectual has been unjustly applied to all programs. This feedback about ineffectual programs, which some consider to be as one informant stated, “hyperbole,” coupled with a lack of faith in teacher accreditation agencies, has added to the focus on teacher education accountability. Also fueling the fire were critics of TPP research-based claims (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904812472725">Aaronson, Barrow, &amp; Sander, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904812472725">Chicago Public Schools, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904812472725">Duckworth, Quinn, &amp; Seligman, 2009</xref>) that TPP programs have minimal to no influence on teacher effectiveness. Many critics of TPP also reason that the current degree of regulation and calls for increasing regulation (an approach advocated by many supporters) are unnecessary and even counterproductive because they may shrink the applicant pool and further diminish average teacher quality in high-need school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0895904812472725">Podgursky, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0895904812472725">2005b</xref>).</p>

<p>Indicators and feedback alone were not adequate to bring teacher education policy to the forefront of the policy agenda. Two federal policies function as focusing events that propelled interest in teacher education accountability. NCLB required that all teachers be <italic>highly qualified</italic> to teach in their respective areas. To be considered highly qualified, teachers were required to have a bachelor’s degree, hold the appropriate state-level certification or license, and demonstrate competence in the subject matter that he or she teaches. However, by leaving <italic>highly qualified</italic> somewhat loosely defined at the federal level, depending on states’ standards for certification and states’ adoption of procedures for teachers demonstrating subject matter competence, the term came to mean relatively little across states. States’ lack of capacity to truly monitor and enforce the requirement resulted in noble policy intentions producing little change in the quality of the nation’s teachers. Quite simply, implementation did not correspond with intention. Nevertheless, the highly qualified teacher requirement illuminated teacher education curriculum, state policies for licensing teachers, and teacher education accreditation, underscoring a need for heightened accountability.</p>
<p>Race to the Top (RttT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0895904812472725">Shear &amp; Anderson, 2009</xref>) had a different and arguably more significant impact on the national debate over teacher education and accountability. Through RttT, the U.S. Department of Education used financial incentives to entice states to reform their teacher tenure and evaluation policies and systems, and as a result, many states have done so. RttT required districts in any state receiving RttT funding to publish teacher and principal evaluation information online. Furthermore, eligibility to even apply for RttT funding required that states not have any law prohibiting student achievement data from being used as part of teacher evaluation. That requirement alone resulted in 6 states removing such statutory prohibitions and prompted 11 states to pass legislation requiring that student achievement data be used as a part of teacher evaluation or tenure decisions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904812472725">McGuinn, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904812472725">2012</xref>). RttT not only provided momentum for teacher accountability based on student performance, but it also amplified attention to teacher education accountability and fostered the development of statewide data systems that could be used to assess teacher effectiveness of program graduates.</p>
<p>Overall, NCLB put into motion the emphasis on teacher quality and accountability. However, its approach (highly qualified teachers) was primarily on inputs. RttT, which could have only occurred in a post-NCLB era, compounded the attention on teacher quality and accountability by stressing outcomes. An emphasis on both inputs and outcomes undoubtedly led to heightened attention to teacher preparation program accountability.</p>

<title>Teacher education accountability policy solutions</title>
<p>Some teacher education programs have responded to criticism, state reform mandates, and the push for program improvement by groups like American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) by significantly overhauling their programs, and there is research to suggest that such reformed programs have resulted in higher-quality new teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>). A few of the more recent program reforms have included (a) redesigning programs around standards; (b) increasing and strengthening clinical practice; (c) placing increased emphasis on developing subject matter content knowledge; (d) strengthening coursework around student learning and development theory, assessment, subject matter pedagogy, and teaching English language learners and students with special needs; and (e) connecting coursework directly to practice in more extensive practicum settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond et al., 2005</xref>). However, these efforts have not halted concerns about the quality of teacher education programs and their graduates. Indeed, several other alternatives have floated to the top of the primeval soup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon, 1995</xref>), and current circumstances suggest that several of the solutions will be put in place, indicating that there will be multiple mechanisms of accountability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0895904812472725">
<title>National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) and U.S. News and World Report.</title>
<p>The NCTQ announced in 2011 that it would conduct a comprehensive review of teacher preparation programs across the nation. The goal of the evaluation and the public report is twofold: (a) to identify programs that are doing a good job of preparing teachers, highlight them, and holding them up as models for other programs to emulate, and (b) to identify programs in serious need of improvement. NCTQ contended that publishing the findings and rankings in U.S. News and World Report ensures that preparation programs will take note and that the results will influence the teacher preparation and teacher markets, with school districts looking to hire teachers from more highly rated institutions and students choosing to enroll in higher-ranked preparation programs.</p>
<p>Alarmed by what they deemed to be a methodology unsubstantiated by research, many colleges of education were apprehensive about the evaluation. AACTE, for example, claimed that the NCTQ’s evaluation “utilized methodologies that do not meet the standard of basic scientific research”. . . including “assess[ing] course syllabi and handbooks against ‘standards’—that are neither research based nor representative of any established consensus—as a means of evaluating teacher preparation programs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904812472725">AACTE, 2012</xref>). Though many colleges initially refused to offer documents for the NCTQ review, NCTQ moved ahead with its review and issued public records requests to obtain documents from public institutions that refused to voluntarily participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0895904812472725">Sawchuck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904812472725">Wiseman, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0895904812472725">
<title>Value-added assessment</title>
<p>The NCTQ evaluation is not the only teacher education accountability initiative to contribute to the heated debate in the teacher education community. There are volumes of reports and articles highlighting the benefits and limitations of value-added modeling (VAM) to assess teachers and more recently to teacher education programs (see for example, <italic>Journal of Teacher Education</italic> Special Issue November/December 2012). Teacher education programs point out that linking teacher preparation to student outcomes is a complex task because (a) a plethora of student and school variables that contribute to student achievement may not be adequately included in VAM, (b) state-administered tests may not be appropriate measures for measuring the contribution of teachers and teacher education programs, and (c) teacher preparation is a multifaceted enterprise (e.g., recruitment, subject matter knowledge, pedagogy, and clinical experiences) and understanding the influence of any of these activities in isolation or in aggregate on study achievement is difficult to study. Despite the concerns of teacher preparation programs, a few states have initiated efforts to use VAM to assess teacher preparation programs. Using a longitudinal database that linked teacher programs and their graduates’ students’ standardized test scores, Louisiana was the first state to implement a comprehensive system for evaluating teacher preparation programs. Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina are sharing teacher performance data with their respective teacher preparation programs and Tennessee published the VAM data for the teacher education programs (Data Quality Campaign, 2011). In collaboration with the Network for Excellence in Teaching, teacher preparation programs in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota are using educational achievement data to improve their programs. It is likely that increasingly more states, with considerable encouragement from the federal government (e.g., RttT), will develop data systems linking student achievement and growth data to teachers and to teacher preparation programs. One informant explained the drift toward VAM for teacher education preparation in this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is the data we have always wanted because it is outcome data; it is about effectiveness, student learning. So the country is building this capacity. States haven’t fully yet used that capacity for accountability, but in the case of Louisiana, they are moving that way definitely. And the federal government is also asking states to provide that information so that they can make choices about where federal resources go for teacher preparation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Concerns about linking sanctions with VAM results were pervasive. Groups representing schools of education at predominantly minority-serving institutions, for instance, believe that using VAM for program accountability would likely negatively affect their programs, prevent their students from receiving financial aid through the TEACH grant program, and ultimately lead to a less diverse teaching force. Nevertheless, the teacher education policy community understands that the momentum behind VAM cannot be halted, and as such has shifted from attempting to impede VAM by highlighting its limitations to encouraging its use as one of multiple measures of the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs. As one policy insider shared with us,
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think value-added data will be the sole method used; I think there will be other metrics as well: retention, principal and district satisfaction, licensure pass rates. . . . There is going to be a definite limit on how much information we will be able to gather about teacher preparation programs using value-added methods. It is still going to require that states actually observe in some fashion what is happening in teacher preparation programs and make decisions about accountability.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another informant suggested that VAM should be part of a balanced approach that considers inputs, processes, and outcomes. Even the Obama Administration’s Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has consistently articulated the goal of having teacher preparation programs “held to a clear standard of quality that includes but is not limited to their record of preparing and placing teachers who deliver results for P-12 students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0895904812472725">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>, p. 2). The Obama administration’s efforts to support VAM for teacher education programs has received support by some individuals and groups, including Chiefs of Change, Teach for America (TFA), NCTQ, and Dean Deborah Lowenberg Ball (School of Education, University of Michigan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904812472725">Ball, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0895904812472725">
<title>Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP)</title>
<p>The unification of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) into the new Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) has the potential of greatly influencing teacher education policy in the coming years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0895904812472725">Wiseman, 2012</xref>). The merger grew out of a desire for a single accreditor of educator preparation programs that could speak to the quality of programs across the nation. CAEP will emphasize many of the teacher preparation program design principles that NCATE has championed for the past several years, and most notably, expanding the clinical foundation of the nation’s teacher education programs. A CAEP Commission on Standards and Performance Reporting has been charged with the responsibilities of developing standards and accompanying evidence for teacher preparation programs and developing recommendations for greater public accountability for programs. On the whole, CAEP’s efforts focus on “self-policing” in an effort to compel programs to better prepare teachers (Levine, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904812472725">Basu, 2012</xref>)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0895904812472725">
<title>edTPA</title>
<p>The edTPA, formerly known as the Teacher Performance Assessment, is an assessment tool for teacher candidates developed from a partnership between the Stanford Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity (SCALE) and AACTE. Developers allege that the new assessment will provide teacher preparation programs with a multiple-measure assessment aligned to the Common Core Standards and InTASC Standards, to help assess teacher candidates’ mastery of essential instructional capacities. The assessment is subject area specific and is intended to be used for teacher incensing and to support accreditation efforts. SCALE has partnered with Pearson to provide the assessment to preparation programs.</p>
<p>The edTPA has the endorsement of AACTE and the Teacher Performance Assessment Consortium (TPAC), which is comprised of 24 states, the District of Columbia, and approximately 160 teacher preparation programs. However, the validity and utility of the edTPA are being questioned by some in the policy community, and as one informant explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>We have not seen any correlation between performance on the edTPA and student achievement. You want to have teachers who perform well on the Ed-TPA, they are also teachers who you could show later down the road have by and large greater gains for students. . . . We haven’t seen exactly how various states are going to set cut scores for this assessment. . . . Like any other kind of assessment, it ultimately depends on what is defined as passing. Just like any other licensure test, those are decisions left to states, but there is certainly the question of what do various cut scores mean in terms of relationship to student achievement? . . . If on a four-point scale you need a 1 on the edTPA, and 99% of teachers who go through teacher preparation in a state get a 1, then you say why are we imposing this assessment if we are going to set it at such a point that everyone passes anyway?</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section15-0895904812472725">
<title>Alternative pathways</title>
<p>Proponents of alternative routes to teaching argue that these programs benefit teacher quality and student learning by deregulating teacher education; allowing the free market to attract, train, and place teachers; and expanding cultural, racial, and professional diversity of the American teaching force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904812472725">Lahann &amp; Reagan, 2011</xref>). The quality of such alternative programs has been loudly criticized by advocates of traditional teacher preparation programs, but research indicates that the quality of both alternative pathways and TPPs and the quality and/or effectiveness of the teachers these programs produce vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904812472725">Huang, Yi, &amp; Haycock, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904812472725">Kaplan &amp; Owings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0895904812472725">Zeichner &amp; Conklin, 2005</xref>). And it appears that the variation in the quality of teachers produced by traditional university-based programs, at least in part, has been responsible for the growth of alternative teaching pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0895904812472725">Sykes, Bird, &amp; Kennedy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A few notable national alternative pathways to teaching include Transition to Teaching, Troops-to-Teachers, and The New Teacher Project (TNTP). Indisputably, Teach for America (TFA) has been the most visible, and some would argue most successful, national program offering an alternative route to teaching. To go along with its popularity, however, TFA has also been one of the most criticized alternative pathways to teaching. An often-leveled criticism of TFA has been that it has exacerbated the problem of placing the least experienced and least trained teachers in schools that serve predominantly economically disadvantaged students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904812472725">Labaree, 2010</xref>). In addition, TFA critics have charged that the program sets up a contrast between TFA corps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0895904812472725"><italic>TFA Corps Profile</italic>, 2009</xref>) members and traditional teachers, undermining the standing of traditional teachers. As Labaree explains, “If coming from an elite college and passing through a highly selective admissions process is what it takes to be a good teacher—which is the message presented loud and clear by TFA—then this leaves the other teachers, who constitute the large majority of professionals in American classrooms, looking second-rate” (p. 52).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each year TFA continues to break records for applications, and in some high-needs urban schools, TFA corps members constitute either a majority or a sizeable minority of the teaching staff. In addition, alternative pathways are not exempt from calls for accountability. For example, the strengthened accountability provisions of the proposed Educator Preparation Reform Act would apply to both TPPs and alternative routes to teacher licensure. Moreover, their inclusion in the discussion indicates that alternative pathways are now a mainstay to the recruitment, training, and certification of teachers in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0895904812472725">
<title>The Educator Preparation Reform Act</title>
<p>In September 2012, Senator Jack Reed (Democrat, Rhode Island) and Rep. Mike Honda (Democrat, California) sponsored a bill titled The Educator Preparation Reform Act. If passed, the bill would make relatively significant changes in how the federal government supports, monitors, and distributes resources for teacher preparation programs and alternative pathways. First, the bill would require that both higher education–based and non–higher-education-based preparation programs submit report cards to the public reporting on program features including admissions standards; candidate selectivity—including candidate grade point averages and scores on standardized assessments; clinical preparation requirements; and outcomes measures, including program graduates’ placement, retention as teachers, and their teaching performance.</p>
<p>The bill would make revisions to the current Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) grants program of Title II of the HEA. TQP was established for the purposes of improving student achievement; improving the preparation of prospective teachers and professional development for in-service teachers; raising standards of accountability for teacher preparation programs; and recruiting a more diverse and highly qualified pool of candidates into the teaching profession. To accomplish these goals, the program incentivizes the development of partnerships between higher education institutions and high-needs local school districts and early childhood education programs. These partnerships have the goal of creating model teacher preparation programs at the undergraduate level, and/or model teaching residency programs for promising teacher candidates without teaching experience. The proposed bill will would amend the program to (a) require that funded partnerships be used for reforming undergraduate teacher preparation programs, establishing teacher and/or principal residency programs, or a combination of the two, and (b) to allow grant funds to be used to support and improve programs for training other educators, including librarians, literacy specialists, and school counselors.</p>
<p>The act would significantly strengthen the current requirement that states (a) identify and report low-performing preparation programs, (b) provide technical assistance to those programs, and (c) report programs that have lost state approval. It would revise the criteria for eligibility for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grant program by targeting funding specifically to students in the latter half of their undergraduate preparation programs and students in graduate programs. The bill would also restrict eligibility for students in programs deemed “low-performing” or “at-risk.”</p>
<p>The act is supported by AACTE and includes many of AACTE’s recommendations for reauthorization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and HEA, including revamping the TQP program, streamlining the accountability provisions of Title II with a focus on program outcomes, and the federal government enforcing Title II provisions around the identification and closure of low-performing preparation programs. The act has received a strong endorsement from the Higher Education Task Force on Teacher Preparation, a consortium of 11 higher education organizations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the problem stream, proponents of TPP contended that criticism was largely, as an informant described it, “unfair and unfounded.” Yet in the policy stream proponents of were actively engaged in developing policies to address this very critique. At first glance this behavior appears to reflect an “If you can’t beat them, then join them” tactic. However, it could also represent an attempt to engage the agenda setting and alternative specification processes on multiple fronts. By being involved in the development of solutions that are likely to gain serious attention, entities threatened by reform can potentially minimize its damaging impact by diluting or eliminating undesirable aspects of the proposed policy before adoption. In addition, responding to the criticism, proponents of TPP seemed to stand united in the problem stream but were divided in their backing of the different initiatives in the policy stream. This division can either undermine the acceptance of certain policies or lead to the implementation of multiple accountability policies.</p>

<title>Organized political forces: Professionalization versus deregulation and alternative pathways</title>
<p>The movement to further professionalize teaching has been led largely by Linda Darling-Hammond, other scholars, and the NCTAF and furthered through the efforts of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the NBPTS, and the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC). Largely, as described in the policy stream, their efforts focus on a wide range of reforms, such as standardization and extensive clinical preparation, that center not only on improving the effectiveness of TPPs but also on reducing the wide variability in quality of programs.</p>
<p>In the 1980s alternative pathways to teaching were developed to meet shortages and replace emergency licensure (NEA, n.d.). However, supported by conservative political groups and several foundations, including the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, the Heritage Foundation, the Pioneer Institute, and the Manhattan Institute, alternative pathways have become a permanent fixture in teacher preparation. The emergence and proliferation of alternative teacher preparation and certification programs has played a major role in policy conversations around teacher education and credentialing. NCLB act’s encouragement of such programs served to heighten their visibility and stimulate their growth in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>). Currently, all 50 states and the District of Columbia provide some alternative route to teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904812472725">Lahann &amp; Reagan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant to the <italic>professionalization versus deregulation</italic> political debate, more than a few TFA alumni now serve as high-level educational administrators and educational reform leaders. Some of these alumni include John White, Louisiana State superintendent of education; Kevin Huffman, Tennessee commissioner of education; Chris Barbic, superintendent for Tennessee’s Achievement School District; Michelle Rhee, former chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools, and founder and CEO of StudentsFirst; and Kaya Henderson, current chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools.</p>
<p>As these organized political forces continue to advocate for their preferred models for teacher preparation, they face increasing accountability requirements. The results from the accountability debate may either support or undermine the claims of effectiveness that advocates of these conflicting models proclaim.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has offered a rather pointed critique of the state of teacher preparation programs in the United States. Secretary Duncan has said of some programs:
<disp-quote>
<p>They operate partially blindfolded, without access to data that tells them how effective their graduates are in elementary and secondary school classrooms after they leave their teacher preparation programs. Too many are not attracting top students, and too many states are not setting a high bar for entry into the profession. . . . And too few teacher preparation programs offer the type of rigorous, clinical experience that prepares future teachers for the realities of today’s diverse classrooms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0895904812472725">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In response to this assessment, under the Obama administration’s education reform agenda includes investing heavily in teacher preparation and training through (a) service scholarships for preparing teaching candidates commit to teach in high-needs fields and communities, (b) improving the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs, (c) providing high-quality alternative pathways for aspiring teachers, and (d) increased and improved professional development and collaboration. The RttT grant competitions have embodied these principles. In an effort to expand high-quality alternative pathways into the teaching profession, RttT awarded points to states with legal or regulatory provisions allowing alternative routes to teacher certification; that committed to building comprehensive education data systems, tying teachers’ evaluation to their students’ achievement data; that committed to holding schools and school staff accountable for student achievement; and that had developed or were developing a process for monitoring, evaluating, and identifying areas of teacher shortage and preparing teachers to fill vacancies in those areas. One study participant characterized the Obama administration’s philosophy specifically around alternative teacher pathways in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>A very prominent corporate reform ideology has been embraced by the Obama administration; with tenets of that ideology being accountability, transparency, investing in alternatives. The administration has brought those tenets to education; investment in alternatives will generate competition, which will improve the public schools. The parallel in teacher preparation is to invest in alternate routes: Teach for America, New Leaders for New Schools, etc.</p>

<title>National mood</title>
<p>There was no indication that this new era of accountability for teacher preparation programs will be short-lived. Instead, it is widely recognized that higher standards of accountability for programs will be a part of the <italic>new normal</italic>. In evaluating how accountability for preparation programs came to this point, one study informant explained that proaccountability sentiment applied pressure to teacher education from two frontiers: K-12 and higher education, remarking,
<disp-quote>
<p>There has been a bit of a vacuum, and higher education has had such a vacuum on teacher education. Teacher education has been more aligned with the traditions of the academy than with K-12 education. As pressure has become more prominent on K-12, it has spilled over onto teacher education. Transparency and accountability have been insufficient. Like the rest of higher education, the goals with teacher education were graduation and degree attainment, with less attention to the skill-level and success of the teacher in the classroom, without teacher education programs being responsible for teachers’ success. Well, the world has changed and calls for accountability are higher than they have ever been.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Organized political forces and national mood were insufficient to place teacher education policy on the governmental agenda. The Obama administration was the primary mechanism for making teacher education prominent on the federal agenda. By providing incentives in a time of fiscal distress to states (RttT), the Obama Administration was able to <italic>encourage</italic> states to conform to the administrations’ preferences for education. This initiated a chain reaction that is still unfolding. The administration’s advocacy of teacher accountability based on student achievement, the development of more sophisticated data systems, and the expansion of alternative pathways to licensure, all helped to set in motion the next set of initiatives currently being proposed that focus on teacher preparation accountability policy. A political benefit to the Obama administration has been that accountability for teacher preparation is supported by both political parties, and the organized political forces are not voicing strong opposition to being held accountable per se; rather the conversation centers on which accountability policies are most appropriate.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Education policy rarely if ever results from the rational deliberation of lawmakers, informed by high-quality educational research. Instead, policy formation is messy and is often driven by competing agendas supported by opposing casts of policy actors. In some cases there is a winning side, but more often than not, policies that result come from compromise. Thus, understanding the politics of education is essential to understanding the origins and development of education policies that shape learning for children in schools across the country. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904812472725">Kingdon’s (1995)</xref> framework to describe how teacher education accountability has come to be prominently featured on the federal agenda, we found that teacher education accountability achieved agenda status largely because of multiple mechanisms at play in the political stream. Public and government sentiment favored public accountability; it had support from both political parties and organized political forces. Although there are divergent opinions about the effectiveness of traditional and alternative models, no one appears to providing strong opposition to some form of accountability. In fact, in the policy stream many groups are helping to shape accountability policies. More important, the Obama administration has been able to allocate fiscal resources to support teacher education accountability policy. The opening of a policy window in the political stream is also indicative of federal involvement in teacher education that is increasing in frequency and scope.</p>
<p>One focus of this study was to examine the extent to which the factors that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904812472725">Cochran-Smith and Fries (2001)</xref> highlighted a decade ago and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904812472725">Arnold et al. (1977)</xref> pointed out more than 35 years ago are transpiring in contemporary times. We found that the Cochran-Smith’s professionalization–deregulation debate played an important role in drawing attention to the variability in quality of TPPs, which was used as an indicator in the problem stream to advocate for accountability policy. In the future the outcomes of the accountability policies that may be implemented could provide data that could extend the debate if the results prove one approach to be more effective than the other or curtail the debate if they are viewed as similar in quality. Time will tell. We found Arnold et al.’s remarks to be applicable to today: “Public demands for accountability, combined with the awakened interests of teachers and the press upon school systems and colleges for better utilization of resources,” will lead to the improvement of the education of teachers. What they did not forecast was the extensive role the federal government, notably the executive branch, would play in driving teacher education accountability policies.</p>
<p>This article represents an overview of the current policy landscape. We highlight how teacher education accountability policy has achieved agenda status and what policies are currently being considered. What policies will be implemented and the consequences of those policies for both traditional and alternative programs have yet to be decided. What is certain, however, is that the professional and technical issues of teacher education are in the political arena and this can be “the best of times or the worst of times for teacher education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904812472725">Darling-Hammond, 2010</xref>).</p>
