<abstract>
<p>Pilot–vehicle interaction represents a critical aspect of aircraft design. Very low-frequency, voluntary although unintentional interaction has been extensively investigated in fixed and rotary wing aeromechanics. Higher frequency, involuntary and thus passive interaction received similar attention in fixed wing aeromechanics, but not as much for rotary wing. The results of an experimental campaign for the characterization of the passive behaviour of rotorcraft pilots' biomechanics are presented. A flight simulator has been used to excite human subjects. The accelerations of their limbs and the motion induced by the vibrations of the limbs in the control inceptors have been recorded. The vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions have been independently excited, while measuring the motion of the arm directly involved in the control inceptor mostly affected by motion in each direction, namely the left and the right arms for the collective and the cyclic sticks, respectively. The frequency domain response has been evaluated; resulting noteworthy behaviour is discussed, addressing its relevance in modelling the passive behaviour of pilots within the bioaeroservoelastic rotorcraft analysis. The measurements of human body impedance, under realistic cockpit motion, are used to identify the direct transfer functions between the motion of the seat and the controls inadvertently fed back into the rotorcraft.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011427662" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The interaction between the pilot and the vehicle is a critical consideration during the aircraft design process, because it impacts on the resulting pilot–vehicle system's performance, stability and safety characteristics. However, only part of this system is directly under the control of the designer, i.e. the vehicle, while the other part is not, i.e. the human. A significant number of occurrences of critical pilot–vehicle interactions have been recorded throughout the history of aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011427662">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup> In the worst cases of those adverse events, the pilot can destabilize the system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011427662">4</xref></sup> possibly resulting in the loss of the aircraft and even human life.</p>
<p>An aircraft and its pilot can be viewed as two individual dynamic systems in a feedback connection: the pilot, stimulated by the motion of the cockpit, inadvertently reacts by injecting commands into the flight controls through the inceptors. These unintentional controls induce further aircraft motion, thus closing the feedback loop. This interconnection may result in an unstable system despite the two subsystems being perfectly stable when considered separately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011427662">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This problem may appear in aircraft in the form of the so-called pilot-induced oscillations (PIOs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011427662">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011427662">6</xref></sup> They consist in a sustained oscillatory motion of the aircraft caused by an active, although unintended, intervention by the pilot on the controls, while attempting to counteract an adverse behaviour, typically under the influence of misleading cues. McRuer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011427662">4</xref></sup> defines them as ‘inadvertent, sustained aircraft oscillations which are consequence of an abnormal joint enterprise between the aircraft and the pilots’. Such ‘active pilot’ PIO phenomena have been recorded since the very first powered flight attempts by the Wright brothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011427662">2</xref></sup> However, when the destabilizing inputs do not result from an active intervention by the pilot, but rather are the consequence of the presence of a passive ‘impedance’ between the motion of the cockpit and the cockpit controls, so-called pilot-augmented oscillations (PAOs) result. In practice, pilots tend to introduce such unintended commands as a result of cockpit vibration.</p>
<p>Although a unique definition is still debated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011427662">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011427662">8</xref></sup> both phenomena are termed aircraft–pilot coupling, or rotorcraft–pilot coupling (RPC) in case of helicopters. This terminology shifts the emphasis from the pilot to the interface with the machine. In fact, despite different pilots and different piloting attitudes exhibit different proneness to instability, thus making the phenomenon somewhat subjective, the importance of the intrinsic proneness of the vehicle itself to unfavourable couplings needs to be recognized, and possibly cured.</p>
<p>These two phenomena are clearly different; specifically, they differ with respect to the range of frequencies of interest. According to a classification introduced by Dieterich et al.<sup>9</sup>, based on the characteristic frequency range, the human behaviour can be considered voluntary up to approximately 1 Hz (McRuer and Jex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011427662">10</xref></sup> place the largest crossover frequency ω<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> for tasks of interest in aircraft control at about 6-rad/s), while it should be considered involuntary and thus passive beyond this threshold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011427662">11</xref></sup> The upper limit for the range of frequencies related to ‘passive’ RPC is conventionally set to 8 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011427662">9</xref></sup> The phenomena related to the active participation of the pilot are usually considered PIO, whereas those related to a purely passive role are considered PAO. The pilot seated in the cockpit behaves as a passive element that transmits the vibrations of the elastic airframe from the seat to the control inceptor. Unintentional high-frequency control actions, filtered by the pilot's biomechanical impedance, are introduced in the flight control, thus closing the feedback loop between the aircraft and the flight controls. According to McRuer,<sup>4</sup> the inclusion of fly-by-wire flight control systems (FCs) increases the chances of occurrence of undesirable phenomena: ‘As a matter of fact, almost every aircraft equipped with a partial or total fly-by-wire FCS has, at one time or another of development process, experienced one or more A/RPC events’. Tischler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011427662">12</xref></sup> report that ‘Actuator rate limiting has been a key contributor to many of the PIOs experienced in flight test programs and must be considered in the development and evaluation of the flight control system’.</p>
<p>While the aspects of the phenomenon directly related to an active participation of the pilot (PIO) have been extensively analysed, primarily for fixed-wing aircraft, only recently attention is being dedicated to the passive participation of the pilot (PAO),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011427662">13</xref></sup> especially with respect to helicopters and rotorcraft in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A broad literature exists about PAO events, mainly focused on fixed-wing aircraft. A PAO event is characterized by the mayor role played in the instability mechanism by the lower frequency flexible modes of the airframe. PAO has been reported for several fixed-wing aircraft, including YF-12A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011427662">14</xref></sup> F-111, Rutan's Voyager,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011427662">15</xref></sup> C-17A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011427662">16</xref></sup> and Boeing 777,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410011427662">17</xref></sup> all caused by the pilot's interaction with the fuselage or wing bending modes. Rotorcraft PAO are less documented. However, for example, Walden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup> reported a significant record of occurrences concerning US Navy and US Marines rotorcraft, including CH-46, UH-60 and SH-60, CH-53, RAH-66, V-22, AH-1 and there are likely to be more not reported in the open literature.</p>
<p>In fact, one may expect rotorcraft to be more prone to PAOs because they are by far less stable than aircraft, and because they are required to fulfil difficult, high-workload missions; a dependence of biodynamic feedthrough (BDFT) on task and workload has been highlighted in the literature (see for example, Venrooij et al.<sup>18</sup>). The typical pilots' biomechanical frequency range (2–6 Hz), overlaps with that of flexible airframe, rotor, FCS/automatic flight control system, actuator dynamics and drive train dynamics modes of vibration, paving the way to a variety of aeroservoelastic instability phenomena.</p>
<p>The history of tiltrotor development also catalogues many PAO events, from the early design and testing of the XV-15 technology demonstrator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011427662">19</xref></sup> to the several aeroservoelastic pilot-in-the-loop couplings encountered during the testing of the V-22.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011427662">20</xref></sup> One V-22 mechanism was related to a 1.4-Hz lateral oscillation (high-focal roll mode) of the fuselage with the aircraft on the ground,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup> while another was related to high-speed flight conditions, coupling the lateral and longitudinal pilot response to airframe elastic modes (asymmetric wing chord bending mode) at 3.2 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup> Tiltrotor manufacturers have therefore been paying significant attention to RPC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011427662">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954410011427662">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, rotary wing aircraft present a specific coupling issue related to the traditional layout of controls, due to the presence of the collective control lever. This device usually rotates about an axis parallel to the rotorcraft pitch axis, and is held by the pilot's left arm in a position that can range from nearly horizontal (minimum collective, with the arm almost fully extended) to some 45° inclination (maximum collective, with the arm moderately bent). The collective control directly affects the collective pitch of the blades, and thus the thrust of the rotor; as such, a variation in thrust could accelerate the rotorcraft vertically, thus causing a further unintentional change in collective input, that in turn could cause further vertical imbalance, and so on.</p>
<p>This may result in a phenomenon known as ‘vertical bounce’, or ‘collective bounce’, a characteristic of helicopters. It consists in a vertical oscillation of the helicopter, caused by pulsating thrust induced by an oscillation unintentionally introduced in the collective control by the pilot. In fact, the motion of the collective control essentially results in a direct change of blade pitch, and thus in a very quick change in thrust, since the dynamics of the aerodynamics is much faster than that of the excitation, and the response is intrinsically quasi-steady (the reduced frequency at 75% blade radius associated to a harmonic collective pitch change with frequency ω is <italic>k</italic> = 0.75(ω/Ω)(<italic>c</italic>/<italic>R</italic>), where <italic>c</italic> is the chord, <italic>R</italic> the radius and Ω the angular velocity of the rotor; it is less than 0.05 for most helicopters for ω up to 3 Hz). The problem, in some cases associated with slung loads (loads suspended outside and below the helicopter fuselage), has occurred several times. On 13 June 1980, an AB-204B helicopter operated by Héliswiss (HB-XKL) hit the ground hard after a sequence of vertical oscillations following the sudden release of a slung load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954410011427662">23</xref></sup> More recently, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has reported accidents occurring after encountering collective bounce (NTSB reports SEA08LA043 and ANC08LA083, respectively, related to accidents occurred in December 2007 and June 2008). In both cases, a UH-1B was involved; the probable cause was related to the failure of the pilot to control the helicopter's vertical bounce. In one case, this was accompanied by insufficient collective control friction; in the other, by poor maintenance, resulting in loose and worn control system and rotor bearings. The NTSB reports from the Operator's Manual for the UH-1B helicopter that ‘collective bounce is a pilot induced vertical oscillation […] at approximately three cycles per second’. This frequency is of interest as, later in this article, it will be shown that its value is close to a biomechanical interaction frequency between pilot and collective lever.</p>
<p>Aeroelastic (i.e. relatively high frequency) coupling between longitudinal and lateral cyclic controls and the corresponding rotorcraft surge and sway motions appears less critical, since changes in cyclic pitch do not cause immediate horizontal forces imbalance, but rather pitch/roll moments, usually filtered by the low-pass behaviour of common rotorcraft. As a consequence, these couplings are usually less prone to causing further action on the controls, although Walden<sup>3</sup> reports that the lateral axis tends to be critical for PAOs, significantly because of deficiencies in the FCS design to consider the contribution of indirect pilot activity from other axes to instability in the primary axis for the control law.</p>
<p>Pilots of tiltrotor aircraft equipped with conventional helicopter control inceptors could encounter similar types of coupling when flying in helicopter mode. Moreover, rolling motion could couple much more significantly through lateral stick motion, since this control moment is commanded by differentially actuating the collective pitch of the two rotors which, as previously explained, respond relatively quickly to collective inputs. For this purpose, the effect of lateral acceleration on lateral cyclic control of the V-22 was investigated in Parham and Popelka.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>The above-described phenomena may be amplified by the dynamics that is inherent in rotorcraft, related to the aeroelasticity and structural dynamics of both the rotor and the fuselage. This aeroservoelastic effect is twofold.
<list id="list1-0954410011427662" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It might enhance the amplitude of the coupling motion, and bring it into a frequency range slightly above the band-limited capabilities of the human body to effectively counteract adverse unintentional inputs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pilot may intentionally try to counteract low-frequency phenomena, although with a phase delay large enough to adversely impact the behaviour of the rotorcraft.</p></list-item>
</list>The presence of a FCS may further complicate the problem, since the motion induced in the control inceptors is subsequently filtered before being actually transformed to actuator control motion (e.g. rotor blade pitch). This has the potential to result in significant adverse responses.</p>
<p>To investigate the proneness to PAOs of a new design, the capability to perform the coupled bioaeroservoelastic rotorcraft analysis is needed, which implies the need for an appropriate model of the biomechanical response of the pilot, or BDFT. This model must account for the physiological dynamics of the pilot's neuromuscular system, which depend upon:
<list id="list2-0954410011427662" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>the weight and the height of the pilot;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the configuration of the cockpit's haptic interfaces;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the pilot's posture and piloting attitude;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the skills and control strategy adopted by the pilot to accomplish a specific Mission Task Element (MTE, according to Padfield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954410011427662">24</xref></sup> a ‘collection of individual manoeuvres [with] a definite start and finish and prescribed temporal and spatial performance requirements’);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a set of elements correlated to the mental activity of the pilot essentially related to the workload level required by the MTE, such as the level of awareness, cognitive state, fatigue, anxiety, and more.</p></list-item>
</list>Often, this broad class of dependencies, which is not completely understood yet, is hidden behind the concept of ‘trigger’, or initiation mechanism, which summarizes the stimuli that may initiate the occurrence of a PAO event. The trigger, as discussed by McRuer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011427662">4</xref></sup> is the third player in A/RPC, along with the pilot and the vehicle. The dependence of BDFT on MTE is pointed out in Venrooij et al.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Several pilot models have been proposed in the literature using data from cockpit mock-up excitation (see for example, Allen et al.<sup>25</sup>, Jex and Magdaleno<sup>26</sup> and Höhne<sup>27</sup>), flight simulator tests (see for example, Mayo<sup>11</sup> and Jump et al.<sup>28</sup>) and in-flight measurements (see for example, Parham and Popelka<sup>20</sup>). Most if not all these results suffer from a limitation: they are specific for the cockpit layout they have been collected from. In most cases, they are specific to fixed-wing aircraft controls layouts, which lack the collective stick. Moreover, the identification of possible trigger mechanisms affecting the response of the pilot requires more detailed models, which in turn require more information on the vibration response of the pilot's limbs. Furthermore, measures directly related to the movements of the pilot's limbs must be collected to develop a pilot model that does not depend on the configuration of the inceptors.</p>
<p>This article documents the results of several test campaigns for the analysis of the biomechanics of rotorcraft pilots in the ‘aeroelastic’ range of frequencies, aiming at understanding the behaviour of the pilot and synthesizing transfer functions to be used in bioaeroservoelastic rotorcraft simulation. The activity is described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954410011427662">‘Activity description’ section</xref>, whereas <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954410011427662">‘Experimental set-up’ section</xref> illustrates the experimental setup and the test campaigns. Finally, section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-0954410011427662">‘Analysis of results’</xref> discusses the experimental results, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954410011427662">‘Collective transfer function identification’ section</xref> proposes new transfer functions for the motion of the collective as a function of the acceleration of the seat, identified from the results of the previous section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011427662"><title>Activity description</title>
<p>A typical approach to RPC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011427662">Figure 1</xref>) consists in coupling the states of the rotorcraft dynamics, <bold><italic>x</italic></bold>, to the control input, <bold>δ</bold>, by adding a dynamic feedback model of the pilot as either a transfer function, when operating in the frequency domain, or its state-space realization, when operating in the time domain (e.g. Gennaretti et al.<sup>29</sup>). The positive feedback <bold>δ</bold><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, which depends on the states <bold><italic>x</italic></bold> through the ‘pilot’ block, is added to the reference controls <bold>δ</bold><sub>0</sub> required to perform the desired MTE in feedforward.
<fig id="fig1-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>RPC mechanical feedback loop.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Typical measures used to counteract adverse couplings in vehicles consist in adding viscous stick dampers and other stick attenuation devices, including mass balancing. Augmented control vehicles also allow to act through FCS gain adjustments and notch or band-rejection filtering, to attenuate adverse pilot's input, <bold>δ</bold><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, between the control stick motion signal and the actual input that is fed into the FCS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011427662">3</xref></sup> The purpose of these filters is to remove the control motion signals in a characteristic band of frequencies associated with, for example, a known structural vibration frequency.</p>
<p>Notch filtering is consistent with the current industrial practice, but suffers from a series of limitations, principally related to the fact that pilot transfer functions, and hence characteristic frequencies, may present a marked variability, depending on the parameters enumerated in the introduction. Another issue, especially in partially augmented aircraft, is that the filter can only act on the augmented fraction of the control input, thus only partially alleviating adverse effects, without completely eliminating them. The variability related to pilot skills, mental activity and workload cannot be eliminated or is not well understood yet. The variability related to the pilot's size cannot be eliminated either, although it can possibly be taken into account by measurement. The variability related to the reference configuration is also well known, but cannot be easily handled with the previously illustrated approach, since it requires that the impedance of the pilot be experimentally measured in all the desired configurations, and possibly to interpolate between a discrete set of transfer functions when the required configuration is not exactly known. How pilot models consisting of transfer functions can be interpolated is not discussed, as it belongs to aeromechanic simulation and is thus outside the scope of this study.</p>
<p>The study reported in this article aims at obtaining a pilot model that can reproduce the relationship between the motion of the cockpit and the involuntary contribution of the pilot to the control inputs of a helicopter, and to highlight how this relationship depends upon the reference position of the limbs. It focuses on helicopter pilots because they are more routinely exposed to airframe vibration than fixed-wing aircraft pilots, and because conventional helicopter cockpits are characterized by a peculiar inceptor to control the collective pitch of the blades.</p>
<p>A passive pilot model has been identified from measurements acquired during a test campaign initially conducted within GARTEUR HC AG-16 (preliminary results have been presented in Dieterich et al.<sup>9</sup> and Jump et al.<sup>28</sup>), and subsequently with partial support from Regione Lombardia and the Italian Ministry of University and Research. The experiments have been jointly conducted by Politecnico di Milano and the University of Liverpool (UOL) using the Bibby flight simulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954410011427662">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011427662">Figure 2</xref>). The activity is continuing in the project ARISTOTEL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aristotel.progressima.eu/">http://www.aristotel.progressima.eu/</ext-link>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011427662">8</xref></sup> sponsored by the European Commission within the 7th Framework Programme.
<fig id="fig2-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Bibby flight simulator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Experiments consisted primarily of imposing a prescribed motion on the flight simulator's motion base and measuring the resulting motion of the control inceptors when passively held by the simulator occupant. Therefore, the flight simulator acted as a vibrating platform to excite the occupant along different axes, without any specific visual feedback; the control inceptor motion is not fed back to the motion platform. A human subject, not necessarily a helicopter pilot, was seated inside the simulator holding a specific control inceptor about a reference position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011427662">Figure 3</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Nominal collective lever positions: (a) 10%; (b) 50% and (c) 90% of end-to-end deflection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The motion of the pilots' limbs was also measured. Biometric measurements were performed using three strapdown inertial sensor units (Xsens' MTi, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xsens.com">http://www.xsens.com</ext-link>) placed on the forearm close to the wrist, on the arm close to the elbow and on the upper torso close to the shoulder. These measurements suffered from the fact that the sensors were attached externally over the occupants' clothes and fixed using elastic tissue bands. Measurement correction procedures should be considered to alleviate deviations due to the compliance of the material within the sensor and the bones, including the flesh (see for example, Kitazaki and Griffin<sup>31</sup>). Since only a qualitative indication of the limbs' behaviour was sought, and considering that required corrections within the frequency range of interest should be minimal, they have been neglected.</p>
<p>Three human subjects have been considered, separately addressing vibrations in the three linear directions of motion: fore/aft, lateral and heave. Preliminary results were presented in Gennaretti et al.<sup>29</sup> for the heave motion, and in Mattaboni et al.<sup>32</sup> for the sway and surge motions. Harmonic and low-pass filtered random signals were used as acceleration inputs to the simulator, characterized by a frequency content limited up to about 10 Hz (up to 7 Hz in the case of pure harmonic excitation). In the case of the harmonic motion, the amplitude of the prescribed acceleration was not greater than 0.2 g, while in the case of the random input, the root mean square (RMS) was 0.04 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011427662">Figure 4</xref> shows the power spectral density (PSD) of the acceleration measured at the base of the flight simulator; its RMS is 0.1108 m/s (about 0.011 g). The same spectrum has been used for vertical, lateral and fore/aft vibration tests.

<p>The interaction between the simulator occupant and the collective and cyclic sticks have been investigated in separate experiments. Different reference positions and configuration parameters have been tested for the collective and the longitudinal and lateral cyclic controls. This allowed to characterize in detail the passive behaviour of the helicopter flight simulator occupants.</p>
<p>The effect of different reference positions of the arm has been investigated as well. The results show that the amplitude and phase of the limbs' response appears to be affected; the configuration of the cockpit and the task can affect the adverse coupling between the vehicle and the pilot.</p>
<p>All the recorded signals were conditioned during the post-processing phase using low-pass Butterworth filters with a cut-off frequency of 25 Hz before being used for identification.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954410011427662"><title>Experimental set-up</title>
<p>The experiments were conducted at The UOL Flight Science and Technology (FST) Research Group's Bibby flight simulation laboratory. At that time, the primary research tool available to FST was a six-visual channel flight simulator mounted upon a six-axis motion base, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011427662">Figure 2</xref> and described in Padfield and White.<sup>30</sup> Research vehicle flight dynamics models are primarily generated using Advanced Rotorcraft Technologies' (ART) FLIGHTLAB software,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954410011427662">33</xref></sup> which interfaces with ART's PILOTSTATION software to provide the motion cueing to the simulator pilot. While the simulator usually requires the development of an air-vehicle model of the desired fidelity, the proposed experimentation required the development or procurement of new capabilities:
<list id="list3-0954410011427662" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>to drive the existing motion system without reference to a specific vehicle model;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>measure the input demands to the motion system;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>measure the angles, rates and accelerations of the simulator pod (i.e. the motion stimulus to the simulator occupant);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>measure the resultant pilot's arm motion;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>capture and synchronize all the experimental data from the various measurement sources.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011427662">Figure 5</xref> shows schematically how these objectives were achieved. Capability 1 was achieved by creating a dummy FLIGHTLAB model, whose motion-demand outputs were all set to zero. The desired input to the motion base was then injected via the simulation model's control system, the output of which was directed to the six-motion system data latches that are the ‘input’ to the motion base control software. To achieve the second capability requirement, the motion-base controller software was modified to broadcast the inputs and outputs of the latch filters. The motion of the motion-base itself was measured by installing a MicroStrain 3DM-GX1 motion sensor procured by UOL. The pilot arm motion was measured by the three previously mentioned MTi sensors provided by POLIMI. Software had to be developed to broadcast the data measured by all these sensors to the recording stations and capture it from the simulation facility's Ethernet and save it on persistent storage for later evaluation.

<p>The majority of the test points required the collective lever forces to be switched off. In practice, the ideal situation of zero friction was not possible with the simulator hardware, thus, the collective lever forces were set to the minimum available. Since with the stick forces switched off, the collective was ‘floppy’, to restrict the inceptor and hence the arm vibration around the nominal start position, a restraint had to be prepared to correctly hold the inceptor in the desired start positions.</p>
<p>To assist the simulator occupant with this task, the pilot display shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011427662">Figure 6</xref> was created. It provided the simulator occupant and operators with an indication of the position of all the control inceptors. The left-most symbol shows the position of the collective lever (XC), the central cross-shaped symbol shows the longitudinal (XB) and lateral (XA) cyclic controls position, and the right-most symbol shows the rudder pedal position (XP). The occupant was asked to keep the collective lever close to the specified reference position within 10% of the range using the display as a guide. No specific precision was required for this task, in order to avoid significant muscular activation transients.
<fig id="fig6-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Control inceptors position display.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The collective lever, with minimal friction, appeared to be well-balanced, since an excitation test run with no occupants showed negligible rotations of the lever about the initial position.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954410011427662"><title>Test procedure: cyclic inceptor</title>
<p>The MTi motion sensors were applied to the occupant as described earlier, but in this case to the right arm and shoulder. No picture is available because the simulator pod provides no visual access from the right side. Reference positions of 0% and ±35% of the maximum range allowed by the inceptor were considered. During one set of tests, the retention force on the inceptor was disabled, resulting in a ‘floppy’ behaviour, while during the other set, the retention force was active, requiring the pilots to apply an appreciable load to hold the stick about the non-centred reference positions.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0954410011427662"><title>Analysis of results</title>
<p>A common approach to the modelling of the pilot's contribution to the aeroservoelastic response of the vehicle consists of identifying an equivalent transfer function that relates the motion of the controls in response to the vibratory load the pilot receives from the cockpit. Single input–single output models associated to a single control as function of excitation about or along a specific axis are often used. This approach may be questionable from many points of view, as the effects of different sources of vibration may not be easily separated. However, it provides a simple and useful tool to consider the problem to a first approximation.</p>
<p>In the literature, there are quite a few examples of experimental transfer functions identified for similar purposes (e.g. those already mentioned for the collective, presented in Mayo<sup>11</sup> and discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954410011427662">Collective transfer function identification section</xref>, and for the cyclic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954410011427662">21</xref></sup>). In many cases, they address the very low-frequency range that is typical of flight mechanics applications for fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011427662"><title>Collective control</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011427662">Figure 8</xref> shows the frequency response of the acceleration relative to the moving base of the flight simulator, measured during heave excitation tests with all pilots holding the collective lever about a reference position corresponding to 50%.
<fig id="fig8-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Frequency response of vertical acceleration relative to the flight simulator reference frame measured on pilot limbs; input: vertical acceleration of motion-base and collective lever reference position: 50%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig8.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The responses look similar, with some behaviour peculiar to each pilot. All pilots have a significantly damped main resonance peak at the shoulder between 4 and 6 Hz. The lightest pilot displays the highest frequency, suggesting that this effect may be dominated by the oscillation of the whole body, or of the torso, due to the joint effect of the seat's elasticity and the straining of the body.</p>
<p>The significant phase delay close to the peak, about 180°, suggests that this effect may not be attributed only to the elastic deformation of the seat: it consists of a very thin layer of foam interposed between the pilot and a structural element that is a part of the pod's frame and thus can be viewed as rigid in the context of the experiment under consideration. As a consequence, the internal forces yielded by the human body must play a dominant role in determining the above-mentioned phase delay.</p>
<p>Increasing differences appear when looking at the accelerations of the elbow and the wrist. A lower frequency resonance peak, close to 3.5 Hz, characterizes the shorter pilot. The behaviour of the other two pilots is similar for frequencies below that of the main peak, but one pilot presents a sharper peak, especially at the elbow, while the other one shows a plateau of high relative acceleration for frequencies above that of the peak.</p>
<p>These differences, especially between pilots 1 and 2, whose physical characteristics are somehow closer to each other, may be related to a difference in the muscular activation state. Additionally, a possible nonlinear constitutive law, typical of reflexive muscular behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954410011427662">34</xref></sup> may be responsible for the large plateau shown by pilot 2. Instead, the arm of pilot 3 seems to behave like a notch filter that cancels the resonant peak of the shoulder in the vicinity of 6 Hz.</p>
<p>In any case, the vibration of the body is clearly amplifying the acceleration of the pod in the frequency range between 2.5 Hz and at least 5 Hz (7 Hz for the taller pilots), when transmitted to the collective lever, with a significant phase delay.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011427662">Figure 9</xref> shows the relative acceleration at the wrist with the collective lever held at 10%, 50% and 90% (0% and 100%, respectively, correspond to full-down and full-up collective). The two pilots considered in the figure show lower amplification factors at 90%. The first pilot shows a larger variability than the second one, suggesting again that the main difference may be related to muscular activation rather than to differences in the relative position of the limbs.

<sec id="sec9-0954410011427662"><title>Lateral cyclic control</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011427662">Figure 10</xref> shows the lateral acceleration measured by the sensors on the right arm when the pod is subjected to an imposed lateral acceleration, and the control stick is ‘floppy’ (retention force disabled).
<fig id="fig10-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Frequency response of lateral acceleration relative to flight simulator reference frame measured on pilot limbs; input: lateral acceleration of motion-base; the cyclic stick is free to move; and reference position: 0%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig10.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The amplification on the lateral motion appears at a lower frequency, compared with the collective lever cases. It appears to be mainly due to the arm vibration, with a slight influence of the vibrations of the torso. Pilots 1 and 2 present an amplification in the range between 1 and 2.7 Hz, while a slightly larger amplification range, with a peak shifted at a frequency close to 3 Hz, is shown by the shorter pilot.</p>
<p>When a retention force proportional to the stick deflection is applied to the stick by an electrical motor, the interesting behaviour of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011427662">Figure 11</xref> appears. The behaviour of pilots 1 and 2, characterized by a lower peak when no retention force is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011427662">Figure 10</xref>), shows a sharp increase of the amplitude peak close to 2 Hz, which nearly doubles. On the contrary, the response of pilot 3, characterized by a higher peak frequency without retention force, is nearly unaffected.
<fig id="fig11-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Frequency response of lateral acceleration relative to flight simulator reference frame measured on pilot limbs; input: lateral acceleration of motion-base; the cyclic stick is subjected to a retention force; and reference position: 0%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig11.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>While changing the reference position does not produce any significant modification of the response when the retention force is disabled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011427662">Figure 12</xref>), the presence of the retention force drastically changes the behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011427662">Figure 13</xref>): the peak at about 2 Hz disappears. This modification can be attributed to a change in muscular activation required to counteract the significant load opposed by the retention force to keep the control stick at ±35%. As shown for the collective lever, also in this case, the muscular activation of the pilot limbs may be responsible for a change in the pilot biodynamic response.
<fig id="fig12-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Frequency response of lateral acceleration relative to flight simulator reference frame measured on pilot limbs for different reference positions of cyclic stick; input: lateral acceleration of motion-base and the cyclic stick is free to move.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig12.tif"/>

</fig></p>
<p>One might object that in regular flight conditions, a pilot would not need to hold the stick sustaining such a high load, as it would rather be trimmed out. However, this could happen for short times during manoeuvre and transients in general; the resulting modification of passive biodynamic behaviour could impact the dynamics of the rotorcraft, and potentially trigger a PAO event.</p>

<p>The mesomorphic model of equation (2) in Masarati et al.<sup>35</sup> appeared to be the most prone to instability when coupled to the aeroelastic model of a light helicopter of the class of the BO105. It is worth noting that, in the original reference,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011427662">11</xref></sup> the ectomorphic function appeared to be more prone to instability when coupled with the dynamics of a heavy helicopter. The rationale could be related to the fact that the frequencies of a larger helicopter are lower than those of a smaller one, and the poles of the ectomorphic pilot are lower than those of the mesomorphic one. One should also consider that the cockpit layout used in the present experiments probably differ from that used in Mayo.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>The transfer function of equation (2) describes the absolute acceleration of the hand that holds the collective inceptor as a function of the seat's vertical acceleration. In order to apply it to time marching analysis, it must be modified to return the relative motion of the stick by adding two (pseudo-)integrators 1/(<italic>s</italic> + α), and by dividing it by the length of the inceptor, <italic>L</italic>, and by its rotation excursion, ϕ<sub>range</sub>

The second additional pole should be set to a low frequency (α<sub>2</sub> corresponding to 2π rad/s, 1 Hz, was used, for example, in Masarati et al.<sup>36</sup>) to eliminate drift and prevent the ‘passive’ transfer function from affecting the bandwidth of pertinence of active pilot models. A more appropriate value can be estimated according to, for example, the crossover frequency ω<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> of McRuer's ‘crossover’ model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011427662">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954410011427662">37</xref></sup> The modified transfer functions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011427662">Figure 15</xref> for different values of α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub>: curve (a) is obtained with α<sub>1</sub> = α<sub>2</sub> = 0 rad/s; curve (b) is obtained with α<sub>1</sub> = 0, α<sub>2</sub> = 2π rad/s; curve (c) is obtained with α<sub>1</sub> = α<sub>2</sub> = 2π rad/s.

<p>The rationale of this correction is that at very low frequencies, a pilot can compensate any acceleration that moves the control away from the desired position, so, a quasi-static acceleration can result, at most, in a static deflection of the control. This pilot model appears to be roughly analogous to the structural part of Hess' structural pilot model (SPM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954410011427662">38</xref></sup> with emphasis on the biomechanical behaviour.</p>
<p>In more sophisticated problems, the ‘active’ behaviour of the pilot may need to be considered along with the ‘passive’ one; for example, in Masarati et al.<sup>39</sup> a semi-active model whose active part is based on McRuer's crossover model is used in the aeroservoelastic analysis of RPC. In any case, the active, very low-frequency behaviour of the pilot is outside the scope of this study.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011427662">Figure 16</xref> compares the transfer function directly estimated from the measured data using Matlab's function <monospace>tfe</monospace> (transfer function estimate, based on the Blackman–Tukey algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954410011427662">40</xref></sup>) to the transfer functions identified directly from time domain data using a time domain subspace method implemented in Matlab's function <monospace>n4sid</monospace> and from the transfer function estimate using a frequency domain method implemented in Matlab's function <monospace>invfreqs</monospace> (inverse frequency response, based on the Levi algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0954410011427662">41</xref></sup>). A frequency resolution of 1 Hz was used for frequency domain identification; a finer frequency resolution can be useful when the transfer function contains very sharp peaks, at the cost of increasing the uncertainty. Since the pilot biodynamic response appears to be characterized by significant damping (as for example in Mayo<sup>11</sup>), no sharp peaks were expected; for this reason, a coarser frequency resolution was considered adequate.
<fig id="fig16-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>Identification quality assessment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig16.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Both identification techniques agree in placing two resonant peaks respectively in the 2–4 and in the 5–7 Hz ranges. The time domain method, however, seems to overestimate the resonance peak amplitude. For this reason, the frequency domain method has been preferred. A structure with four poles and two zeros has been selected, to account for the two resonance peaks resulting from a qualitative inspection of the response shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954410011427662">Figure 16</xref>. Although the coloured noise excitation spanned the 0.4–10 Hz frequency band, the identification was restricted to the 2–8 Hz band for consistency with the definition of aeroelastic RPC agreed in Dieterich et al.<sup>9</sup> and to ensure that the pronounced activity associated with ‘intentional’ stick motion below 1 Hz and the noise above 10 Hz that appear in the figure did not affect the identified transfer function.</p>
<p>The identified functions are characterized by a fourth-order denominator and a second-order numerator, respectively, made by two pairs of complex conjugated poles and one pair of complex conjugated zeros, namely

<p>The amplitude and phase of the function of equation (3) is compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954410011427662">Figure 17</xref> to the identified ones related to pilot #1 at 10% and 90% reference collective control stick positions. The measured output of the experiment, namely the % rotation of the collective control stick, has been transformed in this figure into the displacement orthogonal to the stick at the handle, in order to make it comparable with the function of equation (3).
<fig id="fig17-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><p>Pilot transfer functions frequency response.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig17.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>It is worth noting that, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954410011427662">Figure 18</xref>, there are two dominant frequencies in the pilot's response to a random vertical shaking of the cockpit, corresponding to the two pilot's poles in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954410011427662">Table 4</xref>. The figure shows the results of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the accelerometer measurements taken at the elbow (‘ex’, ‘ey’, ‘ez’) and at the wrist (‘wx’, ‘wy’, ‘wz’), and of the collective control stick rotation (‘c’, in %/(m/s<sup>2</sup>)), normalized by the corresponding base acceleration input. The acceleration components are relative to the flight simulator base, projected in the Earth reference frame.
<fig id="fig18-0954410011427662" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Accelerations relative to the flight simulator base and % collective control stick rotation for random base acceleration input.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011427662-fig18.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The sensor located close to the elbow shows a much larger response than the one close to the wrist. The motion of the sensor close to the wrist, which is closely related to the motion of the collective control stick handle, appears to be dominated by a motion in direction <italic>x</italic> (fore-aft) for mode #1, and by a motion in direction <italic>z</italic> (vertical) for mode #2. On the contrary, the motion of the elbow is dominated by its vertical component for mode #1, while all components show a similar participation for mode #2. Both sensors show a noticeable participation of lateral motion for both modes. The simulator occupants reported some noticeable symmetric motion of the legs (not instrumented) when harmonically excited in heave at the frequencies corresponding to those modes. The phase clearly shows that the modes are definitely complex; it is worth noticing that, as expected, the % collective control stick rotation is almost directly out of phase with respect to the acceleration of the wrist.</p>
<p>Indirect evidence of the presence of a second pair of poles at about 6 Hz was also noticed in Masarati et al.<sup>22</sup> when biomechanics measurements were collected during flight testing of the BA-609 while performing collective dwells. In that case, especially during tests with low friction on the collective control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011427662">Figure 10</xref> of Masarati et al.<sup>22</sup>), the stick motion and the pilot limbs' accelerations showed a peak at about 6 Hz that was not present in the excitation, in addition to a remarkable response at the excitation frequency of about 3 Hz.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0954410011427662"><title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>This article presented the results of an experimental campaign conducted in a flight simulator to characterize the passive biodynamic response of helicopter pilots. The frequency response of the collective and cyclic control inceptors motion and of the occupants' limbs accelerations have been measured while accelerating the flight simulator pod along the vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions. A significant dependence on the posture resulting from the requirement to hold the inceptors at different reference positions has been observed. Cyclic control inceptor measurements associated to lateral excitation also show a noteworthy dependence of the response on the muscular activation required to react the load provided by retention forces. These factors are believed to be potential triggers for pilot-augmented oscillation events. Transfer functions that describe the rotation of the collective control as a function of the vertical acceleration of the pod have been identified for different simulator pod occupants and reference positions of the inceptor. They have been discussed in view of existing results from the open literature.</p>
<p>Future activity is underway to address the development of pilot models for the aeroservoelastic simulation of rotorcraft aeromechanics. The database gathered by these experiments is expected to support the identification of realistic constitutive properties of pilot's articulations and their validation. Additional experiments involving helicopter pilots performing realistic MTEs with different workload levels have been already performed and are being analyzed, while other tests are scheduled. This activity will continue within the project ARISTOTEL, sponsored by the European Commission within the 7th Framework Programme.</p>
