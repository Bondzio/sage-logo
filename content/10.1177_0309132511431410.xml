<abstract>
<p>Indigenous peoples live in challenging environments and engage in complex negotiations to access their rights. Yet research on their social mobilization often stereotypes them as victims of environmental management. We review three debates through which human geographers are beginning to engage more meaningfully with Indigenous environmentalism: the political ecology of neoliberalism; deliberation within claims settlement; and propertization of socio-ecological relations. A movement away from conflating Indigenous with local is evident in those debates, producing recognition of diversity in Indigenous motivations but also a range of challenges to geographical practice.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Indigenous geographies have emerged as a vibrant and productive research theme, but we do not proclaim a new subdiscipline in this series of reports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309132511431410">1</xref></sup> Rather, we consider a body of work which warrants an accessible yet critical inventory because of its insights into social transformation and cross-cultural relations, and its consequences for geographical practice. Such vital concerns of the discipline as place dynamics, community mobilization and human-environment relations have all benefited from attention to the Indigenous cultural renaissance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132511431410">Panelli, 2008</xref>). It is opportune, therefore, to consider research with Indigenous peoples and to comment on its implications for geography as a whole.</p>
<p>In this report, we reconsider the theme of resource conflicts, which has long connected geographers to Indigenous activism. However, empiricist and ethnographic approaches to researching Indigenous communities failed to explain the deeper significance of resource development for three reasons. First, that style of research focused on local expressions of resource scarcity so could not account for cross-scale drivers of environmental change. In section II of this report we examine recent exchanges between Indigenous geographies and political ecology, applauding the latter’s cross-scale approach but revealing our concern about its incorporation of culture into analysis. Second, past research assumed stasis in communities and culture so failed to assess Indigenous peoples’ dynamic negotiations with exogenous processes. Design failure in forums for negotiation was conceived as the driver of ongoing conflicts, but in section III we present a more dialectical critique of deliberation and rights-making and argue that such conflicts are the product of ontological difference. Third, past accounts of environmental conflict assumed that Indigenous groups were homogenous, resulting in essentialization of their environmental preferences. The difficulty with such assumptions is revealed in section IV which presents a warning about Indigenous peoples’ new-found emphasis on property in land claims settlement.</p>

<title>II Political ecology versus Indigenous geographies?</title>
<p>Political ecology has been vital to recent progress in Indigenous geographies, but interaction between those subject areas has also been problematic. Associating resource dispossession with neoliberalization and framing both as multiscale and discourse-laden processes has particular relevance for Indigenous politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132511431410">Perreault and Valdivia, 2010</xref>). By debunking myths of Indigenous irrationality in the production of environmental scarcity or risk, political ecologists have refocused attention to the exogenous processes which condition resource use. Their post-Hardinian analysis avoids caricature of local cultures as explanations or solutions for environmental problems, thereby circumventing the ‘local trap’ which previously characterized research into Indigenous environmentalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132511431410">Brown and Purcell, 2005</xref>). The discursive outcomes of increasing environmental insecurity validate further that panoramic outlook on the production of risk and scarcity. For example, the growing incidence of hurricanes in Honduras is used to justify global conservation initiatives which become shrouded in discourses of community safety, obscuring the real reason for relocation of Indigenous peoples from national parks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132511431410">Timms, 2011</xref>). Incorporation of concepts from disequilibrium ecology also assists with understanding threats to Indigenous sovereignty. It promotes attention to nature’s agency, thereby discrediting preservationism, its presumption of stasis in ecological conditions and its encroachment on Indigenous territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132511431410">Nygren and Rikoon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Political ecology’s approach to environment-development relations evolved from analysis of the Global South, but it has wider relevance. Research into past framings of the Amazon as empty and associated identity reconfigurations in the present is insightful for understanding stateless Indigenous peoples of the North (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132511431410">Hecht, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132511431410">Salisbury et al., 2011</xref>). The political ecology of how southern governments use anxiety about forests and their capriciousness to justify civilizing missions against Indigenous denizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132511431410">Peluso and Vandergeest, 2011</xref>) provides insight into northern ‘interventions’ and ‘emergency responses’ in Indigenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132511431410">Macoun, 2011</xref>). As applied in the South, political ecology demonstrates how ‘off the shelf “solutions”’ to environmental problems ‘undermine indigenous knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132511431410">Jones, 2008</xref>: 675). It also rescales the temporal dimensions of environmental research, highlighting the past resilience and adaptiveness of Indigenous resource practices. In short, the ‘multiscalar spatiotemporal methodology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132511431410">Neumann, 2009</xref>: 404) of political ecology liberates analysis of Indigenous peoples from two stereotypes: one that their land management is regressive and unsustainable; the other that allegedly more informed or authoritative institutions should replace them in resource management.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding those alignments between political ecology and Indigenous geographies, there is reason for hesitancy about further engagement between them. Political ecologists claim that their analyses are relational, but they privilege hierarchical understandings of scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132511431410">Neumann, 2009</xref>). Consequently, they ‘assume that local socioecological actions and events are always derivative of extra-local economic and political structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132511431410">West, 2005</xref>: 633). Political ecologists sometimes depict Indigenous peoples as cultural impediments to the just distribution of resources (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132511431410">Watts, 2006</xref>). This failure to regard culture seriously leads to the undertheorizing of a principal research object – cultural resistance to neoliberal governance. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132511431410">Vadjunec et al. (2011</xref>) that Indigenous concerns which have accompanied neoliberal reform cannot be understood in isolation from associated identity shifts. This highlights the value of emergent work that combines lessons from Indigenous geographies with political ecology to bring together identity, culture and environment in cross-scale analysis.</p>
<p>Political ecologists’ critique of community sometimes suggests that Indigenous claims as to its importance be treated as false consciousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132511431410">Watts (2006</xref>: 103) assessed the political use of chieftainship, indigeneity and community in Nigeria, concluding that they are ‘imagined’ and violent. Communitarian discourses may protect economic interests and that demands analysis, but Watts’ universalizing disrespect for those Indigenes who organize themselves around the concept of community is ethnocentric. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132511431410">Pratt (2011</xref>) rebukes such analyses, even though she accepts the ‘complex community critique’ of political ecologists. Indeed, ‘indigenous communities are never the intimate and cohesive social units we anticipate’ (Pratt, forthcoming: 2). She maintains, however, that a fully materialist analysis of community should focus on its emergence and social construction in everyday practices rather than commence from pre-given social categories. Applying political ecology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132511431410">Urkidi (2011</xref>: 557) adopted a multiscalar analysis of the mining industry’s clashes with Indigenous activists in Guatemala, but her analysis extends to social mobilization and collective rights because ‘community is a basic organizational scale in the Maya world’. Rather than assuming that community is always ‘imagined’ and regressive, there is need for further research into how community, customary use and shared commons motivate resistance to neoliberalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132511431410">Renfrew, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132511431410">Zimmerer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In acknowledging the agency of nature, political ecologists reject binary constructs of culture and nature, and create what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132511431410">Panelli (2010</xref>: 79) labels ‘more-than-human geographies’. That corresponds with Indigenous claims that nature is sentient, but not all Indigenous understandings fit easily with political ecology. When the integration of Indigenous knowledge into state conservation practices leads to conflict, political ecologists presume competing epistemologies and means of valuing the environment. They accept, therefore, a profane ‘“multiculturalist” understanding that we exist in a power-laden world of one nature and many culturally situated perspectives of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132511431410">Blaser, 2009</xref>: 11). Blaser proposes instead a ‘multinaturalist’ ontology in which Indigenous peoples and colonizing others are actors whose worlds are often different. Paraguay’s Yshiro hunters did not contravene wilfully the maximum sustainable catch limits for game which had been negotiated with outside interests. Rather, they believed those limits were irrelevant because, <italic>in their world</italic>, the health of resource stocks is embedded in human-animal relationships of a personal nature, and is not a function of hunting pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132511431410">Blaser, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132511431410">Sletto (2011</xref>: 203) applied political ecology to fire management conflicts among conservation authorities and the Pemon of Venezuela, but he needed to surpass its conventional outlook because fire ‘embodies qualities akin to a trickster’ and must be understood ‘in spiritual terms’. Although grounded in political ecology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132511431410">Scales (2011</xref>) needed to engage with Sakalava cosmology to interpret the failure of Madagascan conservation policies and their reliance on alternative income generation. It was not just that alternative income strategies naturalized an economistic understanding of forests and inserted the Sakalava into global capitalist relations, but also that their understanding of forest evil and taboos entrenched competing rationalities of behaviour. Those findings mirror West’s (2005: 639) earlier critiques in which she contrasted forest use in Papua New Guinea with political ecologists’ ‘rush to show how external structures affect local socioecological lives’. Challenging any expectation that outside influences drive forest use by Gimi-speaking peoples, they manage resources under the logic that prey can have their own customs, are the ‘embodied ancestors’ of hunters and that both share knowingly in a social relationship of exchange (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132511431410">Nadasdy, 2007</xref>). Although political ecologists claim unique perception of nature’s agency, it is unclear whether they will accede to the possibility of ontological difference and multinaturalism. However, recent acceptance of ‘multi-dimensional subjectivities’ in feminist approaches to political ecology suggest that it is extensible in that direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132511431410">Elmhirst, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>III Land claims and the reconfiguration of environmental governance</title>
<p>Many geographers participate in deliberative processes for settling Indigenous land claims. Where such mechanisms are embryonic, co-management of public lands is the common outcome of negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132511431410">McGregor, 2011</xref>). If an institutional structure for retitling contested lands has been developed, there is greater experimentation with transferring land into Indigenous administration. Native title, Indigenous Land Use Agreements or combinations of both now cover 23% of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132511431410">NNTT, 2011</xref>). Reterritorialization is most pronounced in Brazil where ‘over one million km<sup>2</sup> of protected indigenous lands already exist, serving as a barrier to … deforestation and … also promot[ing] cultural survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132511431410">Vadjunec et al., 2011</xref>: 6). Despite an escalating number of settlements, Indigenous claimants often maintain that community aspirations have not been addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511431410">Booth and Skelton, 2011</xref>). We structure our analysis of such discrepancies around three commonly asserted obstacles to claims settlement: transactional costs; limits to communicative rationality; and ontological pluralism. All are noteworthy, but we conclude that understanding discontent with the settlement process requires more radical interpretations than a focus on procedural inadequacies in deliberative mechanisms.</p>
<p>The negotiation process for claims settlement is itself a barrier to Indigenous aspirations, but explanations based in <italic>transactional costs</italic> are simplistic. The protracted establishment of institutions to settle claims and effect co-management frustrates Indigenous claimants, especially in Canada where it required costly legal action and evolution in public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132511431410">McGregor, 2011</xref>). In Australia, the scale of the disputed land area complicates the award of Native title, forcing claimants into bureaucratic negotiations with stakeholders who operate at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132511431410">Howitt, 2009</xref>). The environments which are implicated in co-management are often complex or subject to rapid change, so there can be no surprise that collaborations involving Indigenous peoples of the Arctic are difficult to negotiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132511431410">Nicol, 2010</xref>). Deficiencies in process also undermine negotiations, as is the case when institutional failure to accept Indigenous diversity leads to difficulties coping with overlapping claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132511431410">Carter, 2010</xref>). The disappointing outcomes of claims settlement are also attributed to such capacity and intercultural dilemmas as language barriers, the cost of requisite human resources and the pitting of community volunteers against state employees during negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132511431410">Hill, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132511431410">Pickerill, 2009</xref>). The resourcing of Indigenous governance <italic>after</italic> claims settlement is uncertain, so claimant organizations confront a difficult transition from institution-of-struggle to institution-of-governance.</p>
<p>Those explanations are valid, but they overemphasize the influence of resources, underestimate the skill of Indigenous negotiators and fail to reference Indigenous motivations. Responding to a state tactic which focuses attention to (co-)management rather than land ownership, Indigenous negotiators are often more concerned about what is proscribed from deliberations than they are about their capacity to participate in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132511431410">Kepe, 2008</xref>). Procedural accounts of deliberation muddle cause and effect, focusing on the differential capacities of negotiating parties rather than the processes which create those differences. Consequently, a focus on transactional costs reinstates a technocratic vision for environmental management in which decent collaboration is considered achievable though simple ‘design concepts’ and ‘practical tools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132511431410">Hill, 2011</xref>: 82, 83).</p>
<p>Habermas’ <italic>communicative rationality</italic> and particularly his attention to power-neutral forums for ideal speech have been central to the design and appraisal of co-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132511431410">Takeda and Ropke, 2010</xref>). However, critiques of communicative rationality which have emerged elsewhere in the policy sciences are seldom applied to Indigenous-state negotiations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132511431410">Bond, 2011</xref>). The context and forums in which Indigenous rights are negotiated likely condition the possibility for cross-cultural dialogue. For instance, sunset clauses and national deadlines for claims settlement overshadow negotiations, leading to interparty suspicion and a shift from reconciling values to assessing compensation. Theories of communicative rationality reveal why state officials and Indigenous negotiators both come into conflict with third parties. Land claims commonly intersect with the biodiversity hotspots that recreational, tourism or environmental interests most want to protect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132511431410">Pieck and Moog, 2009</xref>). In that context, deliberative forums for deciding tenure or co-management become means for states and other parties to contest Indigenous rights or to reassert elite notions of entitlement.</p>
<p>Despite those insights into the external pressures on settlement processes, theories of communicative rationality suffer from weaknesses which have been identified in collaboration itself. They fail to account for power relations and overstate the likelihood of consensus. In the case of drawn-out negotiations between the Haida Gwaii and the Canadian government, ‘the consensus-seeking forum was constrained by the broader institutional and political structures [in] which it remained firmly embedded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132511431410">Takeda and Ropke, 2010</xref>: 187). It is ahistorical to suggest that those on either side of the colonial encounter, who have seldom rehearsed open negotiation in the past, will come together for one moment and resolve their differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132511431410">Sowman et al., 2011</xref>). Dialogue must be frequent, meaningful and long-standing for suspicions about its purpose to subside; it cannot be contrived. Even the most carefully designed forum is unlikely of itself to generate ideal speech because it will not overcome the weight of colonial history. <italic>How</italic> issues are discussed is important, but less than <italic>whether</italic> the main concerns of Indigenous peoples will be discussed at all.</p>
<p>Failure to recognize and incorporate<italic> ontological pluralism</italic> explains the tendency for negotiations to omit such key concerns as land ownership. Although proclaimed as a holistic solution to Indigenous rights in places of high ecological value, co-management often serves as a platform for the biocentric agendas of third parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132511431410">Kepe, 2008</xref>). Inherent dualisms within conventional management approaches – nature/culture, managers/owners, and protection/use – remain unquestioned in the assumption that all parties share the same biocentric objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132511431410">Howitt and Suchet-Pearson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132511431410">Schmidt and Dowsley, 2010</xref>). Yet, framing the natural world as an environment-to-be-managed is incongruous for some Indigenous peoples and such misrepresentations of co-management lead to disregard of Indigenous priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132511431410">Stevenson, 2006</xref>). Indigenous negotiators become frustrated or feel co-opted when they discover that the remediation of environmental legacies from colonial development triumphs over their expectations for self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511431410">Coombes, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511431410">Booth and Skelton (2011</xref>: 370) conclude, ‘co-management usually requires First Nations to conform to nonnative management structures, might not incorporate First Nation values, or might not recognize constitutionally guaranteed title and rights, and perpetuates submission to a dominant culture’. This bias towards preservationism and managerialism explains why <italic>diminished</italic> opportunities for development and <italic>increasing</italic> conflict follow negotiation of co-management in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132511431410">Kepe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132511431410">Ntshona et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The ontological differences which produce competing aspirations in co-management are likely to become more pronounced as environmental crises attain greater public notice. Recognition of ecological complexity has unsettled scientific privilege, validating application of plural knowledges in decision-making. Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132511431410">Berkes (2009</xref>) seeks a repositioning of co-management as a flexible institution for addressing environmental uncertainty. He also celebrates a shift in co-management from ‘a two-link relationship between the government and local (or indigenous) resource users’ towards a model which ‘regards multiple linkages and … networks as the essence of co-management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132511431410">Berkes, 2010</xref>: 493). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511431410">Armitage et al. (2011</xref>) want co-management to become a feedback and learning mechanism so it will co-produce the knowledges that are required for adaptive management. Specifically, they note co-management’s potential for drawing ‘a plurality of knowledge sources’ into environmental management (p. 996) so that ‘communities and hunters, scientists and managers can respond quickly enough to emergent system changes’ (p. 1003). Those who call for such reforms fail to disclose that their case studies of good governance for uncertain times were established to implement the proven rights of Indigenous groups, or that inclusion of more knowledge producers may disenfranchise the original claimants. Universal inclusion will accentuate an existing problem in co-management: the reduction of special Indigenous or Treaty rights to general stakeholding interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132511431410">Singleton, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Champions of adaptive (co-)management seem unaware that their new goals are both bio- and ethnocentric. Studies of collaboration in the Arctic highlight Indigenous resistance to the idea that climate change will decrease polar bear stocks because that would treat revered, sentient animals as passive agents in their own destiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132511431410">Schmidt and Dowsley, 2010</xref>). The new emphasis on managing volatile ecosystems is a continuation of old biases towards preserving wild biota. The goal of adaptively (co-)managing the effects of climate change and ecosystem collapse privileges timeframes which poor and hungry Aborigines cannot afford to prioritize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132511431410">Petheram et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, repurposing co-management as flexible decision-making which adapts to ecosystem vagaries or the whims of multiple stakeholders may jeopardize hard-won victories of the past. Those who have experienced the rough hand of colonization will likely prefer the continued legalization of their rights over open-ended processes – precisely because that is less subject to others’ demands for or anxieties about change.</p>

<title>IV Propertization and Indigenous resources</title>
<p>The ethnographic traditions in the discipline’s past work with Indigenous peoples focused on customary land and its repatriation. Recently, however, a more critical and self-reflexive view of Indigenous propertization and the contributions of geographers to that process has emerged. With a renewed emphasis on tenure reform to deliver or barter acceptance for public policy, title and property have become more central to Indigenous politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132511431410">Holmes, 2011</xref>). Forced to confront a history of <italic>terra nullius</italic> assumptions, it is not surprising that Indigenous peoples vigorously assert title to their former lands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511431410">Bhandar, 2011</xref>). Many frame their interests in proprietorial terms because their cultural objections to neo/colonialism are unheard within a political context that champions property as the harbinger of social good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132511431410">Blackburn, 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, propertization of Indigenous causes threatens to displace the cultural motivations upon which they are based. As property should be considered a social construct and a process rather than a suite of material objects, it will always be more-than-economic in its constitution, and its enactment or reconfiguration will impact on socio-cultural values.</p>
<p>Constructive approaches to theorizing the Indigenous fixation with property accompany recognition that some notions of customary title are compatible with neoliberal concepts of <italic>private</italic> property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132511431410">McCormack, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132511431410">MacDonald, 2011</xref>). Until recently, geographers disregarded those associations, doubtless reflecting their fervid endorsement of Indigenous causes but also because they romanticize communal ownership as a basis for sustainable resource use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511431410">Adam, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132511431410">McCormack (2010</xref>: 26) attributes this to ‘the tendency to essentialize traditional ownership as communal and traditional exchange as idealized gift-giving … the antithesis of a possessive individual model’. However, the unchallenged status of property as a desirable outcome of claims-making also reflects the advent of ‘neoliberal multiculturalism’ in which Indigenous confrontation of the state has given way to a more limited pursuit of cultural recognition and property rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511431410">Hale, 2011</xref>: 206).</p>
<p>The intersection of customary tenure and neoliberalism is sometimes palpable. In Alaska, land claims legislation transfers large areas of the public estate into Aboriginal ownership, weakening policy restraints on oil extraction to generate ‘an era when the public domain is increasingly privatized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132511431410">Ganapathy, 2011</xref>: 114). Elsewhere, the complicity of neoliberalism in Indigenous propertization is cloaked in proclamations about a new era of appropriate development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511431410">Bebbington and Bebbington (2011</xref>) confirm the emergence of a policy orthodoxy in South America in which it is assumed that affirmation of Native title will protect Indigenous peoples from resource extractive industries. They prove that, rather than creating post-neoliberal utopia, the new orthodoxy alienated Indigenes from strategic resources, often to a greater extent than in countries where there are no processes for affirming Native title. Geographers’ questioning of propertization accompanies post hoc recognition that their enthusiasm for claims settlement promotes the expansion of property without recognition of its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511431410">Bryan, 2009</xref>). Extension of property to new scales and objects which range from genomic traits to knowledge systems is concomitant with concern about the commodification of Indigenous knowledge (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132511431410">Robinson, 2010</xref>). Most academic scholarship has focused on the transformative potential in this expansion of property for Indigenous cultures, but unease about Indigenous use of proprietorial discourses also warrants analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132511431410">Wainwright and Bryan (2009</xref>: 154) witness in Indigenous activism ‘a shift towards conceiving of rights to land in terms of property’. They highlight the emergence of a cartographic-legal strategy wherein public participatory GIS translates evidence of customary use into legal entitlements. Significantly, the culmination of that strategy in property allocation can be at the expense of rival interests – Black, financially poor Hispanic peoples and, revealingly, other Mesoamericans who claim to be Indigenous (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132511431410">Hale, 2006</xref>). Evaluating discourses of customary tenure in Indonesia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511431410">Adam (2010</xref>: 415) notes their awkward relevance to and malleability in post-conflict scenarios where they serve ‘as a tool of ethno-territorialization’ to block the return of displaced peoples. The exclusionary potential of proprietorial claims, the Cartesian simplicity of GIS and the unquestioned authority of those who inform it displace alternative claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511431410">Bryan, 2009</xref>). Likewise, far from rejecting the extension of property in such neoliberal approaches as market-based instruments, some Indigenous groups have used them to convert complex associations with resources into newly marketable commodities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132511431410">MacDonald, 2011</xref>). Some tribes have welcomed the commoditization of their interests as quota in quota-management systems for fisheries, and have used the power which flows from their new assets to displace the fishing interests of other Indigenous groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132511431410">McCormack, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because it is a social process rather than a linear procedure, Indigenous groups will not always control the outcomes of propertization. First, the award of title must conform with western legal precedents which are intolerant of overlapping interests, so confirmation of territory is fractious and may lead to disruptive competition between tribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132511431410">Larson, 2010</xref>). Suggesting that there is a complex scale politics to those disputes, the emphasis on <italic>collective</italic> ownership in retitling practices has enabled some tribal conglomerates to dispossess Indigenous families of land they have occupied for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132511431410">Li, 2010</xref>). Moreover, propertization often miscarries, leading to a ‘restricted economy of owning, knowing and being’ where Indigenous groups may own land, and even have their ecological knowledge about it revered, but they cannot use it gainfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511431410">Bhandar, 2011</xref>: 229). The Mayan communities of Wainwright and Bryan’s (2009) studies were initially motivated to pursue self-determination, but their maps of Indigenous use and subsequent land titles made them visible and governable. Hence, by ‘recognizing and valorizing certain indigenous … relations with land as property … these relationships are constrained. Such recognition reinforces state power and deepens capitalist social relations’ (p. 169).</p>
<p>Reterritorialization may lead to withdrawal of state services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511431410">Hale (2011</xref>:189) connects Indigenous propertization to the neoliberal strategies of Mesoamerican states which ‘abandoned pretensions of national territorial encompassment, adopting instead a spatially differentiated logic that directs resources … towards certain economically favoured areas’. Renowned sites for reclaiming Indigenous territory are correlated with places from whence the state has withdrawn, problematizing social well-being in isolated communities which are expensive to service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511431410">Hale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132511431410">MacDonald, 2011</xref>). Besides, propertization rarely secures unambiguous titles. Claims to ownership of coastal environments are often translated into customary (use) rights and not customary tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132511431410">Yunupingu and Muller, 2009</xref>). Maori advocacy to investigate title to the foreshore and seabed resulted in modest customary use rights which will be awarded only for ‘substantially uninterrupted’ cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132511431410">Bess, 2011</xref>). Colonization leaves few practices uninterrupted, and what remains may not be useful in modern economic contexts.</p>
<p>On the one hand, attempts to frame the interests of Indigenous peoples as property may jeopardize long-term political strategies by providing the state with reason to translate contested titles and claims as citizenship rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132511431410">Blackburn, 2009</xref>). On the other, the quest for property creates ‘a subject of aboriginal rights who remains caught within the pre-history of the sovereign nation state’ – a subject who is propertied but in a way which could only have been useful in pre-modern economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511431410">Bhandar, 2011</xref>: 235). Revealingly, this is the antithesis of the ‘development with identity’ rhetoric which was used to promote neoliberal multiculturalism and Indigenous propertization in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511431410">Hale, 2011</xref>). Confirming that propertization is paradoxical, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132511431410">Bolaños (2011</xref>) proves that Indigenous claims often flounder at the first hurdle – proving customary use – because those uses are deemed inauthentic. With invalidation of claims, frontier colonization progresses more rapidly and with greater impact on Indigenous communities. Those trajectories are not ineluctable, and property claims open rights-making scenarios which are not otherwise available. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for more research into the unquestioned status of property as the end-point for Indigenous activism, and into the relationships between advanced neoliberalism and rights-making.</p>

<title>V Conclusion</title>
<p>Geography’s engagement with indigeneity refocuses disciplinary practices and develops novel forms of research, all resulting in new ethical challenges. Research on Indigenous environmental rights has inspired more rigorous discussion of indigeneity in the context of multilevel processes. Engagement with political ecology is particularly germane to that discussion because it illuminates the scale of threats to Indigenous self-determination. Geographical practice must extend beyond the tired conflation of Indigenous and local, and towards analysis of the broader discursive and political implications of environmental activism. Indigenous principles of guardianship inform distinctive approaches to environmental governance and challenge assumptions of state-centred management, but they also promote meditation on the ethical foundations for better human-nature relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132511431410">Muir et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, Indigenous peoples’ material concerns about the connections between resource alienation and poverty, the effect of resource depletion on cultural practices or the barriers to Indigenous participation in resource management demand revision of disciplinary priorities.</p>
<p>Indigenous motivations in environmental disputes are connected to broader projects of recognition, reclamation of sovereignty and resistance to northern capitalism; they are not mere resource conflicts. Persistent Indigenous claims about the multifaceted constitution of their resource rights should compel geographers to reconsider their often idealized concepts of local autonomy, participatory development and social justice. As those concepts have influenced land-use agreements, co-management and reterritorialization, we urge for more research into the consequences of formal arrangements for implementing Indigenous rights. As geographers who work primarily with and for Indigenous communities, we recognize how fraught that research can be, but the discipline can no longer avoid its responsibilities.</p>
