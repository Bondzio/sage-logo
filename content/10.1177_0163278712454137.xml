<abstract>
<p>The cultural competence of health professionals affects the satisfaction with, and outcomes of, patient care. Patient-centered cultural training was implemented with 76 trainees. Four months later, they were assessed using standardized patient scenarios and their performance compared to a control group. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the training. Assessment scores were analyzed using <italic>t</italic> tests to compare groups. Interrater reliability was calculated for individual scenarios. The cultural training received positive evaluations with many trainees indicating their intention to change future practice. Those who received cultural training gained higher scores upon assessment than those who had not. This difference was significant for three scenarios with nonclinical evaluators. Interrater reliability ranged from .913 to .427. The significant difference in performance between the groups supports the validity and educational impact of this approach. However, variable reliability highlights the difficulties with developing robust assessments in this area that are feasible within resource constraints.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In reflection of an increasingly diverse society, and a better understanding of the health inequalities across a range of minority groups, the pressure on those responsible for the delivery of health professions’ curricula to ensure the cultural competence of future practitioners has intensified significantly over the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712454137">Crandall, George, Marion, &amp; Davis, 2003</xref>). Driven by a growing body of evidence that the provision of culturally sensitive care can improve health outcomes and patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163278712454137">Brach &amp; Fraser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712454137">Way, Stone, Schwager, Wagoner, &amp; Bassman, 2002</xref>), and the need to train health professionals with the ability to provide quality care for a diverse population, statutory/accreditation bodies and government agencies worldwide now require cultural competence to be addressed within education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163278712454137">Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712454137">General Medical Council, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712454137">Liaison Committee on Medical Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite an expanding resource of published work in this area, educationalists still have much to learn and agree upon regarding the most effective design, delivery, implementation, and evaluation of this important subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163278712454137">Beach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712454137">Price et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, majority of studies describe the development and evaluation of training interventions, and a recurrent theme is the lack of agreed terminology and/or a definition regarding what constitutes “cultural competence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712454137">Seelman, Suurmond, &amp; Stronks, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Initial concerns over the fragmented nature and heterogeneity of early cultural competence training interventions have led to the publication of a number of frameworks, including examples where the training is grounded in communication theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712454137">Crandall et al., 2003</xref>), promotes reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712454137">Seelman et al., 2009</xref>), and those taking a patient-centered approach to training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163278712454137">Betancourt, 2006</xref>). In parallel, some authors have published conceptual analyses of cultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454137">Betancourt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712454137">Kumagai &amp; Lypson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712454137">Seelman et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454137">Betancourt (2003)</xref> identified cultural competence education as consisting of three conceptual approaches focusing on attitudes (cultural sensitivity/awareness), knowledge (multicultural/categorical education), and skills (cross cultural training). He noted that cultural competence requires the successful integration and application of these three concepts, a.k.a the “three-legged stool,” suggesting that the absence of one or more of these concepts in the individual would result in limitations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712454137">Kumagai and Lypson (2009)</xref> describe this further, suggesting that the concept of cultural competence should stretch beyond the traditional notions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward a “critical consciousness” of the self, others, and the world and a commitment to addressing issues of societal relevance in health care. Both authors describe a concept that is both cognitive and affective, and discuss the challenges associated with developing effective curricula in this area.</p>
<p>In this respect, the challenges facing educators around cultural competence share similarities to those existing within health professions education for “professionalism.” Indeed, in many curricula, cultural competence may be described within the wider domain of professionalism. It is well documented within the literature on both professionalism and cultural competence that such attributes (and/or attitudes) are more difficult to address in both training and subsequent assessment than perhaps technical skills or knowledge. Indeed, the more stable the attribute within an individuals’ personality, the more difficult it may be to affect (especially long term) with training. Attempts to change attitudes tend to focus on patient-centered methods that, through discourse, promote self-reflection of the practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454137">Betancourt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712454137">Crandall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712454137">Kumagai &amp; Lypson, 2009</xref>). Resistance to self-reflection and practitioners’ feelings of anxiety or threat when faced with the possibility that they may be [perceived as] biased are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163278712454137">Chun, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712454137">Roberts, Sanders, &amp; Wass, 2008</xref>). Similarly, there are challenges associated with the assessment of attitudes. In particular, an individuals’ attitude toward cultural issues may be easily affected by social desirability bias and as such prove most challenging to assess in a valid manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454137">Betancourt, 2003</xref>). In other words, it is difficult to move assessments of such constructs beyond the “shows how” level of Millers’ pyramid to the highest level “does” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712454137">Miller, 1990</xref>). Clearly, this will have a dramatic affect on the predictive validity of the assessment.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this study outlines the development of the first cultural competency framework for postgraduate dental education in the United Kingdom. A pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient-centered cultural competence training program using assessment involving an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) with standardized patients is described, our hypothesis being that the group which had cultural competence training would perform better during cultural competence standardized patient scenarios (4 months posttraining) than practitioners who had received no cultural competence training (but had the same amount of patient contact).</p>

<title>Context of the Study</title>
<p>A cultural competence framework for postgraduate Vocational Dental Practitioners (VDPs) was identified following a review of the available literature and guidance regarding equality and diversity (government policy, documents from public bodies, support organizations, charities, and legislation). The framework was validated in consultation with stakeholder groups, using questionnaires and focus groups involving dental practitioners and representatives from the six strands of equality and diversity referred to by Scottish Government policy—gender, sexual orientation, age, race, religion, and disability. The final cultural competence framework was presented as a matrix, which triangulated the areas “Race,” “Religion,” “Sexual Orientation,” “Gender,” “Age,” “Disability,” and “Other” (incorporating individuals from socially deprived areas, etc.)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163278712454137">1</xref>
</sup> with the themes <italic>Understanding individuals/negative assumptions</italic>, <italic>Language and communication</italic>, <italic>Courtesy and respect</italic>, <italic>Avoiding discrimination</italic>, <italic>Clinical issues</italic>, <italic>Leadership and management</italic>, <italic>Access</italic>, and <italic>Legislation</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163278712454137">2</xref>
</sup> The framework identified areas of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes that are desirable, and it was used primarily as a blueprint for the training intervention, and subsequently for the development of the cases for assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0163278712454137">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Seventy-six VDPs from the West of Scotland who attended were subject to the cultural competence training intervention and were assessed 3 months later. The negative control group, 15 VDPs from the North of Scotland, were assessed using the same cases (and where possible the same evaluators) having undergone no prior training in cultural competence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0163278712454137">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The training was developed and facilitated by educationalists in collaboration with senior dental educators (who are also qualified dentists) using the cultural competencies as a template for content, and consideration of appropriate learning theory to determine optimum format. The training consisted of 0.5 days introduction during their first week of training (August 2008—mostly didactic involving all students together, with some video clips to stimulate discussion), followed by 1 day in December. This (second) training session involved small groups (10–15 VDPs) rotating round several workshops (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0163278712454137">Table 1</xref>), each delivered by either members of stakeholder groups giving their personal stories to stimulate discussion and reflection, or actors in role-play around a relevant theme. Individuals delivering the training in workshops were asked to keep the context within dental practice as much as possible. All workshops were evaluated with anonymized questionnaires completed by VDPs before leaving the session. The questionnaires included items requesting agreement with statements against a standard rating scale, in addition to the use of open questions to provide qualitative information.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the impact of the cultural competence training, a static group comparison study design was used. Groups were identified on the basis of convenience (location). VDPs were assessed using actors as standardized patients across four cases in an OSCE format. These cases were (1) a female patient (wheelchair user) with communication difficulties (as a result of a stroke) attends the dentist with her carer, (2) inappropriate remarks regarding sexual orientation are made by the dental nurse in front of a patient causing offense, (3) a male with Asperger’s syndrome attends the dental practice for the first time, and (4) a patient of the Church of the Latter Day Saints faith is concerned about anesthetic. All cases were validated by dental practitioners and cultural experts using a modified Delphi process to check accuracy and appropriate content. VDPs’ performance was observed in each case by two evaluators (a dentist and a nondentist) and scored against relevant global criteria using a 10-point (interval) ratings scale with category descriptors (1–3 = <italic>needs improvement</italic> and 4–10 ranging from <italic>satisfactory</italic> to <italic>excellent</italic>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163278712454137">3</xref>
</sup> The global criteria included relevant themes from the cultural competence framework (such as <italic>language and communication</italic> and <italic>courtesy and respect</italic>) in addition to other issues relevant to the case whether generic (e.g., <italic>empathy</italic>) or specific knowledge/actions (e.g., alternatives to adrenalin-based products). A detailed scoring rubric, describing the types of behaviors, attributes, or other performance characteristics associated with the lowest (<italic>need improvement</italic>), or highest (<italic>excellent</italic>) ratings against each of the global criteria for the case, was provided for each case.</p>
<p>The same nonclinical evaluators were used for both groups, with the exception of Case 1 which had a different nonclinical evaluator (due to illness). Different clinical evaluators were used for the control group due to geographical constraints; however, these were dental advisers in each case. A short training session was provided for all evaluators in advance of the OSCE. Subjects could not be blinded due to geographical constraints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0163278712454137">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Overall mean scores were calculated for each VDP across all four cases, and the groups were compared using a <italic>t</italic> test. For each case, data were analyzed using the scores from both evaluators (clinical and nonclinical—a mean of both <italic>overall</italic> scores) and also the mean score from the nonclinical evaluator alone. This was due to the fact that different clinical evaluators had to be used for the two groups, whereas the same nonclinical evaluators were used to observe the performance of both groups (with the exception of Case 1). Interrater agreement was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation. Differences in scores were tested using <italic>t</italic> tests. All analyses were performed using statistical package for social sciences.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-0163278712454137">
<title>Workshop Evaluations</title>
<p>Each VDP (and dental advisers attending) were asked to complete an evaluation form for all 8 workshops, resulting in approximately 650 evaluations. These evaluations asked participants to rate workshops against several criteria, including relevance, usefulness, and how much they had learned (all on a scale from 1 to 6 where 1 represented the most positive rating, e.g., <italic>extremely useful</italic> and 6 represented the most negative response, e.g., <italic>not at all useful</italic>), and whether they intended to change practice as a result of the training. Evaluation results were much more positive than expected (considering the usual barriers associated with equality and diversity training), with almost all mean ratings for all evaluation criteria being on the positive half of the scale (i.e., &lt;3.5). The workshop carried out by the Good Life Group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0163278712454137">Table 1</xref>) was especially well received. Most importantly, many trainees indicated their intention to change practice as a result of the training, particularly following the workshops delivered by stakeholders (30–50% participants). In addition, many of those who did not intend to change their practice indicated that this was because they considered themselves already to be performing to a high standard.</p>

<sec id="section10-0163278712454137">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0163278712454137">Table 2</xref>. Considering the data from the nonclinical evaluators only (as these were consistent for the two groups), the VDPs who had attended the cultural competence training performed significantly better than those who had received no cultural competence training in three of the four cases (Cases 1, 3, and 4). While a positive difference in the performance of the intervention group (in comparison to the control group) was also evident for Case 2, these data were not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .146). Similarly, when considering the mean score from both evaluators, the performance of the VDPs who had received the cultural competence training on Cases 3 and 4 was still significantly better than that of the control group without training (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .1), although the difference observed on Cases 1 and 2 was less and not significant (<italic>d</italic> = .53, <italic>p</italic> = .104 and <italic>d</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> = .482, respectively).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Formal cultural competence training for health professionals remains a relatively new concept in the United Kingdom. In this study, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of cultural competence training and assessment for postgraduate dental practitioners, with promising results.</p>
<p>Despite experiencing many of the challenges associated with the delivery of training in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712454137">Roberts et al., 2008</xref>) such as prior concerns from both trainees and dental advisers that this <italic>reinvented diversity training</italic> represents <italic>political correctness gone mad</italic>, or trying to <italic>teach common sense</italic>, the cultural competence workshops were very positively received by the majority. Didactic sessions (such as the half-day introduction) were less well received, but it appeared that the use of stakeholders themselves to deliver workshops to small groups, helped discussion and reflection to the point where many trainees declared their intention to change practice as a result of the session. Although generally still well received with positive evaluations, the workshops involving actors and role-play to stimulate discussion appeared to have less impact, adding further support for the validity of using stakeholders to deliver training. However, care should be taken not to “pigeonhole” stakeholder groups, making sure that trainees understand that an individuals’ perspective may not be generalizable. Similarly, the training should avoid an approach that may inadvertently encourage “othering,” that is, learning about groups that are “different” rather than the focus being on the trainees’ recognition of their own implicit biases. When considering the need for the integration of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in order to ensure cultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712454137">Betancourt, 2003</xref>), this approach to training may help increase the educational impact and increase the likelihood that any affects are targeted toward the highest level of Millers’ pyramid, that is, what the practitioner “does” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712454137">Miller, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Results from the group comparison suggested a positive educational impact on the “trained” group 4 months posttraining. However, while a positive difference was evident for all standardized patient cases within the OSCE, this was significant for only Cases 3 and 4 (when considering scores from both evaluators). A significant difference between the two groups was also achieved for Case 1 if the scores from only nonclinical evaluators (the same individuals being used to evaluate both groups) were considered. It is difficult to know whether the lack of a significant difference for Case 2 indicates a problem with the training in this area (dealing with inappropriate remarks on sexual orientation made by the dental nurse in front of a patient), or with the assessment itself. A debrief session with trainees revealed that they thought this case lacked validity in as much that in real practice they would have a close working relationship with their dental nurse and would know better how to deal with such an event, whereas the actor playing the dental nurse was a stranger.</p>
<p>The interrater reliability of the standardized patient cases was variable, ranging from <italic>R</italic>(15) = .913, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (Case 4, Control group) to <italic>R</italic>(15) = .427, <italic>p</italic> = .112 (Case 2, Control Group). Also, there was little consistency in reliability between groups within Cases 1 and 2. This may indicate that further training for evaluators is required, beyond our briefing on the process and discussion around the scoring rubrics. Training may be particularly important around the judgment of constructs which are difficult to define, such as many of the relevant attitudes pertinent to the delivery of culturally competent care around professionalism.</p>
<p>These results highlight some of the challenges facing educators regarding the development, and interpretation, of assessment for cultural competence. Given the diversity among practitioners themselves, the identification of suitable cases that could be implemented in a standardized manner across the whole group was difficult. For example, issues that may concern some Muslim females such as preference for a female practitioner if available, or attendance with a chaperone, may be considered differently by practitioners depending on their own gender, and perhaps their own religious beliefs. Similarly, a scenario involving racial discrimination may be considered differently by practitioners of the same race. This interpretation however, also underestimates the complexity of cultural competence. In reality, culture is linked to an individuals’ identity and this will be different for every practitioner and patient. Where appropriate subject matter <italic>can</italic> be found for cases, there are further challenges around developing scoring rubrics and descriptors for attitudinal elements of performance, in particular the more stable traits such as “empathy,” “compassion,” and “altruism.” Evaluators’ judgments on the observed performance of such traits may vary according to their own interpretation of the construct. For example, one person’s sincere empathy may appear “over the top” or patronizing to another. Also, where changes in such attitudinal aspects do occur, these may be smaller (in the measurement sense) and less obvious to an observer than changes in performance of practical skills or knowledge, as suggested by other workplace-based performance assessments of more stable constructs such as “professionalism” and “insight” over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712454137">Prescott-Clements, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712454137">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This study involving the design, implementation, and evaluation of cultural competence training and assessment for postgraduate dental practitioners in the United Kingdom has elicited some interesting results. It is extremely encouraging that both detailed course evaluations and the group comparison research suggest that many elements of this training were not only enjoyable, but effective in improving performance even after a number of months.</p>
<p>Other results from the study highlight the many challenges involved in assessing a construct that is a complex combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Without the necessary attitudes and intrinsic motivation for the provision of culturally competent care for all patients, the knowledge and skills learned are unlikely to be used in everyday practice. However, as with other complex areas of competence such as professionalism, we still need to strive for assessment processes with high utility.</p>
<p>There are some limitations with our study. First, it would have been better if we could have used the same clinical evaluators for each group, but unfortunately this was not possible for practical reasons. Similarly, the subjects could not be blinded; therefore, the assessment was at risk of bias. Second, the groups were selected on the basis of convenience as they could not be selected at random. Even though each group of trainees were all at the same stage in their training and have had similar prior experience, the lack of random selection may pose a threat to internal validity. While the subjects used within this study represented approximately half the VDPs in Scotland at that time, the generalizability of findings on a national scale (Scotland) should be considered with caution.</p>
