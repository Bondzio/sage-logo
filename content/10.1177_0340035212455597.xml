<abstract>
<p>The paper discusses the approaches to cataloguing carnival costume designs adopted by three institutions in Trinidad and Tobago. These institutions are the National Library and Information System Authority (NALIS), the Carnival Institute of Trinidad and Tobago (CITT) and the Alma Jordan Library, University of the West Indies. Catalogue records from these institutions were examined to determine the similarities and differences in the approaches as well as to highlight some of the issues encountered in cataloguing costume designs. The research shows that in addition to core elements found in metadata standards there are other data elements that the cataloguers have identified as being important for the documentation process including the relationship of the costume design to other pieces in the performance as well as the cultural context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Carnival is a pre-Lenten festival that has taken place in Trinidad and Tobago since the 18th century and has influenced similar festivals in the Caribbean and diasporic communities worldwide. Currently, after months of preparation, the festival culminates with two days of street parades throughout the islands. Each year, costumes on various themes are showcased during the parades and in many instances thrown away after use. This tendency to discard has made it difficult for institutions to comprehensively document the costumes designed annually. Despite the long history of carnival, the acquisition and archiving of carnival costume designs are spasmodic activities carried out by a few institutions in Trinidad and Tobago, including the National Library and Information System Authority (NALIS), the Carnival Institute of Trinidad and Tobago (CITT), and the Campus Libraries, University of the West Indies (UWI). These repositories have undertaken separate projects to describe the costume designs in their holdings; as a result, each project provides good case material to discuss the issues associated with cataloguing carnival costume designs. The approach adopted in this paper is to examine the records from these three institutions, paying particular attention to unique facets of information which are considered important for the description of carnival costume designs.</p>
<p>Carnival costumes are usually presented during the parades as a performance of one individual or in groups referred to as Carnival Bands.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0340035212455597">1</xref>
</sup> The size of a carnival band varies and in a medium to large carnival band one would expect a mixture of the following costume types during the presentation: Kings and Queens of the band, (these costumes are usually larger than the other costumes); Individuals, which refer to unique designs for a person in the band; Section Leaders, which describe the frontline costume leading a section during the performance; and Section Players, which are the common costumes worn by several persons. These designs can also be made specifically for male and female adults and children. Cataloguers interested in working with carnival designs are encouraged to learn about the structure of a carnival band and the order in which costumes are presented on stage because this knowledge allows one to assign user-friendly descriptors and to understand the relationship of one piece of costume to the entire performance.</p>
<p>Costume designs are available in various media; this is largely influenced by the advertising methods adopted by band leaders to market the bands. Within the three costume projects discussed in this paper, the earliest media available for consultation were design drawings or illustrated plates from 1956, with the bulk of the material being from 1965–2000. The designs were often created and illustrated by artists of national distinction such as Carlisle Chang and Wayne Berkeley, two artists whose works will be referred to extensively in this paper. These types of early carnival art are currently sought after by collectors and fetch favourable prices on the local art market. In the contemporary carnival environment bandleaders are using glossy handbills of models wearing costume prototypes, live stage shows and Internet services to entice the public to purchase costumes and participate in the parades. Each advertising medium used by the designers provides different challenges for cataloguers as it involves working with ephemera, photographs and original art. It therefore means that several cataloguing standards would have to be considered to create templates for costume descriptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0340035212455597">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>There are several standards available for cataloguing graphic materials, cultural items and works of art. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035212455597">
<italic>Anglo-American Cataloging Rules</italic> (1967)</xref> and its later edition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212455597">AACR2 (2005)</xref> are the early forerunners and have influenced the creation of other standards through their strengths, but more so through their weaknesses. In 1982 the Library of Congress published a separate set of rules entitled <italic>Graphic Materials</italic> which was meant to work in conjunction with the rules of AACR2 Chapter 8. The Introduction to <italic>Graphi</italic>c<italic> Materials</italic> states that
<disp-quote>
<p>“This manual not only augments the original rules found in Chapter 8, but it also departs from that base in several instances in an effort to meet the requirements for cataloging original and historical graphic materials.” (<italic>Graphic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0340035212455597">Materials 2002</xref>
</italic>)</p>
</disp-quote>
One intention of <italic>Graphic Materials</italic> is to provide enhanced guidelines for bibliographic description of original and historical resources by incorporating elements from the archival profession and expanding the idea of the “chief source” of information as articulated in AACR2. As prescribed in <italic>Graphic Materials,</italic> cataloguers can use additional documentation and reference text as sources for description since the items in hand oftentimes lack enough information for the bibliographic record. Even though <italic>Graphic Materials</italic> has improved the options for describing costume designs, it is recognized that costume designs by their nature are works of art, blueprints to works of art and museum pieces; consequently other standards like <italic>Categories for the Description</italic> <italic>of Works of Art</italic> <italic>(CDWA</italic>) and <italic>Cataloguing Cultural Objects (</italic>CCO<italic>)</italic> are needed to satisfy the requirements of some cultural institutions. This became more evident after perusing several online digital projects and the literature on costume designs.</p>
<p>Cataloguers have used the knowledge base of various communities along with metadata standards to create templates for costume projects and it is noted that institutions have categories of information specific to their needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0340035212455597">Bregman and Han (2010)</xref> revealed in their discussion of digital projects involving theatre, photography, and design collections of several institutions that the core metadata elements observed in a cross section of records were: title, description, subject, rights, relation, source, type and format. In the case of their project, which entailed making a design collection available online, it was necessary to expand the core fields listed above to 18 elements, including categories for performance history, production notes, associated people, and provenance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212455597">Goodrum and Martin (1999)</xref>, a Drexel University project on historical costume design conceived of an initial metadata template with 200 fields, along with data entry guidelines for each. They indicated that the design was influenced by the library, archive and museum professions; therefore the template accommodated data for Accession, Description and Additional documentation (including books articles, videos). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212455597">Castronovo (2010)</xref> also highlighted additional categories of information which were considered important in a Shubert Archive project. A category was created for problems identified with the design media, such as damaged paper; interestingly the cataloguing record also held research notes on the steps taken to identify costumes which were previously anonymous. Each of these projects shows that the descriptive tools can in no way be considered exhaustive and that more categories for description have to be considered at the local level.</p>
<p>The categories for description continue to evolve as attempts are made to anticipate the interest of future costume researchers and make the catalogue record satisfy these needs. The influence of researcher needs on the metadata output has been mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0340035212455597">King (2010)</xref>, who suggests that one expectation of this user group is that the metadata should be tailored to their subject needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212455597">Goodrum and Martin (1999)</xref> indicate that their metadata template was based on an assessment of user needs. To create custom type metadata, therefore, cataloguers have to ask themselves what type of information would the costume researcher require apart from the standard access points which are placed on a record? Studies on the information seeking behavior of visual and costume researchers have made attempts to specify these user needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0340035212455597">Hemming 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0340035212455597">Mason and Robinson 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0340035212455597">Jörgensen (1999)</xref> presented a model from her earlier research which suggests that visual researchers look for information in six broad areas: Text-based information (creator, title, period, nationality, technique and genre), Specific Object (size, location, texture, shape and orientation), Topical search (time location, event), Event searches, Affective (lighting, colour, emotion) and Conceptual (abstract, symbolic, thematic). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0340035212455597">Medaille (2009)</xref> pointed out in her research, which focused specifically on the searching behavior of theatre artists, that information is desired for six primary reasons, some of which are highlighted by Jörgensen’s research, but also include information for inspiration, career and historical research. How cataloguers are to realistically capture all these components in a record is an issue each institution undertaking the cataloguing of costume design has to determine in order to satisfy researchers’ information needs and at the same ensure expediency in the execution of the project.</p>
<p>Despite the multiplicity of tools available to cataloguers for describing collections or individual items, the cataloguing of costume designs has produced challenges for different organizations. The Theatre Library Association’s <italic>Documenting Costume Design</italic> (2010) highlights the projects from several institutions involved in managing these types of collections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212455597">Coco (2010)</xref>, who has an article in this volume, records one of the main challenges encountered during the cataloguing process at the Margaret Herrick Library as being the identification of the creator versus illustrator of works and assigning appropriate responsibility on the records. She also points out that in cases where designers use the talent of illustrators, cataloguers have to determine who gets primary responsibility for the work. Even when the designers are known, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0340035212455597">Goodrum and Martin (1999)</xref> suggest that finding authoritative sources for identifying the designer of a costume is challenging.</p>
<p>The anonymous designer on a costume design plate is an even greater challenge for cataloguers and costume researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212455597">Ferris (2009)</xref>, writing about carnival art, highlights the anonymity of costume designers in documentary sources as a major issue when conducting research in this area. She notes that in many publications where photographs of designs are reproduced, the names of the designers are omitted. In the cases of the Wayne Berkeley and Carlisle Chang collections held at NALIS and UWI respectively, the designers also functioned as illustrators and have also inscribed many of the design plates, thus the anonymity issue was not encountered. At the CITT, where there are designs from various sources, this issue is more apparent. To deal with this challenge as much provenance data as possible is gathered during the acquisition process in the hope that researchers can help identify the creator in the future. When the persons responsible for the designs are unknown, the carnival band as a corporate entity is assigned as the creator.</p>
<p>Another issue which presents a challenge is the subject indexing of costume designs and locating appropriate thesauri to assign headings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0340035212455597">Bregman and Han (2010)</xref> also discuss this, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212455597">Castronovo (2010)</xref> writes that “one of the most important and challenging aspects of metadata creation relates to names, subject headings and the thesaurus.” For the Shubert Archive project, Castronovo states that the archive staff, after considering several controlled vocabularies, decided to create and use local subject headings because of the scope of the collection. Other projects have employed multiple thesauri to capture the essence of the design elements; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0340035212455597">Zeng (1999)</xref> points out that “subject indexing for historical fashion items relies on more than one source of subject headings” to adequately describe the resource. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0340035212455597">Zeng (1999)</xref> notes that the Library of Congress headings provide a small list of general terms; some of which have also been reproduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0340035212455597">King (2010)</xref>. Other thesauri she discussed were: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0340035212455597">
<italic>The Thesaurus for Graphic Materials: I Subject Terms</italic> (1995)</xref> and the <italic>Vocabulary of Basic Terms for Cataloging Costume</italic> created by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0340035212455597">International Committee for Museums and Collections of Costumes (n.d.)</xref>. The availability of thesauri is an advantage to any cataloguing project; however costume designs produced in a localized environment like carnival oftentimes require descriptive terms specific to that resource, which may not be available in the international standards. Thus institutions have to invest some time in working on localized headings to be used for costume projects.</p>

<title>Approaches to cataloguing carnival costume designs</title>
<sec id="section4-0340035212455597">
<title>Wayne Berkeley collection at NALIS</title>
<p>NALIS has the largest collection of costume designs by the artist Wayne Berkeley, (1940–2011), who was one of the foremost designers of costumes in Trinidad and Tobago. The collection, according to the online description, “consists of original costume drawings of Wayne Berkeley from his ‘Mas’ producing career. It spans the period 1966–2000” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0340035212455597">Wayne Berkeley Collection</xref>). Wayne Berkeley began his design career in 1959 by producing stage sets; from 1965 he produced carnival bands almost annually and won the Band of the Year title twelve times.</p>
<p>In a catalogue of selected costume designs created during his career, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0340035212455597">Berkeley (1999)</xref> talks about his work and reproduced several images of his costume designs accompanied by brief descriptions. These descriptions are important in discussing the approaches to cataloguing costume designs since the work did not emanate from the library fraternity; it therefore presents data that the designer considers significant for researchers and the general reading audience. The entries in the book contain four elements: Title of Costume, Title of Band, Year and Country, and Description. The Description holds various types of information inclusive of performance history, awards and innovative approaches used for costume construction. Since the publication only showcased the work of Berkeley, the Creator field was omitted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0340035212455597">Figure 1</xref> shows a sample entry from the publication.</p>

</fig>
<p>From this publication it is evident that the relationship between Title of Costume and Title of Band is important, as this helps to explain the development of the band’s theme. In traditional library cataloguing, where the emphasis is primarily on the item in hand, this type of relationship information would be an optional element to be included at the discretion of the cataloguer. For carnival costume descriptions, the context of the larger performance may be considered core information, and documenting the name of the carnival band, if known, is one means of providing context information. The inclusion of Title of Band can also help with historical research on the themes portrayed through the years. It is not unusual for different designers to use similar names for costume designs, especially for themes from nature. Title of Band information would clarify these cases, for although the theme maybe repeated, the overall production title is rarely reused.</p>
<p>The Country and Year of design are also important because themes have been repeated over the years by different designers. The ‘China’ theme has been recreated in three popular presentations: ‘China the Forbidden City’ in 1965, designed by Carlisle Chang; ‘Six Days and Seven Nights in Shanghai’ in 2002, by the group Trini Revellers; and ‘Kingdom of the Dragon’ by the group Legacy in 2009. In the case of Wayne Berkeley, he designed several costumes in different years using the ‘sunset’ theme: ‘Sunset’ from the band Elements in 1998; ‘Arctic Sunset’ from Mirage in 1994; ‘Lake at Sunset’ from Swan Lake, 1991; ‘Clouds at Sunset’ and ‘Sunset’ from the band Secrets of the Sky, 1973. Note that along with these he also had other designs using the sun as the object of inspiration. Contemporary designers also produce costumes for carnival presentations in several countries and providing information on the location will assist researchers to identify the design traits of a particular country and designer.</p>
<p>The Berkeley catalogue preceded the cataloguing and digitization project undertaken by NALIS. Out of this project, NALIS has provided an electronic database of Berkeley’s designs along with digitized images via its website. This is one of the first online resources to provide access to the works of a carnival costume designer. Thus, project leaders willing to work with carnival costume designs can learn from the strengths and challenges of this online resource. The information that the NALIS indexers provided in the online descriptions has also been instrumental in identifying the elements needed for the carnival costume design plates. A sample record from NALIS is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0340035212455597">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The descriptions in the Berkeley publication focused on providing context and historical information for several of his carnival band productions; however, the NALIS records, shaped by AACR2 as the data entry guide and Dublin Core as the structure for the template, gave descriptive information primarily for the item in hand. The distinction between the book publication and the NALIS record is most evident in the Description field, where NALIS used this to describe the information as seen by the cataloguer. The NALIS approach expanded the description to include details on colour and costume construction. The Description field also functioned as the all-purpose area for NALIS, and as such other categories of information, including accompanying props were placed here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0340035212455597">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike the Berkeley record, a separate element was not created to accommodate the band title and country of performance; consequently these pieces of information were also embedded in the Description field and, in some examples, under Subject headings. The extensive use of the Description as a ‘capture all’ field ultimately affects the quality of database recall when search queries are entered. Users have to depend on keyword searches to locate information about the title of a band presentation. This explains the challenge that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212455597">Ferris (2009)</xref> encountered with information recall from the database. While evaluating this resource, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212455597">Ferris (2009)</xref> noted that there are difficulties in retrieving information by the title of the band and the year of production. The different uses of the Description field employed in the book record and the online database each have their benefits and would satisfy the research needs of different clienteles; however, the ideal situation would have been a combination of the two approaches in a single database.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the NALIS records went one step further than the Berkeley publication by adding three elements considered core in many metadata schemas, namely, creator, subjects, and rights, while omitting information such as the dimensions of the design plates and the medium used to create the designs. These records represent early attempts by indexers to fit carnival art into metadata schemas using existing guides such as AACR2. From this experience other institutions have considered other approaches and guides for describing carnival costumes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0340035212455597">
<title>The Carnival Institute of Trinidad and Tobago</title>
<p>The CITT was established to “collect and conserve all forms of information in response to some of the crucial questions that are relevant to the many festivals which occur in Trinidad and Tobago” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0340035212455597">National Carnival Commission of Trinidad and Tobago 2010</xref>). One aspect of CITT’s work is to collect carnival costumes and their designs. Since the CITT functions as a resource centre and museum for carnival artefacts, the data recorded on the cataloguing forms serve multiple purposes. The records provide access to costumes, accompanying designs, provenance, conservation issues and acquisition data including the status of costumes upon acquisition. Whereas the NALIS approach was primarily to provide access to the resources for research, the CITT engaged in extensive documentation to satisfy user access and artefact management.</p>
<p>A sample record from the CITT is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0340035212455597">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>After examining a cross section of the CITT records it was noted that overall the descriptions are lengthy and are, in some cases, miniature essays. In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0340035212455597">Figure 3</xref>, the description was not reproduced because of its length. Noticeably, both NALIS and the CITT used the description element to record extensive details. In the case of NALIS, the indexing of the costumes took place before the digitization process and as such the descriptions helped to distinguish pieces in the collection. For the CITT, a large portion of the description is for curatorial purposes. Some of the features captured in the descriptions were: measurements of costume components e.g. length of a feather, size of a hem; detailed description of all pieces making up the work e.g. construction materials, techniques, type of fabric, and stitching; the construction and/or sale prices for the costume; name of the band leader and where available the design concept as written by the designer. In one particular case of a Wayne Berkeley design held at the CITT, the cataloguer also included information on the order in which the sections proceeded on stage for the performance. While the indexers at this institution attempted to capture as much information as possible, data was omitted in cases where no information or provenance was available to help with the cataloguing process.</p>
<p>What is also interesting with the CITT project is that the documentation process is being spearheaded by an artist/theatre designer; as such the enhanced descriptions in these records reflect a practitioner’s knowledge and skills. While the information provided would be valuable to researchers, the CITT approach to cataloguing is labour intensive and requires an understanding of costume construction and design concepts. Of the three projects, this is the only case in which a subject specialist is performing the cataloguing of the designs; as such the details identified can be beyond the scope of generalist cataloguers. Another outcome of the CITT approach is that the record holds information for both the design and the costume artifact, thereby reducing the number of catalogue records to be created; it also means that location information for the different formats is captured on the same record.</p>
<p>In the cases of the CITT and the Berkeley publication, where designers influenced the documentation process, ‘Title of the Band’ was given a separate field, thereby confirming that this element is of importance to persons in carnival costume research. The CITT also used another metadata element not available in the NALIS records, namely, ‘Producer of the Band’. This is also noted in another carnival costume design project outside of Trinidad and Tobago, the online Carnival Collection of Tulane University in New Orleans, which also provides search options for the producer of the band referred to as a ’Krewe’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0340035212455597">The Carnival Collection 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0340035212455597">
<title>The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine</title>
<p>Admittedly, the cataloguing of costume designs at the UWI is the newest of the three projects and as such the indexers were able to draw on the experiences of the aforementioned projects. The carnival costume design drawings housed at the Main Library form one series of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212455597">Carlisle Chang collection</xref> and were all done by Chang. Carlisle Chang (1921–2001) was a professional artist who participated in many aspects of art and culture in Trinidad and Tobago. He spearheaded the committee that created the designs for the national flag and coat of arms of Trinidad and Tobago. The papers that document his life’s work were bequeathed to the University of the West Indies in 2004 and were named to the Trinidad and Tobago Memory of the World Register in 2010.</p>
<p>Unlike NALIS and the CITT, the cataloguing of the costume designs from this collection occurred in tandem with the digitization process. This had the effect of influencing the standards and the workflow adopted for the project. The costume designs were digitized and the surrogates placed in the online Institutional Repository, UWISpace. Preliminary records were populated with information by the Digitization team with the understanding that the Metadata team would enhance the records in due course. The Institutional Repository operates on a DSpace platform with Dublin Core as the metadata schema for input. The Dublin Core metadata schema is not as granular as specialist schemas such as the CDWA and the Visual Resources Association (VRA) Core, consequently once the essential elements for carnival costume designs were identified, a crosswalk to Dublin Core had to be prepared to guide the bibliographic description. A sample of a UWI record is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0340035212455597">Figure 4</xref>: note that the selection of elements was influenced by the CCO standard.</p>

<p>One outcome of using Dublin Core as the metadata standard was that an element had to be repeated to accommodate various categories of information, as is evident with the Description and Subject elements. The Description fields in many of the UWI records were kept at a minimum because the costumes were not in hand and a decision was made to catalogue the costume design and not the costume itself. It was also felt that the primary role of the cataloguing function is to provide access to the resource and other research data can be incorporated at a later stage if needed. This approach is a departure from that used by the aforementioned institutions which had historical information and costume details in this Description area; instead, information on inscription, presence of fabric swatches, props drawn with the designs and stains were some of the things identified in this field.</p>
<p>Although the UWI records contain some similar elements noted in the NALIS and CITT projects, they also introduced some issues for consideration. The first of these is the use of a third title element labeled Section Title, because a band can have variations in the costumes for different sections. Rather than use an Alternative Title field which would accommodate all titles that the cataloguer felt would be significant, a decision was made to separate them so that whenever data migration has to take place the mapping process would be more efficient. This was then mapped to DC ‘Is Part of” which is meant to give the hierarchical relationship between the pieces and the carnival band as an entity.</p>

<sec id="section7-0340035212455597">
<title>Other cataloguing issues</title>
<p>In reviewing the work done for the cataloguing of the costume designs, two questions that consistently arose were how much information should the catalogue record contain and how much research is expected of the cataloguers? In the introduction to the CCO, the authors, in addressing the issue of ‘How much information should a catalogue record contain?’ suggest that the “focus of cataloguing should be twofold: promoting good access to the works and images coupled with clear, accurate descriptions that users will understand”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212455597">Baca 2006</xref>: 7). Therefore the thin balance between providing information to enable access and conducting extensive research has to be managed for projects involving the cataloguing of original materials. What experience has shown in each of the approaches to cataloguing discussed above is that some research on the costume design and its cultural context has to be undertaken to fill gaps in the bibliographic record. In the UWI project, attempts were made to locate documents from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212455597">Carlisle Chang collection</xref> that dealt with the design ideas as well as inventories of the costume plates. Further attempts were made to establish for each of Carlisle Chang’s carnival bands the number of sections, individuals, kings and queens so as to limit the number of items assigned the term ‘Untitled’. This was greatly aided by the fact that the archive resides at the institution as such additional documentation was used to complement the chief source of information.</p>
<p>Additional documentation for carnival bands can include the design philosophy and the meaning of the costumes as articulated by the designer. This is a particular strength of the early costume designers; however in some contemporary advertisements, for example handbills, this type of information is not available. To illustrate how a theme is developed into a carnival band, one can look at an example of Carlisle Chang’s work. In 1974 Carlisle Chang designed costumes for the carnival band ‘Terra Firma’ and he describes the design idea in the following text:
<disp-quote>
<p>“Terra Firma, the earth’s story, is based on our knowledge of the earth, its structure and behaviour, and is inspired by environmental concern. The twenty four sections fall into four basic groupings the fiery core and centre of the earth; the mantle of rock and minerals; the outer crust of curious subterranean and terrestrial phenomenon and the fourth group the underworld of myth and mystery.”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212455597">Carlisle Chang Collection</xref>, box 5, folder 37)</p>
</disp-quote>
The costumes designed for this theme included glacial waters, diamonds, rubies, electrons and neutrons, among others. In addition to the overall thesis, he provides a full description of various costumes; below is a portion of the text from the essay written on the King of the Band costume, ‘The Alchemist’:
<disp-quote>
<p>“… Tony Superville portrays a mythical character, the Alchemist, a sorcerer or wizard who stands at the heart of matter making his electrons and molecules dance to create all things living or inanimate.</p>
<p>The costume depicts an ancient personage heavily bearded and with wildly streaming hair. He is enclosed in the fiery core of the earth amid an explosion of atoms which seem to split the world asunder …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212455597">Carlisle Chang Collection</xref>, box 5, folder 37)</p>
</disp-quote>
For cataloguers, a text like this is important for source information because the descriptions can assist in providing titles for ‘Untitled’ works or in making the task of creating a descriptive title easier. Helpful headings can also be assigned for performers and other subject associations based on the text. According to documents in Chang’s papers, he created 50 costume designs for this band Terra Firma and these were numbered within the range: 7401–7450. Amongst these designs are individual costumes, section players, king and queen. The cataloguing challenge therefore is not only to present data on an individual plate like the Rubies costume design, but also to provide enough information in that record that would allow researchers to understand the relationship of a design to other pieces and also to gain an idea of the collective performance.</p>
<p>One observation made after examination of metadata records is that there is need to establish a thesaurus that can accommodate the nuances of carnival costume designs. As highlighted in the literature, controlled vocabularies to describe the costume designs at times can be limited, and this was the case with the three projects. In the local practice of carnival there are terms used to describe the costume types and styles which are not all available in controlled vocabularies selected for use, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings. Consequently, additional documentation had to be developed by the institutions to describe these elements. At the UWI, where the metadata element DC Subject holds information on style, class type, costume type, the subject and country of design; two short lists entitled ‘Categories for the Style of Carnival Costume Designs’ and ‘Costume types’ were created to describe the styles of carnival costume designs. Style as defined by the CCO “identifies the named, defined style, historical or artistic period, movement, group or school whose characteristics are represented in the work being catalogued”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212455597">Baca 2006</xref>:156). The element is considered core for the description of works of art and by extension carnival costumes. CCO further recommends that the terms used to express style should be drawn from a standardized list. Consequently, the terminology selected to name the styles of costumes should aim to be consistent, approved by the constituents, and place the work in the context of similar entities. In an effort to prepare a working list for the UWI project, the terms used by the National Carnival Bands Association of Trinidad and Tobago (NCBA) were adopted<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0340035212455597">2</xref>
</sup>. Every participating band in the carnival parade must register with the NCBA and indicate the category under which the presentation is to be judged. A consolidation of the costume categories is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0340035212455597">Table 2</xref> and a short list of costume types in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0340035212455597">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Adopting the terminology established by the NCBA ensures that the costumes will match the registration archives of the NCBA and the history of carnival. It was also necessary to provide a description of the characteristics associated with each costume style; therefore several works on the carnival characters were consulted and appended to the list to provide guidance on how to identify each with a possible photograph from a published source. There were several categories that were difficult to define and these were as follows: Creative, Creative topical, Fantasy and Original. The NCBA was consulted for clarification on these definitions, but even with the explanations, there were no traits that one could list to help the cataloguers make a distinction. One consideration was to look at the themes that were assigned to these categories over the years and use these as guides, but this approach can also provide misleading information. For example, in 2011, the winning carnival queen costume was entitled D’ Jeweled Chandelier, worn by Peola Marchan. Based on the title and look of the costume, one may be tempted to assign it to the Creative category. However, this costume was registered with the NCBA under the Modern History category because it is part of the band D’ Big Dance: Sel Duncan at the Palm Club. The band’s presentation tells the story of a renowned Trinidadian musician, Sel Duncan and the dances at which he played his music in the Palm Club ballroom. The D’ Jeweled Chandelier, when presented on stage, had an accompanying text that explained to the audience that this costume represented the chandelier that hung in the ballroom for these dances. Therefore without the context of the costume design and presentation it would be difficult at times for cataloguers to determine the style. As such, rather than make this category mandatory, cataloguers were advised to leave it out if there is uncertainty. These issues of terminology and definition make it even more difficult to create standardized headings on a wider national level.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The projects at the three institutions are significant in attempting to document one aspect of the multi-faceted Trinidad and Tobago carnival and like other categories of non-print cataloguing these provide their own challenges. Cataloguing continues to be a fluid process that evolves with each project undertaken. While cataloguers prepare records for global consumption with standardized elements guided by international standard, what is also evident is that the cultural context of the costume pieces in performance should also influence some of the data elements designated as important. This was highlighted with the recurring use of several titles on records such as band title and section title, to reconstruct hierarchical relationships, and attempts to link records to the design ideas expressed by the creators. As more institutions undertake the description of these resources in the Caribbean, the development of supporting resources such as a terms dictionary for style and costume types can also evolve.</p>
<p>An examination of the records presented by the three institutions also shows that each institution has data elements that they deem more significant. Overall the institutions followed the standards available and used the description fields to collapse information. However, the data was not consistent for all records and since the records are not integrated in a single national database the challenges of interoperability have not yet arisen. To facilitate any future considerations for an integrated catalogue, standardization would have to take place. Thus to assist the process one would like to recommend the following elements be considered core for cataloguing carnival costume designs: Country of Production Creator, Description, Title of Band, Title of Design, Title of Section, Style (as listed on the NCBA website), Subject and Year of Production. Even with these prescriptive fields, it is also important that the cataloguers continue the dialogue with researchers and designers to ensure that the records adequately capture information to serve the respective clientele.</p>

<p>A carnival band is an organization of designers, artisans, event managers and costumed players. Designers create costumes for a Band on a particular theme, subject, or place. A band can be as small as 2 persons or as large as five thousand persons. Designers compete for the best costumed band and receive prizes and boasting rights for the year.</p>
