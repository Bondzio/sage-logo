<abstract>
<p>The present study was designed to evaluate the extent and topography of osteopontin (OPN) protein expression in the rat hippocampus 4 to 12 weeks following transient forebrain ischemia, and to compare OPN expression patterns with those of calcium deposits and astroglial and microglial reactions. Two patterns of OPN staining were recognized by light microscopy: 1) a diffuse pattern of tiny granular deposits throughout the CA1 region at 4 weeks after ischemia and 2) non-diffuse ovoid to round deposits, which formed conglomerates in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer over the chronic interval of 8 to 12 weeks. Immunogold-silver electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis demonstrated that OPN deposits were indeed diverse types of calcium deposits, which were clearly delineated by profuse silver grains indicative of OPN expression. Intracellular OPN deposits were frequently observed within reactive astrocytes and neurons 4 weeks after ischemia but rarely at later times. By contrast, extracellular OPN deposits progressively increased in size and appeared to be gradually phagocytized by microglia or brain macrophages and some astrocytes over 8 to 12 weeks. These data indicate an interaction between OPN and calcium in the hippocampus in the chronic period after ischemia, suggesting that OPN binding to calcium deposits may be involved in scavenging mechanisms.</p>

<p>Osteopontin (OPN) is an adhesive glycoprotein containing the peptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). OPN has been proposed to act as a chemoattractant that recruits microglia, macrophages, and astrocytes in response to ischemic injury and has also been identified as a potent neuroprotectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412441707">Ellison et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412441707">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412441707">Wang et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412441707">Lee et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412441707">Meller et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155412441707">Schroeter et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022155412441707">Yan et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412441707">Chen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155412441707">van Velthoven et al. 2011</xref>). In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that OPN acts as a phagocytosis-inducing opsonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412441707">McKee and Nanci 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155412441707">Pedraza et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155412441707">Schack et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155412441707">Shin et al. 2011</xref>). Thus, it appears that OPN action in nervous tissue, especially in pathogenic processes in the ischemic brain, is much more extensive than was initially supposed.</p>
<p>Calcification within the central nervous system is a common finding associated with several neuropathological disorders, including brain ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412441707">Gutierrez-Diaz et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412441707">Dux et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412441707">Bonnekoh et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412441707">Kato et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412441707">Ohta et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155412441707">Puka-Sundvall et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155412441707">Ramonet et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155412441707">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412441707">Oliveira et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412441707">Bueters et al. 2008</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that OPN plays a major role in the regulation of ectopic calcification and pathological mineralization of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155412441707">Steitz et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412441707">Fujita et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412441707">Makiishi-Shimobayashi et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412441707">Pampena et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412441707">Giachelli 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155412441707">Scatena et al. 2007</xref>). In addition, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412441707">Maetzler et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated that the lack of OPN induces co-occurring progressive neurodegeneration and microcalcification after an excitotoxic insult, suggesting that OPN is involved in brain calcification. In support of this, we found that calcium precipitation may provide a matrix for the binding of the OPN protein to cell debris or degenerating neurites induced by ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412441707">Shin et al. 2012</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that OPN participates in the regulation of ectopic calcification in the ischemic brain. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in addition to being expressed in activated microglia/macrophages within the first few days after transient forebrain ischemia, OPN protein accumulated in the CA1 hippocampal region over a 4-week period following the insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>). Thus, long-lasting and progressive OPN accumulation in the ischemic hippocampus may be associated with calcium deposits, although the precise nature of these OPN deposits is still unknown.</p>
<p>The present study was designed to characterize OPN accumulation elicited by cerebral ischemia. Given the possible relationship between OPN and calcium deposits, we investigated, over a 12-week survival period, the extent and topography of OPN protein expression following transient forebrain ischemia and compared this with patterns of calcium deposition using alizarin red Staining, a sensitive and specific method for detection of calcium deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412441707">Nitsch and Scotti 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155412441707">Mori et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, we focused on the relationship between OPN expression and glial reactions using confocal and immunogold-silver electron microscopy (EM), as persistent expression of OPN in the ischemic hippocampus has been ascribed to reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>), and glial cells may participate in the formation of calcium deposits following excitotoxin lesioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412441707">Oliveira et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Induction of Transient Forebrain Ischemia</title>
<p>All surgical interventions and presurgical and postsurgical animal care were provided in accordance with the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guidelines and Policies for Rodent Survival Surgery provided by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) in the School of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea.</p>
<p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used in this study. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion and reperfusion method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155412441707">Pulsinelli and Brierley (1979)</xref> with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412441707">Lee et al. 1999</xref>). Briefly, the vertebral arteries were electrocauterized and cut to stop circulation in these vessels. After 24 hr, both common carotid arteries were occluded for 10 min with miniature aneurysmal clips. Only those animals showing completely flat electroencephalograms after vascular occlusion were classified as ischemic and used in the study. Body temperatures (measured rectally) were maintained at 37.5 ± 0.3C with a heating lamp during and after ischemia. Sham-operated rats, with cauterized vertebral arteries and ligatures placed around the carotid arteries, were used as controls. No animal convulsed or died following reperfusion or sham operation.</p>
<p>Animals were allowed to live for 4, 8, and 12 weeks after reperfusion. At each time point following reperfusion, animals (<italic>n</italic>=11/time points for the ischemic group; <italic>n</italic>=5/time points for the sham operation group) were deeply anesthetized with 16.9% urethane (10 ml/kg) and killed by transcardial perfusion with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Additional groups of rats were used for immunogold-silver EM at 4 and 8 weeks after ischemia (<italic>n</italic>=5/time points).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and Double Labeling</title>
<p>Free-floating sections (25 µm thick) were processed for double-immunofluorescence histochemistry. The sections were incubated at 4C overnight with a mix of monoclonal mouse anti-rat OPN (American Research Products, Belmont, MA; dilution 1:100) and one of the following primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies: ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan; dilution 1:500), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA; dilution 1:1500), or biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN; Chemicon; dilution 1:100). The sections were then incubated with a mixture of Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; dilution 1:1500), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson; dilution 1:50), FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson; dilution 1:50), or FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson; dilution 1:50) for 1 hr. The specificity of immunoreactivity was confirmed by the absence of the immunohistochemical reaction in sections from which primary or secondary antibodies were omitted or from which the primary antibody was substituted with purified mouse IgGĸ Isotype control (BD Biosciences; Franklin Lakes, NJ). Counterstaining of cell nuclei was carried out with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole; Roche, Basel, Switzerland; dilution 1:1000) for 10 min. Slides were viewed with a confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd., Jena, Germany). Images were converted to the TIFF format, and contrast levels were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe; San Jose, CA).</p>

<title>Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>To simultaneously detect calcium and the OPN protein, we employed alizarin red S staining and immunostaining of OPN. Free-floating sections were first incubated at 4C overnight with monoclonal mouse anti-rat OPN (American Research Products; dilution 1:100). Antibody staining was visualized with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; dilution 1:50). Sections were then mounted on gelatinized glass and immersed in 2% (w/v) alizarin red S (Sigma; St. Louis, MO) for 30 sec followed by a rinse in distilled water. Counterstaining of cell nuclei was carried out with DAPI for 10 min. Control sections were prepared as described above.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022155412441707">
<title>Immunoelectron Microscopy and Electron Probe Microanalysis</title>
<p>We used a preembedding immunogold-silver technique to detect the OPN protein. Floating vibratome sections (50 µm thick) were blocked with PSG solution (0.05% saponin/0.2% gelatin/0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-rat OPN antibody overnight at 4C. The sections were then incubated with an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY; dilution 1:100) for 2 hr, and silver enhancement was performed with the HQ silver enhancement kit (Nanoprobes) for 3 min. After fixation, dehydration, and embedding in Epon 812, areas of interest were excised and glued onto resin blocks. Ultrathin sections (70–90 nm thick) were lightly stained with uranyl acetate and observed with an electron microscope (JEM-1010; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>For electron probe microanalysis to analyze the spatial distribution of selected elements within OPN-labeled structures, thin sections (80–100 nm) of selected regions were placed on copper grids and carbon coated (approximately 20 nm thickness). The chemical composition of silver-enhanced immunogold-labeled profiles was analyzed using field emission–transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL) equipped with EDAX (for elemental detection by X-ray analysis), installed at the Korea Basic Science Institute. The operative voltage was 200 kV.</p>

<title>Spatiotemporal Relationship between OPN Expression and Calcium Deposits in the Ischemic CA1 Hippocampus</title>
<p>Our previous report provided a comprehensive description of the spatiotemporal distribution of OPN in rats at 1 day to 4 weeks following a 10-min ischemic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>). To investigate the relationship between OPN and calcium deposition in the hippocampus over the chronic interval of 4 to 12 weeks following ischemic injury, we performed double labeling with OPN and alizarin red S. No specific staining for alizarin red S or OPN was detected in the hippocampus of sham-operated rats at any time point (Suppl. Fig. S1). Four weeks after ischemia, tiny granular deposits showing OPN immunoreactivity were diffusely distributed throughout the hippocampal CA1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Fig. 1A</xref>), as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>). In the same section, amorphous to granule-like alizarin red staining in the CA1 region corresponded well with that of OPN immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">C</xref>). Over the chronic interval of 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Fig. 1D</xref>) and 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Fig. 1G</xref>) after ischemia, distinct patterns of OPN staining were observed; non-diffuse, ovoid to round deposits of OPN immunostaining with variable size appeared to become enlarged and occupied the CA1 pyramidal cell layer over time. Interestingly, at higher magnification, it was clear that OPN immunostaining was much more intense at the periphery than in the core region of these deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Fig. 1J</xref>). As revealed by alizarin red staining of the corresponding profiles, the distribution pattern of OPN protein closely matched that of calcium deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">Fig. 1D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412441707">L</xref>). All immunoreactivity specific to OPN was eliminated when the primary antibody was omitted or substituted by purified mouse IgGĸ Isotype control (Suppl.

<title>Spatiotemporal Correlation among OPN, Astroglial, and Microglial Responses in the Ischemic CA1 Hippocampus</title>
<p>To define the relationship between OPN expression and astroglial and microglial responses in the ischemic hippocampus, we performed double labeling with OPN and two glial-specific markers: GFAP and Iba1. As described above, no specific staining for OPN was detected in the hippocampal CA1 region of sham-operated rats, where GFAP-positive astrocytes showed thin glial processes and Iba1-positive microglia exhibited ramified morphology (Suppl. Fig. S3). At 4 weeks after ischemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">Fig. 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">C</xref>), immunostaining for OPN and GFAP was observed throughout the CA1 hippocampus, and it exhibited an overlapping regional distribution. At higher magnification, tiny, diffuse granules of OPN immunostaining were distributed cytoplasmically in astrocytes that appeared hypertrophic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">Fig. 2D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">F</xref>). In addition, dot-like deposits of OPN immunoreactivity appeared to be located outside the astrocytes, probably in the extracellular matrix. At this time point, double labeling for OPN and Iba1 showed that some amoeboid brain macrophages contained dot-like labeled profiles but not tiny OPN granules, as seen in reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">Fig. 2G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412441707">L</xref>).</p>

Note that non-diffuse OPN-labeled deposits of variable sizes and shapes appeared to be located in the extracellular matrix. (D−F) Double labeling for OPN and Iba1 showed that brain macrophages were frequently located in close proximity to OPN deposits and sometimes contained these deposits within the cytoplasm (arrowheads in D−F). (G−I) Double labeling for OPN and GFAP showed that hypertrophic astroglial cytoplasm and processes were in close proximity to conglomerates of OPN-labeled deposits and sometimes encompassed them. Note that the cores of these deposits were devoid of specific labeling for OPN. (J−L) Double labeling for OPN and Iba1 showed that most clusters of OPN deposits were localized within cell bodies of brain macrophages. Cell nuclei appeared blue after DAPI staining.

<p>Localization of OPN in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region was further analyzed by immunogold-silver EM. In animals subjected to ischemic insult followed by 4 weeks of reperfusion, profuse accumulation of silver-enhanced immunogold particles was observed along the surface of irregularly shaped, electron-dense structures, which were located both intracellularly and, frequently, extracellularly. Extracellular calcium deposits, which appeared to be more electron dense at the periphery, were associated with remnants of cellular debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">Fig. 4A</xref>) and occasionally contained degenerated mitochondria, which were small and highly electron dense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">Fig. 4B</xref>). Intracellular calcium deposits were observed within degenerating neurons containing several lipid inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">D</xref>) and also within reactive astrocytes, which were characterized by relatively sparse organelles and the presence of bundles of fibrils or filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate sustained and progressive expression of OPN protein in regions most affected by ischemic injury, the CA1 hippocampal region, in rats analyzed between 4 and 12 weeks after a 10-min period of global forebrain ischemia. We found that the distribution of OPN in these affected regions was very closely related to calcium precipitation and glial reactions based on the following observations. First, simultaneous alizarin red staining and OPN immunohistochemistry showed that the spatial and temporal expression patterns of OPN closely resembled those of calcium deposits. Second, OPN-labeled deposits were closely associated with reactive astrocytes and microglia/brain macrophages. Third, the combination of immunogold-silver EM and electron probe microanalysis showed that silver-enhanced grains (indicating OPN) were clearly associated with the surface of electron-dense precipitates, typical of calcium deposits.</p>
<p>Two distinct forms of OPN-labeled deposits were observed by light microscopy: 1) tiny, diffuse granular deposits distributed throughout the CA1 region at 4 weeks after ischemia and 2) larger, ovoid to round deposits, which appeared to become enlarged in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer over the chronic interval of 8 to 12 weeks. Immunogold-silver EM demonstrated that these OPN deposits were indeed diverse types of calcium deposits that were located both intracellularly and extracellularly. It is noteworthy that although the silver grains indicative of OPN accumulated along the surface of extracellular calcium deposits, the grains were evenly distributed within some intracellular deposits. Given that progressive calcium deposition appeared to occur within OPN-labeled deposits, thereby rendering them more electron dense and homogeneous over time (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412441707">Fig. 4</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412441707">Fig. 5</xref>), it is likely that mature calcium deposits became filled with nearly evenly dense calcium precipitates and that this may have led to accumulation of OPN along the periphery of the calcium deposits.</p>
<p>Intracellular calcium deposits labeled by OPN were frequently observed within astrocytes and neurons at 4 weeks. In particular, astrocytes contained varying amounts of lipid droplets and multiple calcium deposits, most of which were closely associated with glial filaments. At later time points (8–12 weeks), however, when progressive calcium deposition occurred in affected areas, only a few astrocytes showed granular OPN labeling indicative of multiple intracellular calcium deposits. A possible explanation for these results is that the multiple foci of intracellular calcification in astrocytes led to cellular damage and the complete calcification of whole cells. In support of this idea, previous studies have described astroglial calcification in areas of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412441707">Agnew et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412441707">Mahy et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that calcium precipitation in the ischemic brain is associated with impaired calcium homeostasis and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412441707">Gutierrez-Diaz et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412441707">Dux et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412441707">Bonnekoh et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155412441707">Shirotani et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412441707">Ohta et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022155412441707">Watanabe et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155412441707">Puka-Sundvall et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412441707">Bueters et al. 2008</xref>) and that neuronal death was restricted mainly to the hippocampal CA1 region after a four-vessel occlusion insult of the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155412441707">Pulsinelli et al. 1982</xref>), progressive calcium deposition in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 regions may be due to long-lasting degenerative processes occurring in these regions. Several studies have documented progressive neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus following brief periods of ischemia or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412441707">Smith et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412441707">Bendel et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412441707">Bueters et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412441707">Kiryk et al. 2011</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412441707">Bueters et al. (2008)</xref> found that an accumulation of large calcium deposits occurred in the late neurodegeneration phase, affecting newly generated CA1 neurons, but not at early time points (2–14 days after ischemia) despite extensive neuronal cell death. The results suggest that these calcification processes may be associated with neuroinflammatory and astroglial reactions. In addition, astrocytes participate in the accumulation and structural expansion of calcium deposits in excitotoxic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412441707">Oliveira et al. 2003</xref>), and heterogeneity of the astroglial population is a contributing factor to variations in regional vulnerability to neurodegeneration and calcium deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155412441707">Rodríguez et al. 2004</xref>). In this context, it is of interest that astroglial OPN expression in the hippocampus is first induced at 10 days after ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412441707">Choi et al. 2007</xref>), further increased at 4 weeks, and maintained at elevated levels for at least 8 weeks. These observations, together with our new findings, suggest that astrocytes express OPN in the early phase of calcium deposition in the ischemic hippocampus and thus astroglial OPN is centrally involved in calcium precipitation in the ischemic brain. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood at present.</p>
<p>We recently suggested that OPN is involved in phagocytosis of fragmented cell debris by macrophages in response to cerebral ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155412441707">Shin et al. 2011</xref>) and that calcium precipitation in cell debris facilitates local binding of OPN, leading to OPN-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412441707">Shin et al. 2012</xref>). This proposal was supported by the present finding that most OPN deposits were encompassed by brain macrophages at 12 weeks, the latest time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412441707">Fig. 3J</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412441707">L</xref>). At 12 weeks, hypertrophic astrocytes were also frequently observed in close proximity to OPN-labeled calcium deposits, some of which appeared to be surrounded and engulfed by astrocytes. Several studies have documented phagocytic activity of astrocytes after various brain injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022155412441707">Watabe et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412441707">al-Ali and al-Hussain 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155412441707">Sobaniec-Lotowska 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412441707">Mázló et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412441707">Ito et al. 2007</xref>). Our observations suggest that surviving astrocytes may participate in phagocytosis of calcium deposits, although brain macrophages appear to be the cells primarily responsible for their removal and that OPN may be involved in the scavenging mechanism. However, several lines of evidence suggest that OPN regulates ectopic mineralization in response to injury in many soft tissues, including brain tissue subjected to excitotoxic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412441707">Boskey et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155412441707">Steitz et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412441707">Makiishi-Shimobayashi et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412441707">Giachelli 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155412441707">Speer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412441707">Maetzler et al. 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155412441707">Steitz et al. (2002)</xref> suggested in an elegant study that OPN initially physically inhibits crystal growth and simultaneously provides a recognition site and/or concentration gradient for macrophages, thereby leading to acidification and dissolution of residual bioapatite. Thus, the possibility that binding of OPN to calcium deposits inhibits the calcification process cannot be excluded, and further studies are needed to identify the roles of OPN in calcification in the ischemic brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data indicate that OPN is closely associated with calcium precipitation in the ischemic CA1 hippocampus. The OPN protein accumulated profusely along the surface of diverse types of calcium deposits, ranging from small intracellular deposits to large extracellular conglomerates. The labeled calcium deposits appeared to be gradually phagocytized by microglia/brain macrophages and some astrocytes over 8 to 12 weeks after ischemia. Thus, our data suggest that OPN binding to calcium deposits is involved in the mechanisms by which such deposits are scavenged.</p>
