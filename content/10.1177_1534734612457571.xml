<abstract>
<p>A 13-year-old girl presented with multiple painless purulent ulcers with raised borders on the medial aspect of the sole of her right foot associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy for the past 4 years. There was history of local trauma at the site prior to the formation of ulcers. There were no other significant associated signs or symptoms. The patient was initially treated with multiple antibiotics with minimal improvement. Fungal cultures of biopsy specimens demonstrated the presence of colonies of <italic>Sporothrix schenckii</italic> thus confirming the diagnosis of sporotrichosis. Oral itraconazole at the dose of 100 mg twice daily was initiated with marked response at 4 weeks. This case demonstrated a rare morphological presentation of the lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis as mycetoma. The possible diagnosis of sporotrichosis should be kept in mind in such a clinical presentation not responding to antibiotics. Cutaneous sporotrichosis should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible because untreated cases may disseminate to cause visceral involvement with fatal outcome in immunocompromised patients.</p>

<body>
<p>Sporotrichosis is a chronic lymphatic subcutaneous fungal infection caused by <italic>Sporothrix schenckii</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457571">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457571">2</xref></sup> Osteoarticular and visceral sporotrichosis occurs mostly in immunocompromised patients or alcoholics. Sporotrichosis has a worldwide distribution but is more common in temperate and tropical zones with high temperature and humidity. In India, a limited number of cases have been reported, mainly from the northeastern states and Himachal Pradesh, and a few from southern India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457571">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457571">4</xref></sup> The disease is characterized by the development of noduloulcerative lesions in skin and subcutaneous tissue along with involvement of lymphatic tracts. These are usually found over the trauma-prone sites of the body such as the hands, legs, or soles. History of trauma, for example, in the form of a thorn prick, causing implantation of fungus is common. Here we report lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis clinically presenting as mycetoma in an adolescent girl.</p>
<p>A 13-year-old girl, who was a resident of Bihar, India, presented with nonhealing ulcers on the medial side of the sole of the right foot for the past 4 years. A history of thorn prick at the site 2 years prior to the development of the ulcer was present. The lesions were initially treated with topical and oral antibiotics with very mild response. The patient also complained of asymptomatic swelling over the dorsum of the same foot since 6 months. She also complained of pedal edema associated with pain, which was aggravated during walking. On examination, we found that multiple ulcers of size 1 cm × 1 cm, with raised border and necrotic base, were present over the medial side of the right sole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612457571">Figure 1</xref>). The surrounding skin of the ulcer showed erythema and mild induration. The swelling on the dorsum of the right foot was nontender and about 6 cm × 6 cm in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612457571">Figure 2</xref>). Two lymph nodes of size 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm that were mobile and nontender were present in the right inguinal area. Blood investigations, including complete blood counts, liver and renal function tests, and fasting blood glucose levels, were within normal limits. Sputum for acid fast bacilli was negative. X ray findings showed features suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis in the first metatarsal bone of the right foot along with subcutaneous involvement. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality. Tissue biopsy specimen of the lesions was collected aseptically and sent to the mycology laboratory. A potassium hydroxide mount showed cigar-shaped budding yeast cells. The sample was inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar and blood agar and kept at 22°C and 37°C in the incubator. After 2 to 3 days of incubation, colonies of size 2 to 3 mm, moist, and off-white to cream in color were formed. Tubes were further incubated, and the colonies turned brown to black and became dry and wrinkled with minimal aerial hyphae in about 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612457571">Figure 3A</xref>). Needle mounts and slide culture preparations revealed features consistent with <italic>S schenckii</italic>. Subcultures to brain heart infusion agar with blood and incubation at 37°C yielded yeast-like colonies with oval yeast-like cells on Gram stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612457571">Figure 3B</xref>). Based on morphology and conversion studies, the isolate was identified as <italic>S schenckii.</italic> The patient was treated with oral itraconazole 100 mg twice a day and showed some response after treatment of 6 weeks in the form of decreased pedal edema along with partial healing of the ulcer. The swelling present over the dorsum of the right foot also subsided with the treatment.</p>

<p>Sporotrichosis is generally a chronic mycotic infection characterized by nodular and ulcerative lesions of cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymphatic tissues. Historically, sporotrichosis has been associated with gardeners and agricultural workers. Sporotrichosis is classified into 4 clinical categories, including lymphocutaneous, fixed cutaneous, multifocal or disseminated, and extracutaneous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457571">5</xref></sup> Lymphocutaneous presentation is the commonest reported clinical form of the disease in immunocompetent hosts, constituting from 46% to 92% of cases, followed by the fixed cutaneous type (0% to 54%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457571">6</xref></sup> A history of trauma preceding the infection is present in a majority of the patients. Disseminated visceral, osteoarticular, meningeal, and pulmonary forms of the disease are uncommon and are usually seen in patients with underlying risk factors. Dimorphic fungi such as <italic>S schenckii</italic> exist as a mold in the environment. Once the conidia are introduced into the body by inhalation or traumatic injury, the organisms convert to the yeast phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457571">7</xref></sup> <italic>S schenckii</italic> is present in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and decaying vegetation. Inoculation usually occurs via penetration of skin on the extremities while manipulating plant and soil materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457571">8</xref></sup> Recently, 10 cases of sporotrichosis were reported in prepubertal girls by Burch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457571">9</xref></sup> Our patient described the lesions on the sole of the right foot as being of 4 years’ duration and associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy and chronic osteomyelitis of the metatarsal bone without any systemic involvement. The swelling over the dorsum of the foot might be associated with the lymphatic involvement of the sporotrichosis. Here, infection might have occurred by direct inoculation of the organism at the site of injury because the patient provided a history of trauma at the site. Previously, the standard therapy for lymphocutaneous and cutaneous sporotrichosis was a saturated solution of potassium iodide. Currently, itraconazole has become the drug of choice for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. The recommended dosage is 100 to 200 mg daily, to be administered for 3 to 6months depending on the response. If a patient does not tolerate itraconazole, fluconazole can be used as a second-line treatment, but it has a lower success rate than the former azole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457571">10</xref></sup> Our case clinically presented as mycetoma initially but was later confirmed to be a case of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. Thus, diagnosis of sporotrichosis should always be kept in mind in such clinical presentations because the diagnosis can be made easily by a simple Gram-stained smear, potassium hydroxide examination, and fungal culture. Early diagnosis and management of sporotrichosis is necessary to avoid the occurrence of disseminated sporotrichosis, including meningial and visceral involvement, which may have a fatal outcome.</p>
