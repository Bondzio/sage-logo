<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To determine the factor structure of the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale in young adults with only allergies versus those with both allergies and asthma to evaluate the domains of impairment associated with these 2 chronic health conditions. <italic>Method</italic>. A total of 454 young adults with allergies (n = 255) or asthma + allergies (n = 199) between the ages of 18 and 25 (mean = 19.39, standard deviation = 1.34) completed the study questionnaire as a part of a larger study of the psychosocial adjustment of young adults with a chronic health condition. <italic>Results</italic>. A 3-factor structure (Identity, Intimacy, and Relationships and Personal Development) of the Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale had better fit than a 1-factor structure. Several modifications to the original 3-factor model improved the fit within this population. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The 3-factor model was shown to be effective within young adults with allergies and asthma + allergies with some modifications. The structure of the final model was not invariant across the disease groups, although most of the items (excluding health and religious expression) performed similarly between those young adults with allergies and those with asthma + allergies.</p>

<body>
<p>Illness intrusiveness is a construct of considerable interest in both pediatric psychology and health psychology research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713478441">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713478441">2</xref></sup> Illness intrusiveness is defined as disruptions in lifestyle, activities, and interests that an individual may experience as a result of a chronic illness diagnosis and treatment. The extant literature supports a model in which both disease and treatment factors can influence subjective well-being (eg, depressive symptoms, quality of life) through perceptions of illness intrusiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713478441">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713478441">4</xref></sup> Poorer subjective well-being is thought to be influenced through the limitation of control and reinforcement in the outcome in daily activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713478441">5</xref></sup> The illness intrusiveness framework suggests that a reduction of involvement in activity contributes to psychological distress by (<italic>a</italic>) limiting positively reinforcing outcomes associated with participation in meaningful activities and (<italic>b</italic>) limiting perceptions of control by taking away one’s ability to achieve positive outcomes and/or avoid negative outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713478441">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129713478441">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS) has been used to assess the extent to which illness and/or treatment interferes with 13 life domains in numerous chronic illness populations, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and transplant (see Devins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713478441">3</xref></sup> and Devins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129713478441">7</xref></sup> for a review), among others. The IIRS has consistently demonstrated good psychometric properties and a 3-factor structure (Instrumental, Relationships and Personal Development, and Intimacy), which was revealed through exploratory factor analysis and corroborated through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) across chronic illnesses disease types (eg, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, organ transplant).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713478441">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713478441">8</xref></sup> The IIRS has also revealed a 1-factor structure when considering individuals with anxiety disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713478441">9</xref></sup> To our knowledge, however, no known studies have examined the factor structure of the IIRS in young adults with allergies and asthma.</p>
<p>Allergies and asthma are 2 of the most common chronic illnesses, affecting more than 50 million and 24.6 million Americans, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713478441">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129713478441">11</xref></sup> Given that symptoms of allergies (eg, obstruction on the nasal cavity, itching, red and/or watery eyes, sneezing, and anaphylaxis) and asthma (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, feelings of tightness in chest, and coughing) can range in severity from mild to life threatening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713478441">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713478441">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129713478441"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713478441"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129713478441">15</xref></sup> it is likely that affected young adults indeed view their illness as intrusive. Additionally, inherent within the disease course of both allergies and asthma, limitations in daily activities, such as missing work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713478441">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713478441">16</xref></sup> or school,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129713478441">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713478441"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129713478441">19</xref></sup> and difficulties with participating in physical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150129713478441">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129713478441"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129713478441">22</xref></sup> may also contribute to perceptions of illness intrusiveness. Notably, the lone research study investigating illness intrusiveness in individuals with asthma demonstrated that increased levels of illness intrusiveness predict higher levels of anxiety, depression, general psychological distress, and number of missed school days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713478441">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Studies investigating illness intrusiveness have found age to be a moderator in the relationship between illness intrusiveness and distress such that young adults with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and renal disease experience more distress than older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713478441">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129713478441">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129713478441">24</xref></sup> Moreover, added stressors that young adults experience due to increased responsibility and independence on transitioning to college can be exacerbated by having a chronic illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129713478441">25</xref></sup> These important life changes have the potential to make young adults especially vulnerable to difficulties in managing their illness, due to leaving home and being in a new environment and not being around family and friends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129713478441">25</xref></sup> In addition to examinations of illness intrusiveness in young adults with asthma, one study documented impaired quality of life and higher depressive and anxious symptoms in young adults with allergies and asthma + allergies compared with healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129713478441">26</xref></sup> Examining the factor structure of the IIRS may help determine whether this scale has utility in screening for intrusiveness of illness symptoms.
</p>
<p>Despite the salience of illness intrusiveness within young adults with allergies and asthma, no known studies have specifically examined the factor structure of this measure within individuals with allergies and/or asthma. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to use CFA to examine both the 3- and 1-factor structure of the IIRS with these populations. Examining the factor structure in these 2 disease groups can inform our knowledge of how the specific domains of intrusiveness associated with allergies and asthma affect these young adults. An additional aim was to examine the invariance of the factor structure of the IIRS across the 2 disease groups, in order to compare the structure of illness intrusiveness between these 2 groups.

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were 454 young adults with allergies (n = 255) or asthma and allergies (asthma + allergies; n = 199) between the ages of 18 and 25 years (mean = 19.39, standard deviation = 1.34). Participants completed the study questionnaires as part of a larger study of the psychosocial adjustment of young adults with allergies and asthma. The majority of participants were female (64.1%), and most self-identified as Caucasian (78.4%). Participants also self-identified as African American (4.6%), Hispanic (3.3%), Native American (7.0%), Multiracial (4.2%), Asian (1.8%), and Other (0.7%). These demographics were consistent with the ethnic diversity of the university where the study was conducted.

Similar to the 3-factor model, modification indices indicated that freeing the error covariance between items 1 (Health) and 4 (Active Recreations) would improve model fit. The revised model (Model 1c) suggested improved fit, with the CFI fit index suggesting adequate fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713478441">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of Models</title>
<p>To compare the model fit between the 3-factor model and the 1-factor model, the AIC values were compared. Overall, the final 3-factor model (Model 3c) had a lower AIC value than the final 1-factor model (Model 1c), suggesting that the 3-factor model offered a better fit to the data than the 1-factor model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2150129713478441">34</xref></sup></p>

<p>Additionally, Model 3c was evaluated for structural invariance across disease group, by estimating a multisample CFA.

Post hoc analyses indicated that factor loadings for items 1 (Health) and 12 (Religious Expression) varied across the groups, with individuals with allergies only having higher factor loading values than those with asthma + allergies for both items 1 and 12, whereas all other items were invariant. Additionally, the results suggested that the factor covariances were invariant, such that the allergy only group did not differ from the asthma + allergies group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to use CFA to examine the factor structure of the IIRS in young adults with allergies and asthma + allergies. Although this measure has shown reliable factor structure across many disease groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713478441">8</xref></sup> this is the first time it has been assessed with individuals with allergies and individuals with asthma + allergies. Additionally, to our knowledge, the factor structure of the IIRS has not been examined in young adults, even though past research has indicated that young adults may be more susceptible to experiencing illness intrusiveness than older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713478441">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129713478441">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129713478441">24</xref></sup> Consistent with previous literature, the 3 factors of the IIRS supported through this CFA included “Relationships and Personal Development” (ie, family and other social relations, self-expression/self-improvement, religious expression, community and civic involvements, passive recreation), “Intimacy” (ie, marital and sex life), and “Instrumental” (ie, work, finances, health, active recreation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713478441">8</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that within these disease groups, a proposed modified structure in the CFA did represent a better statistical fit than the existing purported model. Two modifications were made to the 3-factor model to improve model fit, suggesting that this population possesses unique differences. First, the error covariance between Health (item 1) and Active recreations (item 4) was freed. Health is generally defined as the condition of being sound in body, mind, or spirit, especially freedom from physical disease or pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2150129713478441">37</xref></sup> Therefore, given the theoretical relationship between health and active recreation such that active recreation often includes activities requiring agile movements of the body, which may not be possible without health of body, the error covariance between Health and Active recreations was freed. Freeing the error covariance between these items increased the fit of the 3-factor model. Although speculative, this difference may have emerged due to an increased association between health and active recreation in young adults with allergies and asthma + allergies, given that each of these diseases has the potential to limit the possibility of active recreation.</p>
<p>Additionally, an error covariance was added between religious expression and community/civic involvement. Given that religious expression is often one avenue of community/civic involvement (eg, fellowship with members of the community) and that religious expression often includes additional community/civic involvement (eg, giving back to the community), we elected to free the error variance between these 2 items. Although speculative, this difference from the larger study of adults with chronic illness may have come about within this particular investigation of college students because religious expression may be the main involvement these young adults have within the community.</p>
<p>The structure of the model was invariant and most of the items performed similarly between those young adults with allergies and those with asthma + allergies. The domains of health and religious expression had a stronger relationship to illness intrusiveness for young adults with allergies than those with asthma + allergies. Jolicoeur et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129713478441">17</xref></sup> found that young adults with “allergy only” had increased impairment in functioning compared with “asthma only” or “asthma and allergy”; thus, although speculative, young adults with allergies may be experiencing more difficulties controlling their disease, thus the stronger relationship.</p>
<p>Although the results of the current study provide additional evidence for the use of a 3-factor structure of the IIRS across illness groups, this study is not without limitations. First, though the racial makeup of the sample is representative of the college population from which it was collected, the majority of participants self-identified as Caucasian. The composition of this sample limits the generalizability of the findings to racial or ethnic minorities. Second, this examination was cross-sectional in nature making an examination of whether the factor structure of the measures is affected by time-related variables (eg, disease duration) or by specific illness related events (eg, severity) impossible to test. Third, IIRS data and disease information were collected through self-report questionnaires and were not confirmed by a physician. Finally, the use of a combined asthma + allergies group may be viewed as a limitation; however, it is likely that other studies examining individuals with asthma may have failed to assess for allergies.</p>
<p>Future studies should use these results to test specific domains of interference associated with allergies and asthma. Additionally, researchers should examine the psychometric properties of the IIRS among different age groups with allergies and asthma. It is important to continue to examine this construct in chronic illness populations, particularly in young adults. Researchers investigating illness intrusiveness in individuals with chronic illnesses should be aware of the 3-factor structure of the measure when examining the construct in relation to illness variables and other psychological outcomes. This information may improve other self-report measures for asthma and allergy, specifically, in better understanding the implications of the symptoms of the disease across several life domains (eg, religious expression, diet, family relationships, work). From this perspective, clinicians should be also mindful that the intrusiveness of allergies and asthma + allergies appears to occur within these 3 domains of functioning (Relationships and Personal Development, Intimacy, and Instrumental). Finally, the clinical utility of the measure should be further assessed by determining the relationship between IIRS and coping or adherence behaviors before consistent clinical utility should be considered adequate.</p>
