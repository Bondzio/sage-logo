<abstract>
<p>This article explores the concept of “public commons” and its relationship with travel decisions under a unique setting: street cleaning in the New York City area. Using a natural experimental design, it investigates the impact of street cleaning on car usage for five hundred randomly selected households. Street cleaning encourages car usage for households without off-street parking and discourages car usage for households with off-street parking. The net effect is an increase of vehicle miles traveled by 7.1 percent, at least 27 percent of which is not a mere redistribution from non-street-cleaning days.</p>

<p>You can park your car on the streets of New York, or you can have a full time job, but you can’t possibly do both.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Street cleaning is a common practice in many communities. The process requires that street parking be temporarily removed from the stock of available parking spaces, which affects parking and travel decisions. When streets are cleaned as frequently as once or twice a week, as in dense urban communities such as New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco, it can become a hassle to residents and a contentious local issue. Many opponents to frequent street cleaning claim that the process forces residents to relocate their cars and thereby increases traffic. However, few studies have examined the effects of street cleaning on parking and driving.</p>
<p>To better understand how street cleaning affects driving, a thorough understanding of the dynamics (or distortion) of residential street parking is required. One perspective is to treat residential street parking as a commodity with incomplete pricing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12459360">Shoup 2005</xref>). Most spaces can be used free of cost because few local governments charge directly for their use. As a result, consumers tend to overconsume these underpriced spaces. Another related perspective is property rights, which treats residential street parking as a commons with open access but rivalry in consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12459360">Epstein 2002</xref>), often leading to “the tragedy of the commons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12459360">Hardin 1968</xref>), in which users overconsume the commons without considering the effect on other citizens and society as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X12459360">1</xref></sup> This article takes the property rights perspective and treats the incomplete pricing as given because (1) while street cleaning is not directly related to parking prices, it has strong implications for the property rights of street parking and (2) the phenomenon of price distortion is likely to continue to exist in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In the property rights perspective, consumers are expected to overexploit the parking commons in multiple ways. Some overconsumption behaviors produce excessive traffic in the form of residents cruising for free street parking spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X12459360">Shoup 2007</xref>) and nonresidents attempting to park on neighborhood streets. Other overconsumption behaviors may lead to reduced instead of increased traffic. For example, residents are often reluctant to use their cars due to fear of losing the right to use the street parking space. Some even may attempt to “convert” the public commons into de facto private property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12459360">Epstein 2002</xref>). For example, households sometimes treat streets as a private garage while using their actual garages for storage purposes. These behaviors actually go beyond “the tragedy of the commons” and become a bottom-up “privatization” of the commons.</p>
<p>Local governments normally adopt three residential street parking policies, parking permit, time limits, and street cleaning, to address the above problems directly or indirectly. Each has different assumptions and objectives and allocates the property rights to different user groups. Resident parking permits represent the classical solution to the tragedy of the commons—enclosing the commons to reduce overconsumption. Even though the motivation is primarily driven by the intrusion of nonresidents, parking permits can also reduce the cruising for parking by residents. Time limits address the parking commons problem in a different way. Instead of enclosing the commons, they actually aim to open it up to prevent residents from treating public streets as private garages. Typical policies include maximum parking times of 24 or 72 hours or an overnight parking ban on public streets adopted by many local governments. However, because time limits are normally enforced through complaints, the declaration of public ownership (e.g., towing a vehicle parked illegally on the public street) depends on the declaration of private ownership (e.g., a resident complains only when the vehicle violates his or her perceived “private” property rights). These rules can therefore end up strengthening instead of deterring the perceived private ownership of residential street parking. Time limits can theoretically increase parking turnover and the vacancy rate, thus affecting parking cruising or intrusion by nonresidents, but practically they are rarely set or enforced well enough to do this.</p>
<p>Street cleaning is actually more effective than time limits as a strategy for reclaiming public ownership of street parking. Street-cleaning rules are faithfully enforced in a top-down approach with few loopholes, and the penalty for violation is severe. For example, each year New York City issues about one million parking tickets (12 percent of the total) to parked vehicles that block street cleaning. This large number indicates a contentious battle over the street parking space between the local government and residents. The frequent street-cleaning schedule may also explain the lack of time limits for residential street parking in the City. Street cleaning reclaims the public ownership of street parking by forcing residents to move their parked cars to alternative places. The location and the nature of these alternatives largely determine the impact of street cleaning on car usage and traffic. When households have access to off-street parking in addition to street parking, drivers can move their cars back to garages or driveways, and the effect of temporarily losing street parking on driving decisions can be minimal. However, when street parking is the only option, drivers must move their cars to other streets or simply drive away for work or other reasons. These car trips would not occur if street cleaning were not performed. In other words, street cleaning may encourage car usage and increase traffic.</p>
<p>This article tests the impact of street cleaning on driving using a random sample of five hundred households in the New York City area. Each of these households reported information about their travel patterns on a random weekday, which might be the street cleaning day for some households (treatment group) or a non-street-cleaning day for others (control group). This natural experiment enables us to capture the causal effect of street cleaning on car usage. The results confirm that car usage indeed increases on street-cleaning days for households without off-street parking but surprisingly decreases, though to less extent, for households with off-street parking. This result is most likely caused by differences in quality between off-street and on-street parking. The policy implications of street cleaning in particular and residential street parking in general are discussed through the frameworks of property rights and social equity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0739456X12459360">
<title>Street Cleaning as Parking Policy</title>
<p>Most communities sweep their streets regularly for environmental, health, and safety reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X12459360">2</xref></sup> In New York City, for example, street cleaning is a complex, billion-dollar operation. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) employs more than seven thousand street-cleaning workers and uses some 450 mechanical sweepers to collect garbage and clean six thousand miles of city streets. Its annual budget was about $1.2 billion in 2010. Street cleaning is conducted in 253 sanitation sections in fifty-five districts (out of fifty-nine community districts)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X12459360">3</xref></sup> and covers more than 83 percent of city streets. More than 70 percent of city streets are cleaned at least two days per week (once on each side), and 42 percent are cleaned four or more days per week (two or more days per week on each side). Street-cleaning frequency tends to be high near urban centers and low at the edges.</p>
<p>Because 95 percent of all street litter accumulates within eighteen inches of the curb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X12459360">Fleming 1978</xref>), most cities prohibit curbside parking during cleaning, which normally lasts 90 to 180 minutes. Residents must move their cars off the streets at that time or be fined. Therefore, street-cleaning rules become a de facto street parking policy. These regulations are referred to as the alternate-side parking (ASP) rule in the New York City region because they are in effect on opposite sides of the street on alternate days. Because New York City does not have a resident parking permit program, street cleaning is essentially the city’s residential street parking policy.</p>
<p>ASP rules are often unpopular, in large part because of the inconvenience they cause drivers. In New York City, ASP rules have spawned at least one novel, a parking guidebook, several sitcom episodes, and two companies dedicated to helping New Yorkers outsmart traffic enforcement officers. A New York City resident explained the hassle of street cleaning at a public meeting:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have made work choices based on street-cleaning rules; I have made food choices based on street-cleaning rules; I have made, most invasively of all, allowance for it in my choice of doctors, appointment times, meeting times. My entire life has often revolved around, “Do I need to move my car today?” And do I need to sit in my car for an hour-and-a-half. (Melanie Gold, a former Upper West Side resident, at a public hearing on street-cleaning and ASP rules before the City Council on November 9, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many residents have fought to reduce the frequency of street cleaning in their neighborhoods. However, despite the unpopularity of the rules, the current street-cleaning system has remained very stable since it was launched in the 1950s. Although DSNY is primarily responsible for conducting street cleaning, the operation involves multiple government agencies, including the Department of Transportation (for parking signs and traffic enforcement), the police department (for parking tickets), and the mayor’s Office of Operations (for evaluating street cleanliness through a seven-scale scorecard system). No single agency is completely responsible for street-cleaning and ASP rules. DSNY designed the current 253 sanitation sections in a way that allows all the streets in one section to be cleaned efficiently and takes into account the workload and schedule of each worker.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X12459360">4</xref></sup> Schedules tend to be inflexible, in both temporal and spatial terms. Furthermore, sanitation workers have a strong union, and their work schedules are often heavily regulated by contracts. Therefore, attempts to make changes to cleaning frequency and routing might face operational and political challenges. A dozen community districts have applied to DSNY for reduced cleaning frequency over the past two decades, but only three such requests have been approved.</p>
<p>The street-cleaning situation has begun to change in recent years, partly because of improved efficiency achieved through advances in street-cleaning technology. DSNY can clean streets faster and less frequently and still meet the minimum cleanliness requirements. Streets have been cleaner over the past five to ten years than at any other time since the current street-cleaning system was first launched in the 1950s. Since 2010, three bills have been proposed in the New York City Council to limit street-cleaning days or otherwise change street-cleaning operations. For example, Intro. 287 would eliminate one day of street cleaning in sanitation sections that have two or more cleaning days per week and receive an average cleanliness-acceptability rating of 90 percent or higher over the course of two years. Intro. 113 would limit the number of days that ASP may be in effect on a residential street to a maximum of two. Moreover, Intro. 375 would allow drivers to park cars on the restricted side of the street right after the mechanical sweeper passes, even if the official cleaning period is still in effect (e.g., 8:00–9:30 a.m. on Tuesday).</p>
<p>One key argument in support of reducing street cleaning is that ASP rules encourage car usage and increase traffic. Residents may be forced to cruise for parking or double-park their cars on the other side of the street, waiting for street cleaning to finish, often with their engines idling. However, this argument has not been empirically tested.</p>

<title>Resident Responses to Street Cleaning</title>
<p>Street cleaning temporarily removes a portion of the parking supply from the market. Although street cleaning is short in duration (90–180 minutes), residents often do not have enough flexibility in their schedule to reclaim their parking spaces immediately after street cleaning. Many residents have to find alternative parking spaces in which they can park for a longer time. Accordingly, the ease of finding an alternative parking space and the frequency of street cleaning largely determine how residents respond to street-cleaning regulations.</p>
<sec id="section3-0739456X12459360">
<title>Residents with Only On-Street Parking: Increased Car Usage?</title>
<p>Residents without access to off-street parking rely entirely on the street parking commons. They tend to overconsume street parking because it is underpriced. Such overconsumption can take the form of overparking on residential streets, or reluctance to use cars frequently due to fear of losing free parking spots, especially in a dense urban setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12459360">Weinberger, Seaman, and Johnson (2009)</xref> found that when people have guaranteed parking at home, they are more likely to use cars in their daily lives. Therefore, moving cars and finding alternative parking spaces during street cleaning might represent “extra” driving that would be less likely to occur if street cleaning were not conducted. This study proposes three possible behaviors as common responses to street cleaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X12459360">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>First, some residents drive and search for vacant parking spaces on other streets not subject to street cleaning on that day in the neighborhood. This search for parking might occur one day in advance or immediately before street cleaning starts. In fact, in New York City, the Department of Transportation (DOT) studied traffic volume on nine street segments before and after the suspension of street-cleaning and ASP rules in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12459360">NYCDOT 2008</xref>). They found that traffic volume was 19 percent higher between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on days that ASP rules were in effect than on days when ASP rules were not in effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X12459360">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, residents may choose to double park on the other side of the same street, which is illegal in many cities, including New York, but often tolerated by the local government. As a result, some people may sit in their cars waiting for the mechanical sweeper to pass. Except in mild weather, these cars are often idling with air conditioning turned on, contributing to green house gas emissions and air pollution.</p>
<p>The third type of response, the focus of this article, is that residents may simply make a new trip by car, to work, to school, or elsewhere, that they would otherwise not make were street cleaning not performed on that day. We found evidence of this type of behavior in a household travel survey conducted in 1998 by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X12459360">NYMTC 1998</xref>). For example, one household from the survey (ID = 1,021,062) has four members, two parents and two teenage children. They own two cars, live in a single family attached house in Brooklyn, and do not have off-street parking on-site. The wife works in downtown Brooklyn full-time as a medical therapist, and the husband works as a teacher in the East Village in Manhattan. Their residence is about two minutes away from a subway station. Both parents’ workplaces are well served by the subway and do not seem to have convenient parking options; there is no on-site parking lot or parking garage visible from street views in Google or Bing. Not surprisingly, in the survey, both reported using the subway as their <italic>typical</italic> commuting mode. However, when they reported their specific travel patterns on Wednesday, June 25, 1997, they revealed that they actually drove to their offices instead of taking the subway and parked in free parking lots not far from their workplaces. They did not run any other errands by car; both went directly to work and returned home without making any stops. One reasonable explanation for this change is street cleaning—their street is cleaned from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. every Wednesday, and they have to find alternative parking spaces for their cars. So they may have decided to drive to work to avoid the hassle of finding alternative parking in the neighborhood, adding 7.1 extra peak-hour vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to the busy roads in Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0739456X12459360">
<title>Residents with Off-Street Parking: Decreased Car Usage?</title>
<p>Residents with off-street parking have private parking spaces in addition to free public spaces. Street cleaning removes on-street parking from the available parking stock, but residents with off-street parking may simply move their cars to their garages or driveways if they do not want to drive on street-cleaning days. Therefore, it seems that their travel decisions should not be affected by street cleaning. However, the physical layout of the public street commons and private parking spaces may affect their travel decisions. In dense urban settings, residents may prefer on-street parking as many <italic>choose</italic> to park on the streets even if they have garage or driveway options. For example, after examining the parking options of 568 driving-home trips in the same study area using the NYMTC travel survey, we found that residents with garages are twice as likely to park on streets as they are to pull their cars into garages. For residents with only driveways, not garages, the preference is split—these residents are equally likely to park in their driveways or on the street (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739456X12459360">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We assumed that street parking is popular because of its high utility; it may enable residents to use their off-street parking space for other purposes, such as storage, and it may be more convenient than off-street parking. The latter explanation is especially true in the study area (including some communities in New Jersey) because one’s garage is often narrow, located in the backyard, connected to the street by a narrow alley, or protected by fences and gates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X12459360">Figure 1</xref>). Moving a car in and out of a garage may take more time and require more skill than simply parking on the street. Parking at home, as a transition between two subsequent car trips, might be viewed as a sort of “transaction cost” of driving. The lower the transaction cost, or the more convenient parking becomes, the more likely a customer is to “consume” car trips. In other words, residents may be more likely to use their cars if the cars are parked on the street commons instead of in their private garages.</p>

</fig>
<p>The higher turnover rate for on-street parking relative to off-street parking at home supports this point. For example, on the basis of 513 driving-home trips from the NYMTC survey that did not result in overnight parking in the New York City metropolitan area, we found that the duration of parking on streets was on average 31 minutes shorter than that of off-street parking. A household that had a garage but chose to park on the street averaged 2.5 more unlinked car trips and almost ten more VMT on a typical weekday than a household that had a garage but chose to park off-street, even though the two groups have almost identical levels of car ownership.</p>
<p>By our estimation, if street parking were completely unavailable to households with on-site garages in the study area, approximately 13 percent of car trips would be eliminated, even after controlling for endogeneity between street parking and trip-making decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X12459360">7</xref></sup> This statistic suggests that when on-street parking becomes temporarily unavailable because of street cleaning, residents with off-street parking may reduce their car usage because their cars might be “stuck” in off-street parking spaces instead of in street parking spots that are more conducive to driving.</p>

<title>Natural Experimental Design</title>
<p>This research employs a natural experimental design to capture the causal impact of street-cleaning and ASP rules on car usage. Natural experiments help overcome some of the methodological barriers to making causal inferences with observational data while avoiding the complexity of randomized experiments. Natural experiments have become increasingly prominent in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X12459360">Sekhon and Titiunik 2012</xref>). Classical studies include the analysis of election ads and voter turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12459360">Krasno and Green 2008</xref>), family size and labor supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12459360">Angrist and Evans 1998</xref>), poverty and children’s psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X12459360">Costello et al. 2003</xref>), children’s gender and legislators’ voting patterns on gender-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X12459360">Washington 2008</xref>), and so on.</p>
<p>In our research design, the random process comes from a household’s choice of a particular weekday to report their travel behavior in a travel survey. The day on which the household decided to report (Monday, Thursday, Friday, etc.) can be viewed as a random decision that is unlikely to correlate with street cleaning. For example, in the New York City case, the 11,098 households that participated in the 1998 travel survey reported their travel patterns across the five weekdays almost evenly (20.1, 19.8, 19.4, 19.8, and 20.9 percent). Therefore, this natural randomization process forms two groups—those households who reported their car usage on a street-cleaning day as the treatment group and those who reported their car usage on a non-street-cleaning day as the control group. The “assignment” of a particular household into either group is random, and the two groups should differ only in the treatment—street cleaning. Therefore, differences between their levels of car usage can be attributed to street cleaning.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: For households with off-street parking, street-cleaning and ASP rules may reduce car usage because these rules remove the often-preferred on-street parking temporarily from the parking supply.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>If these hypotheses are correct, the net outcome will be a combination of higher car usage in households with only on-street parking and lower car usage in households with off-street parking. The result of street cleaning could vary from neighborhood to neighborhood depending on the composition of households (with and without off-street parking) and other variables such as built environments, accessibility to transit, and residents’ demographics. Furthermore, even if a household’s car usage increases on a street-cleaning day, this may reflect a simple shift of some trips from a non-street-cleaning day so that the car usage increase is perfectly substituted by an identical decrease on a non-street-cleaning day. If this is true, street-cleaning and ASP rules redistribute trips instead of increasing overall car usage and VMT. Therefore, in addition to the two hypotheses above, the following two questions are also relevant to this research:</p>

<p>where <italic>Tour</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the number of home-based car tours by household <italic>i, S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is a dummy variable representing whether household <italic>i</italic> reports their travel behavior on a street-cleaning day,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0739456X12459360">8</xref></sup> and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> refers to all other control variables associated with household <italic>i</italic>, including household characteristics (e.g., size, income, car ownership, employment, and children), land-use patterns (e.g., block-group-level population density, zip-code-level job density, transit accessibility, road-network accessibility, and land-use mix within a half mile buffer), and other parking attributes (e.g., segment-level crowdedness of street parking and street width).</p>
<p>A home-based tour refers to a sequence of unlinked trips starting from and ending at home. Because car tours are counted and cannot be negative, a linear regression model is not appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12459360">Barmby and Doornik 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X12459360">Schmöcker et al. 2005</xref>). We estimated several different models, including multinomial logit (MNL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12459360">Wen and Koppelman 2000</xref>), negative binomial regression (NBR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X12459360">Wallace, Mannering, and Rutherford 1999</xref>), and ordered probit (OProbit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12459360">Boarnet and Crane 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the two hypotheses, we applied <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0739456X12459360">Equation 1</xref> to two subsamples separately, households with and without off-street parking. We expect that the <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> variable will be statistically significant with a positive sign for households without off-street parking but a negative sign for households with off-street parking. To answer Q1, we added the results from both subsamples together to calculate the net effect for the whole sample. A positive sum indicates that increases in car usage outweigh reductions in car usage. A negative sum indicates the opposite.</p>
<p>To answer Q2, we estimated <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0739456X12459360">Equation 1</xref> for three different types of car tours: overall car tours (ALL), car tours to work or school (WS), and car tours for personal business, shopping, recreational, and social purposes (PSRS). Discretionary travel, such as PSRS tours, caused by street cleaning may substitute for some PSRS tours that would otherwise be taken on non-street-cleaning days, such as weekends. However, the extra mandatory travel, such as WS tours, caused by street cleaning is most likely not substituting for WS tours on non-street-cleaning days. Therefore, if <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> remains statistically significant for WS tours with a positive sign, it is safe to say that street cleaning indeed increased car usage, and did not just redistribute car usage over a weeklong period. However, even if <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> remains statistically insignificant for WS tours, street cleaning and ASP might still be an important issue because they often move trips from nonpeak hours (e.g., weekends) to peak hours (e.g., early morning or later afternoon on a weekday), <italic>exacerbating</italic> road congestion.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The study area comprises north Manhattan (110th street north), Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, plus ten municipalities along the Hudson River in New Jersey. We did not include the Manhattan core because our data collection method, based on street views from Google and Bing, does not work well for the large residential buildings that are concentrated there. Moreover, most requests to change street-cleaning frequency are from neighborhoods outside the Manhattan core. These neighborhoods we use are more relevant to policy makers.</p>
<p>Three data sources are used. The main data source is the most recent household travel diary conducted by NYMTC in 1998, in which households were asked to report the typical weekday travel behavior of all household members. These data are a bit old, but there is no reason to believe that parking behavior has changed significantly over the past thirteen years. This survey provides information on home-based car tours (dependent variable), travel dates, and all controlled independent variables (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). It includes 10,971 households in twenty-three counties in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. More than 1,900 of those households are located in the study region, from which we selected a random sample of 500 households that own cars. Of them, 232 are from New Jersey, 123 from Brooklyn, 82 from Queens, 50 from the Bronx, and 13 from Manhattan. We obtained the home addresses of all households from NYMTC through a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>We obtained street-cleaning and ASP rules information from the Sign Traffic and Accident Terminal User System (STATUS). STATUS is an operational database created and maintained by the New York City DOT. It was built in 1982 and currently provides an inventory of over one million traffic signs in New York City. This database keeps track of the description, location, and installation dates for DOT signs by street segment. The sign usually states the street-cleaning day and time, such as “No Parking Monday and Thursday, 9–12 AM,” with a broom symbol. For the New Jersey communities, we obtained street-cleaning information and ASP rules from field surveys. We matched the street-cleaning information collected in 2011 with the 1998 survey after taking into account street-cleaning schedule changes due to snow,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0739456X12459360">9</xref></sup> holidays,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0739456X12459360">10</xref></sup> and changes to the schedule made between 1998 and 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0739456X12459360">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results show that the New Jersey communities across the Hudson River have a similar street-cleaning schedule to those in New York City. The average frequency in New Jersey is 1.24 days per week, compared to 1.25 days per week in New York City. However, the distribution of cleanings is very different. In New York City, the majority of households are on streets with a two-day cleaning schedule (42 percent), while the majority of New Jersey households are on streets with a one-day cleaning schedule (42 percent). A large share of New York City households have no street cleaning at all (22 percent), while the same figure for New Jersey households is only 11 percent. In summary, New Jersey communities tend to clean streets less frequently than New York City, but New York City has more neighborhoods, most likely those in east Brooklyn and Queens, not subject to street-cleaning rules.</p>
<p>The last data source is street views from Google and Bing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0739456X12459360">12</xref></sup> Because the analysis depends on residents’ parking options, we needed to identify residential parking options for the five hundred households. However, most local governments in the United States collect no residential parking data, and the study region is no exception. Street views offer an efficient and reliable alternative data collection method and have been used to audit pedestrian environments in Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X12459360">Clarke et al. 2010</xref>), to examine the recovery of New Orleans neighborhoods after Katrina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X12459360">Curtis, Duval-Diop, and Novak 2010</xref>), to count sprawling parking lots in Ohio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12459360">Davis et al. 2010</xref>), and to identify household off-street parking in New York City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X12459360">Weinberger 2011</xref>). Street views are limited in that they do not work well for large buildings where parking facilities may not be visible from either street-side or aerial photos. Therefore, we included only small buildings in the study region, primarily single-family homes and small apartments (fewer than twenty units).</p>
<p>There is a time gap between the reporting of travel patterns (1998) and the identification of parking options (2011), and some housing units might have been demolished or completely renovated during this period. In most situations, a visual check is sufficient to judge whether a building was built after 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0739456X12459360">13</xref></sup> We also examined local building permit databases and the Certificate of Occupancy database in New York City. The latter database records when a newly completed building is actually occupied by residents. We excluded from the analysis buildings that appeared in either database between 1998 and 2011.</p>

Within the off-street parking group, 64 households (19 percent) reported their travel patterns on street-cleaning days, while within the on-street parking group 51 households (30 percent) reported on street-cleaning days because this group tends to live on streets with more frequent street cleaning. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739456X12459360">Table 3</xref> summarizes car tour generation by the three tour types for both on-street and off-street parking households.</p>

<p>For households without off-street parking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0739456X12459360">Table 4</xref>) in model 1 for ALL tours, the variable of interest, <italic>street-cleaning day</italic>, is insignificant for the option of one car tour but significant with a positive sign for the option of two or more car tours. These results confirm H1: households without off-street parking tend to make more car tours on street-cleaning days. We found a similar pattern for WS tours in model 2 and PSRS tours in model 4. This result confirms the theory described in the second section: household members may drive to work to avoid street cleaning even if their normal commuting modes are not by car. This finding also answers Q2; the tour increase in model 1 is unlikely to reflect only redistribution of tours from weekends. The net impact on car usage across a whole week’s span is likely to be positive.</p>
<p>For households with off-street parking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0739456X12459360">Table 5</xref>), different patterns emerge. Note that in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0739456X12459360">Table 4</xref>, the six coefficients for <italic>street-cleaning day</italic> in three models are all positive except one (model 1). However, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0739456X12459360">Table 5</xref>, all six coefficients become negative except one (model 6). Two coefficients are statistically significant (5 percent in model 4 and 10 percent in model 5). These results suggest that street cleaning tends to reduce car usage for households with off-street parking, which confirms H2. This relationship holds for ALL tours and PSRS tours, but not for WS tours, suggesting that although street cleaning is sufficiently annoying to encourage households without off-street parking to break their routines and drive to work, it is not annoying enough to cause members of households with off-street alternatives to change their commuting modes.</p>
<p>The NBR and OProbit models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0739456X12459360">appendix</xref>) show similar results. All six models for households without off-street parking have positive signs, one significant at the 1 percent level, two significant at the 5 percent level, one significant at the 10 percent level, and two significant only at the 15 percent level. For households with off-street parking, all six models have negative signs, suggesting a potential discouraging effect of street cleaning on car usage. However, none of these models is statistically significant, indicating that the discouraging effect is much weaker than the encouraging effect on households without off-street parking. The analysis that follows is based on the results of the MNL models.</p>
<p>To measure the scale of the effect, we simulated three policy scenarios. In Scenario 1, we reduced street-cleaning frequency by one day in neighborhoods with two or more street-cleaning days per week (or four or more days per week on both street sides). The change affects primarily households with only on-street parking. This represents an effect similar to that of Intro. 287. In scenario 2, we expanded the reduction to all neighborhoods except those currently without street cleaning, which means a one-day reduction for neighborhoods with two-day per week cleaning schedule and no street cleaning for neighborhoods with one-day cleaning schedule. In scenario 3, we eliminated street cleaning completely from the study region. These policy changes affect the probability of a household traveling on a street-cleaning day and, subsequently, its estimated car usage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0739456X12459360">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X12459360">Table 6</xref> shows, for households without off-street parking, scenario 1 would lead to a decline of the number of ALL tours by 0.101, a 11.7 percent reduction. When street cleaning is completely abandoned (scenario 3), the reduction increases to a significant 32 percent. Across the tour types, the impact is greater on PSRS tours and less on WS tours, as expected. For example, the complete termination of street cleaning (scenario 3) would cause a reduction of 34.8 percent in PSRS tours, but only 18.9 percent in WS tours. The same pattern holds for the other two scenarios.</p>

<p>Note: Scenario 1 = reduce street-cleaning days by one, only in frequent cleaning districts with two or more cleaning days per week; scenario 2 = reduce street-cleaning days by one in all districts; scenario 3 = eliminate street cleaning completely across the whole study region.

</table-wrap>
<p>For households with off-street parking, the same policy changes would increase car usage, but on a much smaller scale. scenario 1 would increase ALL tours by 0.002, a 0.1 percent increase. When street cleaning is permanently eliminated (scenario 3), the increase is 0.016, or 1.2 percent. Again, this effect is primarily for PSRS tours because the <italic>street-cleaning day</italic> variable is insignificant for WS tours in this subsample. This weak effect is understandable because these households have other parking options and thus are less affected by regulation changes that apply to on-street parking.</p>
<p>Although the change in households with off-street parking is smaller, these households predominate in the sample (325 vs. 175), which may change the aggregate effect on car usage. To test the net effect, we first aggregated the individual actual tour changes by household types and then summed them up. We divided this value by the total sample size of 500 to obtain the average tour change for the entire sample. The results are summarized in the “net effect” section in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0739456X12459360">Table 6</xref>. The larger sample size of off-street parking households is not sufficient to offset the large tour changes by households without off-street parking in any of the three scenarios. The net effect for scenario 1 is a decline of 0.034 tours, or 2.8 percent. When street cleaning is removed (scenario 3), the net effect for the entire sample is 0.086 tours, a 7.1 percent reduction. In other words, for households with cars in the study region, street cleaning on average increases car usage by 7.1 percent, at least 27 percent (0.023/0.086) of which is not a mere redistribution from non-street-cleaning days.</p>
<p>Note that this number is the average net effect in the study region. Because the distribution of on-street and off-street parking households varies significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood, the net effect should also show a large variation. To investigate this variation, we computed the same net effect, but for two types of neighborhoods. One is very close to the urban center—the network distance to Times Square is below the 20th percentile (5.34 miles) for the entire sample (500 households). The other neighborhood type is far away from the urban center, with a network distance to Times Square above the 80th percentile (11.42 miles). Each neighborhood has 100 households in the sample. Not surprisingly, the close-to-center neighborhoods have more on-street parking households than off-street parking households (58 vs. 42), while the far-away neighborhoods are dominated by off-street parking households (87 vs. 13).</p>
<p>As expected, the net reduction is much greater in the close-to-center neighborhoods in all three scenarios (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0739456X12459360">Table 7</xref>). When street cleaning is eliminated (scenario 3), the ALL tour reduction is 14.8 percent in this area, in contrast to the 7.1 percent across the entire study region. However, the reduction is very small in neighborhoods far away from the center, at a mere 2.3 percent. In other words, the net (reduction) effect is almost six times stronger in the close-to-center neighborhoods than in the far-away neighborhoods. The contrast is even greater in scenario 1, which reduces street cleaning frequency only in the frequently cleaned neighborhoods, a designation that might largely overlap with the close-to-center neighborhoods. It is possible that in some neighborhoods far away from the city center, the net effect could be an increase instead of a decline in car usage.</p>

<p>Regarding the control variables, many are insignificant in all six models, most likely because the sample offers limited variation both in car usage and in these control variables. If the sample were drawn from the entire metropolitan area and included households with distinct home parking options, some of these variables would likely be significant. For those that remain significant, most perform as expected.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This article investigates how households change their driving patterns during street cleaning, which temporarily modifies the supply and redefines the ownership of residential street parking. As the New York City region case study shows, street-cleaning and ASP rules do indeed force residents without off-street parking to use their cars when they would not otherwise choose to do so due to fear of losing their street parking spots (H1). Street-cleaning and ASP rules may potentially discourage car usage for residents with off-street parking because these regulations temporarily remove street parking spots, which are more conducive to driving than off-street parking (H2). However, the overall effect of street cleaning on car usage for all combined households in the sample is still an increase (Q1). This impact occurs not only on discretionary travel (personal business, shopping, recreational, and social) but also on mandatory travel (work and school), which suggests that the change in car usage caused by street cleaning cannot be explained away as being the result of a simple redistribution from non-street-cleaning days. The overall impact on weekly car usage is most likely significant (Q2). These findings have direct implications on street parking policy in general and street-cleaning operation in particular.</p>
<sec id="section11-0739456X12459360">
<title>Street Parking Commons</title>
<p>These findings shed light on the complexity of residential street parking, an important but often overlooked parking market that can account for more than a third of the total parking stock in a metropolitan area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X12459360">Transport for London 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0739456X12459360">15</xref></sup> This open-access but rivalrous public space exemplifies the tragedy of a commons, but also displays some unique features that may complicate the decision making on residential street parking policy. For example, the findings confirm that “overparking” (overconsumption) in the residential parking commons may lead to a possible reduction in “overdriving” for residents in the road commons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0739456X12459360">16</xref></sup> In other words, one commons’ tragedy may become another commons’ “comedy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X12459360">Rose 1986</xref>). Such a finding certainly enriches our understanding of the commons problem, but meanwhile can potentially complicate the policy-making process regarding how to balance the tragedy and “comedy” between different commons. This point is especially relevant to transportation systems where various types of commons (parking, road, terminal space, etc.) are interconnected, and policy makers have indeed referred to the commons metaphor in their decision making over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X12459360">Wachs 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X12459360">Waller 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X12459360">Coughlin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12459360">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12459360">Porter and Berry 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The complexity of street parking is further manifested by the somewhat “conflicting” residential street parking policies adopted by many local governments. For example, parking permit programs often aim at enclosing the commons to reduce parking intrusion by nonresidents as well as, often a side effect, parking cruising by residents, while time limits or street cleaning often aim to open up the same commons to deter the bottom-up “privatization.” The former solution may reduce the length of individual trips (less cruising) but increase the trips’ frequency for residents, while the latter reclaims the public ownership of street at the cost of increased trip frequency. A full comparison between the two solutions is beyond the scope of this article, but readers should keep in mind that both solutions occur in a distorted market where street parking is free, which is another fact of consideration.</p>
<p>A discussion of the street parking commons is incomplete without mentioning equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X12459360">Raymond 2003</xref>). Street parking primarily serves car owners, often those who are relatively wealthy in major metropolitan areas where car ownership is not ubiquitous. In our sample, the average income for noncar households is $26,000, while that for car-owning households is $48,500 (all in 1998 dollars). Although street cleaning may increase car usage, it helps deter attempts to treat public space as private property. A similar trade-off exists for resident parking permits. Although they remove inefficient traffic from streets, they also allow more private rights on the public commons. The picture is even more complex when street-cleaning frequency is taken into account. Cleaning frequency is normally higher in dense and old neighborhoods that tend to have lower household incomes and lower in low-density and relatively new neighborhoods that tend to have higher household incomes. In our sample, households on streets with no street cleaning have an average income of $48,500, while households on streets with cleanings once or twice per week have an average income of $38,750 and $33,750, respectively. In other words, the current cleaning schedule assigns more private right to public space to the richer than to the poorer. From this perspective, reducing cleaning frequency in the current high-frequency neighborhoods might be progressive. Of course all the above concerns need to be weighed against the benefits of street cleaning. Clean and healthy streets provide amenities to everybody, not just car owners. Reduced cleaning frequency may not only give away more public ownership of a precious resource but also reduce the welfare of the general public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0739456X12459360">
<title>Street-Cleaning Operation</title>
<p>The fact that street cleaning affects car usage does not imply that street-cleaning rules should be designed with traffic reduction in mind. The paramount objective of street cleaning is and should be cleaning streets, despite all “side effects” discussed above. Only after street cleanliness is guaranteed should political pressure be used to adjust street-cleaning frequency. Only after the decision to reduce or increase cleaning frequency has already made and policy makers find the most “effective,” “reasonable,” or “sustainable” way to do it should car usage be considered as a third-order factor in street-cleaning design. It is only in this relatively narrow policy-making environment that the specific findings of this research can enter the equation and enable a refined analysis.</p>
<p>This prescription reflects reality, especially in New York City. The situation in New Jersey might be different because communities tend to be small and street-cleaning operation is simpler. In New York City, the City Council passed Intro. 287 in April 2011 to allow neighborhoods to reduce their cleaning frequency only if they meet the street-cleanliness standard for two years in a row. Such a move becomes feasible only after the adoption of new cleaning equipment and technology that significantly improves cleaning efficiency. However, neighborhoods still need to file an application and receive approval from DSNY, which considers many factors, such as the district’s cleanliness score, rerouting concerns, workers’ schedules, and the DSNY’s own resources. The results of this research can assist this evaluation process. For example, the simulation of Intro. 287 (scenario 1) suggests that the law will produce a car usage reduction of 0.52 miles per household per weekday in the study region. DSNY could apply this number to the number of car owning households in the three New York City boroughs (1.23 million) to obtain the overall potential VMT effect of this policy change. Meanwhile, variation in the cleaning effect from neighborhood to neighborhood could enable DSNY to pay close attention to the existing parking stock in a neighborhood. The same frequency change may reduce VMT in one neighborhood but increase VMT in another, depending on neighborhood parking stock compositions.</p>
<p>Regarding the limitations of this research, it targets only one specific type of response from residents and does not include cruising for parking and car idling while double parked during street cleaning. Another limitation might be the case study itself—the study area is often perceived to be too unique to offer broad policy implications. Still, the results might have implications for other dense urban communities with frequent street-cleaning schedules: a few in the United States, such as San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago, and more in an international context, such as London, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, and Vienna. Studies in lower-density cities with infrequent cleaning service could further our understanding of the effect of street cleaning on parking and car usage and the nature of the street parking commons.</p>

<p>We assumed that, in general, residents with street parking as their only option were able to park on the street in front of or near their residence. Although no such data are available, we believed this assumption was reasonable. If residents cannot park near where they live on a routine basis, many may decide not to own cars, given that they often have other travel options available—these households tend to live in old neighborhoods with convenient public transportation. We did measure street crowding for the 175 households in the sample, and 72 percent of these households are on streets that had at least one empty parking spot visible in street views from Google or Bing. This evidence indirectly supports our assumption. The only data on distance between residence and parking space mentioned in the literature come from <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12459360">Balcombe and York (1993)</xref> in the United Kingdom. They reported that most residents tend to park within 50 meters (150 feet) of their home if they park on the street.</italic></p>

<p>The five hundred households reported their travel behavior on 161 different weekdays from September 1997 to May 1998. We checked the historical weather data from three meteorological stations, at JFK airport, LaGuardia airport, and Central Park. Of the 161 days, only 6 days were affected by snowfall. Five of these days had less than 0.3 inches of snow and no snow accumulated on ground (ground snow = 0). Only one day (March 23, 1998) was affected by heavy snow from the previous day, such that street cleaning may have been suspended. Only one household reported travel behavior on March 23, 1998, but that street did not have a cleaning scheduled on this particular day, so no observations in the data are affected by snowy weather. This feature of the data is partly a result of the fact that travel surveys normally ask people to report their behavior on typical weather days.</p>

<p>New York City suspends street cleaning on thirty-seven holidays. After checking the calendar, we found that three days reported in the NYMTC survey are among those thirty-seven days, and street cleaning would not have been scheduled on these holidays. These days are October 13, 1997 (Columbus Day), October 16, 1997 (Succoth), and October 23, 1997 (Simchas Torah and Shemini Atzereth on the same day). They affect data from seven NYC households. In the New Jersey communities, street cleaning is typically suspended on fourteen holidays. These holidays affect two days for the New Jersey households: October 13, 1997 (Columbus Day) and November 11, 1997 (Veterans Day). Only two households are affected. Among these nine households, only five are on a street with a street cleaning scheduled on the same day. For these five households, the street-cleaning day variable is coded as <italic>no</italic> instead of <italic>yes</italic>.</p>

<p>Street-cleaning schedules have been very stable in both New York City and the New Jersey communities across the Hudson River. After talking with the local DOT staff, we confirmed that only three community districts in Brooklyn (CB2 and CB6) and the Bronx (CB8) changed their street-cleaning frequency from two days per week to one day per week between 1998 and 2011. No such changes were found in the New Jersey communities. This change affected twenty observations, and all their cleaning schedules were returned to the prechange 1998 schedule for data purposes.</p>

<p>Google and Bing were used at the same time because their pictures often offer different visual perspectives. Pictures from one source may be blocked by a truck or miss a narrow alley. The two data sources enable better coverage. Bing Maps also has a bird’s-eye view that allows a visual check from four angles, not just from the street side.</p>

<p>What matters here is whether the building changed its parking status by adding or losing off-street parking after 1998. Such a change normally occurs when the original building is demolished or a new building is constructed. Minor modifications typically do not change the parking status between off-street and on-street parking. Adding a curb cut to an existing old building is extremely difficult due to strong opposition from the neighborhood because everybody else will lose one precious street parking spot. The <italic>New York Times</italic> reported several such stories in 2011. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if we do not see a new building or a building is not found in the Certificate of Occupancy database, a building’s parking status between 1998 and 2011 remained the same.</p>

<p>We conducted the simulation using the following rule: Suppose forty households in the sample are subject to two street-cleaning days per week. Sixteen of them reported their travel pattern on a street-cleaning day (<italic>street-cleaning day dummy</italic> variable = 1). Assume that one street-cleaning day is eliminated (reduced by 50 percent), and, by chance, only 50 percent of the initial households (16/2 = 8) should report their travel patterns on a street-cleaning day. We randomly selected eight households from the original sixteen as the households that reported their travel patterns on a street-cleaning day.</p>
