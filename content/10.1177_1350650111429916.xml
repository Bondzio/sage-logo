<p>This article describes the tribological characterization of dispersions consisting of irradiated poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) micropowder (Zonyl® MP1100) and an ester oil (Synative ES TMP 05).</p>
<p>A series of PTFE/oil dispersions were prepared with different amounts of PTFE micropowder (10–25 wt%) to study the influence of the PTFE in these dispersions on their tribological properties. The PTFE/oil dispersion with 10 wt% PTFE micropowder was additionally synthesized in the presence of two additives which are derived from phosphoric acid to study the influence on the tribological properties. In addition, a physical mixture of the ester oil and the PTFE micropowder was prepared to illustrate the impact of the chemical coupling reaction with regard to the tribological properties.</p>
<p>A higher concentration of PTFE micropowder more clearly reduces the coefficient of friction in the ester oil. Low coefficient of friction and transition values from static to dynamic friction were observed. The resistance to wear was increased with the amount of PTFE micropowder in the dispersions and clearly reflects the difference between chemical coupling and physical mixture of the components.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650111429916" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the first part, <italic>Synthesis and rheological characterization</italic>, a series of ester oil dispersions containing irradiated poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) micropowder (Zonyl® MP1100) were prepared. New covalent bonds arise owing to the chemical reaction between the peroxy radicals of the PTFE micropowder and the olefinic non-saturated groups of the ester oil under the chosen preparation conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650111429916">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have studied the effect of the amount of PTFE micropowder as well as the influence of additives on the tribological properties of the resulting PTFE/oil dispersions. The irradiated PTFE/oil dispersions have the potential to act as lubricant additives, in contrast to the physical mixture of the ester oil and the same PTFE micropowder. As physical mixtures, PTFE/oil dispersions are indicated, which have been produced at temperatures ϑ &lt; 100 °C at constant shearing load. This physical mixture is indicated by the fast separation of both components.</p>
<p>Our investigations can contribute to an enhanced comprehension of the relationship between the amount of PTFE micropowder and the degree of coupling to the ester oil molecules as well as the kinds of resulting structures in the oil dispersion, their rheological and tribological behaviours, and the generation of ways of influencing this property for the development of lubricant additives.</p></sec>

<p>The rotational rheometer MCR 301 (Anton Paar, Germany) could also be used as a tribometer by mounting a tribology cell in order to explore <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves and static friction measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650111429916">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650111429916">5</xref></sup> The set-up, based on the ball-on-three-plates principle, consists of a non-coated 100-Cr-6-steel ball, an inset with three small non-coated and brushed 100-Cr-6-steel plates, and a bottom stage moveable in all directions on which the inset can be fixed. All measurements were carried out at ϑ = 20 °C and a normal force (<italic>F<sub>N</sub></italic>) at 5 N. From this normal force, the normal load (<italic>F<sub>L</sub></italic>) is calculated. The normal load is the force vertical to the friction surface of the plates. The measuring ball is rotating with a speed from which the sliding speed (<italic>v<sub>s</sub></italic>) is calculated. To maintain the speed, a certain torque (<italic>M</italic>) is required, which is measured by the rheometer and from this torque, the frictional force (<italic>F<sub>R</sub></italic>) is calculated. The quotient of normal load and frictional force represents the coefficient of friction (<italic>µ</italic>). The sliding distance (<italic>s<sub>s</sub></italic>) is calculated from the ball radius (<italic>r</italic> = 6.35 mm) and a displacement angle (<italic>φ</italic>) measured by the rheometer. A speed ramp of the range 0.001–1 m/s was applied and the resulting coefficient of friction was studied.</p>
<p>In addition, the PTFE-containing ester oil dispersions were characterized in terms of wear resistance according to <italic>Brugger</italic> (DIN 51347-2) at ϑ = 25 °C. Depending on the lubricating properties, the rotating roller produces different wear scars onto the fixed cylinder. The scar has the shape of an ellipse. The main axes of the ellipse are measured with a magnifier. Thus, the projection surface of the wear scar is calculated. The quotient of the pressure force and the projected surface of the wear scar is indicated as the load-carrying capacity of the lubricant according to <italic>Brugger</italic> (MPa).</p>
<p>The Shell four ball (VKA) test was used for studying the wear behaviour at a certain surface pressure in the mixed friction area according to DIN 51350-2/-3 at ϑ = 25 °C. For the characterization, 100-Cr-6-steel balls were used (<italic>r</italic> = 6.35 mm). The test procedure was modified as usual to determine the long-term behaviour of extreme pressure (EP) and anti-wear (AW) additives. The ball rotates for 1 min on the stationary balls under a relatively high loading of 1000 N. Then, the wear marks, which form as spherical calottes on the three stationary balls, are measured. An average wear diameter is stated. The welding load was determined in steps of 200 N for 1 min, respectively. The higher the value for the welding load, the better is the lubricating effect under pressure loading.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec11-1350650111429916"><title>Tribological characterization of PTFE-containing oil dispersions</title>
<p>The characterization of the tribological properties of PTFE/oil dispersions with different concentrations of PTFE micropowder was followed by the tribometer platform on the rheometer MCR 301. The dispersions were added into the tribology cell on three non-coated 100-Cr-6-steel plates, which serve as friction bodies. All experiments are double-estimated. The maximal <italic>Hertzian stress</italic> between ball and plate geometry for <italic>F<sub>N</sub></italic> = 5 N was calculated according to equation (1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650111429916">6</xref></sup> and amounts ∼690 MPa
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1350650111429916"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111429916-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The coefficient of friction as a function of the sliding speed was plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429916">Figure 2(a)</xref> for both the ester oil and the PTFE/oil-dispersions. The maximum values of the coefficient of friction were evaluated according to the shape of the <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves. An influence of the amount of PTFE micropowder on the coefficient of friction was obviously observable. The course of both <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves indicates three areas, in which the coefficient of friction was differently influenced by the sliding velocity and the amount of PTFE micropowder, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429916">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves show a maximum, which represents the maximum coefficient of friction. The position of the maximum is affected by the presence and the amount of chemical compatibilized PTFE micropowder and slightly changes at higher sliding velocities. The influence of the PTFE micropowder in the dispersions is visible particularly at small sliding velocities at a considerably lower coefficient of friction in comparison with the ester oil. This indicates that in the transition between boundary friction to mixed friction conditions, at low sliding velocity, the friction-reducing effect of the chemically coupled PTFE micropowder appears clearly and this leads to the conclusion that a larger amount of PTFE more clearly influences the tribological properties of the dispersion at lower sliding velocity.
<fig id="fig2-1350650111429916" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><italic>Stribeck</italic> curves of PTFE/oil dispersions with increasing amount of PTFE and the study of the influence of additives in the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111429916-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The additives (Crafol AP-24 and Crafol AP-63) based on phosphoric acid were used to study their influence on the tribological behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1, containing the lowest concentration of PTFE micropowder (10 wt.%).</p>
<p>The resulting <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429916">Figure 2(b)</xref> indicate a small friction-reducing effect and a shift of the maximum value of the coefficient of friction compared to the unmodified PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1. This behaviour is based on the faster adsorption of the phosphoric acid-derived additives on the metal surface. The low difference between both additives can be attributed to the influence of the different aliphatic substituents. The curve course at higher sliding velocities of both modified PTFE/oil dispersions No. 2 and No. 3 is similar to that of the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1 and may reflect the fact that the layers formed by the additives have been sheared off again at higher sliding velocity (0.05–0.1 m/s). These investigations have shown that the additives in the dispersions No. 2 and No. 3 can reduce the coefficient of friction compared to the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1, without additives, particularly with regard to small sliding velocities (up to 0.001 m/s).</p>
<p>The values of the coefficient of friction for the PTFE/oil dispersion at higher sliding velocity are in the range 0.04–0.05 and indicate both the direct contact between PTFE mircopowder on the steel surface and the fluid friction effect made by the oil.</p>
<p>By means of the rheological characterization, it has to be assumed that the structures formed provide an essential contribution to the tribological behaviour in the dispersions containing more than 20 wt.% PTFE. This conclusion is also confirmed by the influence of the additives on the behaviour of the lowest concentrated PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 1). These additives are able to reduce the coefficient of friction of this dispersion and move the maximum of the <italic>Stribeck</italic> curve to higher sliding velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650111429916">Figure 2(a)</xref>).</p>

<p>In part 1, <italic>Synthesis and rheological characterization</italic>, it was shown that both additives increase the separation velocity clearly and change the separation behaviour of the PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 1) from a steady separation behaviour to flocculated particle networks. That means that a change of the kinetic of the sedimentation process occurred by a modification of the particle interactions. The effect of the additive Crafol AP-24 is strong enough to induce an elastic part in the PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1, proved by rheological investigations.</p>
<p>A similar study on the series of greases also found a correlation between rheological and tribological properties in terms of the influence of the storage modulus (<italic>G</italic>′) on the bearing performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650111429916">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the transition between static and dynamic frictions was determined to follow up the influence of the PTFE amount on the coefficient of friction in the field between boundary and mixed friction conditions. These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650111429916">Figure 4</xref>.
<fig id="fig4-1350650111429916" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Evaluation of the transition between static and dynamic frictions in dependence of the amount of PTFE micropowder.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650111429916-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the case of neat ester oil, the transition between static and dynamic frictions occurs at low sliding velocity accompanied by the highest coefficient of friction (0.14 &lt; <italic>µ</italic> &gt; 0.15). The effect of the chemical coupling reaction between PTFE micropowder and the ester oil reflected in the decrease of the coefficient of friction. That means that the transition between static and dynamic frictions depends on the amount of PTFE in the dispersions. In the case of dispersions with higher amounts of PTFE micropowder, the increase of sliding velocity at this transition indicated that the dynamic friction condition occurs later than in the case of neat ester oil and in the case of dispersion No. 1, respectively. In this dispersion, a high fine fraction with particle sizes between 0.2 and 0.4 µm was proved and discussed in part 1, <italic>Synthesis and rheological characterization</italic>. Furthermore, the particle size increases with the rising amount of PTFE micropowder in the dispersion. This fine fraction in dispersion No. 1 can be responsible for the earlier appearance of the transition to the dynamic friction condition. This behaviour is very strongly changed by the use of the phosphorus-containing additives. Both additives can lower the coefficient of friction of the first dispersion (No. 1), however, only at the expense of an increasing sliding velocity, in particular for Crafol AP-63.</p>
<p>By means of this evaluation, the transition between boundary and mixed friction areas could be described. On making a comparison between the sliding velocities with the coefficient of friction at this transition, the influence of the additives as well as the amount of PTFE micropowder is observable since the transition of boundary friction to the mixed friction conditions is achieved at higher sliding velocity and changed coefficient of friction.</p>
<p>The characterization of the resistance to wear according to <italic>Brugger</italic> is an important method for finding the optimal lubricant with regard to the load-carrying capacity. The measurements showed a good reproducibility of the results. The load-carrying capacity of the PTFE/oil dispersions, according to <italic>Brugger</italic>, increases with the increase in the amount of PTFE micropowder to values considerably greater than 60 MPa, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429916">Figure 5</xref>. This value characterizes the resistance to wear of usual high-performance oils. The comparison between two ester oil dispersions which contain equal amounts of PTFE (3 wt.%), however, distinguished by the way of preparation (physical mixed, chemical coupled), provides a considerable proof of the effectiveness of the chemical coupling between the ester oil and the PTFE micropowder. A very low <italic>Brugger</italic> value (46 MPa) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650111429916">Figure 5</xref> for the physical mixture of the ester oil and the PTFE micropowder. The higher <italic>Brugger</italic> values can be faulty because of the evaluation of the <italic>Brugger</italic> values and therefore are indicated in brackets.

<p>The VKA test represents a simple test of the lubricity under high pressure and permits direct conclusions to the performance of various additives having EP and AW characteristics. The <italic>Hertzian</italic> pressure in the case of the ball-on-ball principle has the same value as that calculated for the ball/area contact in the tribology cell because of the equal ball diameter of 12.5 mm in both cases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429916">Figure 6</xref> shows the characterization of the neat ester oil and the PTFE/oil dispersion (No. 5) containing 20 wt% of PTFE micropowder. A distinct drop of the wear rate is shown as a result of the chemical coupling in the PTFE/oil dispersion. The welding load was increased to the same extent as the wear was reduced.

<p>The ester oil dispersion No. 5 and the neat ester oil were used as additives in a lubricant on synthetic basis. These mixtures contain 3 wt.% of additives and were prepared by a high-speed mixing system (VMA Getzmann, Germany) at temperatures higher than 100°C. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650111429916">Figure 6</xref>, it is to be recognized that the lubricant on synthetic basis provides similar results than the ester oil in the VKA test. The mixture of the lubricant with the ester oil shows a better wear behaviour at slightly increased welding load compared to the unmodified lubricant. On the other hand, the ester oil dispersion No. 5, used as an additive in the lubricant, has a more distinct effect on the wear than the neat ester oil in the mixture with this lubricant. The welding load is also positively affected. From this follows that the chemical-coupled PTFE micropowder in the ester oil is able to increase the wear resistance and the welding load. This effect is particularly recognizable in the mixture with the lubricant on synthetic basis.</p>
<p>From these results, the use of an additive in lubricants can be deduced, particularly with regard to the improvement of the wear resistance.</p></sec></sec>

<p>This article presents the results of the tribological characterization of dispersions containing irradiated micropowder of PTFE and ester oil (Synative ES TMP 05). Dispersions were prepared by the reaction between radicals of PTFE micropowder and the olefinic non-saturated groups of the ester oil to use them as additives in lubricants to enhance their lubricating properties, e.g. extreme pressure (EP) behaviour and wear resistance. The amount of PTFE micropowder in the dispersion varied from 10 wt% to 25 wt%.</p>
<p>By the use of rotation measurements, the change of the coefficient of friction as a function of sliding velocity was followed. The resulting <italic>Stribeck</italic> curves showed that a higher concentration of PTFE more clearly reduces the coefficient of friction of the ester oil.</p>
<p>It was found that the quantity of PTFE micropowder affects both the separation stability and the coefficient of friction as a result of structures, which were clearly proved by rheological investigations in the higher concentrated PTFE/oil dispersions (from 20 wt% PTFE micropowder).</p>
<p>The dispersion containing 10 wt% of PTFE micropowder showed the highest stability against separation due to the pronounced high fine fraction of PTFE particles (0.2–0.5 µm). However, this property does cause neither a structure formation nor a reduction of the coefficient of friction. In addition, two additives, on the basis of phosphoric acid, were used to study whether they are able to affect the properties of this low-concentrated PTFE/oil dispersion. Both additives cause a reduction of the coefficient of friction in the dispersion No. 1. Furthermore, it can be recognized that the maximum of the <italic>Stribeck</italic> curve is moved to higher sliding velocities. However, the evaluation of the transition between static and dynamic frictions provides that both additives delay the occurrence of the dynamic friction although both additives reduced the friction coefficient in PTFE/oil dispersion No. 1. These results correlate well with the findings obtained by the <italic>Brugger</italic> and the VKA tests, respectively.</p>
<p>By means of these results, a relation between the formation of these structures on the tribological properties is visible.</p></sec>
