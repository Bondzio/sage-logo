<p>The best moments happen when students begin to realize how much power they have and use that power to <italic>create</italic>. Composing as they master different instrumental stages helps students make composition and performance a natural step in learning. A step-by-step process (rhythm notation, add pitches, copy to a five-line staff, check work, and play) keeps the work attainable and eases frustration. Repeating the exercise often allows students to make simple steps into more complicated structures (scales, major to minor, etc.) Students play their pieces for and with each other, then for others outside the music room, making performance attainable and easy. When our students leave us, we want them to be fully fluent in our musical language. The children are empowered by what they create, what they perform, and by becoming composers.</p>

<p>Teaching recorder playing is one of my favorite tasks. I love walking the children through the different stages of playing, from the single note “B” to scales and compositions. The best moments, however, happen when students begin to realize how much power they have and use that power to <italic>create</italic>.</p>
<p>On my campus, we teach the recorder only in the fourth grade. It takes, by and large, the entirety of the fourth grade year to complete. Several times throughout the year, I have a special composition project I complete with the classes. In the beginning, we craft our music almost completely together as a class. (My classes range from 18 to 35 students.) By the final time the students tackle this project, they create their compositions completely on their own <italic>and</italic> they must collect signatures for having performed their piece for others.</p>
<p>Once the class has mastered playing the pitches “B,” “A,” and “G,” I assign the first project. I ask the class to gather at the board, where I’ve drawn a four measure rhythm line staff in 4/4 time. The starting and ending notes are quarters. I ask the class to suggest rhythms to complete the staff. As they create the rhythms, volunteers complete writing the rhythms on the board. Once the rhythm is complete, we clap and chant the rhythm together and admire our wonderful work. If we are satisfied, we move on. If there are changes the class would like to make, we adjust as necessary (establishing or refining patterns, etc.).</p>
<p>Once the rhythm has been performed, I add the pitch “G” below the first and last notes. I then ask the class to provide pitches for the rhythms they’ve created, asking that they use only the three pitches we know on the recorder: B, A, and G. As each pitch is chosen, we sing our composition as a class. This allows us to hear and make artistic choices regarding our tune. Again, volunteers scribe the class’s work. Once complete, we perform on our recorders. This allows the children who find audiation a challenge to concretely hear what we have composed. As a class, we discuss the tunefulness of our composition, the mood, refine the melodic “hook,” and so on, and make adjustments as we see fit.</p>
<p>At this point, I draw a treble clef staff above the rhythm staff on the board, time signature 4/4 and with the key signature of G Major. I ask for four volunteers to copy the class work from the rhythm staff onto the melodic staff, one child per measure. Once done, we check the work and then play our class tune again. How dazzling! How inspiring!</p>
<p>I admire the wonderful work of our combined efforts, and let the students know I’ll copy down this amazing composition. The next week, they’ll have their class composition to add to their recorder folders. WOW! We create a title, add it to the board, and note the class as composer in the appropriate location.</p>
<p>The next week, the class receives their individual copies . . . and a worksheet. I quickly recap the steps:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371311407662" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Notate a rhythm on a line staff (4/4 time, first and last notes are given—quarter notes).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Add pitches below your rhythm. Play to make sure you have the sound you want.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Copy your pitches and rhythms to the five-line staff above. Play again to double check your work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Check your notation and tune. Complete!</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The worksheet I’ve created (found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) shows the suggested rhythms (quarter rest, half note, quarter note, two-eighth pair), reminds what 4/4 means, and provides the lines and spaces for B, A, and G.</p>
<p>In our district, students begin composing early, using Orff instruments. Students learn to describe the sounds of tunes and make choices as to mood. High sounds, low sounds, large leaps, and a tall melody versus a shallow or narrow range, where is “home base”/tonic, and so forth, all affect a “feel” of mood.</p>
<p>When we begin this project, absolute pitches/letter names are often chosen at random. When I check a student’s work, I ask them about the “tunefulness” of their choices and what their goal for mood may be. If all pitches are either A or B, will their tune be interesting to a listener? If the letters are chosen at random, will the music sound planned (composed)? If you want a Major sound, will you have more “G”s or “E”s? If you spend most of your time on “G”s or “D”s, then end on “E,” will the listener be surprised? Why? How will the tune change if you spend more time on “E” with only one “G”? (These are, by the way, conversations we’ve held in Grades 2 and 3 as we compose and improvise.)</p>
<p>As a group, I help the students work through the four steps, completing their own compositions. As students finish each step, they bring their papers to me to check their work. I initially look for the correct “math” within measures, then “tuneful” pitch use. Most students do very well with these steps. A few run into challenges moving their tune to the staff. I work with students or assign them “mentors” (partners who have demonstrated mastery of these concepts, a coveted position) as needed to help as they complete their work.</p>
<p>A note here, if you will forgive the pun: I do modify this assignment as students’ IEPs require. Shortened assignments—one or two measures rather than four; Reading assistance—a “Mentor” reads for them; students who don’t write—a “Mentor” takes dictation from them; the number of choices must be restricted—only quarter, two-eighth pairs, and rests, please. Additional time requirements are the only challenge. As I only see the students for one 50-minute period a week, I don’t have the option of allowing a child time beyond my course. Additional time must be granted by allowing the student to take their paper home. This has always been sufficient. I highlight directions, draw beat “lines” under each measure of the rhythm staff, and (as always) assign “Mentors” to help as needed. These modifications, I must say, are seldom required in Music class.</p>
<p>This usually takes one complete class to finish. Anyone needing more time is welcome to take their paper home to complete. The bottom of the paper has one more step, however,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After you have written your piece, practice playing your music. Then practice playing with a friend. Prepare to play your piece for the class in our concert!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That’s right! The next class, everyone brings out their work. I ask for groups of three or four children to meet together and practice playing each other’s compositions. We move about the room, pinning our pieces to the wall or using one of the music stands. The class all practices for about 10 minutes. At this point, all the groups sit down. We “rock, paper, scissors” to decide which group plays first, and then our concert begins. Once a piece has been played, the composer raises their hand so we may applaud their creativity. Each group plays all compositions until everyone’s work has been heard.</p>
<p>The students very much enjoy this project. I repeat this several times throughout the year, as time permits, with small changes to what we do and what is asked of the composers. In this way, composition and small group performance are very natural steps in the recorder learning process.</p>
<p>When the class has mastered the pentatonic scale (B, A, G, low E, low D), we repeat this project with a twist. I review the steps with the class, but we do not create a product on the board together. I guide the class through the project as a group, pointing out that the first and last pitches are now “E”, so our music will have a very different “feel.” (In our district, “minor” is taught as part of the recorder playing process.)</p>
<p>The class and I discuss the new tonic and I ask for the solfège name. “If G is do, then low E is . . .” La! We’ve experienced la pentatonic in third grade, so the tonality is familiar. To bring it back into their ears, and to prepare them for a truly “minor” version of this worksheet later, I play a few “minor” listening examples of music: mysterious, suspenseful, calm, or thoughtful. We talk about the sounds that we can create and I ask the class, as individuals, to pick a goal for their tune. How can they create this sound? Which rhythms will help set their mood? They have to end on E . . . How will they approach this last sound? How will their approach to the final note affect the mood they want to create? These are melodic questions, putting the students in the position of critically thinking about sound and interval use. More questions frequently encountered: What will a large leap sound like in this tune? Will small steps work better with the rhythms they have chosen or large leaps? Let’s sing to find out. If you have a busy rhythm, will leaps or steps better suit the mood of your music? Finally, if they have a busy rhythm and many large leaps, will they have to perform more slowly than suits the mood they have chosen? Are they willing to practice as needed in order to perform what they have written? My personal favorite: this tune is lovely (exciting, powerful). I see you have chosen to change your mood because you are excited about the tune you have created! That is GREAT!</p>
<p>As before, I help the students work through the four steps, completing their own compositions. As students finish each step, they bring their papers to me to check their work. This time, however, I ask them about their goal for the piece. Which mood did they choose? Do their rhythms help create this? Do their pitches work tunefully for their sound? Adjustments are made and individuals begin practicing their music. This usually takes two classes to complete. Students who work more quickly will often choose to compose more lengthy compositions, to title their compositions, write their name in the appropriate location as composer, etc. I am always prepared with a bit of extra staff paper I “just happen to have on hand” for their use.</p>
<p>With this project, I ask the students to play their own compositions as a solo for the class. I introduce this concept in a rather sneaky method, however, easing the students into a natural expression of solo performance. Once the compositions are all finished, I ask the students to write the numbers 1 to 5 on the back of their papers. I ask the students to approach someone they know and ask, “Will you please listen to my composition for Music class?” Or “Will you please listen to me play?” Once a person has served as audience, the student collects their signature on the back of their composition. I give the class some time for a few concerts and signature collections in the music room, but some should be from home (or childcare, etc.) as well. I’ve had signatures from karate practice, youth group, and cooking class!</p>
<p>This time, the students provide a full concert for each other, everyone playing their composition for the class. I ask for a few volunteers, whom I record, and I e-mail the recordings to administrators, PE teachers, classroom teachers, (home), and others as requested.</p>
<p>I find this project especially useful because it covers so many pedagogical bases in such a smooth manner. The step-by-step process breeds accessibility and attainability, making students accountable for their work, from critical thinking through creative and artistic responses and the following performance opportunities. Likewise, I hope this project will be attainable for teachers of all compositional comfort levels, allowing an easy project to hit many skill development areas at once (a gem of a find): performing on instruments, composing, reading/notating, evaluating one’s own work, and so on.</p>
<p>The students truly love this project. It grows on them each time they complete it. By the end of the year, I have musical groans and head rolls when they see the worksheets waiting, but they are only partially honest. When our students leave us, we want them to be fully fluent in our musical language: singing, playing, reading, writing, and composing. Projects such as “Recorder Composer” take the mystery out of the composition process. Have an ear-worm of your own making in your head? Write it down. Like that song on the radio? Don’t want to forget it? <italic>Write it down</italic>. The children are empowered by what they create, what they perform, and by becoming <italic>composers</italic>. I am gratified, as their music teacher, knowing my students have the skills to be independent musicians.</p>
