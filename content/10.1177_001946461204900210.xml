<p>Deborah Sutton’s history of colonisation in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India uncovers a substrate of unstable administrative discourse laying beneath more reassuring, bucolic representations of the Hills, such as that penned by Viceroy Lytton to his wife in 1876: ‘The afternoon was rainy and the road muddy [in Ootacamund], but such beautiful <italic>English</italic> rain, such delicious <italic>English</italic> mud. Imagine Hertfordshire lanes, Devonshire downs, Westmoreland lakes, Scotch trout streams, and Lusitanian views’ (cited in Sutton, p. 1). If descriptions like Lytton’s evoke both a vision and an ideology of landscape whose conventions are now broadly familiar to historians of imperial Britain, then the ‘other landscapes’ of Sutton’s title were far less stable entities, and far less amenable to idealisation. By ‘landscape’ Sutton means something both more and less than that conjured up by a term like ‘the picturesque’. For Sutton, landscapes are composite entities, constructed from both social and natural phenomena that exist for some particular purpose. The purpose that looms largest in her analysis is that of establishing ‘jurisdiction’ over various kinds and qualities of territory under the purview of the nineteenth-century colonial state.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in India, the colonial state’s efforts to delineate tenures that would define rights in landed property often hinged on a rhetorical assertion of respect for indigenous practice. In the Nilgiris, too, this assertion provided an enduring rationale for the state’s arguments and policy decisions. Sutton illustrates this point early in the book, detailing how in the 1820s John Sullivan, the Collector of Coimbatore and one of the area’s earliest British settlers, successfully claimed legal possession over a number of plots of land he had privately acquired by as-serting his adherence to local tradition. In particular, Sullivan claimed to have purchased his land in accordance with a practice followed by other cultivator groups by paying a fee in kind, called <italic>gudu</italic>, to the pastoralist Todavur (Toda) community, whom he described as the hereditary proprietors of the Nilgiris ‘from an antiquity remote beyond the reach even of tradition’ (Sullivan cited in Sutton, p. 16). Though the Madras authorities eventually disqualified this practice when it became obvious that Sullivan’s understanding of the nature and function of <italic>gudu</italic> had little grounding in reality—for example, an 1849 cadastral survey of the area carried out by J. Ouchterlony found that <italic>gudu</italic>, as a measure of the extent of rights, was ‘in fact “unmappable”’ (p. 55)—this did not stop a range of other indigenous groups in the area from asserting both proprietary and usufruct rights according to the same general principle.</p>
<p>Examples like this are a central focus of Sutton’s book: tortuous efforts by the state to codify and regulate land rights whose legitimacy (at least in official circles) stemmed from claims to organic continuity with longstanding local practices. In the Nilgiris, the latter were complex and multiple, incorporating a range of pastoralist communities, shifting and permanent cultivators, waste, pastureland, fertile valley soil and forests pregnant with remunerative potential. A core argument of the book is that the colonial state’s elaboration of rights in land was prompted by the need to transform or <italic>remove</italic> them—rather than to construct a comprehensive settlement—in order to facilitate colonisation by White settlers. Over time this produced a patchwork of inconsistent and overlapping jurisdictional arrangements, and therefore a number of disparate ‘landscapes’.</p>
<p>State practice inevitably introduced novel qualities and objects into a discourse on property, terms whose efficacy in deciding legal issues depended but little on the quality of local knowledge they derived from. The overall impact of these policies on lives and livelihoods in the Nilgiris included—as was true in so many other regions of colonial India—increasing abstraction in the management and definition of forests, the gradual replacement of subsistence by commercial farming and increasing indebtedness among the indigenous and migrant owners and cultivators who opted out of the plantation system.</p>
<p>Sutton develops these arguments in seven loosely chronological chapters followed by a brief but useful conclusion. The early chapters introduce the processes of defining and adjudicating rights in property that recur throughout the book, including an important chapter on their interpellation within colonial cartography. Chapter 4, the middle chapter of the book, assesses changes in local labour cycles and practices that these machinations necessitated. Chapter 5 documents the discursive production of two separate orders of forest in the Hills: one that was scientifically knowable and potentially profitable, tied into plantation (especially tea) economies; and another that was seen as marginal and unproductive, remnant areas of ‘primeval’ jungle called <italic>shola</italic> that came to signify exotic indigeneity. The final two chapters illustrate how later nineteenth century ethnographic knowledge about Toda habitations (<italic>munds</italic>) and funerary rituals (<italic>kedr</italic>) helped complete a long process of spatial and conceptual isolation through which aboriginal landscapes in the Nilgiris became seen as sites of atemporal exotic spectacle. Together the last chapters illustrate how Toda landscapes acquired a stable presence in imperial history and travel writing as civilisation’s necessary Other.</p>
<p>Government documents unapologetically form the primary archive of <italic>Other Landscapes</italic>, though Sutton also deploys ethnographic and travellers’ accounts to useful effect. Her method is thus largely that of discourse analysis, though few works in this genre contain the richness of detail and clarity of analysis Sutton achieves. Despite the impressive elegance of the work, however, two issues seem to call for further analysis. The first is the question of how the history Sutton documents in the Nilgiris was distinctive from other, similar areas in colonial India. There is almost no discussion in the book of the vast and impressive his-toriography on land settlement in colonial India, and the author has thus missed an important opportunity to make her study more relevant to historians working on related themes. The second concerns a foreshortening of theoretical insight as a result of describing indigenous agency solely under the rubric of ‘resistance’. Sutton provides numerous examples of local agents initiating, transforming, or simply ignoring changes in colonial governance, rather than simply responding to or resisting those changes. Nevertheless, <italic>Other Landscapes</italic> is a masterful history of colonial governance in the Nilgiris. It is a significant contribution to the historiography of India’s disparate geopolitical landscapes, and to India’s colonial past more generally.</p>
