<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Motivational interviewing (MI) is effective in promoting behavioural changes in patients with substance abuse and smoking. However, its effectiveness on health outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation patients is unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A total of 146 patients assessed as having poor motivation attended a cardiac rehabilitation programme from February 2008 to June 2010. Patients (<italic>n</italic> = 73) in the control group received usual care while those in the experimental group (<italic>n</italic> = 73) received usual care plus four sessions of MI, each lasting 30–45 min. Clinical and psychological outcomes and health-related quality of life were measured at baseline and 3 months after entering the programme. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, Pearson Chi-squared test, and generalized estimating equations models were used to analyse the data.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There was no significant difference between the two groups on clinical outcomes (all <italic>p</italic>-values &gt;0.05). Patients in the experimental group had higher increases in health-related quality of life (SF-36) scores in the aspects of general health (4.74, 95% CI 0.04–9.44; <italic>p</italic> = 0.048) and role limitation due to emotional problems (8.80, 95% CI 1.16–16.43; <italic>p</italic> = 0.024). However, they reported significantly higher increases in anxiety levels (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) than those in the control group (0.96, 95% CI 0.09–1.83; <italic>p</italic> = 0.030).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The short-term effectiveness of MI on clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life in poorly motivated cardiac rehabilitation patients is limited. MI, however, was shown to increase anxiety levels of patients during the study period (3 months). More evidence is needed to better understand this phenomenon in the future studies.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711425428" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hong Kong, a special administrative region, is located on south coast of China. It has a population of over 7 million, 98% of which is Chinese, mainly Cantonese. Similar to other areas in the region, heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Hong Kong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425428">1</xref></sup> Hypertension, smoking, obesity, and abnormal lipid concentrations are all modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711425428">2</xref></sup> and their modification can be achieved through cardiac rehabilitation (CR) which comprises education, counselling, and exercise. The benefits of CR include improvements in clients’ functional abilities and reductions in symptoms maintenance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711425428">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425428">4</xref></sup> cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and coronary risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711425428">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711425428">6</xref></sup> However, these benefits are dependent on programme participation and long-term adherence to exercise and risk factor behaviour change. In Hong Kong, only 25% of the eligible patients attend CR programmes, of which only 7% complete the 7-week programme. Dropout rates range from 10% to 36%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711425428">7</xref></sup> Low compliance and high dropout rates in traditional CR reflect the challenges to patients in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Traditional CR programmes have focused on a didactic provision of information for clients but lack emphasis on psychosocial components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711425428">8</xref></sup> However, knowledge alone is not sufficient to change health behaviours. Moreover, a CR programme using direct persuasion is likely to evoke resistance and denial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425428">9</xref></sup> Therefore, developing a new strategy to assist cardiac patients in maintaining a healthy life style is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Motivational interviewing (MI) is a client-centred counselling technique designed to engage ambivalent or resistant clients in the process of change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425428">9</xref></sup> This framework maintains that clients go through a ‘wheel of change’ when they make decision to alter a current behaviour which consists of five stages along a continuum: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425428">10</xref></sup> To assist individuals changing their unhealthy lifestyle, healthcare professionals have to assess an individual’s stage of change and to implement intervention to facilitate the client’s progression along the change continuum. There should be a match between the change stage that the patient is in and the intervention; thus, goal setting will match the patient’s level of readiness to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425428">9</xref></sup> Open discussions and exchange of ideas are emphasized in MI. The five principles of MI are: express empathy, develop discrepancy, avoid argumentation, roll with resistance, and support self-efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425428">9</xref></sup> MI is one way of promoting self-efficacy while clients with higher self-efficacy will adhere more to CR programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425428">11</xref></sup> MI is effective in promoting behavioural changes in clients with substance abuse and smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711425428">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711425428">13</xref></sup> Moreover, MI has been used in helping clients with substance abuse and problem gambling in Hong Kong and is a counselling approach acceptable to the Chinese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711425428">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though MI has been used in a number of studies, few have examined the effectiveness of MI used among those cardiac patients who attend CR programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711425428">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711425428">16</xref></sup> Therefore, it is uncertain about the effectiveness of MI on outcomes of cardiac patients who have poor motivation to participate in CR programmes. Hence, the current study aimed to investigate the effect of MI on various clinical outcomes, psychological outcomes, and health-related quality of life of cardiac rehabilitation clients with poor motivation.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711425428"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to investigate the short-term effects of MI on clinical and psychological outcomes and health-related quality of life in cardiac rehabilitation patients with poor motivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711425428"><title>Design</title>
<p>A randomized controlled trial with repeated measures was used in the study. Randomisation was performed using computer-generated random numbers to assign the control and experimental sequence in blocks of six (the last block size was two). Group identifiers according to the randomization list were put in sealed, opaque envelopes. Group allocation was be done by a person independent of the research team, the CR centre manager, opening the envelopes with consecutive numbers for eligible subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711425428"><title>Setting and participants</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a local hospital cardiac rehabilitation centre in Hong Kong. Patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease and joining the cardiac rehabilitation programme were recruited to the study. Participants were those who had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, aged 18–75 years, demonstrated poor motivation to change to a healthy lifestyle, and were able to perform daily activity independently as reported by the patient when entering the programme. Poor motivation, which was assessed by the URICA scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711425428">17</xref></sup> referred to those patients who had dropped out from a CR programme in the last 12 months or who had an initial readiness to change score ≤10 at admission to the CR programme. Patients diagnosed with a mental illness, had history of substance abuse, or had major hearing difficulties were excluded.</p>
<p>Sample size calculation was based on the expected differences between groups from a previous MI study investigating on behavioural changes of cardiac clients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425428">18</xref></sup> using the software of nQuery Advisor 4.0 (Statistical Solutions, Saugus, MA, USA). For α = 0.05 and repeated-measure ANCOVA tests to test the mean outcome differences between the two groups and across time, 56 participants per group are required to achieve 80% power, with the variance of group means = 30, common within-population variance = 25, and the correlation between group = 0.35.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425428">18</xref></sup> A total of 146 participants were judged necessary considering the 30% dropout rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711425428"><title>Intervention</title>
<p>Participants in the control group (usual care) received a 2-month programme which included 16 supervised exercise sessions (2 hours per session and two sessions per week), six group education sessions (1 hour per session per week) on diet, exercise, smoking cessation, stress management, and drug compliance, and one individualized education session with the dietitian. For the intervention (MI) group, participants received all the components of the CR programme as the control group in addition to the MI sessions offered in weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 during these 2 months.</p>
<p>The MI interventions were delivered by the two research nurses who were registered mental health nurses and had completed the required MI training workshop. In addition, two training workshops specific to this study were provided to the research nurses. In this study, the three initial MI sessions were supervised by the investigators (two nurses with experience of conducting MI studies and a clinical psychologist with experience of using MI interventions) to ensure the fidelity, consistency, and appropriateness of the MI intervention. In addition, two co-investigators performed auditing of the interventions on 15 (10%) patients selected randomly during the study period to ensure consistency of the MI intervention. In order to blind the group allocation, data were collected by another research assistant.</p>
<p>The intervention given by the research nurse matched with the patient’s stage of change. For participants in the action or maintenance stage, MI was used to strengthen the commitment of behavioural changes and for those who were in the precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stage, MI focused on building motivation for change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425428">18</xref></sup> During the MI sessions, participants’ awareness of their clinical conditions was discussed. Participants were invited to consider their roles in changing the cardiac condition and involve in planning their rehabilitation progress. Factual information was offered to participants if they indicated a willingness to receive it. The MI intervention was kept at 30–45 min per session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711425428"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>At admission, participants’ readiness to change level was assessed by the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711425428">17</xref></sup> in order to identify those patients with poor motivation to change to a healthy lifestyle. Clinical outcomes comprised measures of blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and drug compliance. Psychological outcomes were anxiety and depression, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711425428">19</xref></sup> and self-efficacy, as measured by the General Self-efficacy Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711425428">20</xref></sup> Health-related quality of life was measured by the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711425428">21</xref></sup> All outcomes were collected at baseline (the first week entering the CR programme) and 3 months after entering the programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711425428"><title>Ethical consideration</title>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient who agreed to participate in the study. Participation in the study was completely voluntary, and all potential participants were informed and assured about the right to refuse, to participate, and/or to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Personal information and data were kept confidential and anonymous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711425428"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. Before data analysis, normality of the continuous variables was assessed using the skewness and kurtosis statistic and graphically by the Q–Q plot. Skewed continuous/ordinal variables and normal-like distributed variables were respectively presented as median (interquartile range) and mean ± standard deviation. Categorical data were presented as frequency (percentage). Triglyceride was log-transformed before entering into statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared using independent t-tests, Pearson’s Chi-squared, or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were employed to assess differential change of the outcomes across the time between the two groups with adjustment for potential confounding factors. The potential confounding factors referred to those background characteristics listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711425428">Table 1</xref> with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.25.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711425428">22</xref></sup> The GEE model accounts for intracorrelated repeated-measures data and is able to fit various types of data with the use of appropriate link-functions. A dummy variable of group was assigned to represent experimental group with control group as the reference. Another dummy variable was set to correspond to the time point of month 3 with the baseline as the reference. The interaction term group × timepoint was included in the GEE model to assess the differential change of the outcomes across the time between the two groups. All statistical tests were two-sided and a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<p>In this study, where strenuous attempts were made to ensure the fidelity, consistency, and appropriateness of the MI intervention were maintained through the three initial supervised MI sessions and the 15 audited MI sessions. The lack of effect might be simply due to either the intervention itself not being appropriate, and therefore not effective, or that the protocols or monitoring mechanisms put in place were insufficient to ensure whether the nurses delivering MI in a comprehensive and evidence-based way.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term effect of MI on clinical and psychological outcomes and health-related quality of life in cardiac rehabilitation patients with poor motivation. However, MI made no differences in nearly all the outcomes measured, except for health-related quality of life (general health and role limitation due to emotional problems). Participants in the experimental group experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety than those in the control group. Thus, it seems that the existing MI intervention as planned was not effective in improving the outcomes of cardiac patients with poor motivation. Indeed, it seemed to increase anxiety.</p>
<p>To date, the effectiveness of MI has been supported by most of the related studies and reviews in addressing the behaviour problems of addiction, especially alcohol addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711425428">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711425428">23</xref></sup> Though there are some existing studies which aimed to examine the effectiveness of MI on outcomes of cardiac patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711425428">24</xref></sup> the results of these studies are inconsistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711425428">16</xref></sup> Moreover, the study design of most of the available studies is not the randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711425428">24</xref></sup> Accordingly, the effectiveness of MI in cardiac health is to some extent still uncertain.</p>
<p>Previous studies usually focused on the effects of MI on the stress, physical activity, dietary habit change, health-related quality of life, or self-care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711425428">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425428">28</xref></sup> little information can be obtained from these previous available studies in terms of the effectiveness of the MI on the clinical outcomes of cardiac patients. In the present study, MI demonstrated to have no additional effects on clinical outcomes measured when compared with the usual CR programme. Possible explanations for the ineffective results might be as follows. Firstly, interventions for control group are actually comprehensive and probably sufficient for patients to improve their clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and drug compliance, to the optimal level. Therefore, it may be rather difficult to make changes on patients’ clinical outcomes through MI interventions. Secondly, it may be too short to detect the changes that MI might contribute to the clinical outcomes but not in 3 months. Therefore, the effects of MI on clinical outcomes especially long-term effect should further be examined in the future studies.</p>
<p>Consistent with a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425428">28</xref></sup> there was a significant increase for two of the dimensions (general health score and role limitation due to emotional problems score) measured by SF-36. Regarding the other subscales of SF-36, though no significant improvements were found across the study period of 3 months, the trend of better improvements in subscales of role limitation due to physical problems, bodily pain, and role limitation due to emotional problems in the experimental group was observed. It might be hypothesized that with a larger sample size, the contribution of MI to improving patients’ health-related quality of life may be significant but the results of this study make it difficult to reach such a conclusion. Thus, more studies are needed to provide further evidence on this aspect.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, participants who received MI experienced significantly higher anxiety as measured by HADS than those in the control group. The process of intervention delivery may need to be considered. During the MI process, motivation for change and commitment to change are enhanced and strengthened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425428">9</xref></sup> Change is the final goal while it also might be the source of anxiety because participants may worry about whether they can really change their lifestyle to a healthier one. Moreover, as participants need to set goals and review them during the MI sessions, it is possible that these increase anxiety if participants fail to achieve their own goals. As a result, they might be afraid of losing ‘face’ or upsetting the researchers. Maintaining ‘face’ is important to Chinese and loss of face caused by failure to keep their promises may result in shame.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711425428">29</xref></sup> In Chinese culture, it is also important to maintain harmony and avoid conflicts with others, especially with experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711425428">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study has some limitations. The study period is relatively short (3 months), so therefore the long-term effect of the intervention remains unknown. Besides, the assessment of the stage of change is based on the patients’ own reports. It is possible that participants just wanted to satisfy the research nurses by providing answers which they thought were desired. Moreover, more men were studied and only one study site was used.</p>
<p>To conclude, motivational interviewing has been proven to be effective in some studies, but its short-term (3 months) effectiveness on changing clinical outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation patients is not supported by the results of this study. The effectiveness of MI in improving cardiac patients’ health-related quality of life is limited. Indeed, it seems that MI may increase anxiety levels of patients. Hence, motivational interviewing may be limited in evoking health behaviour change in poorly motivated patients attending cardiac rehabilitation. Developing a modified MI approach and describing this in detail appropriate to Chinese culture may be warranted.</p>
