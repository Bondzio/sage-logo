<abstract>
<p>As the postscript for this special issue of Education and Urban Society, this article considers the struggles urban schools report confronting as they implement standards-based reform and high stakes testing and discusses the implications these challenge have for future accountability policy aimed at promoting educational equity. Among the issues for future policy to consider with Race to the Top and the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act include the need for adequate resources to develop capacity among school personnel to aid with instructional reform. However, there are three factors that may derail the future effectiveness of accountability policy in urban schools. First, the ongoing federal deficit may limit the availability of resources needed to improve teacher practice. Second, the use of teacher evaluation may cause a narrow focus on tested subjects. Third, the limiting beliefs of teachers may restrict the organizational change within urban schools.</p>

<p>The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has been an important federal policy for urban schools as it has provided funding to support the education of many of its students who are low income and disproportionately African American and Latino. ESEA has changed its emphasis over time from providing funding for targeted academic support of low performing, poor students to the recent practice that allows the use of allocated Title I funds to promote schoolwide change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511431571">St. John &amp; Miron, 2003</xref>). The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, the most recent iteration of ESEA, uses high stakes testing as a means of ensuring that all public schools are responsible for helping its students regardless of race, socioeconomic status, special education status, or language status to achieve academic proficiency as determined by each state. Accountability policy seeks to increase educational equity by improving outcomes as a result of aligning common curricular standards to instruction. Urban schools, in particular, confront an uphill battle to prepare its students for the demands of accountability policy given the academic, professional, financial, and instructional disparities they have consistently encountered over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511431571">Bryk, Sebring, Allensworth, Luppescu, &amp; Easton, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The studies included in the volume provide important lessons based on the experiences of urban school teachers who are the primary targets of accountability policy in Chicago and other school districts engaged in school reform in several regions of the United States between 1999 and 2004. These insights can help in predicting responses to ESEA when reauthorized and the ongoing implementation of Race to the Top grant competition by illuminating the realities that low-performing urban schools encounter and strategies they employ to improve instruction when required. It is apparent from the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511431571">Harris (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511431571">Diamond (2012)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511431571">Finnigan (2012)</xref> that teachers respond to some degree to the accountability pressure encountered from local or state school systems. However, these modifications do not always lead to the type of meaningful change in teacher practice that expand educational opportunities and increase the academic outcomes for students in low-performing urban schools. Why is accountability policy an insufficient policy instrument to change instruction? (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511431571">McDonnell &amp; Elmore, 1987</xref>). Diamond’s concept of partial recoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511431571">2012</xref>) suggests that although high stakes accountability aims to tightly align curriculum and instruction to dramatically transform teaching and learning, this alignment is limited for a number of reasons including the lack of capacity to change. The limited capacity to change among urban school teachers manifests itself in three specific ways.</p>
<p>First, accountability policy can constrain curriculum and instruction instead of expanding educational opportunities or transforming instructional practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511431571">Diamond’s (2012)</xref> data from K-8 teachers in Chicago show that the pressure from high stakes testing may often lead many to narrow curriculum by focusing on basic skills or cause the fragmentation of curriculum to meet the demands of standardized assessments. He found that much of the classroom instruction was teacher directed with little student discussion besides responses to teacher questions. In most instances teacher interactions focused on the correction of students rather than instruction allowing for students’ inquiry. Although professional communities existed among teachers, the quality of these interactions was limited and did not promote sustained dialogue about instructional change. In addition, Diamond suggests that status in the accountability system (i.e., whether on probation) can impact responses to accountability. In schools on probation, school personnel often focused on instruction and provided additional resources to students who were close to helping schools meet proficiency requirements. As a result, practices among schools on probation can exacerbate educational inequality rather than decrease it. Diamond’s study helps us to think about whether the stigma associated with being labeled as failing contributes to school level responses.</p>
<p>Second, low-performing schools may not be able to dramatically change instruction because of the deeply entrenched negative beliefs school personnel hold about students that result in contradictory classroom practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511431571">Harris’ study (2012)</xref> shows that even in school contexts where external assistance was provided from the partnership with the comprehensive school reform model, America’s Choice, some middle-school teachers struggled with how to deal with the academic diversity of their students. Although teachers in the America’s Choice middle schools reported using academic standards to guide instruction, their application varied based on teacher perceptions about students. These teachers’ low expectations were dominated by implicit racialized and class-based deficit beliefs where the onus for change was placed on students rather than on teacher practices. The lack of academic improvement was attributed to problems associated with students’ low ability levels, motivation, and parent expectations. In response to students, some teachers differentiated standards, a practice that contradicts the aims of standards-based reform, by putting a limit on content exposure and outcomes of students instead of creating common educational expectations, experiences, and preparation. This study helps us consider whether the differentiation of standards by teachers replicates the stratification of educational opportunity structures that commonly occurs via ability grouping and tracking. The evidence from Harris’ study shows that increasing curriculum demands as a result of standards does not automatically translate to high expectations for all.</p>
<p>Third, the variable presence of effective leaders is a barrier to urban school success especially under the strain of accountability policy. The presence of effective principal leadership is a significant resource that aids in the instructional change process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511431571">Finnigan’s (2012)</xref> Chicago-based study in three K-8 schools on probation shows that the important role that effective principal leadership had on motivating teachers to make the changes needed to improve students’ test scores to move off probation. Teachers in the schools who moved off probation reported that school leaders who respected their work, provided a clear vision for instruction, expressed high expectations for teachers and students, and created trusting relationships that positively affected their efforts to change instruction. Finnigan’s study aligns with other Chicago research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511431571">Bryk et al., 2010</xref>) suggests that when effective leaders are absent, schools have difficulty in providing a coherent organizational response that allows for the implementation of strategies that help move schools off probation. Without strong leadership, teachers must fend for themselves to change in a context where students’ performance is below average. This study suggests the need for effective principal leadership development targeted to urban schools on probation.</p>
<p>The Harris, Diamond, and Finnigan studies demonstrate that accountability policy does not necessarily build capacity among school personnel who required to respond to it. Rather, accountability policy interacts with preexisting levels of capacity within schools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511431571">Elmore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511431571">O’Day, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511431571">Payne, 2010</xref>). Urban schools that are low performing confront organizational barriers including the lack of trust, limited resources, low morale among school personnel, and limited hope that change will occur via the adoption of new practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511431571">Payne, 2010</xref>). If there are low levels of instructional or leadership capacity among school personnel prior to engagement with accountability, then it is not surprising that responses do not dramatically change practices when mandates are introduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511431571">Bryk et al.’s (2010)</xref> research in Chicago shows that although accountability policy can be an initial catalyst for change, it does not guarantee that efforts are sustained over time. The work of Harris, Diamond, and Finnigan support the necessity for accountability policy that directly addresses capacity building of urban schools if we are serious about improving educational equity.</p>

<title>Race to the Top and ESEA: A Blueprint for Building Capacity of Urban Schools?</title>
<p>The Obama administration’s educational focus with the Race to The Top and the ESEA reauthorization plan addresses the issue of capacity building among school personnel with their commitment to transforming low-performing schools and developing teacher and principal effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511431571">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>). School turnaround grants via Race to the Top that commit additional resources to low-performing schools to aid with improving instruction has the greatest potential to assist urban schools given their low levels of achievement. For example, in the state of New York during the period 2010-2011 among the 67 schools identified as persistently low-achieving schools, the majority are found in the cities of Buffalo (9 schools), New York City (43 schools), Rochester (4 schools), and Syracuse (4 schools; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511431571">New York State Department of Education, n.d.</xref>). The Obama administration is also pushing for the development of rigorous standards that prepare students for college and career by high school completion. To support college-readiness standards new assessments are being developed that extend beyond the basics and measure higher order thinking skills. These new college-preparatory standards and assessments have the potential to increase rigor especially in urban schools where a great deal of focus is on the basic skills (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511431571">Balfanz, 2000</xref>). In addition, the development of coherent teacher evaluation systems is being promoted as a result of Race to the Top to cultivate and compensate effective teachers. These systems will evaluate teachers’ effectiveness by measuring students’ performance as well as other nonachievement indicators of high quality instructional practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511431571">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Potential Barriers to Equity in 2011 and Beyond</title>
<p>On the surface, the Obama administration’s Race to the Top grant competition and proposals for ESEA reauthorization address key issues related to capacity building among state departments of education, local school districts, and individual schools. However, there are several issues that have the potential to limit the progress of this ambitious plan for educational renewal with the significant investment of federal money. First, the success of accountability policy and the resources allocated through Race to the Top will be directly impacted by the weakened U.S. economy confronted with high unemployment rates and a faltering housing market. Given concerns about the mounting federal deficit, budget cuts may limit the funding of domestic programs including education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511431571">Klein, 2010</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511431571">Sawchuk (2011)</xref> indicates that as local school districts around the country confront yearly budget deficits, this may result in teaching force uncertainty and can detract from teachers’ efforts to engage with reform when it is not clear they will have a job. A teacher in Los Angles reported to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511431571">Sawchuk (2011)</xref> that receiving a pink slip decreased her motivation to engage in reform efforts.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Last week, I had a moment where we had to have a grade-level meeting, and I really didn’t want to be there, Ms Iniguez said. “I thought, why am I going to go through all this data analysis if I’m not going to be there in the fall.” (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As states and local districts grapple with budget crises, there is the possibility that the money obtained from the Race to the Top competition will be used as general aid to prevent the loss of teachers or school programs instead of being used for proposed educational initiatives.</p>
<p>The second concern is that when teacher evaluation is linked to students outcomes as promoted by Race to Top, then this has the potential to constrain teachers’ ability or motivation to improve instruction beyond tested domains especially in urban school systems. Given the teacher responses reported in this volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511431571">Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511431571">Diamond, 2012</xref>) as well as other studies (see Elmore, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511431571">Lipman, 2004</xref>) there is the possibility that the accountability pressure may result in narrow practices that promote teaching to the test or targeting students who are closest to meet proficiency levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511431571">Booher-Jennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511431571">O’Day,2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511431571">Finnigan’s (2012)</xref> study in this volume shows that problems can arise in schools when students outcomes are used in teacher evaluation especially when Chicago principals made public test scores for individual classrooms without considering value added outcomes. Although states are in the early phases of constructing the components of teacher evaluations and the reward and sanctions associated with it, we must ensure that the implementation of teacher evaluation systems does not result in counterproductive instructional practices in low-performing urban schools by limiting innovation and risk taking. However, a potential solution to this dilemma is for schools undertaking innovation be given exemption from sanctions associated with high stakes accountability if they engage in significant risk taking for instructional change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511431571">Koretz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, what seems missing from the accountability policy discussion is the importance of explicitly addressing the values teachers hold about students and school leaders have about teachers. In urban schools, it is important to have an ongoing examination about the norms that relate to whether school teachers and leaders have the necessary beliefs and skills to facilitate significant organizational change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511431571">Payne (2010)</xref> argues that urban schools can be demoralizing institutions where low expectations dictate what can be done among school personnel and students. He also indicates that we cannot ignore the racialized and class-based notions that are the foundation of beliefs about urban students and their families. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511431571">Elmore (2009)</xref> suggests “leverage over the performance of organizations is most likely to be effective when it focuses on shaping the knowledge, skill, and values of agents, rather than on strengthening the command and control functions of the system” (p.242). In the end, it is the deeply embedded norms that determine whether school organizations can mobilize resources to promote deep changes in school-level practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511431571">Bryk et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, without sufficient norms and school climate and effective leaders to support change, accountability policy, and additional resources provided to schools may be insufficient to disrupt the institutional barriers to curricular and instructional improvement that exists within low-performing urban schools.</p>
