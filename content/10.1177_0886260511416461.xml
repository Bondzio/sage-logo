<abstract>
<p>This study examines the psychometric properties of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) with street youth who have run away or been expelled from their homes (<italic>N</italic> = 397). Internal reliability coefficients for the five clinical scales ranged from .65 to .95. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test the five-factor structure of the scales yielding acceptable fit for the total sample. Additional multigroup analyses were performed to consider items by gender. Results provided only evidence of weak factorial invariance. Constrained models showed invariance in configuration, factor loadings, and factor covariances but failed for equality of intercepts. Mean trauma scores for street youth tended to fall in the moderate to severe range on all abuse/neglect clinical scales. Females reported higher levels of abuse and neglect. Prevalence of child maltreatment of individual forms was very high with 98% of street youth reporting one or more forms; 27.4% of males and 48.9% of females reported all five forms. Results of this study support the viability of the CTQ-SF for screening maltreatment in a highly vulnerable street population. Caution is recommended when comparing prevalence estimates for male and female street youth given the failure of the strong factorial multigroup model.</p>

<p>Over the past three decades, there has been an expansive growth in research on the causes and consequences of childhood abuse and neglect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511416461">Peters, Wyatt, and Finkelhor (1986)</xref> conducted a systematic review of studies of child sexual abuse published until 1985, finding that the majority were conducted in the 1980s and that interest in the topic was rising. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511416461">Widom (1989)</xref> published a classic study commenting on how methodological problems in research designs restrict understanding of the causes and consequences of child abuse and neglect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416461">Hulme (2004)</xref> updated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511416461">Peters et al.’s (1986)</xref> review of research instruments used to retrospectively study childhood sexual abuse, reporting that most studies continue to use single descriptive indicators of abuse but that use of scales is becoming more common. Recently, in one of the top 10 most cited articles from the journal of <italic>Child Abuse &amp; Neglect</italic> published in the past 5 years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416461">Finkelhor, Ormrod, and Turner (2007)</xref> drew attention to how poly-victimization is a neglected area of study. To understand linkages between types of victimization, researchers, clinicians, and service providers will need to pay greater attention to the tools that will be used to study and treat the causes and consequences of child abuse and maltreatment.</p>
<p>Bernstein and colleagues (2003) noted that there has been a lack of attention to instrument validity for studying retrospective reports of childhood trauma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416461">Hulme (2004)</xref> listed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) as one of 10 available scales for studying childhood abuse and neglect. The short form (CTQ-SF) of this clinical scale appears to be in wide use as validation efforts have been completed in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416461">Scher, Stein, Asmundson, McCreary, &amp; Forde, 2001</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511416461">Wingenfeld, Spitzer, et al., 2010</xref>), Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511416461">Thombs, Bernstein, Lobbestael, &amp; Arntz, 2009</xref>), and other countries. The CTQ-SF has been applied in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416461">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>), field settings of female sex workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511416461">Stoltz et al., 2007</xref>), population-based community surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416461">Thombs et al., 2006</xref>), and in evaluations of service delivery for juvenile justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511416461">Kenny &amp; Lennings, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416461">Bernstein et al. (2003)</xref> reported that their initial validation of the CTQ-SF provided strong support for the coherence and validity of a five-factor clinical scale of child abuse and neglect. The CTQ-SF instrument is a 28-item form that takes about 5 min to administer. As a research tool, if valid in the population under study, the CTQ-SF provides an instrument that allows quick retrospective identification of the prevalence of child abuse and neglect. Bernstein et al. discussed how the CTQ-SF showed criterion validity across four samples (two groups of substance abusers, psychiatric in-patients, and a community sample). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416461">Scher et al. (2001)</xref> demonstrated its validity for a community survey.</p>
<p>Contrary results for the factor structure of the CTQ have been found in multiple studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416461">Lundgren, Gerdner, and Lundqvist (2002)</xref> used an exploratory factor analysis and found a four-factor model suggesting a need to combine emotional and physical abuse as one factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511416461">Villano and associates (2004)</xref> studying female sex workers used a confirmatory factor analysis and reported a poor fit of the five-factor structure. They followed up on this result by using an exploratory factor analysis of their data finding that physical neglect items did not load on any factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511416461">Wright and colleagues (2001)</xref>, studying Canadian college students, reported different factor structures for men and women and instability in the physical abuse factor for women.</p>
<p>In the current study, our aim was to test the psychometric properties of the CTQ-SF using a sample of street youth. Past research has shown that street youth are at high risk for childhood sexual abuse and neglect, drug use, and sexual offending and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416461">Baron, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511416461">Whitbeck and Hoyt (1999)</xref> noted there is a limited amount of productive interview time with this population. Thus, there is a need for a short and valid scale for studying abusive experiences with this group to establish both psychometric structure of the CTQ-SF and to estimate prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect. Last, given ambiguities in the literature on factor structure of the CTQ-SF for men and women, we used multigroup invariance tests to compare the factor structure for male and female street youth.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>From May 2000 to August 2001, street youth were recruited to participate in a field interview about street youth, crime, and life on the street. Street youth usually refers to youths who have run away or been expelled from their homes and/or who spend some or all of their time in various public locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416461">Baron, 2004</xref>). Potential respondents were identified based on four sampling criteria: (a) must be aged 24 and under; (b) must have left or finished school; (c) must be currently unemployed; and (d) must have spent time without a fixed address or living in a shelter in the previous 12 months. These criteria ensure coverage of the age range of street youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416461">Caputo &amp; Ryan, 1991</xref>); exclude youth in school and eliminate those not eligible for full-time employment; and focus on “serious” “at risk” youth. Interviews were conducted immediately on recruitment in Vancouver, British Columbia by an experienced field interviewer meeting these youth in and around the downtown business core of the city bordered by the local skid row and “inner city”. In total about 470 potential respondents were approached, alerted to the project, and screened for study eligibility. Forty-five of these youths proved to be ineligible and 21 youths declined to be interviewed. Ninety-five percent of eligible youths (<italic>N</italic> = 400) completed the study. The high response rate was attributed to the fact that the researcher spent a great deal of time in the field and he was able to establish a good rapport with respondents prior to their decision to grant an interview. Furthermore, respondents who had been previously interviewed were helpful in introducing the researcher to other youths on the street. Past respondents were adept at explaining the project and the consent procedures to potential respondents. The combination of rapport and reputation backed by information from others on the street facilitated the successful collection of the sensitive data explored here. Interviews were conducted in fast food restaurants, parks, in front of store front social services, in bus shelters, and on the street. The CTQ-SF was administered near the beginning of the interview, which was read aloud to participants. The verbal administration of the interview was required for practical reasons as many of these street youth could not read. Participants were awarded CA$20 in food coupons at a popular fast food restaurant for answering questions on the interviews that lasted approximately 1 hr and 10 min. The study was approved by the University of Windsor and the Queen’s University Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>All of the data in this study come from responses to the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416461">Bernstein &amp; Fink, 1998</xref>). It is a 25-item self-report questionnaire (when three additional items assessing minimization or denial of abuse are excluded) designed to measure the severity of abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual) and neglect (emotional and physical). Each clinical subscale has five items asked in the context of “when you were growing up” and item response options answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very often</italic>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416461">Table 1</xref> reports CTQ-SF items in abbreviated form and indicates whether reverse scoring was used.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed using the EQS 6.1 Structural Equations Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416461">Bentler, 2006</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416461">Hu and Bentler (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511416461">1999)</xref>, multiple indexes were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the CFA models. Based on research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416461">Bernstein et al. (2003)</xref>, the CTQ-SF scores were expected to exhibit multivariate kurtosis. As such, robust methods were used as the fit function. The goodness-of-fit statistics included the Satorra-Bentler chi-square (S-B χ<sup>2</sup>), the robust comparative fit index (CFI-R), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and the Bollen fit index (IFI). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416461">Bentler (2006)</xref> stated that a S-B χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio of 2 or less represents a good fit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416461">Hu and Bentler (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511416461">1999)</xref> suggested cutoff points for a wide variety of indexes. A CFI-R above .90 indicates a good fit and .95 or higher is optimal. An RMSEA of less than .05 is preferred and if it is greater than .08 it is considered as a poor fit. The SRMR has preferred values of less than .08 in a well-fitting model. The Bollen IFI has desired cutoffs of .95 or above. In testing for differences in model fit, the SBDIFF program was used to calculate scaled differences in Satorra-Bentler chi-square tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416461">Crawford &amp; Henry, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The average age of the street youths was 20 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.6). Sixty-six percent were male; 34% were female. Eighty-three percent of the sample was White, 12% as Aboriginal (Native Canadian), and 4% as other. The average length of homelessness in the previous 12 months was close to 7 months (SD = 4.1). Approximately 15% of the sample had participated in the sex trade where they had been paid for sex.</p>
<p>Three hundred ninety-seven respondents had complete CTQ-SF data. Three cases with missing data were dropped using list-wise deletion from the factor analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416461">Table 1</xref> shows the internal reliability coefficients (Cronbach’s α) of the five clinical scales of the CTQ-SF for the total sample, males and females varying from .65 to .95. These analyses showed acceptable internal reliability for the entire CTQ measure and four of five subscales. The emotional neglect subscale showed alphas below .70 indicating that it may be unreliable.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics for each of the items are also provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416461">Table 1</xref>. The scores of several items display nonnormality with item-level skewness greater than |1.5| and item-level kurtosis greater than |2.5|. In addition, the normalized estimate for multivariate kurtosis was tested for the full sample and independently for males and females. The normalized estimates for multivariate kurtosis exceeded two (29.2 total; 31.9 male; 6.0 female) indicating model estimation should use robust methods.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511416461">Table 2</xref> reports fit indexes for three models of the CTQ’s factor structure. The first model we tested was Lundgren et al.’s (2002) four-factor model in which physical abuse and emotional abuse items were combined. Fit indexes suggested that this model had adequate correspondence on all fit indexes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416461">Bernstein and Fink’s (1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416461">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>) five-factor model also had adequate correspondence. However, the S-B scaled difference test estimated using the SBDIFF program of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416461">Crawford and Henry (2003)</xref> showed that the five-factor model had a significantly better fit than the four-factor model as the ratio of the S-B χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> was over 2.0.</p>

<p>A higher order factor model was also tested to determine whether the five factors may be subsumed under a construct of general childhood trauma. Results indicated that the higher order model does not fit well.</p>
<p>To test model invariance of the CTQ-SF across gender, the Bernstein and Fink five-factor model was used as a baseline. The invariance analysis tested four multigroup models, each representing a progressively restrictive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416461">Byrne, 2006</xref>). First, configural invariance tests whether the number of factors and pattern of loadings holds across groups. Second, measurement model invariance constrained factor loadings to be equal across groups. Error variances–covariances were not constrained here since this condition may be excessively stringent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416461">Byrne, 2006</xref>). This measurement model invariance test contained the restrictions of the configural model as well. Third, structural model invariance constrained factor covariances to be equal along with parameters from the first two models. Last, item intercepts that are evidence of strong factorial invariance were also constrained to be equal. Establishing factorial invariance across groups is necessary to make valid comparisons of scale scores as it is important to understand the hierarchy of levels that include tests of weak, strong, and strict invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416461">Meredith &amp; Teresi, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260511416461">Table 4</xref> reports the fit indexes for invariance tests. The baseline model for configural invariance was acceptable with satisfactory scores on all fit indexes indicating that males and females have the same basic construct of child trauma. Testing measurement model invariance, factor loadings were constrained to be equal across groups. The measurement invariance was supported because the model provided good estimates of fit and the S-B scaled difference test between configural invariance and measurement model invariance was not significant. Testing structural model invariance revealed satisfactory values on fit indexes. The S-B scaled difference test was not significant indicating that the number of factors and their loadings were the same for males and females.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF) appears to be in wide use in the United States and around the world as a five-factor clinical scale to measure child abuse and neglect. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the CTQ-SF using a sample of high-risk street youth and to use multigroup analyses to investigate gender differences in the factor structure. Previous studies have shown ambiguities in the factor structure of the CTQ-SF for men and women.</p>
<p>Satisfactory internal reliability was obtained for four of the five clinical scales when looking at males, females, and the total sample. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) established acceptable five-factor models consistent with Bernstein and Fink’s specifications (1998) for the full sample. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511416461">Villano et al. (2004)</xref>, our findings do indicate that the established five-factor model of child abuse and neglect does hold up for a high-risk street population. Also, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416461">Lundgen et al. (2002)</xref> we found that a four-factor model combining emotional and physical abuse provided a poorer fit to the data than a five-factor model.</p>
<p>The current study used multigroup models to simultaneously test for factorial invariance of the CTQ-SF across male and female street youth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416461">Merideth and Teresi (2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416461">Byrne, 2006</xref>) review definitions and forms of factorial invariance to explain a hierarchy of levels of weak, strong, and strict invariance. Weak factorial invariance is necessary if one is to make valid comparisons of scale scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416461">Merideth &amp;Teresi, 2006</xref>). If weak factorial invariance is not found, this is an indication that the scale fails to measure the same attributes. More stringent tests of strong and strict invariance are required if the aim is to ensure equity and fairness in application of scores from a test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416461">Merideth &amp; Teresi, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The multigroup tests of factorial invariance evaluated gender differences in the CTQ-SF as a configural model (number of factors), measurement model (factor loadings), structural model (factor covariances), and scalar model (Intercepts). The first three models provided evidence of weak factorial invariance. The latter model is a strong test of factorial invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416461">Byrne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416461">Meredith &amp; Teresi, 2006</xref>) that failed. The finding of weak factorial invariance (but not strong) has implications for assessing differences in child maltreatment and abuse between men and women. Finding that the CTQ-SF has weak factorial invariance indicates that it is valid to make comparison of scores of child abuse and neglect as a five-factor model for male and female street youth. The CTQ-SF can be used to identify whether abuse or neglect is present for males or females. Yet the failure to obtain strong factorial invariance indicates that it may not be equitable and fair to compare between scores for males and females.</p>
<p>The nonequivalence of the strong factorial models for male and female street youth is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511416461">Wright et al. (2001)</xref>. Given that stable configural, measurement, and structural models were found using multigroup comparisons examining gender differences, it may be that male and female street youths do in fact interpret the items in different ways. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416461">Thombs et al. (2006)</xref>, who found that women in the general population were more likely to report abuse across all categories and that people tend to minimize items when the word “abuse” is part of the item. Consequently, a remaining challenge is to parse out a scale that can reliably be considered as having strong factorial validity for both males and females.</p>
<p>Average severity ratings of abuse and neglect for street youth most often were found to be in the “Moderate to Severe” range using the guidelines for the CTQ-SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416461">Bernstein &amp; Fink, 1998</xref>). These scores are substantially higher than what would be found in an adult community sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511416461">Scher et al., 2004</xref>) but consistent with clinical scores for other street populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511416461">Stoltz et al., 2007</xref>). The maltreatment rates for male and female street youth were significantly different across all types of abuse and neglect. Nonetheless, with a valid measure of different types of maltreatment, we were able to address <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416461">Finkelhor et al.’s (2007)</xref> concern regarding causes of poly-victimization by examining co-occurence of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and physical and emotional neglect. While prevalence of maltreatment among street youth were much higher than what would be found in a general population, common patterns of trauma exposure were still evident. The prevalence of emotional abuse and emotional neglect were at extremely high levels for this sample. Additional studies of street samples and nationally representative samples will be needed to compare prevalence and co-occurrence of maltreatment and poly-victimization. Recalling how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511416461">Widom (1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511416461">Widom &amp; Ames, 1994)</xref> demonstrated that childhood abuse and neglect can lead to criminal consequences, with better measures of child abuse and neglect, it will also be important to evaluate what may lead to resilience in street youth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416461">McGloin and Widom (2001)</xref> remind researchers that many people who are abused and neglected turn out to be resilient in breaking the cycle of violence and other ill consequences of their child victimization. Our findings on the validity of the CTQ-SF for use in a street population suggest a need to examine the clinical scores in relation to consequences of child maltreatment, whether it be drug use, prostitution, violence, repeat victimization, or resilience.</p>
<p>Limitations of a field study of street youth include difficulties in obtaining a representative sample of street youth. The in-person interview method also differs from the paper and pencil self-administration of the CTQ-SF in a clinical setting but this same problem was also faced in large-scale population-based telephone surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511416461">Scher et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the use of retrospective self-reporting of childhood maltreatment is limited because of social desirability, memory, and distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511416461">Widom, 1989</xref>). This study provides some important information about the extent of child abuse and maltreatment in a street population in a major urban Canadian city. Additional studies of high risk groups drawing from other cultures, languages, and other factors will be needed to establish generalizability of the CTQ-SF for studying child abuse and neglect in highly vulnerable populations.</p>
