<abstract>
<p>In recent years there has been an increased focus on prisoner resettlement in government policy in England and Wales. Two contrasting trends have been evident. Post-release supervision in the form of enhanced monitoring and surveillance for offenders on statutory licence has grown significantly, while post-release support and provision for adult short-sentence prisoners has been minimalist and remains non-mandatory. This article will examine the problematized status of resettlement in terms of: (a) differentiated meaning; and (b) policy formulation and application. It is argued that ‘resettlement’ attracts many key assumptions and that societal expectations of what can be achieved may be ideationally and conceptually flawed. The discussion centres on both theoretical connections and uncertainties, together with the respective policy implications. An indicative schema of ex-prisoner re-entry is outlined for further analytical exploration and critique. ‘Re-entry’, a ‘buzzword’ in the USA, is preferred for this schema rather than ‘resettlement’ which is the favoured term in England and Wales.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Resettlement has assumed a higher profile in contemporary penal policy in England and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">Her Majesty’s Inspectorates of Prisons and Probation [HMIPP], 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811425445">Home Office, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811425445">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425445">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811425445">House of Commons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">Social Exclusion Unit [SEU], 2002</xref>). As part of their overall resettlement strategy, HM Prison Service has identified seven pathways or factors to address reoffending (now increased to nine, following the Corston Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811425445">Corston, 2007</xref>)). Additionally, pathfinder resettlement projects were created to implement and evaluate ‘through the prison gate’ initiatives for offenders<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895811425445">1</xref></sup> serving terms of less than 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811425445">Lewis et al., 2007</xref>). ‘Resettlement’ has superseded throughcare and aftercare and, together with the associated concepts of re-entry and reintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>), has emerged as a major theme in the discourse on the community transitions of post-release offenders. However, what ‘resettlement’ means is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811425445">Hedderman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1748895811425445">Raynor, 2007</xref>). To the Prison Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2011b</xref>: 1), resettlement refers to the ‘assistance and support’, pre- and post-release, from statutory and non-statutory agencies to enable ex-prisoners and their families to ‘prepare for life after prison … return to normal life … and cope … without re-offending’ – to access accommodation, welfare benefits, education and training, gain employment and address personal problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895811425445">2</xref></sup> For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748895811425445">McNeill (2004)</xref>, there is the broader issue of social reintegration and acceptance. But what does ‘reintegration’ signify, and resettlement too, when many offenders have never felt either ‘integrated’ or ‘settled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1748895811425445">Ramsbotham, 2003</xref>)? Imprisonment in such cases can be both an extension and confirmation of long-experienced marginalized status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al. (2004)</xref>, there is no coherent theory of resettlement. Instead, we find a collection of associated ideas and concepts involving policy-makers, practitioners and academics within a wide-ranging resettlement discourse. One striking feature of resettlement as policy is that it has remained relatively untouched by desistance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>). Trying to understand why offenders cease to offend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425445">Farrall and Calverley, 2006</xref>), as distinct from longer established aetiological theorization, has assumed growing importance within academic criminology yet has barely resonated in government resettlement policy and service delivery, nor in criminal justice/legislative developments in the management of post-release supervision.</p>
<p>The central focus of this article is to examine resettlement as a problematized theoretical and empirical construct for offender transitions from prison to the community. As already indicated, the selected penal domain is England and Wales; however ‘resettlement’ transcends national boundaries and much of the discussion here has wider relevance (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1748895811425445">Padfield et al., 2011</xref>, for a comparative study of release systems in contemporary Europe). At a general level, resettlement denotes a return to wider society but what that may signify in terms of individual circumstance is neither self-evident nor sufficiently reflective of the complex interaction of factors and variables that make up post-prison experiences. To understand resettlement more fully, the concept needs to be disaggregated into salient theoretical elements and their empirical contexts identified and explored. There are four core strands in the following discussion. First, it is argued that ‘resettlement’ is invested with certain normative and prescriptive characteristics derived from generalist views of society, that differentiation is not sufficiently acknowledged and that many presuppositions exist about the social, cultural and economic environments in which offenders find themselves following release. Second, an introductory three-phase theoretical schema of resettlement, as re-entry, is proposed. Third, the relationship between resettlement, re-entry and desistance is examined. Finally, because of the uncertainties about resettlement, both conceptually and empirically, it is argued that many of the expectations of ex-prisoner re-entry may be flawed, and unrealistic, as they rest on a number of assumptions that are epistemologically and ontologically questionable.</p>

<sec id="section2-1748895811425445">
<title>Background</title>
<p>It has long been axiomatic that there are many obstacles to social reintegration after imprisonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811425445">Corston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811425445">Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU, 2002</xref>), some of which are found to be surmountable, others less so, and for some offenders, for all kinds of reasons, completely intractable. These difficulties are both separate and interconnected. The prospect of employment, already diminished by the stigma of imprisonment, is reduced further for the majority of post-release offenders by illiteracy, innumeracy and poor social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU, 2002</xref>). The offender is thus disadvantaged not only by unfavourable social and societal conditions, but the capacity to address and overcome them may be jeopardized by an intrinsic lack of those interpersonal and educational skills which are necessary in a competitive market economy: human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1748895811425445">Stewart, 2008</xref>). Further, if this were not enough, the endemic personal circumstances of chronic poor physical health, substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1748895811425445">UK Drug Policy Commission, 2008</xref>), high incidences of mental disorder, in many cases very severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1748895811425445">Stewart, 2008</xref>), aggravate the marginalization process. To what extent the offender is able to make use of the facilities and opportunities for resettlement therefore becomes a crucial question. If being in prison is enforced exile from society, then returning to the community often constitutes involuntary exile within it. Many ex-prisoners find themselves <italic>in</italic> but not <italic>of</italic> society and ‘suffer from a presumption of moral contamination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811425445">Johnson, 2002</xref>: 319).</p>
<p>Initially concerned with the welfare needs of prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811425445">Jarvis, 1972</xref>), the resettlement ethos has since undergone profound change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>). The Statement of National Objectives and Priorities for the Probation Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811425445">Home Office, 1984</xref>) set out a policy of lower priority for social work with post-release offenders and the introduction of national standards by the Home Office in 1989, at first for community service but extended in 1992, reduced professional discretion in dealing with offender non-compliance and strengthened the surveillance and control requirements (made more rigorous in 2000 and further again in 2005 and 2007). In contrast to the earlier welfarist tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811425445">Garland, 1985</xref>), it is public protection and risk management which now configures ‘end-to-end’, pre- and post-release, offender management: National Offender Management Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748895811425445">NOMS, 2005</xref>). The <italic>Halliday Report</italic> highlighted deficiencies in resettlement services for offenders serving short prison sentences, a group with ‘multiple problems and high risks of re-offending’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811425445">Home Office, 2001</xref>: 3.1, 22). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU (2002)</xref> reiterated concerns over prisoners’ needs, post-release, and drew attention to the failure of many agencies to respond appropriately. In 2004, the Government’s strategy to meet resettlement needs was defined in the <italic>Reducing Re-offending National Action Plan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425445">Home Office, 2004b</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1748895811425445">Nacro, 2000</xref>). <italic>Through the Prison Gate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>) stressed the importance of effective working relationships between the Prison and Probation Services, which, following the Carter Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811425445">Home Office, 2003</xref>), were merged to become the National Offender Management Service in 2004. However, concerns have arisen over organizational practice and poor communication between the two agencies, particularly with risk assessment and post-release supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811425445">Bridges, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811425445">2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>Prison numbers have risen exponentially in recent years. In 1998, for England and Wales, the figure for both males and females was 65,298, which by 5 March 2004 had increased to 74,960. On 22 July 2011, this was 84,934, with female prisoners at just under 5 per cent of the total (a percentage that has remained relatively stable in recent years) (calculated from the Prison Service website: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2011a</xref>). Although the present UK Coalition government has stated an intention to reduce the prison population, their recent backtracking on prospective sentencing reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425445">BBC News, 2011</xref>), influenced not insignificantly by media reaction and considerations of electoral popularity, casts considerable doubt on governmental commitment to that aim. Pre-Coalition population projections for 2009–2015 indicate a continuing long-term upward trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2009a</xref>), due in no small measure to changes in legislation: for example, the indeterminate sentence for public protection (Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 2003). The vast majority of prisoners, including lifers, will leave prison at some point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425445">Appleton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1748895811425445">Padfield, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811425445">2011</xref>), the exception being whole-term lifers (24 males and fewer than five females, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811425445">Hansard, 2009</xref>) whose release is most unlikely. With high reconviction rates for ex-prisoners, particularly those with previous custodial terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895811425445">2010b</xref>), this might suggest that ‘<italic>resettlement</italic>’ is: (a) a ‘flawed’ process – namely that there is something wrong with systems of pre- and post-release provision; and (b) a ‘failed’ product – that non-offending behaviour following imprisonment occurs only on a small scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1748895811425445">
<title>What Is Resettlement?</title>
<p>The definition of resettlement from the Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP), and adopted in <italic>Through the Prison Gate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>), is constructed in narrow instrumental terms without any delineation or examination of the normative structures – values, principles, attitudes, beliefs – on which the means to be employed and/or the ends to be attained are based. Resettlement is thought of as a ‘systematic and evidence-based process … so that communities are better protected from harm and reoffending is significantly reduced. It encompasses the totality of work with prisoners, their families and significant others in partnership with statutory and voluntary organisations’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>: 12, 1.7).</p>
<p>With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1748895811425445">Ramsbotham (2003)</xref>, too, the primary focus is on interventionist/correctionalist methodology and any normative explication is absent. Although he questions a fundamental assumption about ‘resettlement’, the emphasis lies with enhancing the individual’s capacity to ‘settle’ – with an underdeveloped exploration in his broader argument of structural conditions and/or life-course opportunities:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The word ‘resettlement’ is not a wholly accurate description in every case because many prisoners have never had a ‘settled’ existence even before imprisonment. If ‘settlement’ is to have any hope of success, the ways of living law-abiding and useful lives must be inculcated into prisoners … This requires the Prison Service not only to determine how each prisoner can be motivated and equipped to enable them to do this, but also to design every activity around the resettlement, or settlement, process. (2003: 146)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of questions arise. What kinds of community are offenders going to? How will they be received by their family, friends, locality, or in those communities where they are unknown? What might their life opportunities be? In short, what might resettlement mean, not as a generality, but in the unique circumstances of the individual subject? A common presumption found in policy formulation is that resettlement, self-evidently, is a pro-social process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425445">Maruna, 2001</xref>: 7; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425445">Appleton, 2010</xref>, on desistance and ‘pro-social identity’). Assumptions are made about communities, despite a long tradition in sociological literature on the theoretical and empirical uncertainties as to what community means. ‘Community’ is rarely a homogenous, integrated entity. Instead, it signifies heterogeneity (geographic, cultural, demographic, interest alignment) expressed through diverse value and normative frameworks both within communities and between them. For many released offenders, their social environments do not reflect the values, background, life experiences or contain the economic means to promote a sense of ‘going straight’, despite any intention pre-release to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811425445">Burnett and Maruna, 2004</xref>). Resettlement might mean resettling into one’s former criminogenic social network, or a community fractured by social and economic disadvantages with high criminality correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425445">Allen, 2009</xref>). ‘Resettlement’, without conceptual and theoretical exposition, is an incomplete construct and, in the absence of defining normative referents and specified empirical contexts, heuristically inadequate. It is like a road map with most of the required detail to give it substantive meaning missing. Resettlement has tended to be invested with an implicit ‘mainstream society’ normative base, reminiscent of the Durkheimian ‘collective conscience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811425445">Durkheim, 1895/1964</xref>) and the later consensus theories of US structural-functionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748895811425445">Merton, 1957</xref>). Late modernity mediates value and cultural difference yet its very antithesis, an implied (or ‘soft’) mono-culturalism, is discernible. Without a fuller recognition of diversity, resettlement as a criminological concept remains theoretically and sociologically underdeveloped. Resettlement is not a uniform process or a universally agreed end-state but encompasses complex individuated transitions within social structures of differentiated, and unequal, life opportunity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748895811425445">
<title>Resettlement and Re-entry</title>
<p>‘Re-entry’ has become the ‘new buzzword in correctional reform’ in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel, 2002</xref>: 158), whereas in the UK it is ‘resettlement’ that ‘is the buzzword of choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1748895811425445">Ward and Maruna, 2007</xref>: 4). Re-entry has a conceptually more open and less policy-directed connotation than resettlement and is the preferred term in the following schema: ‘“re-entry” lacks the element of support or nurturance implicit in root words like “care”, “aid” and even “settle”. Indeed, ‘re-entry’ is an intentionally vague, largely descriptive term that can imply different things to different listeners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel, 2002</xref>: 160).</p>
<p>Re-engagement with civil society is a process of differentiated and nuanced levels of re-entry or transition. In this article, three principal phases or stages along a continuum of re-entry are identified and explored, though these are not exhaustive and further critical analysis is warranted. For reasons of space, ‘re-entry’, as theoretically constructed and applied in these phases, is distinguished, first, from ‘re-entry’ that includes pre-release work with offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>) and ‘resettlement’ as found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP (2001)</xref>. Second, it corresponds more closely with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel’s (2002)</xref> less interventionist view (earlier). Third, it transcends the instrumentalism of what the State and civic society <italic>do</italic> and focuses more on wider interactions between the offender and their social worlds.</p>
<p>With regard to all three phases, the dynamics of agency/structure define: (a) the nature of the societal reaction to release, or rather diverse reactions as there are likely to be a plurality of temporal, spatial and micro/macro cultural contexts; and (b) the psychological/cognitive processes of the offender, including responses and related adaptive behaviour to that reaction or set of reactions. This is broadly influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811425445">Giddens’ (1984)</xref> ‘structuration’ thesis, whereby neither agency (individual or collective) nor structure are independent of one another but are configured within a ‘duality of structure’: ‘the structural properties of social systems do not exist outside of action but are … implicated in its production and reproduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811425445">1984</xref>: 297). There are complex processes of change – simultaneously and over time – which bring about reconstitutions or transformations (intended and unintended) of individuated, social and cultural practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1748895811425445">Vaughan, 2001</xref>, for a critique of structuration theory in criminology).</p>
<p>The phases of re-entry are presented in broad skeletal terms and do not include such contextual specifics as offence(s), criminal history, length of sentence and type (determinate or indeterminate), whether the offender will receive statutory supervision, or what programmes may have been completed in prison or undertaken after release. These would need to be factored in and examined – theoretically and empirically – according to particular circumstance(s). Re-entry experiences will vary according to the individual and their situation. Some ex-prisoners may be released to approved premises, for example a hostel where there is surveillance as well as expected support. A further consideration might be how re-entry may be affected by perceptions of and behaviour towards particular minority ethnic groups within prevailing host cultures. Gender is another issue. Many women are held in prisons far away from home (‘diaspora’ effect), with multiple adverse consequences for sustaining community ties and family integrity and for accessing local support services on release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811425445">Corston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1748895811425445">Wedderburn et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

It is the beginning of the psychological and social transition from the control and routine of prison environments to individual responsibility for day-to-day living. For many ex-prisoners, this is the first test of whether institutional dependency has occurred or been compounded in cases of prior carceral experience. Before release many offenders express a deep desire not to reoffend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811425445">Burnett and Maruna, 2004</xref>), but whether and to what degree this is realized, notwithstanding the level of personal commitment, is mediated by community response or rather, and more accurately, the actions and reactions of those within the community deemed to be important. These ‘significant others’ may be key individuals in the offender’s extant social networks (as social capital) and/or those networks aspired to. In the days immediately following release, severe difficulties are frequently encountered in navigating the challenges of securing accommodation, finding employment and meeting other material needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU, 2002</xref>). How the offender meets such challenges will be determined not only by the strength or otherwise of their social networks, for example, family, kin and friendship ties, but by the range and depth of their personal abilities, skills and capacities (human capital) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811425445">Coleman, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1748895811425445">SEU (2002</xref>: 10, 6), many prisoners ‘have poor skills and little experience of employment, few positive social networks, severe housing problems, and all of this is often severely complicated by drug, alcohol and mental health problems’. Such ex-prisoners face insurmountable problems during this phase and find that their social and human capital resources are insufficient or unable to manage the demands of transition. Many are caught up in a seemingly intractable ‘revolving door’ syndrome of short prison terms punctuated by brief intervals outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1748895811425445">Nacro, 2000</xref>). For such offenders (in the case of adults) serving sentences of less than 12 months, and therefore without statutory supervision by the Probation Service, their social and structural marginalization may become more deeply experienced and chronic.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Re-entry as emergent social integration</italic>. This is a more developed transitional form and is ‘more than physically re-entering society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel, 2002</xref>: 167). It is beyond the previous (societal) stage and signifies enhanced personal and social transformations towards <italic>being of society</italic>. This mid-stage, of ‘becoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895811425445">Matza, 1969</xref>), is a process of growing assimilation into those social networks of emotional, psychological and social support that promote social integration. To what degree this is accomplished depends not just upon the presence or otherwise of community involvement but the residual, adaptive and developing cognitive, knowledge, skills and other capacities of the offender (human capital). What distinguishes this transition from the earlier ‘societal stage’ is its theoretical and empirical development in both human and social capital terms.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811425445">Coleman (1988</xref>: s98), ‘social capital is defined by its function’: ‘[it] is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be possible’. It is ‘both an <italic>enabling</italic> feature of an individual’s life’ and ‘a … feature of that which is <italic>enabled</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425445">Farrall, 2004</xref>: 61, emphasis in original). Three variants of social capital have been identified: bonding; bridging; and linking. Bonding describes the close connections between people in relatively homogenous groups, such as family members, friends or the same ethnic group. Bridging characterizes more distant connections, for example with associates and colleagues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1748895811425445">Putnam (2000)</xref> sees bonding social capital as good for ‘getting by’ in life but bridging social capital as crucial for ‘getting ahead’. Linking social capital is concerned with relations between individuals and groups within systems of stratified and inequitable power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1748895811425445">Woolcock (2001</xref>: 72) thinks of linking social capital as having the ‘capacity to leverage resources, ideas and information from formal institutions beyond the community’.</p>
<p>The relationship between human and social capital is interactive and contingent. Human capital is subject to change and transformation via the interactive relationship with social capital, as is social capital with human capital. Bonding social capital is foundational, but bridging social capital (for example, initiating and expanding employment opportunities) and linking (with an agency, for instance, so that it might act as either advocate or broker to improve welfare benefit entitlement) may assume increasing importance during this phase. For many offenders, particularly those serving long sentences, some of the ‘old certainties’ of social capital may no longer exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1748895811425445">Sapsford et al., 2005</xref>). For example, separation might have given their partner an independence not previously experienced and the offender’s former domestic roles are challenged and become subject to re-negotiation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Re-entry as social integration or reintegration</italic>. This denotes an achieved level of settled existence within the community and is a more extensive form of inclusion than at the emergent social reintegration stage. Progression to this third phase would depict what generally may be termed a ‘settled’ or ‘socially integrated’ life. There is a deeper sense of belonging and permanence in relationships, of psychological, emotional and social attachment. Human and social capital would have developed in range and form, with the latter likely to incorporate, in addition to bonding social capital, bridging and perhaps linking social capital. Where the offender has returned to a community with (a) an internal personal narrative and intention not to reoffend, (b) favourable and supportive societal reaction(s), in part conducive to a diminution or ending of an ex-prisoner ‘master status’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811425445">Becker, 1963</xref>) or ‘spoiled identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425445">Goffman, 1963</xref>), and (c) associated structural opportunities to reinforce (a) and (b), then these are the presumed pre-requisites for the achievement of non-recidivistic, law-abiding resettlement. This accords with the stated objectives of post-release licence supervision in England and Wales: to ‘protect the public’; ‘prevent re-offending’; and ‘achieve … successful re-integration into the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811425445">Padfield, 2011</xref>: 122). Such would seem to reflect the thinking behind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel’s (2002</xref>: 167) assertion about the ‘moral’ and ‘wider’ community:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If re-entry is to be a meaningful concept, presumably it implies more than physically re-entering society, but also includes some sort of ‘relational reintegration’ back into the moral community. That is, the reintegrated person should be re-accepted as a full fledged member in and of the wider community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether it is integration (settled existence for the first time) or reintegration (returning to a former level of settled living) will depend on specific and antecedent circumstance. For those offenders who have committed offences that attract the severest public censure, the obstacles may prove insuperable and the very opposite of inclusiveness occurs, namely the offender perceived as threat, as ‘other’. Social capital in certain forms may exclude, restrict individual freedom and reinforce inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1748895811425445">Portes, 1998</xref>). In the case of sex offenders, there could be ‘circles of support’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425445">Edgar and Drewery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811425445">Kemshall and Maguire, 2003</xref>), but these are likely to be drawn from small numbers of volunteers and not attract wider community approval or involvement.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With all three stages of re-entry, the host community may not necessarily be pro-social and predominantly law-abiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1748895811425445">Raynor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1748895811425445">Raynor and Robinson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895811425445">Maguire and Nolan (2007)</xref> found in their study that some pre-release offenders were anxious about reoffending if they returned to their home areas. Presumptions of pro-sociality (see earlier comment on resettlement and assumptions of hegemonic mono-culturalism) can be construed as conceptually flawed and theoretically restrictive (constraints of space do not allow for expanded discussion here). All social networks, as social capital, have attributes of sociability and collective cohesion, irrespective of whether they manifest law-abiding or law-offending values and behaviour. Social capital of a defined contra-social kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425445">Halpern, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1748895811425445">Woolcock, 2001</xref>) is not necessarily anomic or constantly and invariably polarized from ‘mainstream’ society. It may, however, be sufficiently contrasting in key aspects, such as in attitudes disposing to and behaviour involving criminality, to be significantly distinguishable from pro-social expressions. Further, just as certain forms of social capital are criminogenic, or not normatively averse to criminal behaviour, so this applies to human capital too. Human capital, by its very nature, embraces diverse skills, abilities and knowledge that individuals variously possess, develop and use.</p>

<title>Resettlement, Re-entry and Desistance</title>
<p>In recent years, criminology has become increasingly interested in crime cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811425445">Burnett and Maruna, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425445">Farrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425445">Farrall and Calverley, 2006</xref>). However, what precisely is desistance is neither self-evident nor straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425445">Farrall and Calverley (2006</xref>: 1), it ‘is something of an enigma in modern criminology’. To desist means ‘to cease or to stop’ and at first glance the concept of desistance would suggest a ‘continued state of non-offending’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>: 18). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811425445">Laub and Sampson (2001)</xref> distinguish between the ending of offending behaviour (termination) and the process whereby that end-state comes about (desistance). Desistance is rarely a single or one-off event and neither is there usually a linear incremental trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425445">Farrall and Calverley, 2006</xref>). Uneven development or ‘zig-zagging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>) is more likely. This conceptualization</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>better captures the true nature of desisting from offending – in which ‘lulls’ in offending, temporary resumption of offending and the like are common – and provides a schema in which <italic>reductions</italic> in offence severity or the frequency with which offences were admitted to could be interpreted as indications of the <italic>emergence</italic> of desistance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425445">Farrall and Calverley, 2006</xref>: 1, emphases in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of key factors have been associated with processes of desistance: maturation (growing out of crime); social bonds (family ties, employment, community involvement, etc.); and the formation of personal narratives that restructure cognitive processes, identity and self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425445">Maruna, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811425445">Farrall (2002)</xref> has drawn a distinction between ‘objective’ changes in an offender’s life and the ‘subjective’ meanings given to those changes. These cognitive (subjective) constructions may exemplify ‘secondary desistance’: namely, a restructuring of self-identity whereby the individual comes increasingly to see themselves as moving from offender to non-offender status. Secondary desistance may derive from ‘primary desistance’ (a period of uninterrupted non-offending) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811425445">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>) but primary desistance is not necessarily a precondition. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811425445">Lemert’s (1951)</xref> conceptual distinction between primary and secondary deviation, it can be argued that elements of a transforming self-identity may precede the primary desistance phase (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811425445">McIvor et al., 2004</xref>, on maturation). Furthermore, desistance may occur without prior reorganization of self-identity, as trigger, in that material attraction or other reasons for offending decline in influence or cease to exist altogether. This seems to be borne out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811425445">Burnett (2000</xref>: 14) who discovered that ‘convert’ desisters were</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the most resolute and certain among the desisters. They had found new interests that were all-preoccupying and overturned their value system: a partner, a child, a good job, a new vocation. These were attainments that they were not prepared to jeopardise or which over-rode any interest in or need for … crime.</p>

<p>Transitions to <italic>re-entry as social integration</italic> with a ‘law-abiding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1748895811425445">Petersilia, 2004</xref>), ‘pro-social’ trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425445">Appleton, 2010</xref>) would emanate from desistance processes typified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811425445">Bazemore and Stinchcombe’s (2004)</xref> ‘civic engagement model of re-entry’; and against a backdrop of social/public scrutiny and critical judgement (see earlier discussion on agentic intentionality and societal reaction). Relevant here is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425445">Maruna and LeBel’s (2002)</xref> distinction between strengths-based narratives and narratives based on either needs or risk. Strengths-based approaches are not concerned with personal deficits (needs or risk) but whether positive contributions can be made. The offender is regarded more as a potential ‘helper’ rather than in need of ‘help’. This transformation of status re-balances the one-dimensionality of an ‘opportunity deficit model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1748895811425445">Raynor, 2004</xref>). The offender is seen less as a victim of circumstance, due to lack of access to resources, and more as an individual with decision-making powers, motivation and heightened self-responsibility (see Raynor’s ‘offender responsibility’ or ‘offender choice’ models, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1748895811425445">Raynor, 2007</xref>). Such ‘capability building’ is an important element of the strengths-based logic of the ‘good lives model of rehabilitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1748895811425445">Ward and Maruna, 2007</xref>: 172). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1748895811425445">Ward and Maruna (2007</xref>: 174) do not use the terminology of human and social capital, their discussion of the ‘internal and external conditions necessary to attain valued outcomes … in the reintegration process’ underscores their essential meaning: ‘Internal conditions refer to psychological characteristics such as skills, beliefs and attitudes, while external conditions refer to social resources, opportunities and supports’.</p>
<p>Offender ‘strengths’ can be translated into valued inputs into the community to elicit ‘earned redemption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811425445">Bazemore, 1999</xref>) and ‘moral inclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895811425445">Maruna, 2004</xref>). In England and Wales there is a long history of prisoners becoming involved in community-focused work, either on projects inside prison or outside on daily release. Organizations such as the Inside Out Trust have been involved for some years in harnessing the labour of serving prisoners for the benefit of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811425445">International Centre for Prison Studies, 2002</xref>). Rarely do the general public know of this and, when made aware, often display considerable surprise. In research for the Restorative Prison Project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1748895811425445">Moore et al. (2003)</xref> discovered that over three-quarters of respondents in a community survey had no knowledge of prisoners having been involved in a local park refurbishment scheme. All of those interviewed thought the work ‘put something back’ and some believed it would help prisoners develop a sense of personal responsibility and citizenship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811425445">Bazemore and Stinchcombe, 2004</xref>). Predictably, a major determinant of perception was seriousness of offence and criminal record. To a small number of respondents, the ‘redemptive’ work made little difference to their largely condemnatory attitude towards offenders in general.</p>

<sec id="section6-1748895811425445">
<title>Extending the Debate: Theory, Policy and Practice</title>
<p>A number of key concepts have been identified and, to a limited degree, explored. The problematized nature of resettlement has been commented upon and a typology or schema of re-entry proposed. Additionally, there has been an initial examination of resettlement and desistance. The relationships between them now require further explication in terms of theoretical connectivity, policy formulation and practice intervention.</p>
<p>First, resettlement is a generic term. The normative constituency of ‘resettlement’ is not self-evident, but multi-layered, nuanced and multi-contextual. Despite this, prescriptive assumptions tend to be ascribed to resettlement to suggest that what it signifies is without question: quite simply, ‘going straight’. Such a position reduces a penological conundrum to an empirical oversimplification. It begs many questions and conflates a supposed generalized end-state with the many and varied processes of adjustment and adaptation. Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1748895811425445">Ramsbotham (2003)</xref> questioned resettlement or settlement, so are many other criminological ‘re-’ words interpretatively problematic: reintegration or integration? Rehabilitation or habilitation? (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>: 3). If rehabilitation is ‘to restore an offender to his or her previous competency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1748895811425445">Scott, 2008</xref>: 15), then ‘habilitation’ (to equip initially) might be more apt in many circumstances.</p>
<p>Second, if the principal aim of resettlement is to be the realization of non-offending, pro-social behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425445">Appleton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811425445">House of Commons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2010a</xref>), then desistance theory introduces a major qualifier. Desistance may be characterized by oscillation between progress and relapse, the range and intensity of each being contingent upon prevailing individual and structural circumstance. Offending may not necessarily come to an end but rather decline in both frequency and seriousness. Would the latter be thought of as resettlement ‘in progress’, or abject failure? Certainly, there are implications for post-release offenders on statutory supervision for whom no allowance may be made for a ‘zig-zagging’ path towards non-offending. Somewhat ironically, the strict enforcement of licence conditions, as mandated by National Standards, can constitute a critical obstacle to reintegration, the very aim the ‘ethos of resettlement’ cherishes so dearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811425445">Hedderman and Hough, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>; on the increased use of prison recalls see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811425445">Padfield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811425445">Padfield and Maruna, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the definitions of resettlement by Her Majesty’s Inspectorates of Prisons and Probation (2001) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1748895811425445">Ramsbotham (2003)</xref> echo statist resettlement logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2011a</xref>) but ‘resettlement’, as has been argued, is a complex process and involves more than ‘what the State does’. (Or what the State often fails to do, pre- and post-release: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811425445">Crook, 2008</xref>, on the high-security estate; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>, on sentences of less than 12 months.) Of interest, is Ramsbotham’s argument that the ‘settlement’ process needs to be undertaken from prison reception onwards, an observation that reflects the old throughcare principle (largely discarded in the 1980s) but which has re-materialized, albeit with different priorities in contemporary penal policy on offender management and the ‘seamless sentence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811425445">Home Office, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748895811425445">NOMS, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This ‘interventionist’ role of the State raises further and wider questions. For Rotman (1990: 183), an offender has a ‘right to an opportunity to return to society with a better chance of being a useful citizen and staying out of prison’. His ‘rights’ model of rehabilitation chimes with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811425445">Cullen and Gilbert’s (1982)</xref> ‘state-obligated rehabilitation’: that the State has an obligation (or ‘moral duty’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811425445">Lewis, 2005</xref>: 123) to provide rehabilitative programmes. However, in the case of offenders serving short sentences in England and Wales (mainly in local prisons where overcrowding is at its most acute), having access to a rehabilitative programme for resettlement as part of a sentence plan, if indeed such a plan has been completed, can be a remote prospect. In June 2007, a high court judge in England ruled that a prisoner serving a sentence for public protection (IPP) should be released as continued detention would be unlawful on the grounds that no facilities (accredited programmes) had been made available to determine whether a danger to the public still existed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1748895811425445">Travis, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748895811425445">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, the Prison Service’s daily release on temporary licence (ROTL), which in part prepares offenders for living in the community while still serving the custodial element of the sentence, is designed to facilitate post-release reintegration. Utilized at prisons with open conditions and following risk assessment, offenders are encouraged and assisted to secure outside paid employment (sometimes continued after release), having first completed voluntary work for the local community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1748895811425445">Sapsford et al., 2005</xref>). Home detention curfew (HDC) and the longer established system of parole (now revised by the sentencing structure of the CJA 2003) can also aid the re-engagement process (on HDC, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425445">HMIPP, 2001</xref>: 95, 7.3; but 105, 7.34 for a critical view), though early release practices may be driven by other factors, too. For example, the ‘end of custody licence’ (ECL), introduced in 2007 but withdrawn in March 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811425445">Hansard, 2010</xref>), was intended to reduce population pressure in the prison estate.</p>
<p>Fifth, agency-driven resettlement, particularly in the statutory sector, has become increasingly concerned with psychology-based interventions: for example, sex offender treatment (SOTP), enhanced thinking skills (ETS) and anger management programmes (CALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2011c</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811425445">Hollin, 2008</xref>). Drawing upon cognitive theory, the aim is to restructure the thought processes of offenders towards more pro-social attitudes and behaviour. Such an approach, though criticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811425445">Kendall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811425445">Mair, 2004</xref>), would complement addressing welfare needs (see ‘FOR – A Change’ programme: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811425445">Lewis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425445">Maguire and Raynor, 2006</xref>). However, an excessive focus on deficits in thinking skills and motivation runs the (almost platitudinous) risk of concentrating too much upon the offender as an individual and not enough on wider social and economic questions. A cynic might argue that it is far more ideologically attractive, and action manageable, for government (Ministry of Justice) to adopt an individualized intervention strategy than it is to manipulate the broad spectrum of impinging structural variables, over many of which it has little, if any, control or influence. Cognitive behaviourism is the ideational bedrock of ‘What Works’. The deterministic rehabilitative theorization of the 1950s and 1960s has been replaced by responsibilization<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748895811425445">5</xref></sup> (the offender as rational, moral agent): ‘rehabilitation with attitude’. Contemporary rehabilitative thinking (certainly at governmental level in the UK) emphasizes decision making and acknowledging the consequences of one’s behaviour, not just for oneself but others, through enhanced cognitive development, self-awareness and self-responsibility (see ‘offender responsibility’ model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1748895811425445">Raynor, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1748895811425445">2007</xref>). This construct of rehabilitation is theoretically and ontologically distanced from the exculpatory leanings of ‘old rehabilitationism’ and, historically, is much closer to the 19th-century precept of personal reform through reflective, contemplative endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811425445">Hudson, 2003</xref>). The ‘new penality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811425445">Garland, 2001</xref>) reformulation of rehabilitation (and resettlement) epitomizes a form of coerced responsibilization, with external surveillance if necessary to produce compliance. Such a paradigmatic shift to a ‘postmodern penal world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1748895811425445">Pratt, 2000</xref>: 127) may not, however, be as profound as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895811425445">Feeley and Simon (1992)</xref> have advanced. To what degree the ‘new penology’ of offender (waste) management has supplanted the welfarist ideology of ‘old penology’ rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811425445">Garland, 1985</xref>) is an interesting question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748895811425445">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425445">Appleton (2010)</xref>, for example, in her study of probation service supervision of released life sentence prisoners in England and Wales, found that officers (as ‘offender managers’) still applied elements of traditionalist/social work/casework rehabilitation practice within the overarching and organizationally prescriptive risk management culture.</p>
<p>Sixth, if one the main objectives of ‘resettlement’, if not the foremost, is crime reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811425445">Her Majesty’s Prison Service, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811425445">Padfield, 2011</xref>), then the generation of ‘pro-social’ human and social capital would appear to be <italic>sine qua non</italic> for resettlement intervention and governance. Given the current managerialist climate of ‘value for money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811425445">Lewis, 2005</xref>) and centralized budgetary control, a critical question is whether the penal system, including for-profit and third-sector agencies, is sufficiently resourced and organized to ‘deliver’ to such a rationale – while also acknowledging the limited efficacy of law enforcement agencies within the wider social policy context of crime regulation and control. The current decision not to introduce Custody Plus (CJA 2003), which would have expanded the supervisory and resettlement role of the Probation Service for sentences of less than 12 months, may not only be a missed opportunity but signal future lack of intent in much broader policy terms. Significant budgetary reductions for the Probation Service to 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895811425445">NAPO News, 2008/2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748895811425445">2009</xref>), the Prison Service and those already applied and signposted within other spheres of state expenditure are ominous. Recent announcements from the Ministry of Justice about a new ‘rehabilitation revolution’, which re-emphasizes contestability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811425445">Home Office, 2003</xref>) and an increasing role for the private sector through payment by results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811425445">Ministry of Justice, 2010a</xref>), are difficult to assess at present yet have to be understood against a national and international background of economic uncertainty and financial constraint (especially in the state sector).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The core purpose of this article has been to explore divergent meanings and empirical contexts of resettlement and to outline three phases of re-entry. Additionally, there has been a brief examination of desistance. For reasons of space, there has been no opportunity to explore ethnicity or gender, nor the contingent factors of age (for example, the re-entry problems of young offenders or those of an increasingly ageing prisoner population), length of sentence, criminal history or previous custodial experience. Class and social structure have been alluded to, but the analysis barely begun. These are for further examination.</p>
<p>The principal argument has been to ask what ‘resettlement’ is and question some of the assumptions – normative, cultural, social, behavioural – that underpin it or are associated. Policy discourse is inclined to centre on provision, or lack of it, from statutory, for-profit or third-sector agencies without any developed examination of the rationale of intervention, the exact aims and objectives or the diverse circumstances of offenders (community contexts, networks of support, agentic capacity) to deal with post-carceral transitions. Resettlement is not simply progression to law-abiding conduct; ‘resettling’ signifies multi-layered and nuanced social and psychological processes that lead to highly differentiated outcomes, some of which can incorporate characteristics of the ‘criminogenic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1748895811425445">Raynor and Robinson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Resettlement, theoretically and empirically, is not synonymous with rehabilitation but such conflation is found in much academic and policy discourse. Despite the wealth of literature on the subject, ‘resettlement’ continues to evade precise conceptualization and heuristic assessment of what it is, how it is to be achieved and whether or not it has been. All may be ‘suitably’ defined (by the offender and appropriate parties), with the designated aim(s) attained in terms of an individual subject and their particular circumstances, but to assume, and expect, that the focus and content of such specific micro analysis can be extrapolated with equal relevance and applicability to a macro world of extensive diversity and contrast seems logically, theoretically and empirically untenable. Resettlement tends to convey a generic notion of <italic>social integration</italic>, but its ‘on the ground’ complexity – phenomenological, social, societal, structural – renders it irreducible to any objectified ‘unitary’ form. Just as the capacity of the criminal justice system to regulate and reduce crime can be exaggerated, so might ‘society’ expect too much of ‘resettlement’ as an outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, to concentrate on transitions from prison to the community, though of considerable importance, may serve to divert attention and scrutiny from the wider critique of contemporary penality and the preoccupations – of government, media coverage, political debate, public comment – with imprisonment as a penal sanction. Many of the issues, problems and concerns over how to ensure that ‘resettlement works’, through policy intervention and socially inclusive measures, would not arise if judicial disposals other than imprisonment were more extensively considered and applied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748895811425445">7</xref></sup></p>
