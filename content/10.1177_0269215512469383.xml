<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disorder affecting young adults, with approximately 100 000 people diagnosed with the condition in the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512469383">1</xref></sup> The disease presents with a variety of symptoms including spasticity, neuropathic pain, bladder and bowel dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512469383">2</xref></sup> which often progresses over time and impacts on quality of life. Management of multiple sclerosis encompasses pharmacological and rehabilitation approaches, however much of the recent research effort has concentrated on disease-modifying drugs and regenerative medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512469383">3</xref></sup> There are a large number of patients for whom current disease-modifying drugs are not beneficial and many people with multiple sclerosis are turning to alternative therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512469383">4</xref></sup> Complementary therapies are commonly used within the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512469383">5</xref></sup> and may offer an option for symptomatic management in long-term conditions such as multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Reflexology involves manual stimulation of reflex points on the feet which correspond somatotopically to specific areas and organs of the body. The technique was developed in China and introduced to the West in 1913, since when its popularity has continued to grow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512469383">6</xref></sup> A Cochrane review on reflexology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512469383">7</xref></sup> did not, however, find sufficient evidence to support its use and highlighted the need for additional research. Subsequent research has provided some evidence of positive effects in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512469383">8</xref></sup> diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512469383">9</xref></sup> chronic constipation in children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512469383">10</xref></sup> and pain in rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512469383">11</xref></sup> and metastatic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512469383">12</xref></sup> Only three studies have been undertaken in multiple sclerosis: one observational<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512469383">13</xref></sup> and two randomized controlled trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512469383">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> These studies have produced mixed results and the most recent by Hughes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> found no difference between precision or sham reflexology on the symptom of pain in multiple sclerosis. All three studies have examined the effect of reflexology in a less disabled multiple sclerosis population. Few studies have exclusively examined the effectiveness of symptomatic therapy strategies treatments for those more severely affected by multiple sclerosis and this has been identified by the MS Society (UK) as an area in need of research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512469383">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reflexology has the potential to offer symptomatic relief and enhance quality of life in this patient group. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of delivering reflexology to people more severely affected by multiple sclerosis and to evaluate the effects of the treatment on quality of life and a range of symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512469383" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A pilot single-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was designed to compare 8 weeks of once weekly reflexology treatment with sham reflexology. Ethical approval for the study was provided by NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran research ethics committee and all participants gave written informed consent. People moderately to severely affected by multiple sclerosis were recruited from the multiple sclerosis service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran. Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an extended disability status score of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting) and 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512469383">17</xref></sup> Patients with a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis who could potentially benefit from reflexology (i.e. had at least two of the following symptoms: bowel, bladder dysfunction, muscle stiffness or spasm, pain, anxiety, depression or poor quality of sleep) were identified and issued with the participant information leaflet and asked to contact the chief investigator if they wished to participate in the study.</p>
<p>A total of 37 people were contacted, 23 agreed to participate and attended the screening appointment. Subjects were excluded if they had: a Mini Mental State Examination score of less than 23,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512469383">18</xref></sup> rapidly progressing disease, additional coexisting neurological conditions, other serious illness such as malignancy or major organ failure and if they had previous treatment with reflexology. One person was excluded due to scoring less than 23 on the Mini Mental State Examination and two people withdrew prior to the first appointment, one due to being unwell with a urinary tract infection and the second because of difficulties committing to the full course of treatment. All participants attended an initial screening appointment and, following successful screening and informed consent, the first 10 participants were randomly assigned by the recruiting therapist using a block randomization process to receive either reflexology or sham reflexology. The remaining 10 participants attended screening after the first 10 participants had completed their treatment. This was to accommodate for the reflexologists other work commitments. All participants were blind to their group allocation.</p>
<p>Participants attended the multiple sclerosis service’s rehabilitation unit on a weekly basis for a 60-minute treatment which was delivered at the same time of day by an experienced, registered reflexologist. The reflexologist was also a qualified massage therapist and delivered both interventions to all participants, which ensured consistency with the treatments and the interactions between the therapist and the participant.</p>
<p>The reflexology treatment consisted of a standardized sequence of pressure massage, stimulating all of the key meridians representative of the major body organs. During the reflexology sessions treatment was adapted according to the participant’s symptoms and to the problem areas identified by altering pressure and using appropriate reflex points. All treatments were therefore tailored to each participant’s needs. Sham treatment consisted of a lower leg and foot massage, with no specific pressure on any of the key meridians.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215512469383">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Outcome measures were undertaken at baseline, immediately following intervention (8 weeks) and 8 weeks after treatment finished (16 weeks). Participants completed the outcome measures at the screening visit following consent and at the final treatment visit (week 8) with the assistance of a health professional who was blind to the participant’s group allocation. The health professional gave a brief explanation about the measures and the participant was asked to complete the outcome measures. Where required, the health professional or the participant’s carer completed the measures with the participant’s guidance. The outcome measures were posted to the participants 8 weeks after completion of the treatment. The questionnaire was completed at home and returned via a stamped addressed envelope. Assistance to complete the questionnaires was offered on participant request.</p>
<p>In addition, participants were asked to keep a symptom diary to record any daily/weekly changes in symptoms and changes in health (e.g. infection), medication or circumstances which may have affected symptoms during the study period. Participants returned the diaries by post at the end of the study.</p>
<p>The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512469383">19</xref></sup> was the primary outcome measure for this study. This scale is a disease-specific health-related quality of life instrument, developed using the patient’s perspective on disease impact. The scale consists of 29 items which are scored from 1 to 5 (total score range 29–145), with a higher score indicating a greater impact of multiple sclerosis on the individual’s life. There are two subscales assessing the physical and the psychological impact of multiple sclerosis. The total score is generated by summing the scores of the individual items, with the subscale scores representing the sum of the items in each subscale.</p>
<p>Secondary outcome measures included a visual analogue scale assessing symptom severity of the following symptoms: muscle stiffness, muscle spasm, body pain, quality of sleep and bladder and bowel function. The scale consists of a numbered line moving from left to right, with the lowest score 0 indicating ‘no muscle stiffness’ and the highest score 10 indicating ‘ extreme muscle stiffness’ . The questionnaire asked whether they had ‘experienced the symptom listed over the previous week’ and participants were asked to ‘circle the number which best described its severity’. Similar visual analogue scales have been used in multiple sclerosis research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512469383">20</xref></sup> and their use in spasticity has been found to be valid and reliable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512469383">21</xref></sup> The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512469383">22</xref></sup> was used to assess mood. Participants rated 14 items on a 4-point scale, with separate subscores existing for anxiety (0–21) and depression (0–21). Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety or depression.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using Minitab version 16 and SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical packages. For demographic variables which were found to be parametric independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine differences, and for non-parametric outcomes (e.g. age) a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used. All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for between-group differences given that the outcome measures did not follow a normal distribution. Within-group differences were analysed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Clinical effectiveness was calculated as percentage change for all outcome measures at 8 and 16 weeks for both groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty subjects met the criteria for inclusion following screening, with 10 receiving reflexology and 10 receiving sham reflexology. All subjects completed the study and attendance of the treatment sessions was high at 95%. Reasons for non-attendance were related to family commitments and ill-health.

<p>There were small, non-significant improvements in most of the outcome measures after 8 weeks of treatment in both groups with most scores returning to baseline by week 16. Moderate reductions in scores were noted in muscle stiffness at 8 weeks in the reflexology group and in bladder symptoms at 16 weeks in the sham reflexology group. The exception to these results was with bowel symptoms where there was a statistically significant improvement noted in the sham reflexology group at 16 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = 0.038).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot study failed to demonstrate any statistically significant differences in the primary outcome measure (MSIS29) for reflexology treatment in people with multiple sclerosis who present with moderate to severe disability. Treatment was well tolerated, however, with all participants completing the course of treatment, no adverse effects being noted and the vast majority (95%) of participants attending the eight treatment sessions. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to deliver reflexology treatment to this patient group.</p>
<p>In relation to the primary outcome measure, the reductions noted in physical subscale at week 8 were much smaller in comparison to the results found by Hughes et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> who demonstrated a 40% reduction following 10 weeks of reflexology and a 34% reduction with sham reflexology treatment. Our results demonstrated much smaller reductions for reflexology (18%) and sham reflexology (10%). This could be a reflection of the greater disability of participants in the study (Extended Disability Status Score of 7.2 (±0.48); 7.4 (±0.53)) in comparison to the participants in Hughes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> ((5.8 (±0.95); 6.2 (±0.8)). The results seen in our study may be an indication that a longer duration of treatment is required or that reflexology is not effective in participants with greater levels of disability.</p>
<p>Similar to the results from previous reflexology studies in multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512469383">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512469383"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> there was a small immediate treatment effect seen in most of the symptomatic outcome measures, with a tendency to return towards baseline levels at follow-up. In this study, however, there were no differences in the effects, regardless of whether the participant received reflexology or sham reflexology treatment. Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512469383">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512469383"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> have reported positive effects of reflexology on pain, spasticity and bladder symptoms in multiple sclerosis, however the improvements noted in the current study were small and non-significant. The one exception was with regard to the effects of sham reflexology on bladder and bowel function. These results are difficult to explain and may warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Overall, the results do not support the use of reflexology for symptom relief in a more disabled multiple sclerosis population and are strongly suggestive of a placebo response. Previous research suggests that the therapist may be the most important component of the placebo effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512469383">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512469383">24</xref></sup> Therefore in this study the therapist’s relationship with the participants may have had more of an influence over the results than the reflexology treatment itself. Similar results were noted by Hughes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512469383">15</xref></sup> and the authors suggest that ‘the physiological process by which symptom reduction is achieved’ should be questioned. Possible mechanisms of action for the placebo response could include the stimulation of neurotransmitters, such as endorphins and dopamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512469383">25</xref></sup> There is a suggestion that chronic symptoms such as those evaluated in our study may be more strongly influenced by the placebo response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512469383">26</xref></sup> and this may explain the comparable response in the reflexology and sham reflexology groups in our study. Another theory to explain the beneficial effects observed in both groups is that the reflex points used in reflexology are perhaps not as specific a location as previously suggested. Stimulation in the general area may have caused an effect. Previous research indicates that reflexologists were not able to determine the presence of pathology according to reflex points, indicating that they were not specifically associated with one area of the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512469383">27</xref></sup> and that generic cutaneous afferent stimulation may be responsible for the dominant effect.</p>
<p>There were a number of limitations to this study, including the small number of participants (<italic>n =</italic>20) and the heterogenicity of the group, with large standard deviations for all of the outcome measures being noted. This may have contributed to the failure to detect statistical differences between the groups. The results were also influenced by a number of incomplete outcome measures from the follow-up assessment, where participants were asked to return questionnaires by post. Future studies using self-report outcome measures should enlist consistency in the methods of completion to maximise returns. The reflexology treatments were tailored to treat the individual participant’s symptoms; therefore there was a lack of consistency in the treatment being delivered across the reflexology group and perhaps also the sham reflexology group. Future research into physical treatments such as reflexology should establish the reliability of the delivering these treatments in a consistent manner. All treatments were delivered by the same therapist who was not blind to the treatment she was delivering and this may have influenced the outcome. It could be argued, however, that using the same therapist brought consistency in the treatment technique and patient therapist interactions across both groups.</p>
<p>This small pilot study has confirmed previous observations that reflexology and sham reflexology in the form of general lower limb massage has an effect on a range of symptoms experienced by people with multiple sclerosis. This study, however, has not demonstrated any advantage of reflexology per se compared with sham reflexology in people with more advanced disability and these results could be indicative of a placebo response. The study confirms that it is feasible to deliver reflexology treatment to patients with more advanced disability. Future randomized controlled trials should include placebo or sham reflexology treatments without direct contact with the foot, or indeed a control group not receiving any cutaneous therapy. This would allow a clearer distinction between the effects of reflexology and a placebo response.</p>
