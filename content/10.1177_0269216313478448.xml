<title>Background:</title>
<p>Advance care planning is considered to have an important role in the management of people with chronic lung disease; however, uptake in clinical practice remains limited. Participant acceptance of the inclusion of an advance care planning information session in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes could support a practical solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216313478448">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To evaluate the introduction of a structured group advance care planning information session from the perspective of participants in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216313478448">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>Prospective qualitative study with semi-structured interview transcripts analysed using iterative thematic analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216313478448">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>Participants in pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes at a tertiary metropolitan hospital and two affiliated community sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216313478448">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Sixty-seven participants with a range of chronic lung diseases were interviewed with ages ranging from 39 to 88 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) ranging from 18% to 130% predicted and 6-min walk distance ranging from 105 to 619 m. Sixteen participants (24%) had previously heard of advance care planning. Major themes were that participants valued the advance care planning information and thought pulmonary rehabilitation was an appropriate setting. The group education format was well accepted and perceived to have advantages over individual sessions. Participants were happy to receive the information from a non-medical facilitator. Non-attendees had usually missed the session for reasons unrelated to content. A small number of participants felt advance care planning was not appropriate for them, but all recognised its value for other participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216313478448">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Participants in our pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes value the opportunity to participate in a structured, group-based advance care planning session. Consideration should be given to broader inclusion of advance care planning education into existing pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance programmes for people with chronic respiratory disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>People with chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have a complex and unpredictable clinical course, with multiple co-morbidities and uncertain prognoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216313478448">1</xref></sup> They frequently experience a prolonged period of severe disability exacerbated by episodes of acute decline in health status and function, with distressing symptoms including dyspnoea and anxiety. Care to prolong life may be initiated in response to an acute deterioration (e.g. mechanical ventilation) rather than as part of a longer term plan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216313478448">2</xref></sup> Despite similar levels of end-of-life symptom burden and treatment preferences, these individuals are less likely to receive palliative care and die at home, compared to people with cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216313478448">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216313478448"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216313478448"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216313478448">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advance care planning (ACP) refers to an individual’s preparation for future loss of capacity by making their values and preferences for medical and lifestyle care known to others. This may include talking to family, friends and health professionals; appointing a substitute decision-maker and recording written values and preferences. While there is impetus and rationale for widespread implementation of ACP, this has not been translated into clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216313478448">6</xref></sup> Identified barriers for health professionals to initiate these discussions include difficult prognostication and concerns about the patient’s perception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216313478448">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216313478448">8</xref></sup> As a result, only a minority of people with chronic respiratory disease have discussed end-of-life care with their physician,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216313478448">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216313478448">10</xref></sup> despite evidence demonstrating ACP discussions are well received in outpatient settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216313478448">11</xref></sup> while those with long-term conditions are in a stable state of health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216313478448">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216313478448">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation and maintenance (PR&amp;M) programmes are multidisciplinary programmes of care for people with chronic respiratory impairment including COPD. Widely used and individually tailored to optimise physical and social performances and autonomy, they are an important part of the clinical management of people with chronic respiratory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216313478448">14</xref></sup> Current guidelines suggest the inclusion of ACP education in PR&amp;M programmes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216313478448">15</xref></sup> but this is not routinely undertaken. Some health-care providers may believe that ACP requires individual consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216313478448">16</xref></sup> Participants’ views of the acceptability of a structured ACP information session being introduced in a group setting as part of PR&amp;M programmes have not been described, and our understanding of why people may choose not to attend an ACP information session is poor.</p>
<p>ACP may be delivered by trained non-medical facilitators using a standardised approach to initiating discussion, reflection and understanding of one’s health state in terms of goals, values and preferences for future treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216313478448">17</xref></sup> In a randomised controlled trial of medical inpatients, a similar ACP approach (Respecting Patient Choices programme) demonstrated improved end-of-life care, patient satisfaction and family satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216313478448">18</xref></sup> We hypothesised that this same structured approach would assist the integration of ACP into existing outpatient PR&amp;M programmes, where education is conducted in a group setting, and enable practical implementation of ACP by non-medical facilitators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216313478448">19</xref></sup> This study aimed to evaluate the introduction of a structured group ACP information session from the perspective of participants in PR&amp;M programmes and identify themes or participant factors that might influence attendance or acceptance.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216313478448">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A prospective qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken using grounded theory principles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216313478448">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216313478448">21</xref></sup> PR&amp;M participants who attended the ACP session (‘attendees’) and those who did not attend (‘non-attendees’) were interviewed following their scheduled ACP education session and provided written consent. This study received institutional ethics approvals from Alfred Health (264/09), La Trobe University (FHEC09/207), Inner South Community Health Service and Bentleigh Bayside Community Health and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216313478448">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Individuals in this study were participants in PR&amp;M programmes at a tertiary metropolitan hospital and two affiliated community sites. Patients were excluded if they had a language or cognitive impairment precluding understanding of the ACP information session. In the hospital setting, ACP sessions took place as part of the regular outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation education programme. Participants were notified of the upcoming ACP information session and provided with a written summary of the session one week prior. In the community setting, all current PR&amp;M clients were sent the same summary and an invitation to attend a scheduled ACP information session, offered in addition to the established education programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216313478448">
<title>Information session</title>
<p>Group ACP information sessions were presented by two trained facilitators using the same presentation at all locations, using pictures and brief written information to promote interactive discussion. The presenter discussed – as a case study – their own appointment of a substitute decision-maker and advance care directive, emphasising the value of ACP for everyone in case of an unforeseen event. Written information and contact details for the ACP facilitator were provided to enable formal follow-up in both the hospital and community settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216313478448">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Interview questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216313478448">Table 1</xref>) explored the perspectives and experiences of individuals that may have influenced their decision to attend the ACP information session. Participants were given the option of semi-structured interviews in the PR&amp;M setting or via telephone. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim by a single researcher (A.T.B.). The proportion of patients who made individual ACP appointments and completed ACP documentation within 6 months of their ACP information session attendance was also collected.</p>

<p>Seventeen participants described PR&amp;M programmes as an appropriate location to receive information about ACP and preferable to an acute hospital setting:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the rehab program is a perfect place, you are still functioning. You still have your marbles together, so you can make those decisions, where in hospital you might be more emotive and you might not have all of your faculties together. (Participant AO12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patients frequently expressed that the provision of ACP information in this setting was consistent with the overall ‘self-efficacy’ message of PR&amp;M programmes:<disp-quote>
<p>It is a very important part of rehab to deal with the consequences of what we have got. (Participant AO9)</p>

<title>Information about ACP is considered to be valuable</title>
<p>Thirty-eight participants articulated that the information presented provided value, particularly ‘peace of mind’ in relation to future care:<disp-quote>
<p>I have emphysema so I don’t really know; I don’t really have that long left. I live on my own, so it will probably be a couple of days before I am found or I’ll collapse in the street … so if I go to hospital then they have that on record there … it gave me peace of mind. (Participant AI02)</p>

<sec id="section19-0269216313478448">
<title>Preference for a group format for the ACP sessions</title>
<p>Thirty-four participants felt that information about ACP is best presented in a group format, rather than as individual consultations:<disp-quote>
<p>A discussion is better because you can ask questions or clarify things or ask details about personal things. Within the group, different people asked different questions and some of the other questions I hadn’t thought of and they were useful. (Participant AO06)</p>
<p>In a single setting you would think ‘Oh God, they have picked me out? What is wrong with me? Do they know something I don’t?’ No, much better in a group setting. (Participant AO09)</p>

<sec id="section20-0269216313478448">
<title>Information can be presented by any adequately trained individual</title>
<p>There was no consensus regarding which health professional should present the ACP information, with 18 participants reporting that they were comfortable with receiving the information from someone other than their doctor:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t mind who talks to me as long as they know what they are talking about. (Participant AI15)</p>
<p>I don’t think it should be the doctors’ province because they have got so much else to do … it would be just a minor point in all of the other problems I have got. (Participant AO15)</p>

<title>The importance of the ACP educator</title>
<p>Twenty-three participants described the substantial impact of the ACP educator:<disp-quote>
<p>The way she delivered it was really lovely … it was really factual, and it could have been really morbid, you could have gone away thinking ‘Oh, I’ll go and slit my wrists’ … but it wasn’t like that. (Participant AO12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many individuals commented that the ACP educator had talked about her own ACP, reinforcing its applicability to all individuals irrespective of their personal state:<disp-quote>
<p>(The ACP facilitator) said she has got one (advance care plan), so I don’t think it is a function of age or illness, it is just being prepared. (Participant AI13)</p>

<sec id="section22-0269216313478448">
<title>Attendance at the ACP information session led to discussion and action</title>
<p>Twenty-four participants who attended an ACP information session discussed being prompted to think about their personal decision-making and initiate discussion with family members:<disp-quote>
<p>It actually made me stop, listen, go home and talk to my sister about it. (Participant AO10)</p>
<p>And it is funny, but I was able to talk to my eldest daughter … where I would not have been able to talk about it to her before. (Participant AO21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants reported that family members subsequently completed ACPs:<disp-quote>
<p>I brought my son, just because it said to bring someone and he was so excited he said that he was going to go home and do it himself. (Participant AI09)</p>

<title>Impact of cultural and personal factors on ACP</title>
<p>Three participants expressed reservations about the session; however, all felt that other people did benefit from hearing the information. Religious and cultural beliefs, together with personal experiences of loss, were cited as influencing factors:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt some of the other participants got helpful results, but because of my own nature and my own beliefs, for me, it was not helpful. (Participant AO18)</p>
<p>Well, you know, not everyone is the same. In fact, there were people there that really enjoyed that talk. And probably they don’t look at death the same as me … everyone handles death in a different way. (Participant AI16)</p>

<title>Themes for non-attendees</title>
<p>Most participants who did not attend the ACP session reported that they did not choose to miss it but had competing commitments or got the wrong day:<disp-quote>
<p>It was just that I was stupid and mixed up the days … I had every intention of being there. (Participant DI09)</p>
<p>I was at an appointment down on level 2, at clinic. (Participant D06)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others had relevant experience in the past:<disp-quote>
<p>Well, it wouldn’t be relevant to me because we have everything in place … we organised it many years ago. (Participant DI08)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>People who did not attend the session still considered its inclusion to be appropriate:<disp-quote>
<p>I think that if people haven’t thought about it, they should think about it because it (the disease) can escalate and get bad very quickly. (Participant D05)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the perspectives of participants in PR&amp;M programmes on the acceptability of the integration of a group ACP information session. Overwhelmingly, participants who attended the session valued the information provided and were happy for presentation in a group setting, in some cases in preference to an individual session.</p>
<p>ACP is a process, of which the first step is the introduction of the topic and provision of information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216313478448">23</xref></sup> Of our participants, approximately 25% had heard about ACP before, which is similar to findings in healthy elders, where 20% reported having a prior conversation about ACP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216313478448">24</xref></sup> Our findings are consistent with work demonstrating the acceptability of introducing ACP information within pulmonary rehabilitation in a different health system and cultural context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216313478448">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216313478448">25</xref></sup> However, this work provides new, in-depth knowledge regarding patient experiences of ACP in pulmonary rehabilitation and provides information regarding the views of patients who choose not to attend the ACP sessions, a group that has not been included in previous studies. A structured and standardised programme may assist with the introduction of ACP into PR&amp;M programmes where it has not previously been provided.</p>
<p>Clinically, ACP discussions often occur when patients are unwell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216313478448">8</xref></sup> Inpatients may have limited ability to engage with these discussions, due to impaired cognition or distractions from acute interventions, affecting their ability to make critical decisions about their long-term care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216313478448">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216313478448">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216313478448"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216313478448">28</xref></sup> This was reflected in our participants’ comments. The optimal setting in which to discuss end-of-life care has been described as being ‘mentally intact and physically functional’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216313478448">29</xref></sup> during periods of stable health prior to onset of acute illness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216313478448">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216313478448">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216313478448">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216313478448">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216313478448">27</xref></sup> which was also the preference expressed by our participants.</p>
<p>It has previously been demonstrated that most patients with COPD in pulmonary rehabilitation did want to discuss ACP with their physicians, but these conversations rarely occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216313478448">25</xref></sup> Most patients wait for physicians to initiate such discussions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216313478448">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216313478448">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216313478448">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216313478448"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216313478448">32</xref></sup> and the absence of such discussion can lead patients to believe that they are not yet required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216313478448">33</xref></sup> However, physicians may have difficulty discussing prognosis in the case of uncertainty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216313478448">34</xref></sup> as is common in patients with COPD due to unpredictability of the course of this disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216313478448">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216313478448">35</xref></sup> Our results showed that patients find initiation of ACP discussions to be useful and acceptable outside the context of a doctor’s consultation, if the information is presented by an appropriately knowledgeable individual. Consistent with a previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216313478448">36</xref></sup> participants in this study described choosing to focus medical consultations on current medical and treatment issues, due to time restrictions. The ACP educators in this project undertook structured training and accreditation under the ‘Respecting Patient Choices’ programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216313478448">37</xref></sup> and therefore were equipped with the necessary information and skills to undertake these patient-centred discussions.</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier reports, most participants were eager to receive information about ACP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216313478448">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216313478448">30</xref></sup> Previous research shows that those who attended ACP information sessions had increased uptake rates of follow-up discussions, appointments and documentation compared with those who did not attend.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216313478448">38</xref></sup> In this study, the majority of participants who made a follow-up appointment did go on to complete documentation; however, this is only one of a range of desired outcomes. Completion of documentation alone does not improve medical care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216313478448">29</xref></sup> or end-of-life care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216313478448">39</xref></sup> and may not reflect the benefits of discussions regarding preferences for end-of-life care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216313478448">40</xref></sup> a theme that was clearly expressed by participants in this study. Additionally, evidence of the benefits of ACP and end-of-life discussions includes a reduction in stress, anxiety and depression in surviving relatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216313478448">18</xref></sup> Therefore, ACP should be considered as a comprehensive process, which may be particularly suitable for people with less predictable prognoses such as COPD.</p>
<p>A small number of individuals in this study did not feel comfortable with ACP discussions, as a result of personal beliefs or experiences. This is consistent with previous literature, with small proportions of people reported not wanting to participate in end-of-life discussions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216313478448">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216313478448">41</xref></sup> Participants in PR&amp;M programmes need to be provided with the opportunity to decline ACP participation without unease. The personal situations of the three ‘attendees’ who did not want any further involvement with ACP highlighted the importance of relevant past experiences, religion or other spiritual beliefs, family and other cultural influences that may necessitate provision of information in other ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216313478448">42</xref></sup> Of interest, however, was the unanimous acknowledgement that other participants in the group had benefited from hearing the information and were supportive of inclusion in the programme. Other individuals chose not to participate in ACP because they felt it was not relevant, rather than because they inherently rejected the idea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216313478448">31</xref></sup> Some attendees indicated that this was a reason to provide a facilitated information session, rather than just written details, so that the relevance of ACP could be better explained and understood.</p>
<p>A limitation to this project was that the available resources only supported English speakers taking part in the project. Therefore, our results may not reflect the range of cultural factors that may impact on discussion and decision-making around ACP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216313478448">42</xref></sup> Additionally, the influence of the metropolitan setting, socio-economic class and education levels were not investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216313478448">43</xref></sup> Our study was not designed to evaluate the effects of disease diagnosis, duration or severity on acceptability or uptake of ACP. However, in order to reflect usual clinical practice, participants with diagnoses commonly seen in pulmonary rehabilitation programmes and a range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) = 18%–130% predicted, 6-minute walk distance = 105–619 m) were included.</p>
<p>Patients attending PR&amp;M generally have moderate-to-severe lung disease and are at increased risk of life threatening cardio-respiratory events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216313478448">25</xref></sup> Enabling people with chronic lung disease to make informed choices about end-of-life care should be a high priority. ACP is advocated as a routine part of standard medical care;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216313478448">23</xref></sup> however, this is not reflected in current practice. This study has shown that patients are receptive to the integration of ACP education delivered in a group setting by a non-medical professional. Consideration should be given to broader inclusion of ACP education into existing PR&amp;M programmes for people with chronic respiratory disease.</p>
