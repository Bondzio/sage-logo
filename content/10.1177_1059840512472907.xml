<body>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>As a school nurse administrator in a medium-sized school district that is required by state mandate to conduct <italic>Acanthosis Nigricans</italic> (AN) screening in Grades 1, 3, 5, and 7, I was particularly interested the December 2012 article “Reliability and Validity of the Acanthosis Nigricans Screening Tool for Use in Elementary School-Age Children by School Nurses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512472907">Scott &amp; Hall, 2012</xref>). Conducting AN screening in the school setting can identify type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among some ethnic populations while Caucasian students at risk may be missed. Kong et al. (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512472907">Abraham &amp; Rozmus, 2012</xref>) believes that obese, Caucasian students may not be identified due to the AN marker being hard to detect. In addition, according to Kobaissi (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512472907">Abraham &amp; Rozmus, 2012</xref>), the grading of the AN marker does not have a significant usefulness as body adiposity is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity. The University of Texas-Pan American University monitors the AN screening mandate in Texas and grading of AN is not required. Grading was required in the first few years of the screening, but was changed in the last few years to AN present or not present. Based on this information, one might ask (1) why develop AN screening tool that grades AN when grading is not clinically significant?</p>
<p>Furthermore, why the mandate to screen for AN in the school setting when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly discourages AN screening of students in school due to insufficient evidence to support that having AN marker will lead to T2DM (CDC, 2011)? The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics do not recommend mass screening school age children; according to Jones and Fica (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512472907">Abraham &amp; Rozmus, 2012</xref>), they recommend screening children 10 and over with a body mass index &gt; 85th percentile, who also have significant risk factors of T2DM. Why not educate instead of screening? As reported in the <italic>Texas Risk Assessment for Type 2 Diabetes in Children: A Report for the Governor and the 82nd Legislature of the State of Texas</italic> prepared by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512472907">University of Texas-Pan American Border Health Office (2011)</xref> indicates that 1,266,456 school children were screened for the AN marker of which 71,729 students were referred for follow-up care with a medical provider. Of the students referred, 11,705 or 16% were seen for follow-up thus 84% of the students who were identified did not receive follow-up care. Why are we ignoring the evidence? As a nurse administrator, it is frustrating asking nurses spend time screening students, making referrals, following up on referrals when parents/guardians do not understand the risks of T2DM and the need to seek a medical evaluation or they don’t have access to health care. Medical referrals do not seem to be effective in combating the fight against obesity and T2DM; perhaps we should follow the CDC’s recommendation of focusing on prevention (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512472907">Abraham &amp; Rozmus, 2012</xref>) through educating students and parents about the importance of eating right and exercising to reduce the risks of developing T2DM and leading healthier lives. The National Parent Teacher’s Association (PTA) supports making healthy lifestyle choices, now is the time to partner with the PTA to introduce students and families to the a, b, c’s and 1,2,3’s of making healthier lifestyle choices.</p>
