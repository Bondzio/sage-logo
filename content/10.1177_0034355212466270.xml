<abstract>
<p>Telecommunication offers rural vocational rehabilitation (VR) clients a method of communicating with their VR counselor between face-to-face visits. Unfortunately, certain telecommunication methods may not be available to many rural VR clients or may pose barriers in the rehabilitation process. This article describes findings from an exploratory survey of 225 rural VR clients recruited from seven VR agencies across the United States. The mail-based survey explored client access to telecommunication, current telecommunication use during the VR process, and client attitudes about using telecommunication to receive VR services. Although 61% of respondents said they had personal access to a computer with Internet and 63% reported that email would be a “very” acceptable or “somewhat” acceptable method of communicating with their counselors, only 39% reported communicating via email with their counselors. Although a variety of factors play into the effectiveness of telecommunication as a VR service delivery mode, email communication might increase the frequency and productivity of VR client and counselor interactions.</p>

<p>Since the Reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, the vocational rehabilitation (VR) program has assisted people with disabilities to secure employment. To do so, VR offers a range of services, including vocational assessment, counseling, referrals, physical and mental restoration, training and education, maintenance, and postemployment services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0034355212466270">U.S. Department of Education, 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, VR agencies are facing a budgetary crisis. In 2009, for instance, 50% of VR state agencies were on order of selection, indicating the agency did not have sufficient resources to fully serve all eligible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0034355212466270">Rehabilitation Services Administration [RSA], 2011a</xref>). Within these economic constraints, VR counselors are carrying larger caseloads with smaller case service dollars per client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0034355212466270">RSA, 2011b</xref>). Rural areas are particularly susceptible to fiscal restrictions, due to travel costs associated with reaching remote areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212466270">Metzel &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One strategy for reducing rural case costs is to provide a portion of client services remotely, via telecommunication. In general, telecommunication includes asynchronous (e.g., email, Internet, fax, etc.) and synchronous (e.g., phone, cell phone, text messaging, video conferencing, etc.) communication methods that reduce barriers related to time and distance. Telecommunication could be used in place of face-to-face visits to reduce counselor travel to remote locations while also providing flexibility to receive and exchange timely information during the VR process. Research suggests that telecommunication methods are particularly advantageous for individuals who are at a distance from service centers or have difficulty traveling to reach services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212466270">Abbott, Klein, &amp; Ceichomski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212466270">Chester &amp; Glass, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212466270">Gore &amp; Leuwerke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034355212466270">Zelvin &amp; Speyer, 2004</xref>). In addition, studies report positive counseling outcomes via a variety of telecommunication methods, including phone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355212466270">Baca, Alverson, Manuel, &amp; Blackwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034355212466270">Tait, 1999</xref>), email (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355212466270">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>), and real-time video/video conferencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355212466270">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>). Several studies indicate that counseling outcomes are comparable between Internet and face-to-face approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212466270">Cook &amp; Doyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212466270">Kraus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0034355212466270">Mallen, Vogel, Rochlen, &amp; Day, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Institute on Rehabilitation Issues (IRI) study groups in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355212466270">2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355212466270">2002</xref> suggested a variety of possible uses of telecommunication in the VR process, including VR marketing for outreach efforts, online assessment tools and training to assist with client job readiness, and online information seeking related to job searches. These studies also highlighted how email could increase opportunities for counselor–client communication by providing a mechanism through which consumers and counselors could engage without having to schedule meetings or wait to share thoughts and concerns. Many of the original IRI suggestions have been realized. In a recent study of 399 VR counselors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212466270">Boeltzig (2011)</xref> reported that counselors used the Internet to share employment information (92%) and directly communicate (87%) with a percentage of their caseload. This reflects a substantial increase from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034355212466270">Patterson’s (2002)</xref> assessment of Internet applications by rehabilitation counselors (<italic>N</italic> = 1,034), in which 65% of VR counselors used email to communicate with clients.</p>
<p>Despite noted advantages, a variety of barriers to telecommunication may disproportionately affect rural individuals with disabilities. Section 254 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0034355212466270">1996</xref> Telecommunication Act calls for universal service access, including rural and high-cost areas, but rural areas still lag behind the rest of the country. For instance, of the 20 million Americans who lack access to broadband at 3 mbps/768 kbps speed or higher, approximately 73% live in rural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212466270">Federal Communication Commission, 2011</xref>). People with lower socioeconomic indicators also use the Internet at lower rates than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212466270">Fox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212466270">S. Jones &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355212466270">Lenhart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034355212466270">Zickuhr, 2012</xref>), and people living in rural areas are among the poorest in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355212466270">Jolliffe, 2005</xref>). Similarly, rural people have less access to certain technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212466270">Economics and Statistics Administration &amp; National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0034355212466270">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2005</xref>). A study conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212466270">Economics and Statistics Administration &amp; National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2011)</xref> reported that access to broadband was significantly lower for rural, low-income, minority, and individuals with disabilities, and a study sponsored by the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported that 54% of adults with disabilities had access to computers as compared with 81% of adults with no reported disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212466270">Fox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Other personal factors such as age, education, and disability type may affect telecommunication use. Data from a Pew Internet and American Life Project of 2,253 telephone interviews indicate that older adults (&lt;50) own less technology, use less Internet, and access a narrower range of applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034355212466270">Zickuhr, 2012</xref>). This same trend holds for education, where people with a high school education or less own fewer devices, use less Internet, and have lower rates of home broadband service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034355212466270">Zickuhr, 2012</xref>). Disability also appears to be a factor. For instance, VR counselors (<italic>n</italic> = 1,187) reported more use of and acceptability with email communication with clients who have visual, hearing, or physical impairments as compared with individuals with cognitive or mental health disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen, Rigles, Arnold, &amp; Seekins, 2012</xref>). Telecommunication methods also present barriers for people with limited writing, understanding, or communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034355212466270">Oravec, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034355212466270">Stofle &amp; Chechele, 2004</xref>). All of these factors may make it difficult for rural VR clients to access and use technology effectively.</p>
<p>This is consistent with data from a study of 1,187 VR counselors, who estimated that urban clients had significantly more access to computers with Internet access (65% vs. 46%), were more familiar with using the Internet to find information (61% vs. 48%), and had more established email accounts (64% vs. 52%) than rural clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). Although several studies address access issues, they do not inform the issue of VR telecommunication use from the client perspective, nor do they provide guidance to VR about how best to configure service delivery in rural communities where broadband speeds are slower.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore rural client access to, use of, and attitudes toward telecommunication as a vehicle for receiving VR services. The following research questions and hypotheses guided this investigation:</p>

<sec id="section2-0034355212466270">
<title>Survey Development</title>
<p>We developed a client survey by adapting a counselor questionnaire that explored the current use and feasibility of using telecommunication methods to provide VR services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). The intent was to parallel the counselor survey for areas applicable to VR clients. The client survey was reviewed by a panel of rehabilitation and research professionals with representatives from Workforce Development, VR, higher education, independent living, and the Research and Training Center on Measurement and Community Participation. The draft survey was tested using cognitive interviews with six VR clients from four states. During the cognitive interviews, respondents verbally explained the thought processes that went into answering survey questions so that researchers could assess clarity of question wording, ease of format, and whether questions resulted in useful and expected information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355212466270">Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009</xref>). The University Institutional Review Board approved the procedures for the project and the content of the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0034355212466270">
<title>Agency and Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>We recruited seven VR agencies from states with large rural populations to participate in the project. Participating agencies included Alaska, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska (Blind Agency), Kansas, and Arkansas (Blind Agency). Data managers from participating agencies selected all clients who (a) were currently enrolled in VR services, (b) had developed an Individualized Plan of Employment (IPE), (c) were 18 years of age or older, and (d) resided in a county with rural–urban continuum codes (RUCC) of 6, 7, 8, or 9. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0034355212466270">United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (2003)</xref> defined RUCC 6 as an urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area; RUCC 7 as an urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area; RUCC 8 as completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area; and RUCC 9 as completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area.</p>
<p>An a priori power analysis indicated that we needed approximately 130 participants in each of two comparison groups to have 80% power for detecting small- to medium-sized effects at α = .05. To get close to our desired sample size, we conducted two rounds of recruitment. During the first round, surveys were mailed from each agency to 50 randomly selected participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355212466270">Dillman’s (2000)</xref> procedures, survey packets included a cover letter describing the research, a copy of the survey, a preaddressed stamped return envelope, and five dollars. Survey reminder postcards were mailed from the VR agency to each selected participant 1 week after the survey was mailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355212466270">Dillman, 2000</xref>). Of the 350 packets distributed, 11 were returned to the VR office as undeliverable. A total of 146 surveys were returned to our research unit, representing a 43% response rate (146/339).</p>
<p>We initiated a second round of recruitment to increase total responses. In total, 50 additional packets were mailed to clients in Louisiana, Alabama, Colorado, and Kansas, and 25 additional packets were mailed to clients in Nebraska (Blind Agency). Nebraska (Blind Agency) mailed fewer packets, and Arkansas (Blind Agency) did not mail any additional packets, due to low numbers of clients who met the inclusion criteria. Alaska inadvertently mailed the second round of surveys to the same 50 clients who were randomly selected for the first round. Eight unduplicated surveys from Alaska (out of 16 returned) were included in the analysis, but were not counted in the response rate of the second round.</p>
<p>In the second round, rather than provide small (US$5) stipends with the survey packets, we used a contingency strategy where respondents were paid a larger stipend (US$15) for each survey that was returned. The contingency strategy resulted in a lower response rate. Of the 225 survey packets distributed, 8 were returned as undeliverable. Seventy-one clients responded, representing a 33% response rate (71/217). The combined response rate for the two rounds of recruitment was 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 225/556), which included the eight Alaska respondents who were recruited twice.</p>
<p>We utilized a mail-based survey so that both technology users and nonusers would provide feedback. Participants also had the option of requesting alternative formats, including large print, completing a telephone-based survey, or accessing an accessible online survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0034355212466270">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Respondents (<italic>N</italic> = 225) were almost evenly split between males (49%) and females (51%). They were Caucasian (76%), African American (14%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (7%), and Hispanic (3%). Respondent ages ranged from less than 30 years (39%), 30 to 39 (12%), 40 to 49 (20%), 50 to 59 (20%), and 60+ (10%). Eleven percent of respondents had less than a high school education, 35% had a high school diploma or general educational development (GED), 42% had completed some college, and 12% had a college degree or advanced degree.</p>
<p>Respondents described their disability. These descriptions were coded as visual impairments (31%), hearing impairments (10%), physical impairments (43%), cognitive impairments (26%), and mental impairments (12%). Percentages add to more than 100 because approximately 20% of respondents described themselves as having more than one disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0034355212466270">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The 36-question survey assessed demographics; client access to telecommunication; client skills, preferences, and situations that may impede or facilitate telecommunication use; current use and acceptability of using telecommunication during the VR process; and client experiences using technology.</p>
<sec id="section6-0034355212466270">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Clients provided background about their age, gender, race, education, and disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0034355212466270">
<title>Client access to telecommunication</title>
<p>Clients used check boxes to indicate which telecommunication methods they had personal access to, including telephone (landline), cell phone, text messaging, computer with Internet, email, and webcam. Clients also indicated general experience using telecommunication methods by answering four yes or no questions, including the following: (a) I access a computer with Internet on a regular basis, (b) I use the Internet to find information, (c) I know how to use email, and (d) I can access free- or low-cost training in my community on how to use the Internet and email.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0034355212466270">
<title>Telecommunication use</title>
<p>We assessed current use patterns and acceptability of using telecommunication during the VR process. Using check boxes, clients first indicated which telecommunication methods they had used with their counselor at any time during the VR process, including talking on the phone/cell phone, texting, email, and video conferencing (i.e., via Skype) or none. Clients also provided an acceptability rating for each method on a 3-point scale, including very acceptable, acceptable, and not acceptable. They could also elect don’t know.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0034355212466270">
<title>Client barriers and facilitators</title>
<p>Client barriers and facilitators focused on individual skills, preferences, and situations that might predict VR telecommunication use. Clients rated their ability to effectively communicate in writing—a needed skill for effective email communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034355212466270">Stofle &amp; Chechele, 2004</xref>)—on a 4-point scale ranging from rarely, sometimes, often, to almost always. They also indicated how they preferred to receive VR counselor instructions by selecting in writing, by talking, or don’t know. Check boxes were used to assess confidentiality concerns for each telecommunication method.</p>
<p>Clients rated potential barriers to face-to-face communication by indicating whether transportation issues made it hard to attend in-person meetings with their counselors, and how many travel miles were required to meet their VR counselor in-person. Clients also indicated whether they felt it was fair to provide VR services using different methods for rural and urban clients to accommodate distance from the VR office and which telecommunication methods they were concerned about using to relay private information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0034355212466270">
<title>Client experiences using technology</title>
<p>Clients provided information about their experiences using technology. Three questions asked clients whether they had experienced any technical difficulties using phone, email, or video conferencing (i.e., Skype) when receiving VR services. Clients also responded to open-ended questions about how using telecommunication had been positive during the VR process and about problems or difficulties they had experienced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0034355212466270">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>In addition to descriptive statistics, we explored study hypotheses with chi-square, independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests, and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum and Spearman’s rho nonparametrics. All group comparisons were evaluated at an alpha level of .01 to help control for the overall Type 1 error rates introduced by multiple group comparisons. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 19.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212466270">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Open-ended responses were analyzed by question. Each written response for a specific question was coded into a main theme. Main themes were generally broad categories and encompassed the main points of individual responses. Within each main theme, responses received a subcode to group similar comments or ideas. Subcodes often emerged based on access issues, type of technology, and disability type. A count within each main theme and subgroup allowed us to quantitatively estimate the strength of response.</p>

<title>Use and Acceptability of Email</title>
<p>The majority of clients (91%) reported using phones or cell phones to communicate with counselors during the VR process. Fewer clients (39%) reported communication via email, and only a small percentage reported using text messaging (3%) or video conferencing (1%) for client–counselor communication.

<title>Demographic Factors</title>
<p>We hypothesized that client characteristics, including age, education level, and disability type would affect email use and acceptability of use in the VR process. We used chi-square tests to evaluate grouped age, education, and disability data by email use and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests to test hypotheses about email acceptability.</p>
<sec id="section16-0034355212466270">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Younger clients (&lt;50) as compared with older clients (≥50) reported higher rates of email use with their counselors (41% vs. 31%), but these differences were not statistically significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 216) = 1.979, <italic>p</italic> = .171.

<sec id="section18-0034355212466270">
<title>Disability</title>
<p>Because clients could endorse more than one disability type, we compared email use among clients from one disability group compared with all others using chi-square tests. There were no significant differences regarding email use for individuals with reported physical, mental health, or hearing impairments, as compared with other disability groups. Clients with cognitive disability reported less email use than clients reporting other disabilities (25% vs. 44%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 204) = 5.695, <italic>p</italic> = .021, and clients with visual impairments reported higher rates of email communication than clients reporting other disabilities (52% vs. 34%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 203) = 5.743, <italic>p</italic> = .020.</p>

<title>Personal Factors</title>
<p>Aside from client demographics, other personal factors may influence the use of telecommunications to receive services. For instance, client opinions may be shaped by ability and desire to communicate in writing and rural clients without transportation may recognize a need for alternate communication methods.</p>
<sec id="section20-0034355212466270">
<title>Communication preferences and ability</title>
<p>The majority of clients (57%) indicated that they preferred getting counselor instructions “by talking,” whereas only 21% preferred getting instructions “in writing.” Thirteen percent indicated a combination of both methods was preferable and 9% were unsure. Clients also indicated that they could effectively communicate information in writing “almost always” (42%), “often” (16%), “sometimes” (23%), and “rarely” (18%).</p>
<p>We used Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests to explore email use as a function of clients’ self-reported ability to communicate the information they need in writing based on a 4-point scale ranging from “rarely” to “almost always.” Writing ability for clients who reported using email with their counselors (median = 3.0) was significantly higher than for clients who did not use email in the counseling process (median = 2.0) <italic>W</italic><sub>s</sub> = 3,913, <italic>z</italic> = −2.83, <italic>p</italic> = .005.</p>
<p>We used Spearman’s rho to explore the correlation between email acceptability ratings (not acceptable, somewhat acceptable, and very acceptable) and client ability to communicate the information they need in writing, on a scale from 1 = <italic>rarely</italic> to 4 = <italic>almost always</italic>. The relationship was significant and positive, <italic>rs</italic>(172) = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0034355212466270">
<title>Transportation</title>
<p>Thirty-seven percent of respondents said that they have trouble attending in-person meetings with their VR counselors due to transportation issues. In addition, 61% indicated they were served through an itinerant counseling relationship, where the counselor traveled to a nearby town to deliver face-to-face services. Clients indicated that they traveled a median distance of 20 round trip miles (mean distance of 50 round trip miles) to attend in-person meetings with their counselors either at the VR office or at an itinerant office location. Clients were also asked whether it was fair to provide VR services using alternate communication methods (i.e., phone, email, etc.) for rural and urban clients to accommodate distance from the VR office. Overall, 64% of clients felt that different service delivery mechanisms were fair, 7% said they were not fair, and 29% were not sure how they felt on this issue.</p>
<p>We analyzed email communication based on transportation barriers. First, we used chi-square to compare clients who reported transportation barriers with those who did not. Rates were not significantly different between these two groups χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 209) = 0.533, <italic>p</italic> = .555. Second, we used independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests to compare mean travel distances based on email use in the counseling process. Clients who reported using email were further from face-to-face meeting locations than clients who did not report using email, <italic>M</italic> = 34.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 50.87 versus <italic>M</italic> = 19.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 26.29, <italic>t</italic>(188) = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> = .018. There were no statistical differences in acceptability ratings based on transportation barriers.</p>

<title>Client Experiences</title>
<p>Few clients reported technical difficulties when using telecommunications to communicate with counselors. Eleven percent of clients said they experienced problems using the phone and 8% said they experienced problems using email.</p>
<sec id="section23-0034355212466270">
<title>Positive experiences</title>
<p>Clients were asked to share positive experiences they had using telecommunications to communicate with their counselors and 107 (48% of the total) responded. Thirty-five clients (33% of qualitative responses) said that they enjoyed communicating via email because counselors responded more quickly to email messages than phone messages, it was a quick way to communicate between in-person meetings, and it was efficient and convenient. In addition, five of these clients preferred email communication because it provided documentation they could refer back to for clarification. In all, 33 clients (31% of qualitative responses) said that using the phone had been helpful during the VR process for making appointments, checking in with their counselor between meetings, and because it cut down on clients’ travel time and expenses; 22 clients (21% of qualitative responses) said that telecommunications in general have been helpful for a variety of reasons. Of these, five clients liked that VR provided them with technology or assistive technology. Others said the use of technology reduced transportation barriers (<italic>n</italic> = 3), saved time and money (<italic>n</italic> = 3), increased the amount of contact they had with their counselors (<italic>n</italic> = 3), provided more options for communicating with their counselors (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and was helpful for performing job searches (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>

<sec id="section24-0034355212466270">
<title>Negative experiences</title>
<p>Fifty-six clients (25% of the total) described negative experiences using technology to communicate with their counselors. About a third of these (<italic>n</italic> = 18, 32% of qualitative responses) said their biggest problem was not with the technology, but with their counselor. These respondents noted that their counselors did not return calls and emails, or were unavailable the majority of the time. Thirteen clients (23% of qualitative responses) said they did not have access to the necessary technology or assistive technology. Eleven others (20% of qualitative responses) said they had experienced technical difficulties such as dropped calls, lost messages, computer crashes, and poor phone and Internet connections. Six clients (11% of qualitative responses) said using telecommunications was difficult because it created communication problems. Problems included clients’ lack of understanding of written instructions, lack of one-on-one personal interactions, and lack of disability-related accommodations (e.g., clients who are blind could not read emails and texts, clients who are deaf preferred to communicate in American Sign Language [ASL], etc.).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VR counselors report barriers to serving rural clients due to associated travel costs and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212466270">Metzel &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>). As such, it is not surprising to learn that counselors report less contact with rural versus urban clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, rural people with disabilities report that lack of transportation is one of their most significant barriers to participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212466270">Gonzales, Stombaugh, Seekins, &amp; Kasnitz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>From the study sample, 27% of clients reported they had trouble attending in-person meetings with their counselors due to transportation issues.</p>
<p>One solution to addressing counselor and client transportation issues is to provide VR services via telecommunication methods. This study investigated access to, use of, and attitudes toward telecommunication from the VR client perspective so that methods might be tailored to meet rural client needs. Several telecommunication methods were explored but some approaches such as texting and video conferencing were rarely utilized. For this reason, the discussion focuses on client experiences with email.</p>
<sec id="section26-0034355212466270">
<title>Enhanced Communication Opportunities</title>
<p>From the survey, we learned that only 39% of clients used email to communicate with their counselors, but 63% felt that this method was “very acceptable” or “somewhat acceptable.” In addition, the majority of clients (64%) in this study felt that it was fair to provide VR services differently to rural and urban clients, and specifically to use more alternate communication methods such as phone and email to increase contact. Based on these findings, email use might be expanded to increase communication opportunities between counselors and rural clients during the VR process.</p>
<p>Expanding email use may be particularly important for rural clients who typically receive fewer services than urban clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212466270">Johnstone et al., 2003</xref>) and have less frequent contact with their counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, as text-based email requires less bandwidth than alternate communication methods such as video conferencing, it may be the most appropriate rural approach in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0034355212466270">National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, itinerant counselors visit rural locations on a rotating basis. Unfortunately, this model does not guarantee that service delivery coincides with needed assistance. One advantage of email communication is that it provides flexibility in the counseling process by eliminating the need to set up and attend face-to-face appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212466270">Chester &amp; Glass, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034355212466270">Mulhauser, 2011</xref>). It also gives counselors and clients the ability to describe and respond to problems and questions as they arise, rather than waiting for appointments.</p>
<p>A large qualitative study (<italic>N</italic> = 1,346) conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212466270">Hein, Lustig, and Uruk (2005)</xref> indicated that more frequent client/counselor communication improved client employment outcomes. Because email communication has the potential to increase the number of contacts between the counselor and client, its use may translate into enhanced vocational outcomes for rural clients.</p>
<p>Increased opportunities for client–counselor interactions may also increase working alliance, a predictor of employment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212466270">Donnell, Lustig, &amp; Strauser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355212466270">Lustig, Strauser, Rice, &amp; Rucker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034355212466270">Lustig, Strauser, &amp; Weems, 2004</xref>). Working alliance is described in terms of shared goals, tasks, and bonds. The alliance grows stronger when counseling goals are mutually shared, tasks are defined and relevant to shared goals, and bonds between the counselor and client are well developed through shared activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355212466270">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>). One strategy for building this alliance is to increase opportunities for client–counselor interactions, whereby clients and counselors become more engaged in the rehabilitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212466270">Hein et al., 2005</xref>). Although face-to-face methods are generally considered best practice, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212466270">Cook and Doyle (2002)</xref> found that Working Alliance Inventory scores were similar for individuals who received Internet versus face-to-face therapy.</p>

<title>Access to Telecommunications</title>
<p>Despite the advantages, email use and acceptability depends on a variety of factors. At the most basic level, clients must have access to technology along with infrastructure that enhances use. The literature we reviewed cited several access barriers to telecommunication, including people with lower socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212466270">Fox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212466270">S. Jones &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>), particularly in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212466270">Federal Communications Commission, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0034355212466270">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2005</xref>). A recent Pew Internet and American Life Project reported that only 54% of adults with disabilities had access to computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212466270">Fox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Access rates for our sample were much higher, where 61% of respondents owned a computer with Internet and 69% reported they could easily access a computer with Internet in their community. In addition, very few clients reported technical difficulties when communicating with their counselors, which may indicate that rural infrastructure can adequately support phone and email communication. Although the sample was probably overrepresented by technology users, access rates were higher than expected for rural constituents. Despite the access barriers described, there are trends that broadband is expanding to even the most rural communities and consumer subscription rates continue to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212466270">Federal Communications Commission, 2011</xref>). Access issues in the short run may become nonissues in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0034355212466270">
<title>Demographic and Personal Factors</title>
<p>Other determinants of effective telecommunication relate to personal factors. Age did not appear to be a factor in our sample, but our hypotheses that use and acceptability of use would be influenced by client education, disability type, and ability to communicate in writing were supported. For instance, clients with cognitive disability were less likely to use or want to use email. In a study of VR counselors (<italic>N</italic> = 1,187), 37% of counselors indicated that email would be difficult for their clients with cognitive impairments due to limited reading and writing skills, limited understanding of written communication, limited access to computers, and trouble operating telecommunication equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). These considerations seemed to be supported from the clients’ own perspective.</p>
<p>Based on recommendations from the Internet counseling literature, we also hypothesized that individuals with mental health disability would use email less than other disability groups. Several studies suggest that counseling over the Internet is not appropriate for individuals with substance abuse issues, personality disorders, delusions, or hallucinations, severe depression or suicidal thoughts, who are in abusive situations, or who have thoughts of hurting themselves or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212466270">Australian Psychological Society, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212466270">Kraus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034355212466270">Mallen, Vogel, &amp; Rochlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034355212466270">Suler, 2001</xref>). Although a percentage of VR clients may have mental health issues that include these characteristics, our data did not support different use rates among individuals who had mental health disabilities.</p>
<p>In general, client factors should be considered when developing a telecommunication relationship. This could be achieved with a simple checklist during the VR intake process that assesses client access to technology and preferences about using technology to increase client/counselor engagement. This might also present an opportunity for the counselor and client to discuss situations when online communication may not be an appropriate strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0034355212466270">
<title>Quality</title>
<p>Although most clients seem open to receiving VR services via telecommunication methods, the quality of those services must be retained. Some clients described negative experiences using telecommunication with their counselors due to counselor unresponsiveness. For instance, clients described situations where their counselors did not return phone or email messages or were unavailable most of the time. In addition, counselors need to consider the ethical standards for distance counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355212466270">Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification [CRCC], 2010</xref>) and their own internal agency policies regarding different telecommunication applications.</p>
<p>VR training to effectively deliver services using alternate methods may be necessary to maintain quality. Training components might include strategies for ensuring client confidentiality such as file encryption and increased security settings, approaches for structuring an email relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212466270">Abbott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212466270">Bradley, Hendricks, Lock, Whiting, &amp; Parr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212466270">G.

Second, small sample size coupled with low response rates may have biased results. One likely source of bias was overrepresentation by telecommunication users, resulting in an overly optimistic picture about telecommunication saturation in rural communities.</p>
<p>In addition, there is evidence that the sample was over- and underrepresented by certain disability groups. As compared with RSA 911 data records, our sample was overrepresented by individuals with visual impairments (31% vs. 1%) and physical impairments (43% vs. 27%), and underrepresented by individuals with mental health impairments (12% vs. 33%) and cognitive impairments (12% vs. 25%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034355212466270">RSA, 2009</xref>). These differences may have biased telecommunication use and acceptability among clients because underrepresented groups have been characterized as being harder to serve using telecommunication methods in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212466270">Ipsen et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies will likely build on the exploratory findings presented to provide a more complete picture of VR client telecommunication use.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Constrained VR budgets, large caseloads, and rising fuel costs create barriers for in-person service delivery in rural communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212466270">Metzel &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212466270">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>). Expansion of telecommunication methods provides a strategy for overcoming these barriers by providing additional opportunities for counselor and client contact at little cost and staff time to the agency. Many clients already use and rely on some simple telecommunication methods to communicate with their counselors, but several strategies are underutilized from the client perspective.</p>
<p>Email, in particular, has huge application in the VR counseling process. Because email is asynchronous, it allows both clients and counselors to engage with one another without having to arrange meeting times or use intermediaries to schedule appointments. It also provides a written record of communications to refer back on and is widely available via computer and cell phone service. The utility of telecommunication methods, however, depends on the development of a humanized online relationship that contributes to the client–counselor relationship. In part, this starts with an acknowledgment that the use of telecommunication is not a one-size-fits-all method. Client access, preferences, skills, and abilities all play a role in pursuing telecommunication use in the counseling process. Counselors, too, need to assess their own abilities to communicate empathetically, clearly, and professionally using remote means.</p>
