<abstract>
<p>Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey–Birth cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 6,450), the present study hypothesized that 48-month-old children of divorced mothers would score lower on emerging literacy than the children of formerly cohabiting mothers, compared with the children of mothers in stable marriage. The children of mothers who divorced or exited cohabitation but then remained single did not have significantly lower literacy than children of mothers in stable marriage. The children of divorced parents who then cohabited with another man fared significantly more poorly on literacy tests than children of continuously married parents. The children in the divorce → cohabitation group also had significantly lower literacy than the children in the divorce → noncohabitation and cohabitation → noncohabitation groups. Mothers in consistent cohabiting relationships were also more likely than mothers in stable marriage to have children with low literacy. The association between stable cohabitation and child literacy was mediated by change in socioeconomic status.</p>

<p>The research literature has shown that divorce has negative effects on many children. Few research studies have examined whether children are also adversely affected when their cohabiting biological parents separate from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192513X12445164">Wu, Hou, &amp; Schimmele, 2008</xref>). The question of how cohabitation dissolution affects children is significant given the large number of children who are currently born into cohabiting parental unions and the high rate of separations among these couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12445164">Cherlin, 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X12445164">Osborne, Manning, and Smock (2007)</xref> found that cohabitors were 5 times more likely to separate from each other 3 years following the birth of their child than were married couples.</p>
<p>I am aware of only one study that has examined the effects of cohabitation dissolution on children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0192513X12445164">Wu et al., 2008</xref>), and this study was conducted with 10- to 15-year-old children. Moreover, this study focused on the effects of cohabitation dissolution on children’s emotional behavior, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. The present study examined the effects of both cohabitation dissolution and divorce (compared with marriage) on preschool-age children’s emerging literacy skills. Younger children’s academic skills (i.e., literacy) may be particularly sensitive to family disruptions resulting from either cohabitation dissolution or divorce. Younger children rely heavily on parents’ nurturance and intellectual and language stimulation for the development of emerging literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12445164">Crosnoe, Leventhal, Wirth, Pierce, &amp; Pianta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12445164">Hsin, 2009</xref>), and these may be negatively affected when parents terminate cohabiting or marital relationships. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey–Birth (ECLS-B), I selected a sample of biological parents who were either married or cohabiting with each other when the child was 24 months old. I examined the effects of cohabitation dissolution and divorce compared with the effects of consistent marriage on 48-month-old children. I focused on emerging literacy because early literacy skills have been shown to be consistently strong predictors of later literacy abilities and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X12445164">Pearson &amp; Hiebert, 2010</xref>). I also examined four mediators of the association between relationship dissolution and child outcome: change in household income, change in depressive symptoms, change in maternal stimulation of child learning, and mothers’ pregnancy timing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X12445164">
<title>Background</title>
<p>A substantial body of research has shown that divorce during the early childhood years has a negative effect on children, including children’s behavioral adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X12445164">Pett, Wampold, Turner, &amp; Vaughan-Cole, 1999</xref>); child–mother attachment security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X12445164">Nair &amp; Murray, 2005</xref>); parent-reported academic difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12445164">Allison &amp; Furstenberg, 1989</xref>); and emotional well-being, self-esteem, and sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X12445164">Peretti &amp; Di Vitorrio, 1993</xref>). Although many studies find negative effects of divorce on young children, researchers have also reported that divorce does not have a negative effect on all children and the negative effects are often modest in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12445164">Hetherington &amp; Kelly, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X12445164">Kunz (1992)</xref> concluded from her review of 347 empirical studies that divorce has a stronger negative effect on younger children than on older children, although not all studies conducted after 1992 have found this to be the case. For example, divorce has been found to have a small positive effect on preschoolers’ interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12445164">Kunz, 2001</xref>). Very few studies have been conducted on the effects of parental divorce on preschool-age children’s school readiness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12445164">Amato’s (2001)</xref> most recent meta-analysis found that the negative effect of divorce was stronger for academic achievement of children in primary school compared with children in secondary school. These findings seem to suggest that divorce would also have a negative effect on preschool-age children’s emerging literacy. Moreover, studies have shown that other stressors in the family such as parental depressive symptoms and parents’ poor health have negative effects on children’s emerging literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12445164">Fagan, 2011</xref>), further supporting the idea that divorce may have a negative effect on preschoolers’ literacy.</p>
<p>In the present study, I suggest that divorce will have a greater negative effect on children’s literacy than will cohabitation dissolution (compared with parents who are married) because divorce is more stressful than the breakup of cohabiting relationships. I build on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12445164">Abidin (1992)</xref> who suggests that the parent–child system can be affected by multiple stresses associated with characteristics of the child, parent, and the family’s demographic situation. Abidin and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12445164">Conger, Wallace, Sun, Simons, McLoyd, &amp; Brody, 2002</xref>) suggest that stresses in the family, such as divorce, can affect the quantity and quality of parenting behavior, parents’ well-being, and the emotional climate of the family. Furthermore, stress that has a negative influence on the parent–child system may be especially detrimental to the child’s emotional and behavioral development during the early childhood years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12445164">Abidin, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Although I am not aware of specific studies suggesting that divorce is more stressful than cohabitation dissolution, I believe that there are a number of reasons to suggest this may be the case. Researchers have found that cohabitors have more liberal attitudes about relationship breakup than do married individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12445164">Axinn &amp; Thornton, 1992</xref>). Parents’ liberal attitudes about relationship dissolution may enable them to adjust more easily when the coresidential relationship terminates. Married individuals also have more contact and stronger ties with extended family members than do cohabiting individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X12445164">Eggebeen, 2005</xref>). Family members and friends may encourage married parents to work out their problems before considering separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X12445164">Nock, 1995</xref>). Even if some family members and friends are supportive of the parents’ decision to divorce, there are likely to be other individuals in one’s network who would like the couple to stay married and work out their problems. The decision to get divorced therefore may involve parents having to confront others’ disappointment at the dissolution of the marriage. These interactions with family and friends may be stressful for the divorcing parents. There is also evidence that married individuals function as shared economic entities (e.g., shared bank accounts and home ownership) to a greater extent than cohabiting couples who tend to function more independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192513X12445164">Wilk, Bernhardt, &amp; Noack, 2009</xref>). It may be more stressful on parents when these shared entities must be reconciled because of divorce. In addition, parents may perceive divorce as a greater personal failure than exiting a cohabiting relationship because of the greater emotional investment associated with marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X12445164">Nock, 1995</xref>). There is considerable evidence that many parents experience increased levels of depression when they are undergoing divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X12445164">Lansford, 2009</xref>). Their depression may be a manifestation of feelings of personal failure at not being able to make the marriage work. Together, these findings would seem to suggest that divorce is more stressful than cohabitation dissolution and, therefore, may have a greater negative effect on children’s emerging literacy than does cohabitation dissolution.</p>
<p>It has become increasingly clear that the trajectories of divorced and cohabiting mothers are not all the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X12445164">Koerner, Rankin, Kenyon, &amp; Korn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X12445164">Raley &amp; Wildsmith, 2004</xref>). Divorced and previously cohabiting mothers may remain single (dating or not dating), they may remarry or marry, or they may enter new cohabiting relationships. Mothers who marry or who enter new cohabiting relationships shortly following the divorce or cohabitation breakup may increase the resources (e.g., financial) available to the child, but at the same time they may expose the child to new stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X12445164">Cavanagh &amp; Huston, 2008</xref>). Studies show that several family transitions over a short period of time may be detrimental to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12445164">Fomby &amp; Cherlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12445164">Hill, Yeung, &amp; Duncan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X12445164">Raley &amp; Wildsmith, 2004</xref>) because they can lead to disruptions in routines in the child’s environment, lower levels of maternal availability to the child, and lower psychological functioning in mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X12445164">Osborne &amp; McLanahan, 2007</xref>). Thus, in the present study I examined the effects on children of mothers who divorced or exited cohabiting relationships but then either remained single, started to cohabit with a new partner, or married a new partner. Studies have shown that older children of divorced mothers who then remain single have more negative academic outcomes than older children of continuously married mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12445164">Hill et al., 2001</xref>). Based on these findings and the literature suggesting that divorce may be more stressful than cohabitation dissolution, I hypothesized that, compared with children with continuously married parents, the children of divorced mothers who remained single will have lower literacy scores than the children of cohabiting parents who remained single. The growing body of research on outcomes for children who experience multiple family structure transition also seems to justify the following hypothesis: The children of divorced and previously cohabiting mothers who either remarried or started new cohabiting relationships within a short period of time would have significantly lower literacy scores than the children of continuously married couples as well as the children of divorced and formerly cohabiting mothers who remained single.</p>
<sec id="section2-0192513X12445164">
<title>Mediators</title>
<p>I have already alluded to several possible mediators of the association between divorce and child outcomes. These mediators are examined in relation to the associations between child emerging literacy and each of the marital status/cohabitation groups, including mothers who divorce and then remain single, divorce and then remarry or cohabit, cohabit and then remain single, and cohabit and then marry or cohabit with a new partner. The literature on divorce has suggested that ending a marriage can have a crisis effect on parents, leading to a reduction in parents’ well-being and an increase in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X12445164">Kalmijn &amp; Monden, 2006</xref>). Although I expected cohabitation dissolution to be less stressful than divorce, the transition from cohabiting with the child’s father to being single may still be challenging for the mother and lead to increased depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X12445164">Klausli &amp; Owen, 2009</xref>). The literature on depression in parents found that preschoolers tend to have lower self-esteem and tend to do more poorly in school when their parents are depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X12445164">Sinclair &amp; Murray, 1998</xref>). Based on the literature, the present study hypothesized that an increase in depressive symptoms would explain the associations between divorce and cohabitation dissolution and child literacy.</p>
<p>Of the various resources that may be altered when parents divorce or end cohabiting relationships, research shows that parents are far less likely to experience financial well-being when they are single. U.S. Census Bureau data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12445164">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>) revealed that 8.8% of married couple families with children younger than 18 years were poor compared with 37.2% of female householders with no husband present in 2010. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12445164">Avellar and Smock (2005)</xref> found that transitioning from a two-parent, cohabiting family to a single-mother family was associated with greater odds of poverty entry. Growing up in poverty has been associated with a wide array of negative child outcomes from birth to adulthood, including behavior problems, low academic achievement, poor health, and teenage pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12445164">Ayoub et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12445164">Burchinal, Vernon-Feagans, &amp; Cox, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X12445164">Runions &amp; Keating, 2007</xref>). The literature leads me to hypothesize that a decline in mothers’ socioeconomic status (SES) will mediate the relationships between divorce and cohabitation dissolution and child literacy.</p>
<p>Divorced and previously cohabiting mothers are likely to spend less time with their children because there is only one person to fulfill the breadwinner and caregiving roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12445164">Gibson-Davis, 2008</xref>). Research evidence supports the hypothesis that solo mothers spend less time with their children than either married or cohabiting mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X12445164">Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001</xref>), although family structure variation in mother involvement with children is modest compared with father involvement with children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12445164">Brown, 2010</xref>). Given the significance of parental attention and time for positive child development, the present study examined change in quantity of mother interaction with children as a mediator of the relationship between divorce and cohabitation dissolution and child literacy. I hypothesized that change in mothers’ cognitive stimulation will mediate the relationships between divorce and cohabitation dissolution and child literacy.</p>
<p>I also examined mothers’ pregnancy intentions as a mediator. Qualitative studies have shown that many cohabiting women who became pregnant did not intend to conceive a child or hoped to defer parenthood until a later time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X12445164">Sassler, Miller, &amp; Favinger, 2009</xref>). There is also evidence that children do not fare as well when their parents feel that the timing of having a child is too soon. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12445164">Bronte-Tinkew, Scott, and Horowitz (2009)</xref> found that 2-year-olds scored lower on mental proficiency when mothers did not intend for the pregnancy to occur. Based on these findings, I hypothesized that poor pregnancy timing (i.e., having a child sooner than hoped for) will mediate the association between divorce and cohabitation dissolution and child literacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0192513X12445164">
<title>Research Goals</title>
<p>In summary, the present study hypothesized that, compared with children in stable marriage, children of divorced mothers who remain single will have lower emerging literacy scores than children of previously cohabiting mothers who remain single. I also hypothesized that the children of divorced and cohabiting parents who remarried or started new cohabiting relationships would have significantly lower literacy scores than the children of continuously married parents and the children of divorced and formerly cohabiting relationships who remained single. The following four mediators were explored: increase in mothers’ depressive symptoms, decline in household SES, decrease in mothers’ cognitive stimulation, and pregnancy timing. It is noteworthy that mothers who cohabited with the child’s father at 24 months may have continued to cohabit with the same partner at 48 months (i.e., stable cohabitation). The literacy scores of children living with stably cohabiting parents were also examined in this study.</p>
<p>Selection factors are an important consideration in studies examining the effects of family structure on children. I addressed selection factors by controlling for variables that are likely to be confounded with relationship dissolution or with child literacy. I controlled for child gender because boys tend to have lower literacy skills when they begin school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12445164">Hoglund &amp; Leadbeater, 2004</xref>). I controlled for child age at 48 months because of differences in the timing of the child outcome data collection within each round of the ECLS-B. I controlled for child cognitive ability at 24 months because these have been shown to be correlated with later child literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12445164">Crosnoe et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, I controlled for race/ethnicity. Hispanic children are likely to have lower emergent literacy scores because the immigration experience may be stressful for parents who must adapt to a different culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X12445164">Fomby &amp; Estacion, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Source</title>
<p>The ECLS-B is a nationally representative probability sample of 10,700 children born in the United States in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X12445164">National Center for Education Statistics, 2005</xref>). Children were excluded from the study if (a) they were born to mothers younger than 15 years (in response to state confidentiality and sensitivity concerns), (b) their parents placed them up for adoption at or shortly after birth, and (c) they died before the age of 24 months. The ECLS-B cohort of children was followed at approximately 9 months, 24 months, 48 months, and at kindergarten entry. The study oversampled Asian and Pacific Islander children, American Indian and Alaska Native children, Chinese children, twins, and low and very low birth weight children. The sample of children born in the year 2001 was selected using a clustered, list frame sampling design, which was made up of registered births in the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics system. Births were sampled from 96 core primary sampling units (counties and county groups) representing all infants born in the United States in the year 2001. Sampling was based on the occurrence of the birth as listed on the birth certificate.</p>
<p>The study collected data from primary caregivers (mostly mothers), resident and nonresident fathers, child care providers, teachers, and school administrators. Data about children were collected from the parents, through direct observation and testing, and from teachers. Primary caregivers included biological, adoptive, foster, and stepmothers and a very small percentage of fathers. Resident fathers included biological, adoptive, foster, and stepfathers. Data from nonresident fathers were collected at 9 and 24 months but not at 48 months. The present study makes use of the primary caregiver interview and child testing. The primary caregiver interview and child testing were conducted in the child’s home.</p>
<p>More than 14,000 births were sampled and fielded. Of these, 76% (<italic>n</italic> = 10,700) of primary caregivers were interviewed at 9 months. About 92% (<italic>n</italic> = 9,850) of primary caregivers who completed the 9-month survey completed the 24-month protocol, and 82% (<italic>n</italic> = 8,750) of those who completed the 9-month survey completed the 48-month survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0192513X12445164">
<title>Analytic Sample</title>
<p>The sample for the present study was limited to biological mothers who completed the primary caregiver interviews at 24 and 48 months and who were married or cohabiting with the biological father at 24 months. The first step in selecting the sample was to omit 300 cases in which the individual completing the primary caregiver interview was not the biological mother at 24 and 48 months. Next, I selected cases in which biological mothers indicated that they were currently married (<italic>n</italic> = 6,550) or had never been and were not currently married (<italic>n</italic> = 2,400) during the 24-month interview. I then restricted the sample to children who were living with both the biological mother and father at 24 months (<italic>n</italic> = 6,250 for married parents, <italic>n</italic> = 900 for never married [cohabiting] parents). Finally, I omitted 668 cases in which the child did not live with the mother at 48 months and 8 cases in which the mother was widowed. The final sample included 6,450 cases (5,700 married and 750 cohabiting at 24 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0192513X12445164">
<title>Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>The average age of the children at the 48-month interview was 4.4 years of age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12445164">Table 1</xref>). Most of the mothers were non-Hispanic White (49.2%), followed by others (23.2%), Hispanic (19.3%), and non-Hispanic Black (8.2%). At 48 months, the majority of biological parents in the sample were in stable marital relationships (82.7%), 4.4% were divorced and then single, 1% were divorced and then cohabiting with a new partner, 8.9% were in stable cohabiting relationships, 2.4% had exited a cohabiting relationship and then were single, and 0.5% had exited a cohabiting relationship and then were cohabiting with a new partner. The median household income of the mother–father families ranged from $40,001 to $50,000 per year at 24 months.</p>

<title>Measure of Literacy</title>
<p>The ECLS-B used a 37-item assessment of emergent literacy at 48 months. Content areas included letter recognition (8 items), letter sounds (6 items), early reading—recognition of simple words (4 items), phonological awareness (10 items), knowledge of print conventions (8 items), and matching words (1 item). The majority of items were selected from published instruments, including the PreLAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12445164">S. E. Duncan &amp; De Avila, 1998</xref>), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Third Edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X12445164">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>), and the Preschool Comprehensive Test of Phonological and Print Processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X12445164">Lonigan, Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 2002</xref>). Skip rules were incorporated into the assessment to allow children to skip over difficult questions that were similar to earlier questions that they had not been able to answer correctly. There was no ceiling effect for the test, but there was a floor effect for about 10% of the children tested. The floor effect suggests that the literacy assessment did not measure accurately for the children with the lowest level of literacy skills. Item response theory (IRT) calibration and scoring were used to calculate an overall literacy scale score for each child. Reliability (alpha) of the IRT-based literacy scores was .81. Total scores ranged from 4.29 to 34.68 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12445164">Table 1</xref> for sample mean).</p>

<title>Measures of Marital Status and Cohabitation</title>
<p>I constructed variables measuring mothers’ marital status and cohabitation status at 24 and 48 months. To construct these measures, I used one item from each of the mother questionnaires asking about mothers’ marital status (married, divorced, separated, widowed, never married) and a second item to determine whether the mother was cohabiting during these time periods. This item asked the mother to indicate with which adults the child currently resides. Mothers who were married at 24 and 48 months and the child lived with the biological father and mother at both times were coded as “stable marriage” (reference group, <italic>n</italic> = 5,300). Mothers who indicated that they were never married at 24 and 48 months and the child lived at both times with the biological father and mother were coded as “stable cohabitation” (<italic>n</italic> = 600). Mothers who indicated that they were married only at 24 months and the child lived only with the mother at 48 months were coded as “divorced → noncohabitation” (these mothers could also be separated and noncohabiting; <italic>n</italic> = 250). Mothers who indicated that they were married only at 24 months and the child lived with the mother and a different father at 48 months were coded as “divorced → cohabitation” (<italic>n</italic> = 100). Mothers who cohabited at 24 months and the child lived only with the mother at 48 months were coded as “cohabitation → noncohabitation” (<italic>n</italic> = 150). Mothers who cohabited with the biological father at 24 months and then cohabited with another father at 48 months were coded as “cohabitation → new-cohabitation” (<italic>n</italic> = 50). Very few mothers indicated that they were married or cohabiting at 24 months and then married to a new man at 48 months (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 50). These cases were therefore dropped from the study.</p>

<title>Measures of Mediators</title>
<p><italic>Depressive symptoms</italic> at 24 and 48 months were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale–Short Form (CESD-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X12445164">Ross, Mirowsky, &amp; Huber, 1983</xref>), which comprises 12 of the 20 items from the full CES-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X12445164">Radloff, 1977</xref>). The CES-D is a self-report scale that measures the absence or presence of negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors during the prior week. The measure is based on parents’ responses to questions on how many days in the past week the respondent felt bothered, had a poor appetite, could not shake the blues, had trouble keeping focus, felt depressed, felt everything was an effort, felt fearful, had difficulty sleeping, talked less than usual, felt lonely, felt sad, and could not get going. Items were rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>rarely</italic> to 4 = <italic>most or all days</italic>). Higher scores indicated more depressive symptoms (α = .87 at 24 months and α = .89 at 48 months). Depressive symptom indexes were constructed for mothers by summing the 12 CESD-SF items. Change in depressive symptoms from 24 to 48 months was assessed by including measures of depressive symptoms at both time periods (i.e., controlling for symptoms at 24 months).</p>
<p><italic>SES</italic> was computed at the household level using data from the parent (mother) and father questionnaires at 24 and 48 months. This constructed variable was based on mother’s and father’s education, mother’s and father’s occupation, and household income. Father’s occupation and education were not included in the calculation of household SES at 48 months if the father no longer lived in the same household as the child and mother. Parent education level was obtained by asking parents to indicate the highest level of education completed at the time of the interview. Similarly, parents were asked about their occupation, and these data were transformed to prestige scores based on the <italic>Standard Occupation Classification Manual.</italic> One item was used from the parent questionnaire at 24 and 48 months to measure total household income. Mothers were asked about their total household income from all sources. Respondents were asked to estimate their income within a range of $5,000 (i.e., $15,001-$20,000).</p>
<p>Mothers were asked a series of questions regarding their involvement in child activities during the past month related to <italic>cognitive stimulation</italic> when children were 24 and 48 months. All questions were scaled from 1 = <italic>more than once a day</italic> to 6 = <italic>not at all</italic>. The items were reverse coded so that a high score indicated higher levels of involvement. Three items were used to assess cognitive stimulation: read books to the child, tell stories, and sing songs. These items were recoded and then summed so that a high score indicated higher levels of cognitive stimulation (α = .62 at 24 months and α = .61 at 48 months). Change in cognitive stimulation from 24 to 48 months was assessed by including measures of cognitive stimulation at both time periods (i.e., controlling for mothering at 24 months).</p>
<p><italic>Pregnancy timing</italic> was assessed at 9 months. Mothers were asked whether they became pregnant sooner than they wanted, later than they wanted, or at about the right time, and a dichotomous variable was created to indicate whether the mother became pregnant sooner than she wanted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0192513X12445164">
<title>Measures of Controls</title>
<p>Child cognitive ability at 24 months was controlled using the Bayley Short Form–Research Mental Scale (BSF), which is an adaption from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12445164">Bayley, 1993</xref>) especially designed for the ECLS-B. Children’s cognitive abilities were assessed through observation conducted by field staff who completed an extensive training to administer standardized tasks (e.g., naming pictures, verbalizing, comparing sizes) to the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X12445164">National Center for Education Statistics, 2005</xref>). The BSF assessed memory, vocabulary, problem solving, early counting, and reasoning. These separate scales were summed to form a total raw score, which was used to estimate the Overall Mental Scale. IRT true-score equating was used to place the BSF results on the same 0-to-178-point scale used by the BSID-II. The BSF mental scale score is an estimate of the number of items a child would have answered correctly had the full BSID-II been administered. The reliability of the BSF was .79 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12445164">Table 1</xref> for sample mean). There is no reported evidence of the correlation between the BSF and future outcomes for children because the BSF was newly created for the ECLS-B study.</p>
<p>I included in the models child gender to control for the potential effect that this variable might have on the dependent variables (DVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12445164">Hoglund &amp; Leadbeater, 2004</xref>). I also controlled for child age at assessment because of the differences in the timing of the data collection within each round of the study. I used the age of the child in months at the 48-month survey. In addition, I controlled for mother’s race/ethnicity. The following categories were constructed: Hispanic, African American, non-Hispanic Other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian), and non-Hispanic White (reference group). Controls for SES, depressive symptoms, and mothers’ cognitive stimulation at 24 months are described in the “Measures of Mediators” section.</p>

<sec id="section12-0192513X12445164">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Stata’s multiple imputation method (imputation by chained equations [ICE]) was used to replace missing data. Multiple imputation has emerged as an attractive technique for analyzing incomplete data because it almost always produces estimates which are more representative of the population than do the more popular methods of handling missing data such as listwise deletion or mean substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X12445164">Allison, 2001</xref>). Multiple imputation uses observed data to impute missing values over multiple data sets; analyses are then conducted across each data set and the estimates are averaged. Only those variables used in the regression models were used to impute missing values.</p>
<p>Five multiple regression analyses were conducted. First, marital/cohabitation status and control variables were regressed on child literacy at 48 months (Model 1). The next four multiple regression analyses tested each of the mediators in a separate model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12445164">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> suggest the following criteria for testing mediation effects: the independent variable (IV; marital status/cohabitation) must be significantly associated with the DV (literacy), the IV must be significantly associated with the mediator variable (MV, e.g., change in household income), the MV must be significantly associated with the DV, and the MV must significantly reduce the association between the IV and the DV. When compared with Model 1 of each multivariate analysis, Models 2 through 5 show the extent to which each of the MVs reduce the association between getting married and child literacy. To test that the IV was associated with the MV, multivariate models were run with the MVs as the outcome variables and all study controls and marital status/cohabitation as predictors. Sobel’s test was conducted to determine whether the mediation effect was significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section14-0192513X12445164">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>The mean literacy score was 13.88 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.24) for all children in the analytic sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12445164">Table 1</xref>). This score suggests that children answered just less than one half of the items in the literacy test correctly. The 5% outlier test revealed that the actual mean (13.88) was very similar to the trimmed mean (13.54). Moreover, there was no change in the multiple regression findings when the outliers were omitted from the analysis, suggesting that there was no need to omit outliers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X12445164">Table 1</xref> reveals that children of mothers who were married at 24 months scored significantly higher on literacy than children of mothers who cohabited at 24 months.</p>
<p>The mean child cognition score (BSF) at 24 months was 126.34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.59). The 5% outlier test revealed that the actual mean was very similar to the trimmed mean (126.46), suggesting that there was no need to omit outliers. The children of mothers who were married at 24 months scored significantly higher on the BSF than the children of cohabiting parents.</p>
<p>There was also no evidence that outliers needed to be omitted from the mediation variables. Mothers who cohabited at 24 months scored significantly higher on depressive symptoms and significantly lower on SES and cognitive stimulation at 24 and 48 months than mothers who were married at 24 months. Cohabiting mothers were also significantly more likely than married mothers to believe that their pregnancy occurred too soon (70.5% vs. 65.5%).</p>
<p>The correlation matrix revealed no evidence of collinearity among IVs (table available from the author). Furthermore, all variance inflation factor parameters were less than 2.5 and all tolerance parameters were greater than 0.40 in regression analyses, suggesting that there was no multicollinearity.</p>

<sec id="section15-0192513X12445164">
<title>Multiple Regression Analyses</title>
<p>Model 1 examined the first hypothesis of the study: The children of divorced mothers who remain single will have significantly lower literacy scores than the children of formerly cohabiting mothers who also remain single, compared with the children of married mothers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12445164">Table 2</xref>). This hypothesis was not supported. Neither divorce → noncohabitation nor cohabitation → noncohabitation was significantly related to child literacy. The unstandardized coefficients for these two groups were about equal in size (−.66 and −.68, respectively).</p>

<p>The second hypothesis was supported, although only for mothers who were divorced and started a new cohabiting relationship before the child was 48 months, and not for mothers who terminated cohabiting relationships and started new cohabiting relationships. That is, mothers who were divorced and started a new cohabiting relationship between 24 and 48 months had children with significantly lower literacy scores than children whose mothers were married at 24 and 48 months. The effect size for divorce → cohabitation was small. I conducted two additional multivariate analyses to determine whether divorce → cohabitation had an effect on child literacy when divorce → noncohabitation and cohabitation → noncohabitation were included as the reference groups (i.e., instead of stable marriage). The results of the first analysis showed that divorce → cohabitation had a significant negative effect on literacy (<italic>b</italic> = −2.70, β = −.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; results not shown in table), compared with children of mothers who went from divorce → noncohabitation. The results of the second analysis revealed that divorce → cohabitation had a significant negative effect on literacy (<italic>b</italic> = −2.69, β = −.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; results not shown in table), compared with children of mothers who went from cohabitation → noncohabitation.</p>
<p>The unstandardized coefficient for cohabitation → new-cohabitation was not significantly different from stable marriage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12445164">Table 2</xref>, Model 1). However, examination of the unstandardized coefficient reveals that in all likelihood this variable did not reach significance level because of the small number of mothers in this group (<italic>n</italic> = 50).</p>
<p>It was noteworthy that children of mothers in stable cohabiting relationships scored significantly lower on emerging literacy than the children of married mothers at 48 months. The unstandardized coefficient for mothers in stable cohabiting relationships was nonetheless about one half the size of the unstandardized coefficient of divorce → cohabitation. The effect sizes (betas) of both variables were about equal in size due to considerable differences in the sample sizes for divorce → cohabitation (<italic>n</italic> = 100) and stable cohabitation (<italic>n</italic> = 600).</p>
<p>Models 2 through 5 examined mediators of the relationship between family structure and child literacy. Only two family structure variables (divorce → cohabitation, stable cohabitation) were significantly related to child literacy and, therefore, could be tested for mediation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X12445164">Table 2</xref> revealed that there was no change in the regression weights for divorce → cohabitation when the mediating variables were added to the models. That is, depressive symptoms, SES, mothers’ cognitive stimulation, and pregnancy timing did not reduce the association between divorce → cohabitation and literacy.</p>
<p>There was a significant mediation effect of change in SES on the association between stable cohabitation and child literacy. Model 3 revealed a negative association between change in SES and child literacy (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Thus, the first stage of Baron and Kenny’s test of mediation (MV − DV) was confirmed for change in SES. Next, I examined whether stable cohabitation was significantly associated with change in SES (IV − MV). SES at 48 months was regressed on stable cohabitation and other control variables (table not shown). The results revealed a significant association between the IV and MV (<italic>b</italic> = −0.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Finally, change in SES reduced the unstandardized coefficient for stable cohabitation from <italic>b</italic> = −1.30 in the control model to <italic>b</italic> = −1.13 in the mediation model. Sobel’s test revealed that the mediation effect of change in SES was significant (Sobel’s test = −3.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There were no other mediation effects on the association between stable cohabitation and child literacy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main goal of the present study was to examine the effects of cohabitation dissolution versus divorce on preschoolers’ emerging literacy. The present study hypothesized that divorce → noncohabitation would have a greater negative effect than cohabitation → noncohabitation on preschool-age children’s literacy, compared with children living with stably married parents. This hypothesis was based on the literature suggesting that divorced mothers face more challenges than previously cohabiting mothers and, therefore, divorce is likely to be more stressful for adults and children. The results of this study did not support this hypothesis for children of mothers who divorced or exited cohabiting relationships but then remained single. However, the children of divorced parents fared significantly more poorly on tests of literacy than children of continuously married parents when the mother was cohabiting with another man 2 years following the divorce. The children of divorce → cohabitation also had significantly lower literacy scores than the children of divorce → noncohabitation and the children of cohabitation → noncohabitation, providing additional support for the hypothesis that multiple family transitions are associated with negative effects on preschool-age children. Together these findings appear to suggest that the children of mothers who exit cohabiting relationships fare better on literacy tests than the children of mothers who divorce, but only if the divorced mother enters a new cohabiting relationship.</p>
<p>The effect size of divorce → cohabitation on child literacy was small, a finding which is consistent with other studies showing small effects of family structure variables on child outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12445164">Acock &amp; Demo, 1994</xref>). We note, however, that the effect of divorce → cohabitation was larger than the effects of child gender and being a Hispanic child compared with being a White, non-Hispanic child. On average, children whose mothers divorced and subsequently started new cohabiting relationships obtained a score that was .36 SDs lower than children whose mothers were continuously married, after controlling for 24-month cognitive abilities, child gender, race/ethnicity, SES, mothers’ depressive symptoms, and mothers’ cognitive stimulation. One way to examine this effect is to compare it with the effect of a benchmark early child intervention program, the Abecedarian Project. Researchers found that 5-year-old children who participated in the 3- to 5-year project obtained IQ scores that were .75 SDs greater than children who did not attend the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X12445164">G. J. Duncan &amp; Gibson-Davis, 2006</xref>). In other words, the average effect of the high-quality intervention program was slightly more than two times larger than the effect of divorce → cohabitation on children’s literacy scores. Although the effect of divorce → cohabitation on children is smaller than the effect of the intervention program, it is not unsubstantial and seems to be worthy of attention by policy makers.</p>
<p>The findings of this study seem to suggest that divorce per se is not what negatively affects preschoolers’ emerging literacy abilities. Instead, the mother’s pursuit of new intimate cohabiting relationships shortly following a divorce may be what negatively affects young children. One possible explanation is that these mothers are exposing children to a high level of instability that then negatively affects the child. Researchers have suggested that multiple partnerships over a short period of time may have negative effects on children because of disruptions in routines in the child’s environment, lower levels of maternal availability to the child, and lower psychological functioning in mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X12445164">Osborne &amp; McLanahan, 2007</xref>). I examined several possible mediators of the association between divorce → cohabitation and child literacy (change in maternal depressive symptoms, SES, maternal cognitive stimulation, and pregnancy timing). All the mediating variables were significantly related to child literacy, but none explained the relationship between divorce → cohabitation and child literacy. I surmise that there may be better measures of mother–child interaction that are more sensitive to the effects of multiple family structure transitions on child literacy. For example, mothers’ responsiveness, support, and nurturance may prove to be significant mediators. Unfortunately, the ECLS-B did not include viable measures of these mediators at 48 months.</p>
<p>The present study showed that children do not show significantly lower literacy scores when their mothers end and start new cohabiting relationships within the same 2-year period of time. However, the size of the unstandardized coefficient for cohabitation → new-cohabitation was relatively large and probably would have been significant with a larger sample size. It seems that cohabitation dissolution as well as divorce may have small negative (significant) effects on children when mothers start new cohabiting relationships shortly following the dissolution of their previous union. These findings appear to be consistent with the idea that multiple partnerships are more detrimental to preschoolers’ literacy outcomes than is relationship dissolution per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12445164">Hill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X12445164">Raley &amp; Wildsmith, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A second noteworthy finding of this study was that mothers in consistent cohabiting relationships were more likely than mothers in stable marriage to have children with low literacy scores. These findings are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12445164">Ackerman, D’Eramo, Umylny, Schultz, &amp; Izard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X12445164">Dunifon &amp; Kowaleski-Jones, 2002</xref>), although these studies are limited because they have tended to examine mothers’ cohabitation at one point in time. Researchers have become increasingly interested in the reasons why cohabitation is associated with poorer child outcomes. The mediation findings of the present study suggest that the association between consistent cohabitation and child literacy is partially explained by a decrease in SES among consistently cohabiting mothers compared with consistently married mothers. This is an interesting finding because cohabitation has often been thought to lift children out of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X12445164">Manning &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>). My findings, which are based on longitudinal data, reveal that over time mothers in stable cohabiting relationships with the biological father have declines in SES compared with stable married persons, and it is this decline in SES that partially explains why children of stable cohabiting parents are doing more poorly on literacy tests.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study are also noteworthy because, compared with children residing with two married parents, stable cohabitation has a larger negative effect on literacy than does divorce → noncohabitation, and cohabitation → noncohabitation. That is, staying single may be better for child outcomes than is stable cohabitation. One possible explanation for this finding may be that mothers who remain single after divorce or cohabitation are able to provide more attention to their children. Mothers’ cognitive stimulation, however, was not found to mediate the association between the noncohabiting mothers and child literacy. Again, it is possible that there are parenting behaviors (that were not measured at the 48-month interview), such as maternal support and responsiveness, that would explain the associations between these variables.</p>
<p>There were a number of additional limitations in the present study. The ECLS-B measure of mothers’ cognitive stimulation was weaker than the measures of SES and depressive symptoms because it only included three self-report items. The ECLS-B also did not assess the number of partners with whom the mother lived between the 24- and 48-month interviews. It was only possible to determine whether the mother resided with a partner at 48 months who was different from the biological father at 24 months. The limited measure of marital status/cohabitation did not allow me to measure multiple family transitions (i.e., more than 2). In addition, it would have been helpful to follow the families in the study for a longer period of time, that is, longer than the 2 years between the 24- and 48-month interviews. The sample would likely have had a larger number of mothers who went from cohabitation → new-cohabitation if there had been a longer follow-up time. As it was, there were only 50 mothers in this group, which limited the power of the analysis. Finally, the ECLS-B data did not include a measure of quality of mother’s interaction with the child at 48 months, although quality was measured at 9 months. It is possible that improved quality of mother–child interaction would have mediated the association between divorce → cohabitation and child literacy. This would be a fruitful area for future research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study adds to the knowledge base about relationship dissolution and effects on children in two ways. First, it shows that divorce (and possibly cohabitation dissolution) is likely to have negative effects on preschool-age child literacy only when residential mothers transition into new cohabiting relationships shortly following the breakup of their previous relationship. The findings add to the growing body of research suggesting that several partnerships over a short period of time are disruptive to child development outcomes. Second, the present study adds to the increasing body of literature showing that cohabitation, even when stable over a 2-year period of time, has negative effects on children. There is currently a great need for studies to provide a better understanding about the reasons for these negative effects, as there are significant implications for the growing number of parents who have chosen to raise their children in the context of cohabitation rather than marriage. The findings of the present study also suggest that these family structure effects are relevant to children at a young age and may affect their school readiness.</p>
