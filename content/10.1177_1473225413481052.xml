<title>Children in Care in England and Wales, Under the Supervision of Youth Offending Teams, are Failed by Agencies who ‘Do Not Always Work Effectively Together in the Best Interests of the Child’</title>
<p>A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, Ofsted and Estyn considers children who were looked after and placed away from their local authority area, but were also subject to youth offending team (YOT) supervision. The issue of placement outside of the home area, and its links to offending, impacts on a relatively small group of children, but given their particular vulnerabilities, the Inspectorates considered that it requires investigation. In spite of a statutory requirement that children in care should be placed within the local authority area, so far as is reasonably practicable, data from the Department of Education indicate that ten local authorities have no children’s homes within their boundaries, almost one third of children in care are accommodated outside of their home area, and 91 per cent of this group are placed in private or voluntary provision. At the same time, figures confirm that young people in care are almost three times as likely to be subject of a youth justice disposal as children in the general population (6.9 per cent in the course of one year, compared to 2.4 per cent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473225413481052">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The inspection found that many of the children in the sample had experienced multiple placements outside of their local authority. Almost one third had been placed out of their home area on three occasions; and 18 per cent had experienced more than five such placements. In one case, a young person had been moved 31 times. Nearly two thirds (63 per cent) were living more than 50 miles away from home, with one in four (24 per cent) more than 100 miles. Such distances inevitably tended to undermine contact with families, friends, and professionals from the placing authority.</p>
<p>In recognition of the increased vulnerability of looked after children to contact with the youth justice system, Crown Prosecution Service guidance acknowledges that:<disp-quote>
<p>… a criminal justice disposal, whether a prosecution, reprimand or warning, should not be regarded as an automatic response to offending behaviour by a looked after child, irrespective of their criminal history.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However the majority of practitioners interviewed for the inspection, considered that the youth justice system was not infrequently used as a disciplinary measure by residential units, propelling children down a youth justice route for offences which would not have attracted police attention in a family home environment. More than half the sample had committed offences in the care placement leading to a criminal sanction and opportunities for restorative approaches to enable diversion were missed.</p>
<p>In the event of prosecution, children were frequently further disadvantaged. Magistrates reported that children placed out of area were often accompanied by an adult who did not know them very well, making decisions in relation to remand and sentence more problematic. In one case, witnessed by inspectors, a girl was ‘accompanied to court to face charges of assault against care staff by a member of staff whom she had previously assaulted’.</p>
<p>Nearly all children in the sample subject to criminal justice proceedings had reoffended, rates of non-compliance were high, and return to court for breach was routine. Disproportionate involvement in the youth justice system was matched by a high level of victimization: in one in five cases, children had themselves been victims of offending while under YOT supervision.</p>
<p>Despite a statutory responsibility to safeguard children in care, arrangements to address the acute vulnerabilities of this particular group were frequently deficient. Inspectors considered that less than half of the sample had their emotional or mental health needs appropriately met. Absconding from placement was a frequent occurrence. Educational outcomes were disappointing and appeared to have been negatively impacted by being placed away from the home area. Few children were attempting GCSEs and none were taking A-levels, severely constraining future employment prospects. No cases showed evidence of adequate long-term care planning and, while some young people had been placed in specialist supported lodgings, the options for many of those moving towards independence consisted of hostel or bed and breakfast accommodation, staying with acquaintances, or returning to live with their families. The report details how such data were objective manifestations of personal tragedy, expressed in the words of one young woman who said: ‘I have lost all my connections with people. I have been moved to three different schools and lost my friends’.</p>
<p>In this context, YOTs, despite their best efforts, struggled to provide a satisfactory service. Comprehensive information from the home authority was often lacking and liaison with residential establishments was frequently inadequate and ad hoc. Moreover youth justice staff tended to underestimate the traumatic impact of children’s experiences. Issues of loss, disruption, loneliness or sadness were rarely addressed and lack of engagement was consequently taken at face value rather than recognized as an indicator of a troubled emotional state. Inspectors considered that, on occasion, YOTs were too ready to take formal action for non-compliance without a sensitive appreciation of how the child’s circumstances – away from family, friends and a community they knew and understood − differed from those of most other young people with whom they worked.</p>
<p>The inspectors record their disappointment at the lack of integration of service provision for this especially vulnerable group. This failure typically led to an acceptance that it was sufficient to manage such children through the system rather than focusing on longer-term aspirations for their future.</p>

<title>The Government in England and Wales Refuses to Countenance a Rise in the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility</title>
<p>The low age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales, at ten years, has attracted criticism from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Within the jurisdiction, the Joint Committee on Human Rights also concluded in 2009 that attributing criminal liability at that young age was inappropriate. Nonetheless, the Government has not proved sympathetic to calls to change the legislation in this regard.</p>
<p>On 5 December 2012, an open letter addressed to Jeremy Wright, Parliamentary under Secretary of State with responsibility for youth justice, urged a review of the current position. Signed by 55 experts including the Children’s Commissioner and her deputy, the letter cites, as evidence in support of such a review, a report published by the National Association for Youth Justice on the same day. Speaking to <italic>Children and Young People Now</italic> magazine, on 7 December 2012, the Minister indicated that the government’s position was unchanged since ‘young people aged 10 and over are able to differentiate between bad behaviour and serious wrongdoing’. A Private Members’ Bill seeking to increase the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years was subsequently introduced to the House of Lords on 17 January 2013, but seems unlikely to attract government support.</p>
<p>The stance of the Minister for England and Wales contrasts with that of his counterpart in Northern Ireland where the age of criminal responsibility is currently also set at 10 years. In October 2012, David Ford, Minister for Justice, confirmed that he is committed to a rise in conformity with the recommendations of an independent review of the youth justice published the previous year.</p>
<p>The open letter to the Minister appears at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thenayj.org.uk/news-events-and-information/">www.thenayj.org.uk/news-events-and-information/</ext-link></p>
<p>Jeremy Wright’s comments in response to the letter are reported in <italic>Government Dismisses Call to Increase Age of Criminal Responsibility</italic> by Neil Puffett, in <italic>Children and Young People Now</italic>, 7 December 2012, available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1075632/government-dismisses-increase-age-criminal-responsibility">www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1075632/government-dismisses-increase-age-criminal-responsibility</ext-link></p>
<p>David Ford’s endorsement of an increased age of criminal responsibility is cited in <italic>The 2012 Annual Statement: Human Rights in Northern Ireland</italic>, published by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, and available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nihrc.org/index.php/publications/browse/item/664">www.nihrc.org/index.php/publications/browse/item/664</ext-link></p>

<title>Latest Figures Show a Fall in the ‘Youth Incarceration Rate’ in Canada for the Third Consecutive Year</title>
<p>Figures released by the <italic>Canadian Centre for Justice Studies</italic> show that the proportion of children in contact with the youth correctional system (either under statutory supervision or in custody), on any single day, was 12 per cent lower in 2010/11, at 79 per 10,000 young people in the 12−17 population, than five years previously. Boys account for more than three quarters (78 per cent) of those who come to the attention of the system and involvement in correctional services increases sharply with age: the overall rate of 17 year-olds subject to community supervision or detention was 315 per 10,000 young people in the general population, whereas that for children aged 12−14 years was below 200.</p>
<p>There is considerable variation across provinces. For much of the last decade, British Columbia has experienced the lowest rate of criminal justice involvement. During 2010/11, that jurisdiction reported that 33 children per 10,000 were subject to correctional intervention, less than half the national average and almost eight times below the highest rate, 254 per 10,000, recorded in the North West Territories. Similarly while the overall pattern between 2005/06 to 2010/11 has been one of decline, a number of areas have registered a rise. In Yukon, for instance, the proportion of young people in contact with correctional services over that period increased by 38 per cent. Children of Aboriginal identity are overrepresented in the youth justice system, accounting for just over a quarter (26 per cent) of those subject to correctional services while constituting just 10 per cent of the general youth population. The overrepresentation is sharper, at 35 per cent, for Aboriginal girls.</p>
<p>The large majority of children in contact with the system are subject to community supervision, mostly probation. Custody accounts for just one in 10 of those within the system, representing, on average, 1500 young people incarcerated on any given day, some of whom are placed in open rather than secure facilities. In line with the general reduction in children subject to correctional interventions, the use of custody has fallen over the past five years in most provinces and territories, with Newfoundland and Labrador registering the biggest decline of 58 per cent. There were exceptions, however: Manitoba experienced an increase of 38 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p>Although there is a statutory presumption, contained in the Youth Criminal Justice Act 2002, that a custodial sentence should generally be reserved for serious offences, six in 10 incarcerated young people had committed non-violent crimes, with a quarter of sentences of detention imposed for offences against property. In contrast to custodial sentences, the rate of remand rose between 2005/6 and 2007/8. While there has been a decline in the period, since it has not been as marked. As a consequence, remands now account for the majority of custodial placements.</p>

<title>Australian Study Finds that Children Supervised by Staff who Adopt a ‘Non-blaming Approach’ and Reward Pro-social Behaviour, Have Lower Rates of Recidivism</title>
<p>A study conducted with juvenile justice staff in New South Wales explored the extent to which various approaches to supervision were related to recidivism rates of children subject to community orders. The aim of the research was to test the hypothesis that ‘the more the effective practice skills highlighted in earlier research were used, the less frequently the offenders under supervision would reoffend’.</p>
<p>A total of 117 interviews between staff and young people, each involving a different service user, were observed over a period of four years. A framework for assessing workers’ supervisory skills, across 15 broad dimensions, was developed and staff were rated independently by three researchers on the basis of the extent to which their practice accorded with previous research findings. Scores reflected supervisors’ practice rather than the response of young people in recognition of the fact that non-engagement might be explained by factors unrelated to the skills of individual staff.</p>
<p>Workers were accorded a ‘global skill score’ between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest) depending on the extent to which their practice displayed ‘role clarification, pro-social modelling, problem solving and relationship, and each of the skills used in a collaborative way’. A correlation was found between increased global score and reduced detected reoffending within two years of the order. Although this relationship did not reach the level of statistical significance, there was a significant association between increased recidivism and staff who attracted particularly low skills scores. These findings, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473225413481052">Table 1</xref>, were not explained by differences in the level of risk posed by the young people under supervision.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Individual skills were also rated independently on a five point scale and higher scores tended to be related to reduced reoffending. In particular, children supervised by workers who were honest, friendly, optimistic and used appropriate self-disclosure, had reduced rates of recidivism by comparison with supervisees whose workers scored less highly on these dimensions. Young people who were encouraged by staff to develop their own strategies to address identified areas of difficulty were less likely to reoffend. Supervisees of workers who demonstrated better relationship, or pro-social modelling, skills also tended to reoffend less. None of these relationships, however, reached conventional levels of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Two skill sets demonstrated a stronger relationship with reduced reoffending. Fifty-five per cent of young people allocated to staff who scored three or more for rewarding young people’s pro-social behaviour – giving praise or material inducements such as fewer appointments – were reconvicted within two years. This compared with a recidivism rate of 76 per cent associated with workers who attracted a score of two or less. Similarly, reoffending rates for children of staff who scored three or higher for effective ‘non-blaming skills’ – the capacity to avoid blaming the child, directly or inadvertently, for his or her circumstances − was reduced, at 61 per cent, by comparison with staff whose skill rating was below three (76.5 per cent). In both cases, the relationship was statistically significant but fell just outside the conventional significance level when the risk posed by the young person was factored into the analysis.</p>
<p>Qualified staff, appointed as juvenile justice counsellors, tended to demonstrate a higher use of skills than unqualified juvenile justice officers. The former group were more than twice as likely to be awarded a score above five for their global skill rating. They also achieved better outcomes in terms of reoffending despite having higher risk caseloads. The difference between the two groups of staff was statistically significant and remained so when client characteristics, including risk, gender, and indigenous status, were taken into account. The relevant outcomes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1473225413481052">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The report notes that the findings accord with previous research showing that youth justice workers who exercise particular skills are more likely to generate lower rates of reoffending among children whom they supervise. Further, staff given a counselling role are more likely to make use of such effective skills. Thus, ‘[t]here is potential for widespread reductions in recidivism if juvenile justice organisations prescribe a counselling role to supervisors and employ staff with relevant qualifications’.</p>

<title>UK Government Admits that Five Children in England and Wales were Held in Adult Custodial Establishments during 2011</title>
<p>On 10 January 2013, in answer to a parliamentary question, Jeremy Wright, Minister with responsibility for youth justice, confirmed that five children below the age of 18 years had been moved from the secure estate for children and young people to adult custodial establishments during 2011.</p>
<p>The practice of detaining juveniles in adult facilities potentially represents a breach of Article 37(c) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which requires that ‘every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interest not to do so’. The Minister did not suggest that the welfare of the child had been a factor in the decision to move the children concerned. A prison services spokesperson cited in the <italic>Independent</italic> newspaper, while refusing to comment on the individual circumstances of the children involved, confirmed that:<disp-quote>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, any young person can be transferred to an adult prison. This will usually happen because a young person’s violent or disruptive behaviour presents an unacceptable risk to the welfare of other young people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the same article, Andrew Neilson, Director of Campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, argued that the acknowledgement by the Government raised serious concerns about the fitness of the juvenile prison service if it was unable to cope with the behaviour of difficult young people.</p>
<p>More generally, the <italic>Children’s Rights Alliance for England</italic> (CRAE), in its annual report on the State of Children’s Rights in England, contends that some aspects of children’s treatment in custody – even when they are detained within the under-18 secure estate – constitute a breach of their right to be ‘treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person’ (also a requirement of Article 37(c)). Concerns include strip searches, the level of segregation, and the use of painful restraint techniques. Figures provided by Jeremy Wright, on 20 December 2012, indicate that, in the first three months of 2011, there were 245 recorded episodes of injury to children in young offender institutions (YOIs) and secure training centres following restraint.</p>
<p>CRAE’s report, while conceding that there has been an improvement in the proportion of children in YOIs who report involvement in education, is also critical of the fact that children deprived of their liberty do not enjoy a statutory right to education and as a consequence receive fewer hours of input than their non-imprisoned peers. During 2011/12, children in public sector YOIs received, on average, 17.7 hours of educational instruction per week. The figures do not, however, include time spent in vocational training.</p>
<p>Jeremy Wright’s admission that five children were detained in adult custodial provision is given in Hansard, House of Commons, 10 January 2013, Column 445W. Figures for injuries following restraint are given in Hansard, House of Commons, 20 December 2012, Column 957W</p>

<title>The Number of Children Incarcerated in England and Wales Continues to Fall but Average Sentence Length Rises</title>
<p>At November 2012, the latest date for which figures are available, 1551 children below the age of 18 years were detained in custody. This compares with a child custodial population of 2980 in November 2007, representing a fall of 48 per cent over that period. The decline in child imprisonment has however been accompanied by an increase in the duration of incarceration. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1473225413481052">Table 3</xref>, the average length of custodial sentences rose from 10.3 months in 2007 to 12 months in 2011. It seems likely that this trend is, in part, a consequence of the fact that the average number of previous convictions recorded against children receiving custodial sentences over this period also increased.</p>

<title>Children Transferred to the Adult Court for Property Offences in the United States have an Increased Risk of Re-arrest</title>
<p>Most states have provision whereby the jurisdiction of the juvenile court can be waived and children subject to prosecution in the adult court. During the 1990s, all but one state introduced legislation making it easier for young people to be tried as adults and between 1998 and 1994, the number of cases waived rose sharply. The period since has seen a reversal of that trend, in large part a consequence of falling juvenile court throughput which declined by 20 per cent between 1997 and 2009. In that latter year, an estimated 7600 children were transferred to the adult court.</p>
<p>Recent research, undertaken as part of the <italic>Pathways to Desistance</italic> study, has suggested that the impact of transfer to the adult justice system may depend on the presenting offence and previous offending history. The research focused on 654 cases processed in Maricopa County, Arizona, of which 193 (29 per cent) involved transfer to the adult court, a higher proportion than that in many other states where the statutory provisions allowing waiver from juvenile court proceedings are more tightly drawn.</p>
<p>Matched comparison of children who remained in the juvenile court with those who were transferred to adult jurisdiction suggested that defendants with no prior adjudicated offending were less likely to be re-arrested, over a four year follow-up period, than those with a previous criminal history, irrespective of the venue in which cases were heard. Where the presenting offence was one of violence against the person, re-arrest rates were lower for those processed through the adult court than for those where juvenile jurisdiction was retained. Conversely, transfer was likely to exacerbate reoffending rates where the index offence was a serious property crime.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that the focus on a single county means that the findings may not be representative of outcomes in other areas, but suggest that whether or not transfer leads to higher recidivism might vary according to the nature of children’s offending.</p>

<title>The Number of Staff Employed by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales Falls by 44 per cent in Three Years</title>
<p>The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales was established as a non-departmental public body by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to: monitor the operation of the youth justice system; advise the Secretary of State on matters pertaining to youth crime and services to prevent it; commission research and promote good practice; and coordinate accommodation for the detention of children deprived of their liberty through criminal proceedings. On election in May 2010, the Conservative/ Liberal Democrat coalition government announced that the Board would be abolished and its functions absorbed into the Ministry of Justice. In the light of considerable opposition, those plans were formally abandoned in November 2011.</p>
<p>Figures provided by Helen Grant, Minister with responsibility for victims and courts in answer to a parliamentary question, indicate that the number of staff working for the Board has diminished sharply in the period since the election. On 1 November 2009, the Board had 407 employees, including temporary staff, those on secondment and contractors; by November 2012 that figure had fallen, by 44 per cent, to 226 as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1473225413481052">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>On 8 January 2013, Jeremy Wright, Minister with responsibility for youth justice, announced a review of the Board to ascertain whether there is a continuing need for the organization to carry out its functions in the current form and to consider governance arrangements. The announcement accords with government policy to review regularly all non-departmental public bodies.</p>

<title>Enhanced Resettlement Regime at Feltham Young Offenders Institution in England Provides ‘Evidence of Promising Practice’</title>
<p>The <italic>London Youth Reducing Reoffending Programme</italic>, frequently referred to as <italic>Project Daedalus</italic>, was located in the Heron Unit at Feltham young offender institution in London, for young people towards the end of the custodial element of their sentence. Higher staff ratios permitted a greater focus on activities aimed at improving skills in preparation for the transition to the community, with a particular emphasis on ‘job readiness’. A central feature of the initiative was the involvement of ‘resettlement brokers’ whose function was to provide a consistent point of contact for the young person both in custody and on release. In some cases, the relationship extended beyond the end of the licence period but the extent to which contact was maintained varied: a third of young people reported seeing their mentor weekly after their return to the community, whereas 16 per cent had contact less than once a month.</p>
<p>An evaluation notes that the increased range of activities available within the custodial setting was associated with a reported reduction in behavioural problems. Ninety-three per cent of children considered that the period in the unit had helped them to take responsibility for their own development. On release, more than half were engaged in education, training and employment, comparing favourably with data showing that two thirds of the general youth custodial population have no such activities arranged on return to the community. However, only one third of the Daedalus sample was able to sustain the engagement for more than six months.</p>
<p>Recidivism within one year of release was lower than for the institution as a whole: 53 per cent against 72 per cent. However, young people were selected for the programme on the basis of being motivated to desist from offending. Moreover, a far smaller proportion (nine per cent) of project participants were assessed as posing a high risk of reoffending than has previously been found among the overall child custodial population (37 per cent). The evaluation acknowledges that, in the absence of a control group, no firm conclusions can be drawn and that recorded improvements cannot necessarily be attributed to the positive impact of intervention.</p>
<p>The governance arrangements for the project included elements of ‘payment by results’, whereby providers’ financial remuneration depends upon outcomes delivered, a mechanism that the government is keen to expand across the criminal justice landscape. The evaluation notes some of the anomalies that might potentially be associated with such an approach. As youth custody within England and Wales declined sharply, so too did referrals to the project, but the number of young people on the programme was one of the ‘metrics’ that triggered payment to providers. The same trend ensured that programme participants were increasingly those whose offending was more serious or persistent, making targets to engage the cohort in education, employment and training more difficult to achieve than they would otherwise have been.</p>
<p><italic>Daedalus</italic>, funding for which has now come to an end, is to be replaced by a resettlement scheme operating across a number of young offender institutions for young people from the capital. According to a report in <italic>Children and Young People Now</italic> magazine, the crime reduction charity Nacro has been awarded two of the three payment by results contracts on offer, covering eleven London boroughs. The organization will be paid five per cent of the contract value in the first instance; further payments, representing 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the total programme costs, will be dependent on the number of young people participating in the scheme and the proportion who enter education, employment or training on release respectively. The remaining sum will be paid according to performance against ‘engagement milestones’, measured in terms of sustained engagement of young people over time.</p>
