<sec id="section1-0363546513488866">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Recently, posterolateral corner (PLC) reconstruction techniques have been developed based on an anatomic study of cadaveric dissections. However, the best operative method for various anatomic reconstructions remains controversial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513488866">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The anatomic single fibular sling method for PLC reconstruction would be sufficiently strong to control posterolateral rotatory instability without an additional tibial sling.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546513488866">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513488866">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This retrospective cohort study analyzed 60 knees in 60 patients who underwent anatomic PLC reconstruction using the single fibular sling method with a tibialis anterior allograft, with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Ninety percent of the patients had concomitant reconstruction of one or both cruciate ligaments. Preoperative and postoperative dial test, varus stress test, and subjective clinical outcomes including Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores, and stress radiographs, including varus and posterior stress, were compared. In addition, intraoperative arthroscopic findings were analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513488866">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean length of clinical follow-up was 35.6 months (range, 24-65 months). Forty-two (70%) patients showed no rotational instability postoperatively. Varus laxity improved, with 96.7% of the patients assessed as grade 0 or 1. The mean side-to-side difference in varus stress test was reduced from 2.32 ± 1.33 mm preoperatively to 0.37 ± 1.48 mm postoperatively. Posterior stress radiography in combined posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction showed a mean posterior tibial translation of 14.7 ± 2.83 mm preoperatively and 4.06 ± 1.40 mm at final follow-up. The Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores improved from 52 ± 6.7 to 87.7 ± 12.3 and from 44.8 ± 6.3 to 77.6 ± 14.2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical outcome or varus laxity between isolated PLC and combined injuries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513488866">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Anatomic PLC reconstruction using a single fibular sling method is an effective and relatively simple procedure for most patients with posterolateral rotatory instability, with the exception of those with severe multiple injuries.</p>

<p>Injuries of the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee are uncommon but can lead to chronic disability, such as persistent instability with resulting articular cartilage degeneration, unless appropriately treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513488866">35</xref></sup> These injuries are rarely isolated and are nearly always associated with cruciate ligament injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513488866">29</xref></sup> They have negative effects on the clinical outcome of cruciate ligament reconstruction, particularly when they are not recognized at the initial diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513488866">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513488866">28</xref></sup> The diagnosis of posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) requires appropriate physical examination of the knee and a high degree of suspicion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488866">23</xref></sup> Although the diagnostic rate has increased with the evolution of physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513488866">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513488866">29</xref></sup> it remains lower than the real incidence rate. However, recent advances in the understanding of PLC anatomy have led to the development of surgical treatment for PLC injury. The popliteofibular (PF) ligament, lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and popliteus tendon are essential structures that should be included in PLC reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513488866">35</xref></sup> Numerous techniques to repair, augment, or reconstruct the posterolateral structure have been described, such as biceps tenodesis by the Clancy method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488866">6</xref></sup> fibula-based reconstruction (transfibular reconstruction, fibular sling) by Fanelli and Larson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488866">10</xref></sup> and combined fibula- and tibia-based anatomic reconstruction (fibular and tibial slings) by LaPrade and Wentorf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488866">23</xref></sup> Clinical results of PLC repair or augmentation have shown poor outcomes (9%-37%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513488866">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513488866">32</xref></sup> Thus, the current trend for PLC stabilization has moved toward anatomic reconstruction to restore normal stability and mechanics. Recent studies selected patients who underwent PLC reconstruction with concomitant cruciate ligament reconstruction and evaluated clinical or radiologic results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488866">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488866">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513488866">36</xref></sup> However, the best operative method for various anatomic reconstructions remains controversial, whether anatomic or nonanatomic or isometric or nonisometric. Levy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488866">24</xref></sup> demonstrated that reconstruction of the posterolateral structures is a more reliable option than repair alone in the setting of multiligament injuries. Arciero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488866">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513488866">5</xref></sup> reported that the anatomic single fibular sling method with concomitant cruciate ligament reconstruction could restore varus and rotational stability.</p>
<p>The current study was carried out with more patients and with a comprehensive approach to verify the effectiveness of restoring rotational and varus stability using the proposed method. The hypothesis was that the anatomic single fibular sling method would be sufficiently strong to control PLRI without an additional tibial sling.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546513488866" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital, and all patients provided informed consent. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 73 patients who underwent PLC reconstruction for PLRI by a single experienced surgeon (J.G.K.) between October 2005 and October 2008. The inclusion criteria included disruption of the PLC (diagnosed by physical examination, MRI, and arthroscopic findings), minimum follow-up period of 2 years, and primary PLC reconstruction using the anatomic single fibular sling method. Exclusion criteria included patients with prior PLC surgery, PLC reconstruction using other methods, an associated fracture in the same leg that could affect knee function, combined neurovascular injuries, multiple fractures due to severe trauma, and malalignment in lower extremities.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546513488866">
<title>Evaluation Method</title>
<p>Preoperative physical findings and intraoperative arthroscopic examinations were analyzed. A dial test under anesthesia (spinal or general), with the patient supine, was used as the standard test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488866">23</xref></sup> Two orthopaedic residents held each knee at 30° of flexion, and a senior surgeon applied external rotation with maximal manual force while an orthopaedic sports medicine fellow recorded the amount of external rotation of the tibial tubercle. This test was performed twice in turn. Measurements were taken with a goniometer after applying external rotation stress to the tibia. An assistant positioned the goniometer, and the examiner read the result with a minimum of 1° difference. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to differences in dial test results between involved and uninvolved knees: &lt;15° (group A), 15°-20° (group B), and &gt;20° (group C). Postoperative external rotation was assessed with the dial test and patients were grouped in the same manner, this time with patients awake. Intrarater and interrater reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).</p>
<p>Varus instability was assessed by varus stress test with a maximal manual force at 30° of knee flexion. While conducting the test, the examiner placed his finger directly over the joint line to evaluate the amount of lateral joint opening. This test was performed twice by a senior surgeon and an orthopaedic sports medicine fellow, and the patients were classified according to the guidelines for varus laxity (grade 1 = 0-5 mm, grade 2 = 5-10 mm, grade 3 = &gt;10 mm compared with the unaffected knee).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513488866">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488866">23</xref></sup> Varus stress was measured by varus stress (150-N force) radiography at full extension with a Telos device (Austin and Associates, Fallston, Maryland) in neutral rotation. Patients with concomitant PCL injury were assessed with a posterior stress radiograph, which was measured by the same stress forces (150-N force) and a Telos device at 90° of knee flexion in neutral rotation. These stress tests were performed in both involved and uninvolved knees. The lateral joint opening and posterior tibial displacement were measured according to previously published studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513488866">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513488866">20</xref></sup> Images were accessed through the picture archiving and communication system (Maroview version 5.4; MAROTECH Inc, Seoul, Korea). Measurements of the radiographs were carried out by 2 orthopaedic surgeons, and intrarater and interrater reliability was assessed using the ICC.</p>
<p>Functional and clinical outcomes were assessed by clinical examinations, Lysholm scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores, and stress radiographs.</p>

<sec id="section9-0363546513488866">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>We investigated arthroscopic findings, including popliteal hiatus widening, popliteomeniscal fascicle rupture, PF ligament injury, and abnormal popliteomeniscal motion, in the manner of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488866">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513488866">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513488866">33</xref></sup> After arthroscopic examination, a curvilinear skin incision was made in the lateral aspect of the knee, extending from the lateral femoral epicondyle to the anterior aspect of the fibular head. The incision was made between the retinaculum and iliotibial (IT) band, exposing the biceps tendon and PLC of the knee. The peroneal nerve was identified and retracted with the biceps tendon. The fibular collateral ligament, popliteal tendon, and PF ligament were identified. Two femoral tunnels were made just proximal to these anatomic locations. Two guide pins were placed just proximal to the lateral epicondyle and just distal to the palpating popliteal tendon, followed by the use of a 6-mm-diameter cannulated reamer with a 30-mm depth. The fibular head tunnel was directed from the anteroinferior superficial aspect to the posterosuperior deep location and was made 6 mm in diameter at the distal portion of the anatomic insertion site. A fresh-frozen tibialis anterior tendon allograft, irradiated with 1.5 to 2.0 Mrad, was prepared as graft material, and it had a diameter of 6 mm and length of 24 to 27 mm. An interlocking Krackow suture was passed through each end of the graft. One end of the prepared graft was then pulled into the femoral socket for the popliteus tendon and tensioned from the medial side of the knee by pulling on the passing suture. The graft was fixed to the femur using a 7-mm bioabsorbable screw (Linvatec, Largo, Florida). The free end of the graft was passed under the IT band and original LCL to the posterosuperior portion of the fibular head through the soft spot between the LCL and superior border of the biceps tendon. It was then pulled into the previously drilled 6-mm fibular tunnel. The graft was tensioned from the anteroinferior side of the fibular head by pulling on the passing suture, and it was fixed to the fibula using a 7-mm bioabsorbable screw. The free end of the graft was passed anteriorly under the IT band again, pulled into the other femoral socket for the LCL, tensioned, and fixed in the same manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513488866">Figure 1</xref>). In case of a popliteus tendon rupture, the femoral attachment of the popliteus tendon was exposed and repaired in a pull-out manner to the femoral socket of the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513488866">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Combined cruciate ligament ruptures were reconstructed concomitantly before PLC reconstruction. We performed single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a quadrupled semitendinosus tendon (ST) or quadrupled ST and gracilis tendon autograft. The femoral tunnel was made in the femoral notch positioned at 10 o’clock (right knee) or 2 o’clock (left knee) through a transtibial technique. We used the RIGIDFIX system (DePuy Mitek, Raynham, Massachusetts) for femoral fixation and bioabsorbable interference screw (Smith &amp; Nephew, London, United Kingdom) for tibial fixation. The PCL reconstruction was performed using the posterior transseptal portal approach for making a tibial tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513488866">1</xref></sup> The tibialis anterior tendon allograft is usually used as the graft source, and the femoral fixation was performed with the RIGIDFIX system, with tibial fixation using a bioabsorbable interference screw and staple.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513488866">
<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was dependent on the status of concomitant ligamentous reconstruction. After PCL reconstruction, the knee was protected with a brace for 12 weeks, with weightbearing allowed when tolerated using crutches. From 3 weeks after the operation, prone passive flexion exercise and supine passive range of motion (ROM) exercise with the support of both hands were performed to increase ROM at 3 or 4 days after surgery. However, when the ACL was reconstructed with PLC reconstruction, bracing was performed for 6 weeks, and passive ROM exercise with a continuous passive machine was started at 3 or 4 days postoperatively. Progressive ROM exercise was maintained for 3 to 6 weeks, aiming for 120° of flexion by week 3 for ACL reconstruction and 90° of flexion by week 3 for PCL reconstruction. Progressive closed kinetic chain strength training was performed, and full weightbearing was allowed 6 weeks after surgery. Light running was started at 12 weeks, and a return to sports activity was allowed from 6 months after surgery if the results of further evaluation, including activity level, were appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513488866">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software (version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Functional, clinical, and radiological outcomes were analyzed by comparing the preoperative and last follow-up evaluations using the paired <italic>t</italic> test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A search of our databases identified 73 knees in 73 patients who received PLC reconstruction with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Seven patients were excluded because they received PLC reconstruction using both tibial and fibular slings, and 7 patients with combined neurovascular injuries or multiple fractures due to severe trauma were also excluded. One patient with knee dislocation and neurovascular injury received PLC reconstruction using both a tibial and fibular sling. Thus, a total of 13 patients were excluded. The mean length of clinical follow-up was 35.6 months (range, 24-65 months). Of the 60 patients, 52 were men and 8 were women. The mean age at the time of surgery was 37.8 years (range, 18-57 years). Thirty-six cases were right-sided, and 24 cases were left-sided. The pull-out manner was used to repair complete popliteus tendon rupture in the femoral attachment in 5 patients. Fifty-four (90%) of the 60 cases had combined cruciate ligament injuries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513488866">Table 1</xref>). All 54 patients with combined cruciate ligaments underwent reconstruction. Twenty-two patients underwent partial meniscectomy, and 2 patients underwent meniscus repair. Among 4 patients with cartilage lesion, 3 underwent debridement, and the other patient had microfracture performed. Among the causes, motor vehicle accidents accounted for the largest proportion of injuries (30 cases, 50%), followed by sports activities (12 cases, 20%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513488866">Table 2</xref>). One patient exhibited common peroneal nerve palsy after trauma, which had recovered partially at the last follow-up. Reconstructions in all patients were performed a mean 105 days (range, 1-753 days) after injury. Only 3 patients could be evaluated within 3 weeks because almost all patients who came to our hospital, including those with injuries from motor vehicle accidents, received primary care from other hospitals.</p>

<p>External rotation was checked at the last follow-up. Of the 60 patients, 42 (70%) had no rotation. There were 16 patients (26.7%) in group A, none in group B, and 2 (3.3%) in group C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513488866">Table 3</xref>). The ICCs for intra- and interrater agreement ranged from 0.71 to .087. Two patients with combined PCL reconstruction had posterior drawer test results of &gt;10 mm and were in group C (&gt;20° dial test result). These patients had severe combined injuries with PCL rupture and associated extensive capsular tears. The varus laxity was improved; 96.7% were checked grade 0 or 1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513488866">Table 3</xref>). The mean side-to-side difference in varus stress radiographs was reduced from 2.32 ± 1.33 mm preoperatively to 0.37 ± 1.48 mm after reconstruction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513488866">Table 3</xref>). In patients with combined PCL injuries, posterior stress radiography showed a mean posterior tibial translation of 14.7 ± 2.83 mm preoperatively and 4.06 ± 1.40 mm at the last follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513488866">Table 3</xref>). The ICCs for intrarater and interrater agreement ranged from 0.91 to 0.93 and from 0.88 to 0.92, respectively. The mean Lysholm score was 52 ± 6.7 (range, 42-64) preoperatively and improved to 87.7 ± 12.3 (range, 61-100) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The mean IKDC subjective score was 44.8 ± 6.3 (range, 34.5-55.1) preoperatively and 77.6 ± 14.2 (range, 49.4-98.8) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was carried out to verify the effective restoration of external rotational and varus instability by anatomic reconstructions using the single fibular sling method with no tibial sling. Results of the current study support that the proposed technique effectively treated more PLRI patients compared with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488866">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488866">31</xref></sup> except for 2 failed cases associated with extensive posterolateral injuries.</p>
<p>Numerous techniques to repair, augment, or reconstruct the posterolateral structure have been suggested. Tenodesis of the biceps femoris using the Clancy method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488866">6</xref></sup> involves rerouting the biceps tendon via fixation to the lateral femoral condyle. This technique has been modified to use the middle one-third to one-half of the tendon to provide dynamic stabilization but does not address the role of the PF ligament or popliteus tendon and may overconstrain. The single tibial sling method, first proposed by Albright and Brown,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513488866">2</xref></sup> can restore posterolateral stability when the knee is extended but loosens during flexion and ineffectively limits external rotation. The single tibial sling technique might have some disadvantages, because it differs from the actual anatomy and lacks an isometric point. The short lever arm compared with a fibular sling would require additional reconstruction to replace the LCL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513488866">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513488866">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the anatomic and biomechanical evaluations of the PLC of the knee have evolved, many different kinds of anatomic reconstructions, including those of essential structures such as the LCL, PF ligament, and popliteus tendon, have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513488866">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513488866">35</xref></sup> These anatomic PLC reconstructions can be categorized into 2 main groups: single fibular slings and double (fibular and tibial) slings. These groups can be further divided into 2 subtypes according to the reconstruction technique: isometric or double anatomic femoral tunnel. The single fibular sling technique was based on an isometry study and was suggested by Fanelli and Larson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488866">10</xref></sup> Fanelli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488866">9</xref></sup> used 2-tailed (fibular head and proximal tibia) PLC reconstruction when the proximal tibiofibular joint was disrupted or hyperextension external rotation recurvatum deformity was present. LaPrade et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513488866">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513488866">22</xref></sup> reported the tibial-fibular double sling technique as an anatomic reconstruction method. However, this technique is not completely anatomic and requires an extensive lateral approach. Jung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513488866">16</xref></sup> recommended a more anatomic reconstruction that passes through the lateral tibial plateau and fibular head in severe cases, such as type C PLRI.</p>
<p>Some controversy exists about whether combined tibia- and fibula-based reconstruction or only a single fibular or tibial sling is sufficient for reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488866">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513488866">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513488866">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488866">30</xref></sup> LaPrade et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513488866">22</xref></sup> reported 3 or 4 types of tibial attachment for the popliteal tendon but found that most were not important for stability, and they failed to identify the most important attachment. In contrast, the double-bundle technique can cause overconstraint during external rotation due to reduced external rotational force in comparison with a normal knee at 90° of flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513488866">27</xref></sup> The popliteal tendon showed no strong attachment to the tibia, excepting some fibrous expansion of the capsule, suggesting that a tibial sling is unnecessary during posterolateral reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488866">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488866">10</xref></sup> Rauh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513488866">30</xref></sup> reported that single fibula-based and combined tibia- and fibula-based reconstruction techniques are equally effective for restoring stability following a simulated biomechanical injury. Yoon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513488866">36</xref></sup> also revealed that the anatomic single fibular technique presented similar results compared with additional popliteal reconstruction. Feeley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488866">11</xref></sup> reported that a double femoral tunnel with an oblique fibular tunnel reconstruction described by Arciero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488866">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488866">31</xref></sup> in an in vitro study best restored native knee kinematics to lateral structures. We have performed the anatomic single fibular sling technique, which was almost the same as that described by Arciero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488866">3</xref></sup> and driven by our anatomic dissection of PLC structures since 2003.</p>
<p>Before reconstruction, we carefully conducted physical and arthroscopic examinations of the PLC of the knee. Arthroscopic examination of the popliteal hiatus area to verify anatomic structures and injuries is very useful to determine whether to perform a pull-out repair of the proximal popliteal tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513488866">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513488866">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488866">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513488866">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513488866">33</xref></sup> The musculotendinous junction is usually involved in an injury to the popliteus; however, we identified proximal tendon ruptures in some cases. If the popliteus tendon can be repaired in a pull-out manner into the femoral socket combined with PLC reconstruction, an additional tibial sling is unnecessary. Although this single fibular sling method has a weakness in cases of popliteus rupture, after a careful arthroscopic evaluation and pull-out repair of the popliteal tendon, all 3 essential PLC components (PF ligament, LCL, and popliteus tendon) were reconstructed. In sum, the procedure is relatively simple and reproducible.</p>
<p>However, there were 2 cases of failed anatomic reconstruction by single fibular sling in this study. Even though the single fibular sling was effective in most patients with PLRI, combined tibia- and fibula-based reconstruction should be considered in severe posterolateral injuries including the PCL and posterolateral capsule.</p>
<p>Corten and Bellemans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513488866">8</xref></sup> reported that there were no significant differences in postoperative clinical outcomes in patients with different cruciate ligament injuries or meniscal injuries after PLC and concomitant cruciate ligament reconstructions. In our study, there were no statistically significant differences between isolated PLC and combined injuries with regard to clinical or stability results. However, the number of isolated repairs was relatively small, limiting the power of this comparison. The clinical knee scores might rely mainly on clinical results of cruciate ligament reconstruction as preoperative scores of the patients with multiple ligament injuries were low.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the cases in the current study were not strictly under the same conditions, as PLRI were nearly always associated with cruciate ligament injuries, as in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488866">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488866">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513488866">36</xref></sup> As isolated PLRI are rare in incidence, large-sized, well-organized, and prospective clinical studies on a homogeneous population of patients with injury are required. Second, the study was limited to the single sling method, with no comparison with the combined tibia- and fibula-based reconstruction or conventional biceps tenodesis. Third, it was impossible to compare acute with chronic conditions. There were only 3 patients who could be evaluated within 3 weeks, because almost all patients who came to our hospital, including those with injuries from motor vehicle accidents, received primary care from other hospitals. Finally, varus stress radiography was measured at full extension, although the LCL is the primary stabilizer at 30°, because we found it difficult to maintain the position of 30° of flexion reliably when using the Telos stress device. However, a 0.37-mm result, which would be considered as not measurable, was almost the same as the results of a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513488866">31</xref></sup> To overcome this limitation, we performed an additional varus stress test with a maximal manual force at 30° of knee flexion. We should try to evaluate at 30° in the future with more reliable stress device settings.</p>
