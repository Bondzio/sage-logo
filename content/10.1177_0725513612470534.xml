<abstract>
<p>One of the most striking features of the South African polity, as the 20th anniversary of democratization draws closer, is the intensity of public arguments about race that show no signs of abating any time soon. In the midst of worsening socio-economic inequality, it’s the economic question – of the terms of access to wealth, status and economic power, and of how to erase the residues of apartheid’s economic dispossession – that dominates these arguments. In recent years, the ANC Youth League – a renewal of the Youth League originally created in 1944 and then banned in 1960 – effectively positioned itself at the forefront of this politicization of race. I argue in this essay that from 1994 to early 2012, the contemporary Youth League retained its predecessor’s political persona of precocious provocateur, particularly on matters of race – but differently styled, and deployed to different political ends in the new conjuncture. The repertoire of the Youth League during this period was shaped by a clientelist politics, informed by a version of freedom as a freedom to consume, and the concomitant spectacles of conspicuous consumption that infused the iconography of the ‘new’ South Africa. These tendencies were most dramatically illustrated during Julius Malema’s controversial tenure as Youth League president. Largely disconnected from discursive, deliberative notions of the political, the Youth League’s version of politics became an amalgamation of angry street protest, patronage, and lavish partying, which produced a racialized iconography of being well-heeled and down-trodden in a seamless narrative of black solidarity.</p>

<p>One of the rousing rallying cries of the African National Congress (ANC) when unbanned in 1990 was its commitment to the project of a ‘non-racial’ democracy. Following the party’s euphoric election to power in the country’s first inclusively democratic election in 1994, a new constitution enshrined non-racialism as one of its founding values. Its pursuit was immediately paradoxical. The effort to transcend a politics of race would depend, in the first instance, on revitalizing the very racial categories that animated the apartheid project at the outset: only this time, as the basis for an ambitious project of racial redress. Predictably, therefore, ‘non-racialism’ has been accompanied by the re-politicization of race and the project of racial ‘transformation’. Indeed, one of the most striking features of the South African polity, as the 20th anniversary of democratization draws closer, is the intensity of public arguments about race that show no signs of abating any time soon. These arguments have been multi-faceted and somewhat fluid, shaped in part by political conflicts and realignments within the ruling party and its allies. This essay focuses on one strand of argument: one which came to the fore with growing vehemence, associated with the recent ascendancy of the ANC Youth League within the ANC and the polity at large.</p>
<p>As the perceived ‘miracle’ of the negotiated democratic transition receded, the discourse of human rights and a shared sense of place and time that marked ‘the Mandela moment’ (1994–8) lost some of its original traction. Versions of racial identity linked to aspirations to prosperity and upward mobility became more assertive, abrasive and divisive. It’s the economic question – of the terms of access to wealth, status and economic power, and how to erase the residues of apartheid’s racialized economic dispossession – that has come to dominate public argument about race in South Africa.</p>
<p>This is unsurprising, given the deepening economic inequality that has marked the post-1994 period. The transition from apartheid to a constitutional democracy ushered in hopeful expectations among the country’s black<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612470534">1</xref>
</sup> citizens – previously subject to regimes of racialized economic exclusion – of rising standards of living across the board. The reality, however, has been far more uneven. Although economists differ on the exact statistical measures, there is general agreement that South Africa’s Gini coefficient worsened between 1995 and 2008, from around 0.56 to 0.8, the worst in the world (among countries where such measures are taken) at that point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0725513612470534">Marais 2011</xref>: 208). The socio-economic spectrum has been marked at the top end by abiding (if increasingly uneven) white prosperity and wealth, along with an extraordinarily rapid growth of the (still relatively small) black upper and middle classes, producing a marked trend of accelerating inequality within the black population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470534">Seekings and Nattrass 2005</xref>). At the other end however, the vast majority of the population has remained trapped below the poverty line. While poverty measures are complex and somewhat controversial, the prevailing consensus is that poverty levels worsened between 1993 (the year in which the first national household income surveys were conducted) and 2000, and then began to improve modestly, following the expansion of government investment in social welfare grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513612470534">Posel and Rogan 2012</xref>: 98) With unemployment levels growing and in the midst of a debilitating HIV/AIDS epidemic that cut a swathe through the economically active population, it is social grants (pensions, disability, and child care grants) that have protected many households from outright destitution – so much so that according to one set of calculations, in 2008, the poorest decile in the country comprised a preponderance of young black males in small rural households without pensioners or children, and hence ineligible for two principal social grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612470534">Price 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Sadly, then, South Africa’s democratization to date has seen the highly unequal society bequeathed by apartheid become one of the most unequal societies on the planet. While relatively small – albeit growing – numbers of black people have become spectacularly rich, the new social order has delivered the majority of black South Africans, particularly young adults with little prospect of employment, a vexing mix of rising expectations and declining prospects. And this has created a fertile field for the growth of a racial populism focused on the continuing struggle for ‘economic liberation’. </p>
<p>To date, the constituency of this movement has included a mix of marginalized<sup>

</sup> and aspirantly upwardly mobile black youth<sup>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612470534">4</xref>
</sup> a renewal of the Youth League originally created in 1944 and then banned in 1960. I argue in this essay that the contemporary Youth League retained its predecessor’s political persona of precocious provocateur, particularly on matters of race – but differently styled, and deployed to different political ends in the new conjuncture. The repertoire of the Youth League post-apartheid has been shaped by a clientelist politics that articulates with a version of freedom as a freedom to consume, and the concomitant spectacles of conspicuous consumption that have infused the iconography of the ‘new’ South Africa. Indeed, if economically vulnerable black youth were prominent within the ranks of the supporters of the Youth League, its appeal capitalized on the newfound wealth and conspicuous consumption of its leadership and their <italic>nouveau riche</italic> social cohort, as evidence of the prosperity hankered for by the rank and file. This was a politics of emulation and aspiration closely intertwined with the performance of black ‘bling’. And it made for a re-racialization, if newly figured, of the political sphere. Largely disconnected from discursive, deliberative notions of the political, the Youth League’s version of politics became an amalgamation of angry street protest, patronage, and lavish partying, which produced a racialized iconography of being well-heeled and down-trodden in a seamless narrative of black solidarity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0725513612470534">
<title>The Youth League and the mobilization of black youth during the apartheid years</title>
<p>Black youth is not, and has never been, a homogeneous category in South Africa; nor has the ANC Youth League been the only movement created for and by black youth. But it has had a significant impact on the development of the ANC, and since 1994, has been the most influential and controversial locus of formal political organization among black youth, including at the poorer end of the socio-economic spectrum.</p>
<p>It was in the Youth League, founded in 1944, that the famed cohort of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo – who would all become powerful leaders of the ANC in later years – found their political feet. Under the founding presidency of Anton Lembede, the Youth Leaguers effectively challenged the leadership of the ANC to radicalize its project and modes of protest, in line with the grievances and interests of the masses. These young leaders were members of a relatively small cohort of mission- and university-educated black South Africans; but their political vision was of a struggle against white supremacy that galvanized mass support by acknowledging the hardships inflicted within the lives of black people across the board. Partly in response to these challenges, the ANC’s prevailing repertoire of written missives and small delegations to those in power gave way to mass meetings and protests, with a more militant sense of purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612470534">Lodge 1983</xref>: 21, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470534">Mandela 1995</xref>: 112).</p>
<p>The Youth League’s challenge to the ANC establishment was also ideological, as the Youth League became a sounding board within the ANC for vocal strains of ‘Africanism’ or ‘African nationalism’ (as the League put it) – a role that has since been memorialized and officialized in the ANC’s contemporary narrative of its political history.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513612470534">5</xref>
</sup> By 1948, the Youth League’s Basic Policy Document named African nationalism as its ideological centre-piece and organizing principle, positioning the Youth League as its vanguard within the ANC: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>From the very outset, the Congress Youth League set itself, inter alia, the historic task of imparting dynamic substance and matter to the organisational form of the ANC. This took the form of a forthright exposition of the National Liberatory outlook – African Nationalism – which the Youth League seeks to impose on the Mother Body. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 1948</xref>)</p>
<p>The only driving force that can give the black masses the self-confidence and dynamism to make a successful struggle is the creed of African Nationalism, which is professed by the Congress Youth League of South Africa. The Congress Youth League holds that the Africans are nationally oppressed, and that they can win their national freedom through a National Liberation Movement led by the Africans themselves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 1948</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In his autobiography, Nelson Mandela recounted the suspicions of the white left and the ANC’s close alliance with the Communist Party, that accompanied the Youth League’s Africanism: ‘wary of white influence in the ANC, we [in the Youth League] were concerned that the communists were intent on taking over our movement under the guise of joint action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470534">Mandela 1995</xref>: 123). </p>
<p>With the National Party’s accession to power in 1948 and an increasingly hostile terrain of political struggle, the ANC positioned itself at the helm of the Congress movement, along with the Transvaal and Natal Indian Congresses, and the Congress of Democrats (for whites). The racialized wariness did not abate – neither in the Youth League, nor the ANC and the Congress movement at large. It was partly an abiding ideological unease insinuated into the continuing tensions within the ANC’s relationship to the South African Communist Party (SACP),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0725513612470534">6</xref>
</sup> but it was perhaps more widely a product of the everyday intrusions of apartheid’s racial hierarchies into the powerful minutiae of political organization. As Raymond Suttner, long-standing member of the ANC, explained:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When white and black did work together in the Congress movement at various levels from the 1950s as part of distinct but allied organisations, racial and class dynamics were present. The skills and resources tended to reside primarily with whites and other communities. These were people who had cars and provided the lifts for people to attend and go home after meetings, or the individuals with money who could access funds and knew how to obtain professional assistance where that was required. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470534">2011</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With the banning of the ANC in 1960, the Youth League fell into abeyance. It would take over a decade before powerful stirrings of youthful activism recurred, initially within the Black Consciousness Movement and then more assertively with the Soweto uprisings in 1976. Triggered by the government instruction that Afrikaans should be the medium of instruction in black schools, the uprisings were an explosion of anger at the notorious system of Bantu education and its apartheid moorings. The mood and militancy of the times also reflected a youthful impatience with the perceived political passivity of their parents’ generation in opposing white supremacy – and the beginnings of what would become a more fully-fledged generational crisis in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Soweto protests spread to other parts of the country, bringing black youth onto the streets into often brutal confrontations with police. But, as Clive Glaser argues, this was youth struggle borne essentially of the classroom and the schooling experience, rather than of the street, which contributed a ‘more cerebral and disciplined form’ of protest than otherwise (2000: 185). This did not exclude recourse to violence, sometimes spectacularly so. As one of Glaser’s youthful informants put it, ‘we were wild’ – partly in response to provocations from street gangs whose interests were more criminal than political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0725513612470534">2000</xref>: 185).</p>
<p>In the 1980s, violent and defiant clashes with police on townships streets became the dominant mode of politics: this was a period marked by aspirations to render the townships ‘ungovernable’. With ‘educational issues linked more concretely to broader political objectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612470534">Bundy 1987</xref>: 329), the boundary between school and street became more blurred, and township school-goers were drawn into community protests and conflicts, mobilized under the rubric of the United Democratic front (UDF) and allied organizations, including COSAS (Congress of South African Students) and, later, SAYCO (South African Youth Congress). For many, this was at the cost of their education, and a break with the more ‘cerebral’ modes of politicking of the late 1970s. As the decade wore on, its political heat fanned by national states of emergency in 1985 and 1987, young activists were highly visible and vulnerable, manning barricades, in the front line of police fire and tear-gassing, at the forefront of rallies and marches. Theirs was a rhetoric of war, ‘a peoples’ war’. As Monique Marks observed,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>war and insurrection became the slogans of the day. Nicaragua, Cuba and Mozambique … came to be models of armed strategies for liberation. Youth were organized into youth congresses in large numbers under the slogan ‘Freedom or death: victory is certain’. (1992: 11)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The generational fractures overtly politicized during the 1976 uprisings grew deeper and more confrontational. Young activists provoked anger and controversy among the ranks of older township residents by convening so-called ‘peoples’ courts’, imposing harsh discipline on those suspected of political ‘disobedience’, including within their parents’ generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612470534">Marks 1992</xref>). Young ‘comrades’ were also implicated in the recourse to notoriously brutal political tactics, such as the necklacing<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0725513612470534">7</xref>
</sup> of alleged <italic>impimpis</italic> (spies). But, in the thick of the tear-gas, and at the frontline of police beatings and arrests that became daily routines in townships during the 1980s, the tenacious militancy of ‘the young lions’ signaled new orders of defiance and courage in confronting the apartheid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470534">Johnson 1988</xref>: 113).</p>
<p>These activists were predominantly male. While young women did take to the streets, leadership positions were largely the preserve of young men. And as the collisions with police grew more violent, the ideology and rhetoric of ‘the struggle’ confined young women more explicitly to the margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470534">Seekings 1991</xref>: 82–4). This was a politics of the street dominated by young men with a keenly masculinist sense of leadership and power. In a milieu of intense danger and insecurity, a macho bravado took centre-stage.</p>
<p>As the 1980s drew to a close, levels of political violence continued to escalate, with the UDF and its allies, aligned with the ANC, pitted against both the apartheid state and the ethnically constituted Inkatha, concentrated in Natal and with strongholds in migrant Zulu communities on the Witwatersrand. After the ANC was unbanned in 1990, the political violence ratcheted up to its highest levels yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612470534">Coleman 1988</xref>). It was with the prospect of democracy both immanent and precarious that the Youth League was resurrected, absorbing the ANC-aligned South African Youth Congress (SAYCO) within its ranks. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0725513612470534">
<title>The re-emergence of the Youth League post-apartheid</title>
<p>The new Youth League was a product of two strands in the genealogy of youthful activism prior to South Africa’s negotiated transition: on one hand, the role of ideological provocateur within the ANC establishment that marked the old Youth League, and on the other, the street-wise, macho and often violent bravado of township struggles that had dominated the politics of the 1980s. The new Youth League fused these together in ways that reconfigured the relationship between the League and the ANC, and spoke vocally to the post-apartheid politics of race and class.</p>
<p>The new Youth League immediately donned the mantle of defiant radicalism, in the ‘ungovernability’ mould. A blending of the discourses of youthful challenges to parental authority (of the ANC, in this case,) and ‘revolutionary’ activism suited the purpose well, and underpinned an inherently ambiguous relationship to the ANC. According to the Constitution of the Youth League, ‘the ANC Youth League shall function as an autonomous body within the overall structure of the ANC of which it shall be an integral part. It shall be based on the political and ideological objectives of the ANC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 2004</xref>). This was interpreted, according to the Youth League Induction Manual, as the basis of an ‘autonomous but not independent relationship between the ANC Youth League and the ANC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 2011b</xref>). The Manual’s version of the Youth League’s autonomy, however, more closely resembled a claim to independence.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Autonomy of the ANC Youth League is not a by the way issue [sic], but a revolutionary organisational practice which if ignored, could undermine the impetus and energy that young people should impact in any radical political, economic and social change of society … Autonomy of the Youth League should not just be reduced to organisational autonomy of organising meetings, but not taking decisions. It should fundamentally mean the right of the Youth League to formulate independent political, ideological and strategic perspectives in the cause of struggle and independent capacity and ability to robustly advocate for such perspectives. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 2011b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fuzzy, if not incoherent, boundaries between being ‘autonomous’ and ‘not independent’ were critical to the political and ideological role that the Youth League sought to play in the post-apartheid milieu. On the one hand, the degree of distance from the parent body allowed the Youth League to be deployed by the ANC to take political and ideological positions more stridently and provocatively than deemed appropriate within the ANC, or a contending faction thereof.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0725513612470534">8</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, the claim to autonomy also enabled the Youth League to defy its political parent, and constitute itself as a powerful political actor on its own terms – even if, in so doing, attracting the public wrath of all or some of the ANC elders. So the League functioned both to speak the otherwise unspeakable within the ANC (or parts thereof) with tacit approval of elders, <italic>and</italic> to speak back critically and defiantly to the ANC establishment.</p>
<p>This opened a space of ideological and political unruliness, sometimes transgression, within the ANC and the polity at large – including on matters of race. In the past, concerns about black ascendancy in the anti-apartheid struggle and expressions of racialized anger about the dynamics of the congress movement, were disciplined in the ANC under the rubric of ‘non-racialism’. But this neither resolved nor banished such issues. The renewal of the Youth League in the 1990s brought the question of black ‘ownership’ of the struggle and the tenacious residues of race in the post-apartheid order, onto the table more overtly and defiantly than elsewhere within the ANC – a comparable role to that of the original Youth League during the 1940s.</p>
<p>The tone was set by the first president, Peter Mokaba, who took office in 1990. His early political affiliations having been in the Black Consciousness Movement, Mokaba distanced himself from pro-Communist members and sympathies within the ANC, taking a stand ‘at the helm of the ANC’s “African Nationalist” tendency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470534">Lodge 2004</xref>: 200). As the ANC braced itself for tense and precarious negotiations with the National Party in the early 1990s, Mokaba kept a sense of black militancy alive and kicking. With calls to his young comrades to ‘roar, young lions roar’, Mokaba nurtured controversy by reviving an old struggle song, <italic>dubula ibhunu</italic> (shoot the boer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612470534">Brkic 2010</xref>). The occasion he chose was a memorial rally in 1993 for influential ANC leader Chris Hani (erstwhile Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC in exile and General Secretary of the Communist Party), following Hani’s murder by right-wing Afrikaner nationalists – an inflammatory act that threatened to subvert the fragile negotiation process and exacerbate political violence. Hani had commanded huge support among youthful supporters of the ANC, including within the Youth League (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470534">Glaser 2012</xref>: 105), so his assassination was a powerful rallying moment for black youth. The impact of the song – a defiant and deliberately provocative rejoinder to the white right wing – captured the emerging character of the new Youth League: militant black youth rediscovering their power to unsettle the political arrangements of their elders (in this instance, the concerted commitment to negotiations). With the song widely received within the white population as a racial slight, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and President Mandela intervened to set the negotiation process back on track, which included a stern rebuke to the Youth League from Mandela, for threatening the project of ‘national reconciliation’.</p>
<p>Other Youth League leaders have cut similarly unsettling figures,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0725513612470534">9</xref>
</sup> but none as daringly as Julius Malema, appointed Youth League president in 2008, with Peter Mokaba as his avowed role model. In conversation with journalist Fiona Forde, Malema expressed his liking for Mokaba’s ‘militancy, his defiance. Malema liked the fact that despite Mokaba's standing in the party, he was still a homeboy, a man of the people from Polokwane where he too was from. And he loved him for standing up to the whites’ (2011: 140). Like Mokaba, Malema enjoyed pushing the racial envelope, in ways that took the Youth League’s posture of unruly rebelliousness to a new extreme. With wry understatement, Malema put it thus: ‘we sometimes say things that old people are afraid to say’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470534">du Preez and Roussouw 2009</xref>: 75).</p>

The ensuing anger and alienation was fuel to Malema’s fire: his political rhetoric was saturated with invocations of ‘revolution’; young comrades were enjoined to be ‘radical’, ‘militant’ and ‘heroic’ in their preparedness to wage ‘war’ on the residues of the old apartheid order that had held them back and threatened to vanquish their hopes for a prosperous future. </p>
<p>While echoing the activist rallying cries of the 1980s, and replete with the machismo of the politics of ‘ungovernability’, Malema’s exhortations resounded within an increasingly fractious and ill-disciplined organizational milieu, partly within the ANC at large, but especially strikingly within the Youth League. Highly publicized League meetings, particularly if occasions for heated leadership battles or controversial debates about similar fights in the ANC, were notoriously reckless and disorganized, with brawls breaking out between opposing factions. The tone was set by the conference that installed Malema into the presidency: the first attempt to elect a new leadership had to be cancelled in the ensuing chaos. With Malema in charge, accusations of patronage and corruption against and within the organization abounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470534">Glaser 2012</xref>: 135–6). Contenders for leadership positions were accused of buying support; positioning themselves corruptly within wider power struggles in the ANC; giving jobs-for-pals, and in irregularly awarding and/or receiving tenders for lucrative business deals. Malema’s own income and lifestyle came under increasingly intense scrutiny, with accusations that his expensive predilections could not be sustained by the salary he was earning in his position as Youth League president. An investigation was launched to determine whether a corruption case would be initiated against him (with as yet no formal decision taken). </p>
<p>For all the sulphurous heat that enveloped the Youth League under Malema’s leadership, however, he manoeuvred the League into a position of significant political influence – as much in the polity at large as in the increasingly fractious parent party. Malema himself wielded considerable power within his home province of Limpopo – the province with the largest signed-up membership of the post-apartheid Youth League (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470534">Lodge 2004</xref>: 194). This afforded him some muscularity in deal-making within the wider ANC establishment and its internecine conflicts. In this, Malema was both patron and client. Early links with Mokaba and others within Limpopo’s political elite positioned him as the beneficiary of business deals that made him exceedingly wealthy in a short space of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470534">Glaser 2012</xref>: 136). His presidency of the Youth League enabled him in turn to become a political patron, disbursing his own largesse, creating networks of loyal clients, whose economic fortunes depended on their loyalties to him and the Youth League – in turn increasing Malema’s currency as a king-maker within the ANC.<sup>

</p>
<p>In a country in which more than two-thirds of the population is under the age of 35, the sheer demographic significance of the youthful vote within the ANC underwrote the Youth League’s political salience in the ‘parent’ party. Indeed, the League is likely to play a decisive role in determining the outcome of all forthcoming elections of ANC presidents, as it did in removing Thabo Mbeki from the presidency of the ANC at its national conference in Polokwane, 2007. And under Malema’s leadership, the Youth League magnified its visibility and impact as an audacious firebrand – fuelled as much by a milieu of heightened media attentiveness as by the unruly ruptures within the ANC after the Polokwane conference that ousted Mbeki as ANC president. During the apartheid years, regimes of censorship and suppression governed media coverage of anti-apartheid struggle; little was known about the ins and outs of ANC politics, its ideological battles, and the lives and loves of political leaders. Since 1994, the combination of a free press and the hyperbolic advance of new social media, nationally and globally, created a completely new stage for the scripting of political argument. In line with global cultures of debate, a cult of personality – with its <italic>frisson</italic> of scandal and controversy – set the terms. The Youth League’s bravado thrived within this milieu – and most hubristically, during Malema’s term as president. Charismatic and bold, Malema was masterful in commanding media attention, and rapidly became a media spectacle, guaranteed to make head-line news on national television and radio, an almost obsessively frequent topic of conversation in radio talk shows, magazine articles, and on the internet as the subject of countless blogs, videos, etc. And he loomed as large in conversations among those who disdained his politics as among his fans – a key element of his political power to shock and unsettle, and to set the terms of often vehement and anxious public argument.</p>
<p>The loudest explosions were detonated by Malema’s rhetoric of ‘economic war’ in defence of the black poor, on one hand, and the flamboyant performances of consumerist excess within the leadership of the Youth League on the other – and in particular, by the question of how to reconcile the two.</p>
<p>Not a man for careful reasoning or systematic policy debate, Malema’s version of how and why to wage ‘economic war’ was emotive and performative: in the main, strategically choreographed as episodes of angry confrontation on two fronts, skillfully selected as the two most painfully raw nerves in the post-apartheid body. The first was the distribution of land – an abidingly politicized issue, given the devastating legacies of black dispossession in the aftermath of the 1913 Natives Land Act, and with which the post-apartheid state has been slow to deal. Wholly at odds with ANC policy, Malema brazenly called for land grabs on the part of the poor, with clear echoes of Zimbabwe’s Zanu PF. Indeed, Malema made sure that a visit to Robert Mugabe, whom he embraced as a political mentor, made the headlines, knowing that this was guaranteed to produce a volcanic reaction within the polity. The second was a call for nationalization of the country’s mines – symbol <italic>par excellence</italic> of the exploitation of black labour upon which the citadel of white prosperity had been built. Once again, this was an overt challenge to the ANC establishment that had explicitly rejected the idea. And Malema’s intervention was also the lightning rod of intense public argument, not least within the mining sector, but also more widely among businesspeople and others anxious to sustain the country’s appeal among foreign investors.</p>
<p>The call for nationalization, in particular, produced strategic convergences at certain moments between the Youth League and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), lubricated by an intermittently shared language of class antagonism, working-class revolution, and bourgeois exploitation – including the Youth League’s rendition of itself as ‘the vanguard of the working class in the struggles for total social, political and economic emancipation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 2011a</xref>). But in the main, this was a mirage. Arguably, Malema’s political capital and rhetorical currency was primarily, if not entirely, a discourse of race, rather than class, in a politics of racial solidarity. And it was both a symptom, and a contributing cause, of the extent to which the terms of political contestation were still locked within apartheid’s racial schema.</p>
<p>In Malema’s version of the country’s ills, the ‘counter-revolutionary’ forces that have waylaid ‘economic liberation’ were racially constituted: the enemy was white capital, rather than capital in some generic, non-racial sense. In May 2011, Malema addressed a crowd of Youth League supporters in an informal settlement promising to expropriate land from whites without compensation, ‘to ease the government's burden of providing millions of South Africans with houses nearer their places of work’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470534">Molatlhwa 2011</xref>).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We need fearless leaders who will tell these whites that we are putting our people here for free. We have to buy land from whites when they did not even buy land from us. This is confirmation that we must get the land for free. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470534">Molatlhwa 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A few months later, in September, Malema engaged a large crowd gathered to mark the Youth League’s 67th anniversary in September 2011, with a declaration of ‘economic war’ against the ‘white minority’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612470534">Bosch 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Malema’s calls to seize control of the mines, as icons of the shimmering wealth that black toil and suffering have produced for whites, resonated as a story of the tenacity of white deceit and manipulation beyond the demise of apartheid. As Jonny Steinberg recounted after conversations about Malema with people in rural Transkei, ‘the idea that real power was not transferred to the people in 1994, that the privileged locked it up or hid it away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513612470534">2011</xref>), makes existential sense to people for whom poverty looks set to stay.</p>
<p>The racial face of the enemy was clearest when he was also the object of an angry envy, in a rhetoric of racial emulation. Addressing a crowd of ‘economic freedom marchers’ journeying from Johannesburg to Pretoria, Malema was bluntly to the point:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When they ask you why you are marching, you must say you are marching because you want to be like whites. Everything whites have, we also want it. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612470534">Mngxitama 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>And in explaining the rationale for land grabs, Malema was similarly explicit:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We must restore our dignity. We must have everything that white people have. Everything they have in town we want the same where we stay, better services. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470534">Mabuza and Sapa 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Nor was Malema shy to resort to overt racial aggression – most notoriously, during an abrasive encounter with BBC journalist Jonah Fisher, whom Malema banished from a press conference with a tirade of racialized invective. Challenged by Fisher for the opulence with which he conducted himself as a ‘revolutionary’ leader, Malema responded furiously:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This is not a newsroom, this. This is a revolutionary house. And you don’t come here with that tendency … Don’t come here with that white tendency … If you’ve got a tendency of undermining blacks even where you work, you are in a wrong place. … Get out! (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470534">Forde 2011</xref>: 190)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Turning the economic war into an onslaught on<italic> white</italic> wealth was the ideological crucible that coupled conspicuous consumption on the part of the Youth League leadership with a commitment to the cause of the largely impoverished rank and file – the hallmark of the Youth League’s racial populism.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea that being stylishly in the public eye has political currency was not new, nor unique to this country. But the centrality and intensity of consumerist codes of youthful status and power in the Youth League in contemporary South Africa was unprecedented in its history. So much so that it likely struck a dissonant chord with other youth movements invoking radical causes elsewhere in the world. When journalist Fiona Forde travelled to Caracas to cover the Youth League’s participation in the World Federation of Democratic Youth conference in 2010, she observed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Venezuela has never seen so many designer labels as it has these past 48 hours since the arrival of the South African young ones. … They descended on the city with their expensive suitcases and travel bags, top-of-the-range baseball caps, flashy T-shirts, snazzy shoes and sneakers, sleek man-bags and a string of other expensive accessories hanging out of them – and a bodyguard in tow – all dressed up for a socialist youth conference. I have been wondering how they must appear in the eyes of the other youth who have flown in from all over the world … casually dressed. (2011: 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the accusation by critics of the Youth League that these <italic>nouveau riche</italic> seductions contradicted the alleged commitment to the interests of the black poor were frequent and pointed. But the Youth League’s narrative of economic liberation made place for a well-heeled black vanguard. According to Malema, ‘we are the elite that has been deliberately produced by the ANC as part of its policy to close the gap between whites and blacks in this country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470534">du Preez and Roussouw 2009</xref>: 23). The unbridled performance of prosperity became a strategy of racial bravado in and of itself – evidence of a successful onslaught on the bastions of white economic supremacy. In Malema’s words, responding to critics of the Youth League’s conspicuous consumption:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If we are going to refuse the youth [of the Youth League] to drive these [fancy] cars, it means they are only good for white youth. Ours will never drive those cars. So we must sit and appreciate the good things by whites and not by one of our own. That’s what we are trying to break. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470534">du Preez and Roussouw 2009</xref>: 23)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For the League’s supporters, then, there was a seamless connection – be it ideological or tactical – between an affluent leadership and an economically marginalized rank and file, undergirded by the deployment of a politics of racial solidarity. Thus, Malema made no effort to conceal the <italic>accoutrement</italic> of newfound affluence – as in the large and conspicuously expensive wristwatch that he regularly sported, along with his luxury cars and designer clothing. And, as his comment above suggests, political lobbying – including visits to informal settlements – could comfortably encompass spectacles of plenty on the part of well-heeled Youth League office bearers ferried in luxury cars.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0725513612470534">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nor did Malema make any secret of his close and lucrative friendships with prominent members of the new black elite – including the likes of Kenny Kunene, controversial media-savvy entrepreneur with a taste for provocative spectacles of extravagant consumption, and a vocal supporter of the Youth League. Kunene’s and Malema’s bravado sometimes took them a tad too far – as in the notorious case of Kunene’s birthday celebration staged as a ‘naked sushi’ party, with guests (including Malema) encouraged to eat their sushi off the near naked, and mostly white, bodies of female ‘plates’. A predictable media sensation ensued, setting tongues wagging across the country. Malema initially waded in to defend Kunene, but had to retreat after the ANC declared the occasion ‘unrevolutionary’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0725513612470534">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Such occasions of hubristic consumerism constituted a particularly tasteless excess; but arguably they also served to expose the racial – and often racist – underpinnings of public distaste. While Kunene’s birthday bash in Cape Town hit the national news, an upmarket strip club nearby that had been serving ‘naked sushi’ for several weeks attracted no public censure at all – in part, for lack of the kind of publicity sought by Kunene, but also symptomatic, perhaps, of a long history of white discomfort with black extravagance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0725513612470534">Posel 2010</xref>). Some bloggers party to the various fracas on the subject of conspicuous consumption within the new black elite rightly pointed out that white elites spending comparable orders of money, or decked out in similarly expensive designer gear, ensconced in vast mansions, did not attract the intense declamations triggered by their black counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612470534">Plantive 2011</xref>) – a reminder of the residual power of apartheid habits of thought and judgement. It was apartheid’s exercise in ‘the governance of the consuming passions’ (to use Alan Hunt’s phrase) that politicized performances of affluence and status among black people as unpalatable gestures of racial proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0725513612470534">Posel 2010</xref>). With all its unseemly excesses, Malema’s consumerist bravado struck resoundingly at that chord, as a discomfiting exercise in racial emulation.</p>
<p>One of the manifest differences between performances of black and white affluence was the extent to which the former have occurred within the gaze of the poor. Unlike wealthy whites whose social circles are more likely to be homogenously affluent, the social milieu of the black nouveau riche often straddles township and suburb: owners of expensive homes in predominantly white suburbs partying in black townships, visiting friends and family there over weekends. So too with the well-heeled Youth League elite: given the extraordinary rapidity with which their wealth has been accumulated, their social and family life may remain strongly tied to modest homes in the townships or rural villages – which may then become the beneficiaries of the newfound wealth. Malema, for example, retained ties with his grandmother in the rural village in which he was raised, built her a house, and contributed to the schooling of children in the village.</p>
<p>For his supporters in the Youth League, therefore, Malema’s ascent to affluence arguably established, rather than undermined, his credentials, to represent the interests of the poor: son of a humble domestic worker, ill-educated, radicalized at a young age, militant activist in the anti-apartheid cause, ‘child’ of the ANC, who rose in the ranks of the struggle to a life of riches and power, living in the previously forbidden affluent white suburbs, but never forgetting his roots, remaining an ‘ordinary’ person who moved between the townships and suburban <italic>nouveau riche</italic> with ease. This was a narrative of a seamless connection between being poor and rich: the poor can become rich, the rich were once poor, and each never loses the affinity with the other. And it is the shared experience of growing up black that sews it together. This is a version of black upward mobility depleted of any of the angry rhetoric of ‘economic war’ between a<italic> black</italic> bourgeoisie and working class. The analytic of class therefore loses any real traction, receding rapidly behind the more prominent and powerful lens on the economic problem as a racial one. Black enrichment is then depicted as a project of accomplishment rather than exploitation, performing what is racially possible and the subversiveness thereof within the post-apartheid residues of racialized subjection.</p>
<p>The discourse of racial solidarity also found expression in, and was actively nurtured by, the crossovers between the Youth League’s spaces of politics and entertainment. From around 2000 – but more forcefully since Zuma’s accession to the presidency in 2007 – the ANC establishment sought to play an active role in wooing young voters into a ‘cool’ version of ANC, as a party to which they would relate as ‘born frees’. The first moves in this direction were modest. In a discussion document prepared for the Youth League’s 21st national conference in 2000, repeated reference was made to the need for the Youth League to harness ‘youth popular culture’. The League’s vision, it said,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>should become part of the very fabric of South African youth culture. It must strive to get its slogans … accepted as part of popular youth culture [and] actively engage in and with popular youth culture in all its manifestations and at all levels. … The League must also engage with new developments in marketing and public relations to get its message across and reach out to youth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470534">ANC Youth League 2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ANC agreed, and in 2002, at the Youth League’s behest, the government Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology convened a meeting between former President Mandela, some of the country’s leading <italic>kwaito</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0725513612470534">15</xref>
</sup>musicians, and the Youth League. Recognizing the popularity of <italic>kwaito</italic> among black youth, and therefore its power to mobilize support for the ANC and the Youth League, the Ministry promised to support and promote <italic>kwaito</italic> as ‘our first post-colonial music genre’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612470534">Nkwanyane and Motaung 2002</xref>), while Mandela urged the League to exploit the crossovers between political and cultural spaces: ‘artists are able to reach the millions politicians can’t reach’, he said, particularly in the case of the youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612470534">Nkwanyane and Motaung 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Zuma’s accession to the presidency, the boundaries between politics and entertainment were more actively and assertively blurred, as much by Zuma’s regime as by the Youth League. Having recognized his debt to the Youth League as crucial contributors to his triumph over Mbeki for the leadership of the ANC in 2007, Zuma had to find ways of courting continuing support among youth, and deploying youthful predilections for music, dancing and partying were critical to these endeavours. In 2011, the ANC leadership commissioned a ‘voter’s album’ with cuts from leading <italic>kwaito</italic> and other artists popular in black circles, especially the youth. The inner sleeve of the cover contained a message from President Zuma, to ‘jive to the African National Congress beat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470534">Ndlovo 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The Youth League took its own initiatives in a similar vein. Malema commissioned a local DJ to produce a musical track on ‘nationalization’, in the form of a ‘traditional gospel-sounding song’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612470534">MTV Meets n.d.</xref>), and ‘gave permission’ to a popular <italic>kwaito</italic> musician to release a praise song, ‘<italic>gcwala ngoJulius’</italic> (‘I’m crazy about Julius’). There have been at least two musical remixes of Malema’s skirmish with Jonah Fisher, profiling Malema’s rebuke, ‘don’t come here with that white tendency’, celebrating his bravado.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0725513612470534">16</xref>
</sup> And many musicians popular with black youth openly declared their allegiances to the Youth League. At the 17th annual South African Music Awards in 2011, for example, ‘musicians, namely Kwela Tebza and dj Cleo [were] chanting “Viva ANC Youth League” and asking “what would elections be without the ANC?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513612470534">Sibeko 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with the music, partying became a political tool for Malema’s Youth League and Zuma’s ANC. ‘Big bashes’, called and funded by the ANC, the Youth League, and/or by Malema personally, were regular features of the social calendar of politically connected black youth. With transport provided for invited guests – or for the masses, if the party was more open – such parties brought young people, almost all of them black, from various strata and locations into contact with the black <italic>nouveau riche</italic>. Often with expensive alcohol flowing lavishly and on the house, and black social celebrities in attendance along with political high-flyers, these occasions enacted party politics as sophisticated entertainment. Debts to, and acknowledgement of, the ANC or Youth League as sponsors of the fun may have been said or unsaid, but the connection was clear. According to sociologist Zethu Matebeni, who attended one of the ANC’s pre-election parties in 2010, the large numbers of assembled guests were ‘singing ANC songs with a hip-hop twist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470534">Posel 2011</xref>), and wearing T-shirts given to them on arrival printed with Zuma’s face. Zuma too came to the party, sang the songs and danced with the crowds. ‘You couldn’t tell what it was: was it a party? A political thing? It was having fun through politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470534">Posel 2011</xref>). </p>
<p>More than merely factionalized electioneering, these events also scripted a deeper affirmation of the ANC at large, and its role as the country’s liberator during ‘the struggle’ – linked to emotive evocations of a shared black history and identity. Almost all those attending the Youth League’s parties were black; as Matebeni puts it, ‘it goes without saying’. And included in the musical menu were iconic struggle songs that spoke to a shared black struggle against an experience of oppression that whites were spared. In Matebeni’s words, ‘you’re made aware of where you come from, and what you owe to the struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470534">Posel 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While memorializing this sense of a shared and binding past, the parties were equally focused on the present and its opportunities for upward mobility. With social and political celebrities in attendance, fashionably and extravagantly geared up, these occasions demonstrated the upward gradient of the struggle: the distance covered and the destinations reached. ‘It’s a story that ‘we’ve come from poverty, places of misery and oppression, and look where we are now: we’ve made it, but we still remember where we came from’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470534">Posel 2011</xref>). For the less well-heeled youthful party-goers who looked in on the consumerist spectacle from an envious margin, the aspiration to, and association with, this version of the good life remained connected to what ‘the struggle’ – and therefore the ANC – had delivered.</p>
<p>In February <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470534">2012</xref>, Julius Malema was suspended from the leadership of the Youth League, and subsequently expelled, on grounds of having brought the ANC into disrepute. The ANC also declared its intention to rein in the Youth League, disciplining its claims to autonomy. Malema’s political future and the impact of his expulsion on the Youth League are imponderable at this point; at the time of writing, it is clear that Malema’s expulsion has divided the League, with a strong contingent of Malema supporters adamantly insistent on the League’s autonomy in relation to the ANC, while others have submitted to the ANC’s call for greater ideological and political discipline. It’s unclear at this stage how these differences will resolve. As for Malema, his removal from office meant that he lost the accoutrements of his role as a political patron, having no tenders and other gifts emanating from his presidency of the Youth League, to disburse – at least for now. A strategic opportunist, his political rhetoric is already adapting to the political logic of the moment – including pot shots at the black capitalist elite too.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0725513612470534">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What Malema’s tenure as Youth League president demonstrated was the political traction of a version of ‘economic liberation’ that simultaneously exposed and reproduced some of the starkest limitations of South Africa’s transition to date – notably, the extent to which the commitment to democratic freedoms has worsened, rather than eased, the debilitating economic inequalities bequeathed by apartheid. From the early 1990s, a version of Mandela’s biography – from proudly militant leader of the struggle to wise, skilful and principled statesman holding out the olive branch to the enemy and embracing a future of human rights for all – was carefully crafted by the ANC as a symbolic narration of South Africa’s liberation. A little under two decades later, a version of Malema’s biography offered a different narrative of freedom, one that may well continue to resonate more powerfully than Mandela’s among those for whom the human rights project has been a disappointment: as a rags-to-riches story of a black man born on the margins who rose to political prominence and wealth with transgressive bravado, unafraid to ‘take on the white man’, but one who never forgot his roots among ordinary and humble people. </p>
<p>For disaffected youth in particular, ‘never forget where you came from as you aspire to leave it behind’ can provide the script for an identity politics that has also been written at the intersection of politics and youthful popular culture, with more global resonances and energies. It’s one in which the realities of emerging class differences within the country’s black population can recede, smoothed out in a politics of defiant emulation and envious aspiration: if black leaders can wrest what was previously the monopoly of white people, then so can the rank and file. It becomes a matter of what blackness can do.</p>
<p>In a country with a past as saturated with race as South Africa’s, and with a present in which blackness continues to define a condition of marginality for the large majority of the population, the abiding power of racial interpellations should come as no surprise. After all, it’s undeniable that ‘the economic question’ that confronts the polity now, with mounting urgency, is moored in a system that deployed its racist apparatuses to buttress a white monopoly of economic prosperity. And since the formal demise of apartheid in 1994, wealth in South Africa has remained disproportionately concentrated in white hands. Yet, if the politics of the Youth League in post-apartheid South Africa galvanized the indubitable power of racial interpellation, it also demonstrated its vacuity in producing any serious or effective solution to the deepening economic divides. As an analysis of the country’s ills and plausible basis of policy-making and intervention, the Malema narrative was dangerously inadequate. Like all populist rhetoric, it ‘thrives’, as Jean Comaroff puts it, on ‘radical reductionism’ that erases the ‘complex collaborations and contradictions that shape the totality of which all are part’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470534">2011</xref>: 104–5). It also nurtured an identity politics locked inescapably into the apartheid universe of thought and judgement, exhibiting the dualism of emulation and subversion that post-colonial theorists exposed as one of the hallmarks of the colonial predicament. On one hand, the covetous imperative of Malema’s declaration – to ‘have everything that white people have’ – reproduces the logic of white supremacy and its civilizing mission, which assigns whiteness to the apex of virtue, status and superiority, making whiteness the object of envy and aspiration. On the other, this complicity with the terms of a long-standing racist hierarchy simultaneously subverts it, in the reversal of white ascendancy. To take from whites becomes an incontrovertible sign of superior power. The greater the lingering traction of apartheid’s racial schema and the spectral residues of the hierarchies of worth that undergirded it, the more powerfully transgressive the meanings of black wealth. But overall, it is surely an identity politics in the thrall of the past: the fantasy of white dispossession reinstates the power of the apartheid racial hierarchy as the basis of the possibility of vanquishing it.</p>

<label>1.</label>
<p>I’m using the term ‘black’ here to encompass the three racial categories used by the apartheid state to designate ‘non-whites’ – i.e. coloured, Indians and Africans. Given the country’s demography, with Africans constituting nearly 80 per cent of the population, Africans constitute the large majority of the poor – but there are also legacies of apartheid’s economic exploitation among coloureds and Indians, who have benefitted far less – in some cases not at all – from policies of black economic empowerment post-1994.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0725513612470534">
<label>2.</label>
<p>The Youth League’s constituency is not wholly homogeneous, but includes many from the ranks of the unemployed, poor and poorly educated who live in urban or peri-urban townships and shanty-towns, as well as rural villages and small towns.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0725513612470534">
<label>3.</label>
<p>The political definition of youth is typically expansive. The Youth League defines the category as spanning 16 to 35 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470534">Lodge 2004</xref>: 191).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0725513612470534">
<label>4.</label>
<p>I don’t wish to suggest that the Youth League is the only political mouthpiece for black youth on the margins; there are a number of NGOs and social movements with the same constituency that disdain the strategies and ambitions of the Youth League, and position themselves within a social justice ethos and discourse.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0725513612470534">
<label>5.</label>
<p>‘Its [the Youth League’s] essence [‘Africanism’] is to be found in the formulation: “We believe that the national liberation of Africans will be achieved by Africans themselves”. This sounds almost literally like the philosophy of the present-day “Black Consciousness” in South Africa which states: “Black Man! You are on your own!”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470534">ANC 2012</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0725513612470534">
<label>6.</label>
<p>Interviewed recently by journalist Fiona Forde, Ronnie Kasrils, long-standing member of both the Communist Party and the ANC in exile, remarked that ‘those suspicions about Mandela the nationalist, who was anti-communist, you know, they never really went away. And if you talk about Mandela the legacy, you know you are talking about Mandela as essentially a black nationalist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470534">Forde 2011</xref>: 113).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0725513612470534">
<label>7.</label>
<p>The practice of necklacing involved setting a person alight by burning petrol poured onto a rubber tyre placed around his or her neck.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0725513612470534">
<label>8.</label>
<p>This role of the Youth League was especially striking as an element of Zuma’s accession to the presidency of the ANC in 2007, and in its aftermath of internecine conflict within the party.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0725513612470534">
<label>9.</label>
<p>According to David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513612470534">Mohale (2011)</xref>, Youth League member from the Free State, ‘Mandela had to give serial lectures to youth league presidents Peter Mokaba and Lulu Johnson on the tactical mistakes they made and how these mistakes cost the ANC’.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0725513612470534">
<label>10.</label>
<p>It is necessary to distinguish between the Youth League’s formally documented membership, and supporters who turned up to various events organized by the League. The former is mercurial and difficult to quantify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470534">Forde 2011</xref>: 178; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470534">Lodge 2004</xref>); the latter is by definition somewhat unpredictable and situational. These elements of indeterminacy are inevitable, given the absence of robust data to measure the Youth League’s constituency more fully.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0725513612470534">
<label>11.</label>
<p>The term has become a colloquialism for black South Africans born after the demise of apartheid in 1994.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0725513612470534">

<p>For more detailed discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470534">Forde (2011</xref>: chs 10, 11).</p>

<p>Referring to such occasions, an article in the <italic>Mail &amp; Guardian</italic> noted ‘ordinary people say, “what’s wrong with Juju [as Malema is popularly known] making money?”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612470534">Malala 2011</xref>).</p>

<label>15.</label>
<p>Originating in the late 1980s, <italic>kwaito</italic> is a musical form that became extremely popular among black South African youth after 1994. The extent to which <italic>kwaito</italic> lyrics embrace modes of political commentary is the subject of some debate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612470534">Coplan 2005</xref>); I am more interested here in the direct and explicit harnessing of <italic>kwaito</italic> singers and performances by the ANC to its causes.</p>

<p>In August 2012, Malema again hit the headlines, in rallying support for the miners at the Lonmin mines, following a massacre of miners on a wild-cat strike by police. With his personal and political situation having shifted in the midst of an intensely divisive leadership struggle within the ANC, Malema’s rhetoric reiterated the familiar theme of ‘economic war’, but now with a version of the enemy that seems to include the likes of Patrice Motsepe and other black billionaires. At the time of writing, it’s not clear how sustained or influential this critique will be.</p>
