<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the infant bed-sharing practices of mothers from the birth of the infant to three months of age. The study was a longitudinal descriptive design using a self-report instrument immediately after delivery with follow-up phone interviews at one and three months after discharge. While no mothers intended to bed-share with their infants immediately after delivery, 60 percent reported bed-sharing at some time at one month after discharge and 9 percent at three months. Only 19 percent of mothers reported receiving information about infant sleeping practices from their physician and 22 percent from their nurse. One month post discharge was identified as a high-risk period for infant bed-sharing. Interventions aimed at teaching new mothers about responding to infant cues and ways to manage a fussy infant may minimize the rate of bed-sharing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of deaths in infants from one to 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511432300">CDC, 2011</xref>). An associated causal factor of SIDS that has been reported in literature is infant bed-sharing. A significant number of infant deaths due to SIDS and bed-sharing were noted in a southeastern Pennsylvania county. To address this, a group of clinicians from a community medical center and researchers from a local university came together to study the attitudes and bed-sharing practices of mothers of infants from birth to three months of age. The ultimate goal was to use this descriptive data to design an intervention to reduce the incidence of unsafe bed-sharing practices in the county.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367493511432300">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Healthcare providers have remained divided about whether infant bed-sharing and/or co-sleeping is an acceptable family choice or a dangerous practice putting the infant at risk for SIDS. Some of this controversy exists because a lack of conceptual agreement about the definitions of bed-sharing and co-sleeping. The practice of bed-sharing has been defined as a mother or care provider and infant sleeping in same bed, while co-sleeping has been defined as infant and mother or care provider sharing the same room but different sleep surfaces. This distinction is important; however, many studies vary in their definition of these terms, affecting the interpretation of research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511432300">McKenna and McDade, 2005</xref>). The literature review that follows reflects the terms used by the authors of the reported studies; however the use of these terms does not necessarily reflect these definitions.</p>
<sec id="section3-1367493511432300">
<title>Benefits of bed-sharing/co-sleeping</title>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated both the physical and psychological benefits of bed-sharing, particularly for the breastfed infant (Ball, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511432300">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511432300">McKenna et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511432300">Ball (2003</xref>) found that 65 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 80) of their sample that ever breastfed reported sleeping with their infant at least occasionally, compared with 33 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 43) who never breastfed. At one month of age, 72 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 81) of breastfed infants in her study were found to be involved in some bed-sharing, compared to 38 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 54) of infants who were not breastfed. Atech and Hamelin (2008) similarly found that the women in their study who breastfed were more than twice as likely to share a bed with their infant compared to women who bottle-fed.</p>
<p>Breastfed infants who co-sleep are more likely to sleep supine and suckle frequently causing decreased deep sleep and an increased frequency of arousals for feeds. This may contribute to the establishment of a good milk supply for mothers and a decreased risk of SIDS for these infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511432300">McVea et al., 2000</xref>). In a review of the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al. (2007)</xref> reported on three studies which found an increased number of awakenings for those infants who were co-sleeping. The results of two of these studies, however, showed that these awakenings were for shorter periods than those who were not co-sleeping, and therefore allowed for more sleep for care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An increase in breastfeeding duration was also found among infants who shared a bed with their mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>). The causal relationship, however, is unclear (bed-sharing improving breastfeeding duration or breastfeeding increasing the likelihood of bed-sharing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511432300">Ball (2003</xref>) found a significant increase in breastfeeding duration in infants who were bed-sharing at one month of age.</p>
<p>The maternal benefits of co-sleeping include maternal bonding and an increase in maternal sleep. A positive association between maternal–infant bonding and bed-sharing has also been widely discussed in the literature, although not studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>). A positive association between the number of hours of maternal sleep in breastfeeding mothers and co-sleeping was found in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511432300">Quillin and Glenn (2004)</xref>. The breastfeeding mothers in their study who co-slept with their infant for any part of the night got more sleep than those who did not co-sleep. This relationship was not found with bottle-feeding mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367493511432300">
<title>Negative effects of bed-sharing/co-sleeping</title>
<p>Bed-sharing has been suggested in the literature to increase the infant risk for SIDS due to the risks of overlaying or entrapment, wedging, falling or strangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511432300">Mesich, 2005</xref>). Studies have found an increased number of reported infant deaths when sleeping on a surface other than one designed for infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511432300">Scheers et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511432300">Nakamura, Wind and Danello (1999</xref>) found that 23 percent of 515 infant deaths studied over a seven-year period were a result of overlaying and 77 percent were due to entrapment. Other studies have supported these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511432300">Collins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511432300">Drago and Dannenberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511432300">Kemp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511432300">Person et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511432300">Thogmartin et al., 2001</xref>). In a retrospective review of SIDS cases in New Jersey (1996–2000), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511432300">Ostfeld et al. (2006</xref>) found that bed-sharing was reported in 39 percent of SIDS cases studied. Contributing risk factors associated with bed-sharing included bedding, environmental, and positioning risks.</p>
<p>The age of the infant (younger than 11–16 weeks of age) and the fact that they were bed-sharing was also found to increase the risk of SIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511432300">Tappin et al., 2005</xref>). Bed-sharing during this time may be due to the exhaustion of parents experiencing frequent night awakenings and feedings along with recovery post delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511432300">Carroll-Pankhurst and Mortimer (2001)</xref> found in their sample of 84 infant deaths due to SIDS in Ohio, that a younger age at death for these infants was significantly associated with bed-sharing (<italic>p</italic> = .044). This was particularly significant if the mother was large (&gt; 79.5 kg) (<italic>p</italic> = .01).</p>
<p>Ateah and Hamelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511432300">2008</xref>) reported that 72.4 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 293) of the respondents in their study admitted bed-sharing on either a regular or occasional basis. Eighty-eight percent of the sample stated that they knew that there were some risks associated with bed-sharing. Thirteen percent of those who shared a bed with their infant reported at least one incident where they rolled onto their infant.</p>
<p>Additionally, in households where there are smokers and the infant is bed-sharing, an increased risk of SIDS has also been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511432300">Tappin et al., 2005</xref>).The use of alcohol or recreational drugs has been also been positively associated with SIDS and bed-sharing because of the lack of parental supervision for safe bed-sharing (i.e. infant lying prone, excessive bedding, entrapment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsely et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Recommendations about bed-sharing/co-sleeping</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511432300">American Academy of Pediatrics’ (2005)</xref> position statement clearly identifies bed-sharing as a potentially hazardous practice which may lead to SIDS. Alternatively, parents are advised to co-sleep with the infant’s crib placed next to the parent’s bed. If the parents choose to bed-share they recommend a ‘nonprone sleep position, avoidance of soft surfaces or loose covers, and avoidance of entrapment by moving the bed away from the wall and other furniture and avoiding beds that present entrapment possibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511432300">AAP, 2005</xref>: 654). Additionally, adults other than the parents and siblings, as well as parents who have an impairment in arousal from alcohol or drugs should not bed-share with the infant.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511432300">Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (2008</xref>) states that the recommendations for infant care which may impair the initiation and/or duration of breastfeeding should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding. Family, ethnic, socioeconomic, feeding, and other circumstances should be considered in obtaining an infant sleep history. Parents should be encouraged to verbalize their opinions and seek information and support from healthcare providers. They should be educated about the risks and benefits of co-sleeping and unsafe co-sleeping practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511432300">Table 1</xref>) and be allowed to make their own decision about co-sleeping.</p>

<title>Study design and methods</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the infant bed-sharing practices of mothers from the birth of the infant to three months of age. Maternal choices for sleep practices, influences on those choices, infant feeding method, environmental factors, and maternal beliefs about bed-sharing were also examined.</p>
<p>The study emanated from a collaborative effort between a medical center in southeastern Pennsylvania and a local university. A group of researchers from the university, members of the maternal-child community outreach program from the medical center, nurses from the postpartum inpatient unit, and a pediatric physician, met regularly to discuss maternal-child health issues affecting the county and possibilities for collaborative research to improve client outcomes. The need for this study resulted from a review of infant mortality data from the area.</p>
<p>A longitudinal descriptive research design was chosen to answer the research question. A descriptive approach was most appropriate to learn about the existing practices of bed-sharing of these women, as little was known about what these women’s infant sleep practices were. Descriptive data provided baseline knowledge from which interventions will be developed to minimize the risk of SIDS from bed-sharing. The first three months of life was chosen as the time period for this study, as this was found in the literature to be the period of highest risk for SIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511432300">Horsley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511432300">Tappin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1367493511432300">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A convenience sample of women who have given birth (singleton and multiple) to healthy infants (infants who were admitted to and discharged from the well-baby nursery with the mother) at a large medical center in southeastern Pennsylvania was obtained. Women were excluded if their baby was not discharged at the same time as the mother and if they did not speak, read and write English or Spanish.</p>
<p>Ninety-four women were enrolled in the study and completed the self-report instrument. Seventy women were interviewed at one month of infant age and 54 women were interviewed at three months of infant age. The participant drop-out was due to an inability of the research assistant to contact the women for the follow-up interviews. The participants’ demographics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511432300">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Instrument</title>
<p>A self-report instrument was developed to obtain demographic data, infant sleep practices, influence on maternal choice for infant sleep practices, maternal attitudes toward infant sleep practices, and environmental factors contributing to infant sleep practices. The instrument was developed by the researchers after a literature review revealed no existing tools that would sufficiently answer the research question. The Flesch-Kincaid level of the questionnaire was 7.9 years of age. Additionally, the instrument was translated into Spanish and was certified by a Spanish translator, as a significant population of women who deliver at the institution were Spanish speaking. An interview guide for follow-up phone interviews with the mothers at one and three months postpartum was also developed and translated into Spanish.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1367493511432300">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>Institutional Review Board approval for the study was obtained from the medical center and the collaborating university. Participants were approached by the nurse educator on the postpartum unit to discuss the study, answer any questions, and obtain signed informed consent from those women who agreed to participate. The participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time. A copy of the consent was given to the participant. Each participant who participated in the one-month and three-month telephone follow-up interviews were entered into a monthly drawing for a $25 gift certificate to a national retail store.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1367493511432300">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Once informed consent was obtained, the participants were given the self report instrument and were asked to complete it and leave it in a locked box on the postpartum unit. The subjects were then contacted by a research assistant through a telephone follow-up interview at one and three months after discharge. The research assistant had difficulty contacting some of the women participating in the study due to the transient lifestyles of some of these women. Three attempts were made to contact the woman and if no contact was made at that time, the participant was withdrawn from the study. After each telephone interview, the participant’s name was entered into the monthly drawing for the gift certificate and the gift certificate was mailed to the winner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1367493511432300">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the quantitative data included the use of descriptive statistics and t-tests to study group differences (breastfeeding; bottle-feeding) using SPSS 13. Qualitative data were analyzed using line by line coding which was then reviewed and categorized.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1367493511432300">
<title>Results</title>
<p>At the time of enrollment, none of the participants stated that they would be sharing a bed with their infant. At one month of infant age, only one participant reported regularly sharing a bed with her infant. However, when asked in the follow-up interviews how often the infant had shared a bed with the mother over the past month, 47 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 31) of the participants interviewed at one month of infant age reported sharing a bed with their infant and 17 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 9) of the participants interviewed at three months of infant age reported sharing a bed with their infant. At the one-month interview, 11 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 7) of participants reported sharing a bed with their infant the night before the interview, and 11 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 5) of participants at the three-month interview reported sharing a bed with their infant the night before. There were no statistical differences among participants who reported bed-sharing between bottle-feeding and breastfeeding mothers.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent (<italic>N</italic> = 65) of participants at one month reported that the infant had his/her own bed and 100 percent of participants at three months reported that the infant had his/her own bed (<italic>N</italic> = 54). One participant at one month reported using a co-sleeper. Therefore, for this sample, the lack of an infant bed was not a factor in bed-sharing.</p>
<p>Fifty percent (<italic>N</italic> = 46) of the participants reported that they had a discussion with someone about infant sleep practices prior to infant discharge from the hospital, and 50 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 46) reported that they did not discuss it with anyone. Participants who discussed infant sleep practices did so with relatives (27%, <italic>N</italic> = 25), friends (22%, <italic>N</italic> = 21), a nurse (22%, <italic>N</italic> = 21), a physician (19%, <italic>N</italic> = 18), and from a magazine or newborn class (3%, <italic>N</italic> = 3). While most of the participants articulated that they knew that bed-sharing put their infant at risk for SIDS, their attitudes about the age by which a child should sleep alone, and the age at which a child should not share a bed, revealed that knowledge does not always translate to attitudes. None of the participants said that a child should never bed-share at one month of infant age, while 54 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 20) at three months said that a child should never share a bed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The discrepancy between the participant report of infant bed-sharing and actual bed-sharing practices may be due to infant sleep issues experienced during this stage of infant development. Frequent feedings, infant irritability, and maternal fatigue may play a role in unplanned bed-sharing with the infant. This may be due to the phenomenon of reactive co-sleeping. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511432300">Madansky and Edelbrock (1990</xref>) identified two types of co-sleeping; reactive and non-reactive (intentional). Reactive co-sleepers choose to co-sleep because of the infant’s sleep problems. Non-reactive (intentional) co-sleepers choose to sleep together for personal reasons. Since none of the mothers stated that they intended to bed-share, it can be assumed that this sample would be primarily reactive co-sleepers.</p>
<p>Most of the bed-sharing for this sample was reported at one month after the birth of the infant. This is of particular concern because of the increased risk for SIDS in bed-sharing when the infant is younger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511432300">Tappin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the participants had a high level of knowledge regarding the risks of bed-sharing with an infant, survey participants still reported sharing a bed with their infant while they intended to not bed-share with their infants. This is similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511432300">Ateah and Hamelin (2008</xref>) who also found a high rate of bed-sharing in families who had knowledge about its risks.</p>
<p>It was very concerning to learn that only half of the mothers in this study reported receiving any information about infant sleep arrangements, and only 19 to 22 percent had received any information from healthcare providers (physicians and nurses). It is the responsibility of all healthcare providers to educate families about safe infant sleep practices in order to decrease the risk of SIDS from bed-sharing. As these mothers reported getting information about infant sleep practices from friends and family members, it is important that information about safe infant sleep practices is widely disseminated to the general public and that family be included in any newborn education.</p>
<sec id="section14-1367493511432300">
<title>Clinical nursing implications</title>
<p>Education about safe infant sleep practices is essential for the prevention of SIDS. It is evident, based upon the findings of this study, that either health providers are not educating mothers about safe infant sleep practices or these mothers do not hear or remember the message. Consistent messages about safe infant sleep must be delivered in multiple settings by multiple providers (i.e. childbirth educator, obstetrician/midwife, nurse, and pediatrician), in order for new mothers to absorb and retain that knowledge. Families should also be included in this education to ensure that the mother is not getting mixed messages regarding safe infant sleep.</p>
<p>In this study, one month of age was found to be a high-risk time for bed-sharing. This is most likely due to infant sleep issues and maternal sleep needs. As this is also a high-risk time for death from SIDS due to bed-sharing, we must educate mothers about how to deal with infant sleep issues in a safe and effective manner so that the mother’s fatigue is minimized and infant safety is maximized. Home follow-up by nurses, either by telephone or a home visit, may also allow for screening for infant sleep issues which may lead to unsafe bed-sharing, and provide education and support for the new mother in dealing with these issues.</p>
<p>Knowledge about the risks of bed-sharing does not necessarily keep mothers from bed-sharing, as evidenced by this and other studies. Therefore, it is important that healthcare providers carefully assess the needs of the family (personal, cultural, socioeconomic), assess the potential risk factors for unsafe bed-sharing practices (the use of alcohol, the use of mind altering drugs, who is planning on sleeping in the bed with the infant, the bedding, the size and type of bed, and proximity to a wall), and the family choice for infant sleeping arrangements. Since reactive bed-sharing may occur even when families choose not to bed-share, all families should receive education about the risks of bed-sharing and strategies to minimize the risk of SIDS if they choose to bed-share (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511432300">Table 1</xref>). Families should be encouraged to co-sleep if at all possible, rather than bed-share, or keep the infant in a separate room, to significantly minimize the risk of SIDS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511432300">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Infants who bed-share with adults or children are at an increased risk of death from SIDS. Through early and consistent education about safe infant sleep practices (including the risks of bed-sharing and safe bed-sharing practices), healthcare providers can minimize the occurrence of death due to SIDS from bed-sharing. Through a thorough family assessment, contact with the family through one month post discharge, and education about the management of infant sleep issues, families and healthcare providers can work together to make every night’s sleep a happy and healthy one.</p>
