<body>
<p>Today’s case:</p>
<p><italic>It’s your writing day and you’re brimming with optimism, enthusiasm, and resolve. This morning’s emails include the stupendous news that the resubmission of your first-ever RCT grant application has been successful, and you think that one more solid day’s effort on the manuscript reporting your first-ever systematic review (the one that formed the basis for your successful grant resubmission) can get it ready to send off to your favorite journal. Moreover, the overseas graduate student you offered to peer-mentor last year reports that, with your help, she has won the scholarship competition that will permit her to finish an advanced degree before she returns home, and the homeless shelter where you and two colleagues volunteer at a drop-in clinic has finally received funding from the city for a nurse-practitioner. Finally, you learn that you’ve just received a teaching award from your junior house staff and medical students</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>However, your optimism and resolve take several hits as you scan the other new emails in your Inbox: an automated request (sans abstract) from a journal to review a manuscript they’ve just received; an invitation from a recently-tenured senior colleague to take over, reorganize, and run his graduate course on adaptive trials; invitations to register for two annual meetings (the Society for Clinical Trials and your sub-specialty society) and two special symposia (in areas of tangential interest), all to be held at attractive destinations; a request from your Dean’s Exec Officer to serve on a committee to re-review and re-reorganize the hospital-university space dispute resolution system; a very generously funded ‘Request for RCT Proposals’ for a disease outside your specialty; a request from a colleague in that specialty to help him apply for those funds; and a plea from a member of your clinical rota to take her call this coming weekend</italic>.</p>
<p>At this early ‘stem cell’ point in your career, you are an omni-potential academic clinician, and your brains, skills, and interests could propel you into a wide array of exciting and fulfilling careers. For example, your experiences with the overseas graduate student could inaugurate a career in international health research and education. Or, you could evolve into a health-care innovator and evaluator, attacking problems in personal or public health care closer to home. Or, you could evolve into an educational innovator and evaluator, and any of the foregoing could lead to a career in progressively senior administrative and leadership posts.</p>
<p>Regardless of your career path, your professional success and life-satisfaction will depend on your ability to focus your time and energy on your primary professional and social goals. Consequently, you must strictly ration any diversion of your time to the myriad other opportunities that will be offered to or thrust upon you. That is, you will have to learn how to say ‘no’ (nicely) to some opportunities and, especially, to the far more numerous ‘dys-opportunities’ that can devour your time and energy and retard your career and personal development.</p>
<p>In this trio of <italic>Rounds</italic>, we will offer some ideas for managing the Priority Lists no. 1 (<italic>things you’re doing now that you want to quit</italic>) and especially no. 1a (<italic>things you’ve just been asked to do that you want to refuse to do</italic>), that we introduced back in Round 3 in April 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512463177">1</xref>]. The co-author of this <italic>Round</italic>, Andy Oxman, suggests that another priority list overlaps lists 1 and 1a: <italic>things that you think you should do, but you really shouldn’t, especially early in your career</italic>. The key to managing priorities is to identify all those things that you really shouldn’t do – whether you’re already doing them, or whether you’ve just been asked to do them – and to say ‘no’ to them in a firm but courteous fashion (nicely).</p>
<p>We think how to say ‘no’ is one of the most important skills we can impart to our mentees and younger colleagues. Having to do this for them originally struck us as odd, given that most of them learned the power of the word ‘no’ between the ages of one and two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1740774512463177">†</xref></sup> Then we realized that most of us, having learned to say ‘no’ at an early age, lose this power during years of regimented, authoritarian schooling.</p>
<p>Because the primary audience for these <italic>Rounds</italic> is the clinician-trialist, our examples and responses will focus on those of greatest relevance to this group. However, we hope that they will also be useful to readers in other disciplines and with other interests. And, because our focus is on new investigators, we will stress learning when and how to say ‘no’ early in one’s career, and how to say ‘no’ nicely, so as to avoid offending people and other undesirable consequences of saying ‘no’. As your career progresses and you become an established clinician-trialist (with tenure or its equivalent, with a couple of trials prominently published, and with enough self-assurance to have achieved the prerequisites for becoming an effective mentor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512463177">2</xref>]) you should contribute and help to support a collaborative scientific and medical culture by saying ‘yes’ to requests for teaching, peer-review, and useful administrative tasks (especially when they benefit younger colleagues). But saying ‘yes’ too often and too soon can do more harm than good to your career and to your ability to help others.</p>
<p>In an informal survey of about 50 of our colleagues worldwide, we found that not only is our point-of-view about protecting new academics widely shared, but also their strong opinion that established academics retain the need to get better at saying ‘no’ (nicely) to the requests and demands that not only threaten their own continuing careers and satisfaction but also limit their contributions to the careers and satisfaction of others.</p>
<p>The rest of this first <italic>Round</italic> will grapple with email, that double-edged sword that can both enable and disable clinician-trialists at any stage in their careers. On the one hand, many of your most valuable exchanges with your mentor and other colleagues (and most of the requests you have received) probably have occurred via email. And you’ve no doubt already appreciated that RCT ideas and preliminary protocols can be exchanged, discussed, and revised with worldwide colleagues within hours, that data quality checks can be completed swiftly across time-zones and work schedules, and that every collaborator who wants to see the latest draft of a trial report can get it within seconds (just as we discovered that we could get advice about how to say ‘no’ (nicely) from dozens of colleagues by sending out a single email request).</p>
<p>Moreover, of course, you’re already an email benefactor in your clinical training and practice, all the more so for those of you who don’t automatically receive lab, imaging, and other clinical reports via a hospital information system, or don’t have ready access to ‘experts’. For example, ‘Fast Facts and Concept’ (FFAC) emails have been shown to increase US internal medicine interns’ knowledge of palliative care topics and self-reported palliative care skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512463177">3</xref>]. And a GI trainee in Los Angeles, preparing departmental rounds on confocal laser endomicroscopy, posed an academic question about it in one-time emails to 39 US and Canadian experts, received his first answer within 30 min, and heard from 77% of them within 13 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512463177">4</xref>]. And a group of neurologists in Belfast, serving a population of 1.7 million whose average wait for a first neurology appointment was 72 weeks, reduced it to 4 weeks when general practitioners (GPs) emailed their consult requests on a one-page template and quickly received a return email from the consultant with either a diagnosis and management advice, an appointment for investigations, a request for further information (all the former without the patient being seen), or an appointment. They found it safe, changed only three diagnoses on re-referral, and reduced the net cost per referral by 58% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512463177">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Finally, the numbers and sorts of patients and citizens who are benefitting from the incorporation of email into their care are rapidly rising, from single email delivered, computer-tailored smoking cessation interventions in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512463177">6</xref>], to email reminders that increase visits for colorectal cancer screening in Oregon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512463177">7</xref>], to weekly email messages and a monthly personal email message for maintaining weight-loss in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512463177">8</xref>], to viral email marketing as a distribution method for tobacco control advertisements in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512463177">9</xref>].</p>
<p>But this last example exposes email’s second edge, exemplified by the Maltese hospital-based pediatrician who monitored a month of personal emails (way back in 2008) and concluded that 70% were spam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512463177">10</xref>]. Was Albert Einstein anticipating email as far back as 1917 when he wrote to a friend ‘Our much-praised technological progress … could be compared to an axe in the hand of a pathological criminal’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512463177">11</xref>]? We suspect most of you have held a similar thought as you faced an ever-bloated email Inbox whose uninvited, unwelcome contents – if thoroughly answered – would devour your time, exhaust your energy, and extinguish your fun day after day after day.</p>
<p>What solutions are there for saying ‘no’ (nicely) to unsolicited email? We’ll discuss responses to specific types of requests in the second Round of this trio, but for now we offer the following generic strategies and tactics suggested by our colleagues:</p>
<list id="list1-1740774512463177" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Never work for a boss (including yourself!) who declares that you are ‘unprofessional’ if you don’t respond to all email within a day.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Initiate – and keep up to date – personal email countermeasures that ban the same unsolicited email from ever appearing a second – or certainly a third – time in your Inbox. These range from hitting ‘unsubscribe’ options at the first opportunity, to using your mail user agent (Microsoft, Mozilla, or whatever) options to ban further messages from a source that bothers you twice, to employing ever more elaborate spam-detectors (rumor has it the Bayesian ones are best at killing guilty messages while sparing the innocent ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512463177">12</xref>]).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Try to ‘touch’ every Inbox message just once by either: replying to it with a short answer; highlighting and filing it in a dated ‘To Do’ file for a long answer; filing it in an archive for future reference; deleting it, or deleting it and banning its repetition. The secondary objective here is experiencing the exhilaration that comes from seeing an empty Inbox.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employ, depending on the severity of your email affliction, progressively restrictive auto-replies based on the ‘I’m away at a meeting or on vacation’ model (but avoiding the fatal flaw of accumulating a mountain of email waiting to paralyze the returning attendee or vacationer). These auto-replies can range all the way from ‘I am unable to respond to email for the next <italic>x</italic> days/weeks. If your inquiry is still timely after that date, please write to me again at that time’ to ‘I am unable to respond to current email messages’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1740774512463177">‡</xref></sup> Of course, you still read your email (thus avoiding the fatal flaw), touching each one once, responding to just the ones you find important and deleting all the rest.</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section1-1740774512463177" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This Round isn’t over yet, because our discussion period has just begun. Rounders who have other or contrary thoughts about the general topics or the management of email, or have questions or comments about the ones presented here, are encouraged to send them to the Editors, with a copy to Dave at <email>sackett@bmts.com</email>. He’ll summarize them in a later round.</p>
<p>Great thanks to all our colleagues who have sent us their experiences and suggestions. Many of them will appear in Part 2 of this trio of <italic>Rounds</italic> as we deal with the specific sorts of opportunities and dys-opportunities that are presented to clinician-trialists (and others), when to say ‘no’ to them, and why. In Part 3 we deal with the strategies and tactics of saying ‘no’ (nicely).</p>
