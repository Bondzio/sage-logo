<p>This is not a book written for sociologists in particular, even though its author is well-known for his studies in the sociology of science, anthropology, and “actor-network theory.” Bruno Latour remains one of the more influential French social scientists since the death of the titanic Bourdieu eleven years ago. This little study, like all of Latour’s writings, is dense, heterodox, spirited, challenging in its premises, mostly Gallic in its references and inspiration, creatively deviant, provocative, and probably worth the reading time of ordinary non-French sociologists. This is mostly because it pushes the reader through unusual terrain which, upon reflection, can indeed prove useful to standard sociological analysis, even if by accident.</p>
<p>One of the charms associated with French scholarly mandarins is their willingness, even their obligation, to cross disciplinary boundaries with abandon, an essential part of their roles as Parisian public intellectuals. What might seem in the anglophone sphere as over-reaching or preening, mostly for the sake of implied scholarly omniscience, among the French literati such a style of exposition is cheered if it is perceived to be sufficiently “brilliant.” <italic>Par exemple</italic>: “The Moderns possess this interesting peculiarity of always dreaming of a temperature that they never had any chance of attaining” (p.ix), which could mean a great deal, or nothing, or something of interest if one knew exactly what the referents connoted. And since one cannot know short of asking Latour for raw explication, the reader is left with the pleasant duty of interpreting these sentiments in a way that seems to cohere as “an argument.” Such a rhetoric “gifts” the writer with great room in which to cavort, and brings the willing reader into a kind of dialogue where ambiguity reigns, but in happy company with whatever ideas seem to make sense at a given moment of shared intellectual history. The fact that “The Moderns” requires definition, the notion that “they” are “always dreaming” of something called a “temperature,” and that—very typically French—they nevertheless “never had any chance of attaining” said “temperature” (that intensely romantic yearning for The Absent), all generate a zone of intellectual playfulness that is hard to resist for people whose job is to frolick with ideas.</p>
<p>In a sentence just prior to this one we learn that “This is a double contradiction, one explicit, the other implicit and folded into the work of art itself.” Latour enjoys dialectical contradictions, especially those with which he can encircle his reader just prior either to resolving the contradiction with some logical or rhetorical flourish, or declaring that our era is sunk in such antinomies that “we” are trapped—in the case of this book by “factish gods” or “the iconoclash.” It is also vital for scholars’ reputations, particularly theorists, to invent new terms which followers and opponents can mouthe so as to participate in The Conversation at <italic>Les Deux Magots</italic>. Latour is very smart about all this, so it is fun to watch him stroll along the tightrope of cultural critique without much of a net.</p>
<p>All this accounts for the book being composed of three quite different components: a previously untranslated French “pamphlet” published in 1996 recounting Latour’s study of fetishism in the context of Tobie Nathan’s ethnopsychiatry in Paris (pp. 1–66); a reprinting of a 2002 museum exhibition catalogue in Karlsruhe, Germany called <italic>Iconoclash</italic>—Latour’s neologism—already available in English (pp. 67–98), the “aim of which is to suspend iconoclastic gestures” (p. x); and finally, “I have added a third chapter in which I compare religious images to those of scientific practice” (p. x), another reprint, of a 2005 publication in English (pp. 99–124).</p>
<p>Probably the best use of this book for sociologists is to follow Latour through the etymology and clinical uses of “fetish” in the first and longest chapter. Though current attention to “the fetish” in the United States turns mostly around elaboration of Marx’s “commodity fetishism,” Latour demonstrates that there are many other uses of the term as an analytic device. In fact, he concludes his examination of the concept this way: “As is customary in critical thought, I first reused the pejorative meaning of the words ‘fetish’ and ‘worship.’ Once this is done, the Moderns can no longer appear to be without fetishes and worship, as they have boastingly—or despairingly— believed. They do have a fetish, the strangest one of all: they deny to the objects they fabricate the autonomy they have given them. They pretend they are not surpassed, outstripped by events. They want to keep their mastery, and they find its source within the human subject, the origin of action, or else. . . the Moderns, piqued at not being able to use human work as an explanation for action, want to kill the subject-source by drowning it in various effects of language, genes, texts, fields, subconsciousnesses, and causalities” (p. 61). And there you have it.</p>
