This describes what has been achieved during the first two years of this programme, implemented by the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights to catalyze and support community-led and citywide upgrading and partnerships between community organizations and local governments.

Published by and available from Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham, this includes detailed descriptions of local government finance in different regions of the world.
