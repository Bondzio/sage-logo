      <abstract>
        <p>Mary Adams was a science producer at the BBC from 1930–6. She is shown to have played a
          crucial role in shaping science broadcasts, in particular devising formats and styles of
          presentation. However, her approach is shown to have been primarily motivated by
          broadcasting considerations rather than by the popularisation of science. Through her
          interaction with scientists she helped to construct a new professional domain, that of the
          science-broadcasting professional, at a time when other producers were creating analogous
          roles in other areas of broadcasting. This paper is based largely on unpublished archival
          documents.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In 1930, a biologist in her early thirties from Cambridge University, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511419450">Mary Adams (1898–1984)</xref>, joined the staff of the
        British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Britain’s only official broadcasting body at the
        time. She was the first specialist science producer in the BBC that we know by
            name<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511419450">1</xref></sup>. A colleague
        wrote that during her six years in post “she raised high the level of broadcast science
        talks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511419450">Lambert, 1940</xref>: 75). This
        paper looks at her role as a science producer, and at her ideas about science broadcasting.
        It also presents the organisational context within which she worked.</p>
      <p>Adams was not a broadcasting novice when she joined the BBC in 1930. In the spring of 1928
        she had given a series of six radio talks on <italic>Problems of Heredity</italic>. These
        talks “caused widespread interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511419450">BBC,
          1930</xref>: 9), and were published the following year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511419450">Adams, 1929</xref>). In the book’s preface Adams offered some
        thoughts on science broadcasting. She considered that, in a broadcast talk, ideas counted
        for more than facts, which often had to go unstated. A good voice was more important than
        subtlety of expression. Finally, “[b]roadcast talks need not be confused with education:
        they are promising stimulants which may become a powerful aid to the spread of education.”
        In other words, mainstream broadcasting (as opposed to specialist broadcasting such as
        Schools broadcasts) was not a medium for delivering lectures; but, used in the right way, it
        could surprise casual listeners into wanting to know more. This was broadly the view she
        maintained during her tenure as a radio producer, as I show in this article.</p>

      <p>Science scarcely figures in histories of British broadcasting (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511419450">Briggs, 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511419450">1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511419450">Paulu, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511419450">1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511419450">Crisell, 2002</xref>). In this, their authors follow a
        pattern set by the many early BBC staff members who published reflections on broadcasting.
        For instance, John Reith, the first Managing Director of the BBC and (from 1927) its first
        Director General, outlined his conception of public-service broadcasting in his book
          <italic>Broadcast over Britain</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511419450">Reith, 1924</xref>), with chapters on the enormous potential
        of the new medium for music, literature, religion and general education; but only a single
        sentence alludes to its potential for science. Similarly taciturn about science was the
        BBC’s first Talks Director, Hilda Matheson, whose 1933 book <italic>Broadcasting</italic>
        has chapters on literature and drama, music, entertainment, and education, but only a couple
        of paragraphs on science as a broadcasting subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511419450">Matheson, 1933</xref>). More recently, specialist historical
        studies have appeared which examine particular facets of the BBC, such as its activity in
        music, modernist literature, medicine, and its relations with the press (see respectively
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511419450">Doctor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511419450">Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511419450">Karpf, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511419450">Nicholas, 2000</xref>). However, science remains largely
        unexplored. (The present author’s doctoral thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511419450">Jones, 2010</xref>, is a preliminary foray; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511419450">Boon, 2008</xref>, looks at early television
        science documentaries.) The relative absence of science from the historical literature,
        however, does not mean that science was of little account in the BBC’s early history, as
        will become clear.</p>
      <p>Away from broadcasting history, much of the scholarship relating to science in the popular
        media has focused on science journalism, especially in newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511419450">Bucchi and Mazzolini, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0963662511419450">Sumpter and Garner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511419450">McComas and Simone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511419450">Hansen, 1994</xref>, to give a few examples) and television
        (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511419450">Murcott, 2010</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0963662511419450">Tanner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511419450">Bienvenido, 2008</xref>). This work has
        largely shown that science news stories are framed primarily by contemporary news values:
        topicality, sensation and relevance to readers trump the canonical scientific values of
        caution, qualification and precision. In other words, the institutional values of the
        context in which the science is presented are crucially influential, and this remains true
        when the science stories are not news-related. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963662511419450">Ulin (2003)</xref>, drawing on American experience, shows
        how an exceedingly concise programme format fostered a politically and ethically neutral
        view of science which suited the programme’s corporate sponsors. The format also,
        ironically, suited advocates of a greater public understanding of science, who equated a
        knowledge of science with assimilation of decontextualised facts – the type of content
        engendered by the programme’s format. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511419450">Hughes (2007)</xref>, in a study of the early freelance science journalist J. G. Crowther
        (who appears in this paper), demonstrates how the shifting power balance between Crowther,
        his editor and his scientific contacts materially affected the content and style of the
        published stories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511419450">Silverstone
          (1985)</xref> observed, in the making of a BBC <italic>Horizon</italic> television
        documentary, the gradual evolution of the storyline by the television producers in such a
        way that the final product met the producers’ needs rather than the scientists’. Science
        output in the popular media thus straddles several areas of professional competence (as does
        much media production). The interaction of those competences bears on the final product.</p>
      <p>With science broadcasting at the BBC, the institutional dimension looms especially large
        because of the singular ethos of the BBC. Within a short time of its founding, the BBC
        became a byword for high-mindedness and public service, and for many of the staff who joined
        in the 1920s and early 1930s (the cohort which included Adams), broadcasting was almost “a
        social and cultural crusade” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs,
          1995</xref>: 12).</p>

      <title>2. The BBC; paternalism and public service</title>
      <p>Broadcasting in Britain, which began during the early 1920s, was very much a product of the
        immediate post-First World War era. Its public-service ethos was a response to social
        conditions in the aftermath of the war. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs (1995</xref>: 173) refers to a widespread feeling during and after the First World
        War that national education in Britain had served the population badly. For many Britons,
        formal education had been limited to basic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511419450">LeMahieu, 1988</xref>: 10). Many intellectuals considered
        that the public was deprived of education in democratic citizenship. In effect there was a
        “knowledge gap” between the state and the citizenry, especially among those newly
        enfranchised in 1918 – that is, men aged 21 and over, and women aged 30 and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff, 1991</xref>: 11).
        According to John Reith, the begetter of British public-service broadcasting, creating a
        better informed and more responsible citizenry was one of the many potential benefits of
        radio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511419450">Reith, 1924</xref>: 18–19).</p>
      <p>A knowledge deficit was not the only disadvantage endured by the mass of citizens. New
        forms of commercial popular culture (cinema, recorded popular music and large-circulation
        publications) were considered, by pessimists within cultivated élites, to be debased. They
        were banal, appealed to base instincts and undermined established cultural hierarchies
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511419450">LeMahieu, 1988</xref>: 107–121). Some
        “progressive” intellectuals, however – characterised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511419450">LeMahieu (1988</xref>: 138–139) as sceptical about the
        efficiency, fairness and social utility of <italic>laissez-faire</italic> economic policy –
        took a more sanguine view. They believed that the new modes of communication, used
        responsibly, could help create a more unified, egalitarian society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff, 1991</xref>: 13). LeMahieu sees John
        Reith’s conception of broadcasting as one such progressive response to mass, commercial
        culture. Reith’s aim as a broadcaster was not to satisfy a market want, but to elevate taste
        by supplying edifying material. He was overtly paternalistic: <disp-quote>
          <p>It is occasionally indicated to us that we are apparently setting out to give the
            public what we think they need – and not what they want, but few know what they want,
            and very few what they need. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511419450">Reith,
              1924</xref>: 34)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Responsibility for determining listeners’ needs lay solely with the BBC, which effectively
        had a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain until the introduction of commercial television in
        the mid-1950s. Under the aegis of the BBC, such cultural luminaries as W. H. Auden, Hilaire
        Belloc, Robert Bridges, G. K. Chesterton, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, John Masefield, George
        Bernard Shaw, Beatrice and Sidney Webb and H. G. Wells were brought before the public in the
        early years of broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511419450">Avery,
          2006</xref>: 139).</p>
      <p>Although the fare offered by the BBC was not always popular, broadcasting itself proved
        highly popular, as in many other parts of the world. Between 1930 and 1939, the proportion
        of UK households possessing a radio rose from 30% to 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511419450">Pegg, 1983</xref>: 7). The medium was not only popular, it
        was also universal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511419450">Scannell
          (1980</xref>: 24) has observed: “Radio addressed not the particular publics of the daily
        newspapers, not the specialised readership of the Left Book Club, not the tiny audiences for
        documentary films, but the general public, society at large.” The BBC, then, had a wide and
        increasing reach during the 1930s. Furthermore, it was not merely a disseminator of cultural
        artefacts; rather, it had a pastoral role in relation to its listeners, guiding their
        taste.</p>

      <title>3. Talks and adult education</title>
      <p>In the period during which Mary Adams worked as a radio science producer, and for long
        after, there was no department in the BBC specialising in science. In principle, what
        distinguished BBC departments from each other was not content but mode of presentation. In
        1927 there were four main programme-producing departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511419450">Briggs, 1965</xref>: 664, 665):</p>
      <list id="list1-0963662511419450" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>

          <p>Productions</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The last of these, “Productions,” handled popular entertainment, as well as dramatic
        presentations. The Music department, which dealt only with “classical” music, was an
        exception to the general principle that departments were not defined by content. During the
        1930s, other departments were added for overseas broadcasts, television, outside broadcasts,
        news, and schools, all of which could handle many types of output, including science.</p>
      <p>From roughly the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s, many of the talks presented during the prime
        listening time of early evening were produced by the Adult Education section, which, prior
        to 1928, had been in the Education department. Thereafter it formed part of Talks, except
        for a hiatus around 1931 when it was briefly split from Talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff, 1991</xref>: 155; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs, 1995</xref>: 206). Adult Education
        was the section Mary Adams joined in 1930, and for whom she had presented her six talks on
        the <italic>Problems of Heredity</italic> in 1928, referred to earlier.</p>
      <p>Adult education talks were meant to be interesting to general listeners; but, for the more
        motivated listener, additional resources were available. For the price of postage, listeners
        could get a syllabus of talks, which gave a timetable for the term (12 weeks), synopses of
        talks, information about the speakers, lists of further reading, and questions for
        discussion. The BBC encouraged collective listening, under the direction of an adult
        education officer, who would not be formally connected with the BBC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511419450">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">3</xref> are taken from adult education syllabuses.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref> is the timetable of adult
        education broadcasts for April to July 1930. Each box in the table represents a slot for 12
        weeks’ worth (i.e. one term’s worth) of broadcasts. Some “slots” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref> are shared by two or more series of
        broadcasts. For example, the slot on Friday at 7.25 p.m. is split between
          <italic>Bird-watching and Bird Behaviour</italic>, in the first half of the term, and
          <italic>Labour and International Affairs</italic>, in the second half. Splits could be
        organised in other ways too; for example, the slot on Fridays at 7 p.m. was split between
          <italic>Music Criticism</italic> and <italic>New Discoveries</italic> (a topical science
        series). In this case the two programmes alternated, each appearing fortnightly through the
        12-week term.</p>
      <p>The 35 occupied slots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref>
        give a total of 35 × 12 = 420 adult education broadcasts, or, as there were three terms per
        year, 1260 talks per year. This figure fluctuated somewhat, but is not untypical of the
        early 1930s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref> indicates the
        eminence of some of the speakers: among the scientists are Julian Huxley and Cyril Burt, and
        among the non-scientists are Vita Sackville West, Desmond MacCarthy and Ernest Newman.</p>
      <p>Science broadcasts often did not fit the conventional scientific disciplines of physics,
        chemistry and biology. In fact deciding which of the talks series in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref> were scientific is not easy, although the
        decision is not always as difficult as in this example. Some of the series in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511419450">Figure 3</xref> are clearly psychological (such
        as <italic>The Study of the Mind</italic>, on Tuesday at 8.00), and could be regarded as
        scientific. Similarly, the series <italic>Digging up the Past</italic> (Wednesday, 7.25),
        although concerned with archaeology, might have had some scientific content, as might the
        series <italic>Some Industries of Great Britain Today</italic> (Thursday, 7.25). This
        discipline-straddling approach reflected the intention of giving the broadcasts general
        appeal. It also partly illustrates the difficulty of establishing quantitatively the amount
        of science broadcasting in the adult education output. I tentatively estimate that 11.5% of
        the 420 adult-education broadcasts in this table were scientific, and that the same
        percentage was devoted to literature<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511419450">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The formal process of programme planning from 1927 (when the BBC was converted from a
        commercial company to a public corporation) until the outbreak of war in 1939 underwent
        various changes. However, the broad principles remained the same. Programme planning was a
        mixture of top-down input from programme planners and bottom-up programme ideas from
        producers and their heads of departments. The top-down aspect was largely a matter of
        planning schedules, reviewing recent broadcasts, vetting programme ideas, and ensuring good
        use of resources. Programme planners were by no means indifferent to listeners’ tastes – for
        all the BBC’s paternalism – and set much store by “balancing” the schedules to create a
        suite of offerings that, in the long run, catered for a wide range of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511419450">Burns, 1977</xref>: 124).</p>
      <p>This formal arrangement, though, gives little indication of the degree of autonomy enjoyed
        by individual producers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs
          (1995</xref>: 9) suggests that during the BBC’s first decade, which overlaps with Adams’s
        first few years at the BBC, most programme decisions came from below. One BBC staff member
        of the 1930s characterised the Talks department in the early part of the decade as marked by
        a “cult of the temperamental producer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511419450">Green, 1962</xref>). Matters began to change around 1934 when, for reasons explained
        later, “an elite of policy making high officials – with little experience of programme
        making, or any specialised knowledge of programme areas – began to impose corporate
        definitions of BBC policy across the whole range of programme output” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511419450">Scannell, 1980</xref>: 26). For the period covered by this
        paper, however, producers enjoyed a good deal of autonomy, and a significant amount of the
        output of the Talks department was associated with adult education.</p>

      <title>4. Mary Adams, pioneering science producer</title>
      <p>Mary Grace Agnes Campin was born on 10 March 1898 in Hermitage, Berkshire, in England. She
        was brought up in Wales, and attended University College, Cardiff, gaining a first-class
        honours degree in botany in 1921. For the next four years she was a researcher in biology at
        Cambridge University. Around 1925 (the year of her marriage to Samuel Vyvyan Trerice Adams,
        1900–51), she became an extramural adult-education tutor in Cambridge, and continued in this
        role until she joined the BBC in 1930. It was during this pre-BBC period as an adult
        education tutor that she gave her first broadcasts for the BBC, referred to earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511419450">Adams, 2004</xref>). In 1930, she gave a
        series of six talks on <italic>Pioneers of Health</italic> and a series of five eugenically
        themed talks <italic>A1 or C3? The Future of the Race</italic>. For the next six years Adams
        worked in the Talks department as a producer, and gave a few further broadcasts.</p>
      <p>Like many intellectuals of the time, Adams was a keen advocate of eugenics. In one of her
        1928 BBC talks she drew attention to what was, for many eugenists, a primary problem facing
        society: the deteriorating quality of the human breeding stock. In a book based on her 1928
        broadcasts she wrote: “… the children of able parents are more likely to be gifted than the
        children of empty-headed, indolent or idle parents. Yet statistics show that the casual
        labourer leaves nearly twice as many children as the professional man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511419450">Adams, 1929</xref>: 89–90). Universal
        education was necessary if eugenics was to succeed: “So long as certain classes are denied
        access to knowledge on account of their poverty, it will be difficult, if not impossible,
        for the Eugenist to persuade people to listen to him” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511419450">Adams, 1929</xref>: 91). There were implications for
        children’s education too: “Let us give [children], first of all, a saner, freer education
        about sex” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511419450">Adams, 1929</xref>: 96).
        Possibly it was suggestions like this that prompted one listener to express a hope that “no
        member of the opposite sex had been obliged to remain in the studio while [Adams] was
        broadcasting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511419450">Adams, 1929</xref>:
        ix).</p>
      <p>Some prominent science broadcasts produced by Adams, or produced during her tenure as a
        producer, include <italic>What is Science?</italic> (six broadcasts by mathematician Hyman
        Levy in autumn 1931); <italic>Science and Civilization</italic> (six broadcasts by Aldous
        Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Hilaire Belloc, J. B. S. Haldane and Oliver Lodge, January and
        February 1932); <italic>Biology in the Service of Man</italic> (6 broadcasts by J. Arthur
        Thomson, spring 1932); <italic>How the Mind Works</italic> (18 broadcasts by Cyril Burt and
        others, October 1932 to February 1933); and <italic>A Tour Through Space and Time</italic>
        (8 broadcasts by James Jeans, October and November 1934). Many other broadcasts could be
        cited. BBC staff member Richard Lambert paid tribute to Adams’s production skills as
        follows: <disp-quote>
          <p>[Mary Adams] raised high the level of broadcast science talks, through her contacts
            with scientists at the universities, and her ability to pick out the latest scientific
            developments and have them presented in a lively and informative way. … when she was
            transferred to Television [1936], the light she had lit in the Talks Department grew dim
            again. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511419450">Lambert, 1940</xref>:
            75)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>What is noteworthy here is not so much Lambert’s eulogising of Adams – he is, after all,
        one BBC professional writing about another – but his depiction of her role. He highlights
        her gatekeeping and framing functions – her choice of speakers and topics, and her skill in
        finding “lively and informative” styles of presentation. He attributed the success of
        science talks to her rather than to the speakers she commissioned. She was, he implies,
        largely responsible for the quality of science broadcasts, although it is clear from BBC
        documents that she was not the only producer of science broadcasts, or science-related
        broadcasts, at this time. In fact, producers seem to have been flexible. For example, Felix
        Greene, the producer of a 1934 series on unemployment <italic>Time to Spare</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511419450">Scannell, 1980</xref>: 19–20), invited
        William Bragg to take part in a programme on psychical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511419450">Friday, 1974</xref>: 73), and producers Lionel Fielden and
        Joe Salt worked with science broadcaster Gerald Heard, though they were not specialist
        science producers. Mary Adams herself had a managerial role from August 1934 as part-time
        assistant to Head of General Talks, and arranged a series of unrehearsed debates on
        miscellaneous topics in 1935 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs,
          1995</xref>: 137, 140).</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff (1991</xref>: x)
        characterise the early years of the BBC as notable for the development of now-familiar
        formats and styles of broadcasting through experiment and refinement. An innovative type of
        science broadcast introduced under Adams, entitled <italic>Science in the Making</italic>,
        ran for two series, in 1931 and 1932. Each week, listeners were asked to participate in
        research activities, albeit of a homely sort. In one broadcast, the biologist John R. Baker
        asked listeners to report when blackbirds laid their first eggs. In another, natural
        historian and geographer Ivan Margary asked for observations of the time of flowering of the
        first blackthorn; and physicist Dr John Shaxby conducted perceptual experiments to
        investigate masking of one sound by another played simultaneously. Nearly 1000 listeners
        returned accounts of what they had heard in the broadcast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511419450">BBC, 1932</xref>: 170–171). Adams liked this type of
        broadcast, and commented that Baker’s and Shaxby’s broadcasts had yielded results “of real
        value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>).</p>
      <p>In Adams’s view, talks which explained what scientists did were more successful than talks
        aimed at conveying what scientists knew, because listeners lacked the requisite background
        knowledge to comprehend scientific findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>). In 1933 Adams wrote that science was
        widely misconceived as “the history of sudden and startling inventions,” whereas
        fundamentally it was a process or a method: “systematic trial and error … frustration and
        discovery, a laborious construction of instruments, theories and methods of investigation”
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511419450">Adams, 1933</xref>: 12). This goes to
        the core of why Adams favoured programmes such as <italic>Science in the Making</italic>.
        She liked them “because they show methodology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>).</p>
      <p>A frequent science broadcaster from the Adams period was Gerald Heard, referred to earlier.
        From 1930, he broadcast regularly on topical science matters, first in the fortnightly
        series <italic>Research and Discovery</italic> and then in <italic>This Surprising
          World</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511419450">Moseley, 1933</xref>).
        The latter series continued until 1934<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511419450">3</xref></sup>. Adams considered that for this type of broadcast, Heard was the most
        successful presenter she had used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams,
          1936</xref>). She especially admired his wide range of scientific interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>), and also his virtuosity
        and sharpness of mind. His bravura performance in an unrehearsed broadcast debate speaking
        against the motion that “Life a hundred years ago is preferable to life a hundred years
        hence” prompted this enthusiastic response from Adams<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511419450">4</xref></sup>: <disp-quote>
          <p>Just a note to let you know how very brilliant we all thought you were last Saturday.
            Praise pours in on all sides, and I just want to turn it towards you. I think the way
            you leapt on to their points was staggering. Thank you very much. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511419450">Adams, 1935</xref>)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Heard’s performance, and Adams’s appreciative response, can illuminatingly be contrasted
        with that of another science populariser of the time, the journalist J. G. Crowther, who
        gave a broadcast under Adams’s supervision in 1931. In that year, Adams saw a short filler
        item in <italic>Nature</italic> in which an unnamed commentator observed that the tails of
        sparrows in London appeared to be frequently misshapen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511419450">5</xref></sup>. Adams invited Crowther to speak about this
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511419450">Adams, 1931a</xref>). His broadcasting
        experience at this time was limited to three short talks on astronomy in early 1928 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511419450">Matheson, 1927</xref>).</p>
      <p>Adams suggested to Crowther a way to handle the sparrow story. Its “human interest” could
        be used as bait to seize the listeners’ attention, prior to the presentation of weightier
        evolutionary matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511419450">1931b</xref>).
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511419450">LeMahieu, 1988</xref>: 22–23,
        observes that “human interest stories” were a feature of nineteenth-century popular
        journalism, and made impersonal issues interesting by emphasising aspects of the stories
        that bore directly on the lives of the public.) Crowther was reluctant – maintaining that
        scientific exposition ought not to be motivated by “entertainment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511419450">Crowther, 1931</xref>). Adams responded on the basis of her
        professional expertise: <disp-quote>
          <p>I am afraid bitter experience has shown me that it is only by this round about method
            that the great B.P. [British Public] will listen to a wireless talk on science. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511419450">Adams, 1931c</xref>)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>For Adams, imaginative and entertaining styles of presentation (such as Heard’s) were
        essential if listeners were to be hooked. Crowther, on the other hand, felt science
        popularisation served a higher purpose in which “entertainment” had no place. In 1928 he had
        written: <disp-quote>
          <p>The public should be made to realize that their own existence is largely the result of
            the application of science to the old domestic manufacturing arts, and that social
            organization is obviously in the long run very sensitive to the application of science.
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511419450">Crowther, 1928</xref>: 236)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>For Crowther, then, at least one of the functions of popular media was to serve science: to
        show people how dependent they were on science, and to engender a proper esteem for science.
        His approach was no less paternalistic than Reith’s, but, unlike Reith’s, was based on the
        notion that science had a special status and was owed special consideration.</p>
      <p>Crowther, despite his misgivings, went ahead with the sparrow talk<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662511419450">6</xref></sup>, but received only one further commission from
        Adams – a talk on radioactivity in March 1934. Reviewing the merits of various scientific
        broadcasters some time later, Adams acknowledged that Crowther’s wide breadth of scientific
        understanding ought to have made him an ideal radio speaker, but she judged him “a poor
        broadcaster.” (She put C. P. Snow in the same category; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>.) For Adams, where science popularisation
        was concerned, the primary activity was capturing the listeners’ attention, and then
        projecting a scientific story entertainingly – as Heard could do. The public needed to be
        won over, not lectured to.</p>
      <p>In devising ideas for programmes and finding suitable speakers, producers such as Adams
        often needed advice and suggestions from outside the BBC. Formal and informal arrangements
        existed for this. The formal arrangements were based on a range of advisory committees,
        whose members were drawn from inside and outside the BBC. A prime example (from 1937
        onwards) was the Talks Advisory Committee, whose membership included biologist Julian
        Huxley, a frequent broadcaster in the 1930s and afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511419450">Talks Advisory, 1937–9</xref>). There was, however, no
        advisory committee specialising in science. Informal advisory arrangements, on the other
        hand, operated through networks of acquaintance and friendship. Here again Gerald Heard
        proved valuable, not only to Adams but also to several of her colleagues. In 1934, he
        proposed that the psychoanalyst Jung be invited to broadcast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511419450">Heard, 1934</xref>). In the same year, he recommended to a
        BBC producer that journalist Peter Ritchie Calder (later a celebrated science populariser)
        be invited to broadcast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662511419450">Salt,
          1934</xref>). In 1935, he was sounded out by a staff member for his views on a proposed
        new series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511419450">Salt, 1935</xref>). Adams,
        therefore, despite being professionally distinct from the world of science, in the sense
        that she saw her role as deciding what was best for the listeners, was also dependent on it
        – or representatives of it – for particular sorts of expertise.</p>

    <sec id="section5-0963662511419450">
      <title>5. Science and society</title>
      <p>The 1930s were notable for the growth of the social relations of science movement. Among
        other goals, this movement advocated increased use of science for the betterment of society
        and public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511419450">MacLeod and
          MacLeod, 1976</xref>). Scientists associated with the movement were predominantly, but not
        exclusively, left-wing, and often admirers of the USSR as a model of what a rationally
        organised administration could achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511419450">McGucken, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511419450">Werskey,

        328).</p>
      <p>For many scientists associated with this movement (and including the journalist Crowther),
        promoting the public understanding of science had a utilitarian and a moral purpose related
        to social amelioration. The left-wing physicist Patrick Blackett, in a 1934 radio talk later
        published in a book, referred to science’s unexploited capacity for remedying social ills:
        “Industry and science have made such huge advances that a large improvement in the standard
        of life, particularly of the workers, is now technically and immediately possible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511419450">Blackett, 1935</xref>: 129); and in 1939 the
        crystallographer J. D. Bernal wrote that if the potential of science for benefitting human
        welfare were “drummed into” people, the demand for science to be used in this way would
        become irresistible, to the displeasure of the “vested interests of owners and advertisers”
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511419450">Bernal, 1939</xref>: 305). The power
        of science to “diagnose and cure the problems of society” was also often proclaimed in
        science documentary films at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511419450">Boon, 2008</xref>: 109).</p>
      <p>Mary Adams produced a number of broadcasts by scientists associated with the movement,
        beginning with the communist mathematician Hyman Levy. In the autumn of 1931, Levy gave a
        series of six talks entitled <italic>What is Science?</italic> Adams was drawn to use Levy
        because she admired “his ability to communicate complex scientific ideas in simple, everyday
        language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511419450">Werskey, 1978</xref>: 170).
        On the strength of <italic>What is Science?</italic>, Levy was invited to participate in two
        further series. The first was <italic>Scientific Research and Social Needs</italic>,
        broadcast in the autumn of 1933, in which he appeared with Julian Huxley. The second was
          <italic>Web of Thought and Action</italic>, broadcast in the spring of 1934, during which
        Levy interviewed twelve experts (one per week) from diverse fields, such as engineering,
        economics, politics, philology, biology, and philosophy.</p>
      <p>One of Levy’s scripts for the <italic>Scientific Research and Social Needs</italic> series
        aroused Adams’s anxiety. Apprehensive about the political tone of Levy’s script, she sent a
        note to William Bragg, who had been asked to supply an introductory talk for the series.
        Adams asked Bragg to put Levy’s views “in perspective,” and added that “Scientific progress
        seems … to have magnified rather than minimised social instability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511419450">Friday, 1974</xref>: 71). Adams on this evidence was by no
        means an uncritical advocate of science.</p>
      <p>In view of Adams’s reservations about the social consequences of science, it might be
        wondered why she presented the “science and society” type of broadcast at all, albeit as a
        minor part of her department’s science output<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662511419450">7</xref></sup>. Adams’s own justification for this type of
        broadcast comes in a memo she wrote in 1936, in which she set down her thoughts on the
        effectiveness of various types of science broadcasting developed during her tenure.</p>
      <p>According to Adams, talks aimed at instilling scientific ideas were of little value
        because, as mentioned earlier, “The general public has no background for the appreciation of
        technical scientific talks. A proper appreciation of [scientific] results is therefore
        practically impossible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams,
          1936</xref>). As far as the public were concerned, scientific facts were “only interesting
        … if they are attractively presented.” Adams’s judgements here were not based on systematic
        audience research, which had yet to be adopted at the BBC, but almost certainly on
        correspondence from listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662511419450">Silvey,
          1974</xref>: 87–102, 28–31).</p>
      <p>Adams was equally sceptical about the value of reflective talks by scientific celebrities,
        such as James Jeans or Arthur Eddington. Listeners tuned to such broadcasts “primarily on
        account of the attraction of [the broadcaster’s] name &amp; reputation.” In so far as such
        talks were intelligible, it was because the subjects were treated “philosophically or
        semi-philosophically” (rather than scientifically): <disp-quote>
          <p>In the nature of things such talks have little educational value: but they have
            presentation &amp; publicity value &amp; are at any rate unharmful. We have had a good
            many such series in the past. Many of this kind frankly speaking are certainly not
            understood but the broadcasts have a spurious appeal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Adams’s preferred type of talk concerned what scientists did rather
        than what they knew. However, this type of talk was, in her view, not the one most widely
        appreciated by listeners. For wide appreciation it was necessary to turn to “science and
        society.” Unfortunately this type of talk was the hardest to plan, because: <disp-quote>
          <p>The working scientist who is competent to describe the facts … is often the worst
            person to discuss their relevance to social affairs. The speaker competent to do that is
            generally a Marxist &amp; therefore “biased”. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511419450">Adams, 1936</xref>)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Allegations of political bias became a serious issue for the BBC in the increasingly
        conservative political climate of the mid-1930s. The BBC was repeatedly accused of left-wing
        bias by conservative newspapers and commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511419450">Lambert, 1940</xref>: 76–77) though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511419450">Scannell (1980</xref>: 25) characterises attitudes within
        the Talks department at this time as predominantly “progressive” rather than left wing.
        During the mid-1930s, BBC managers, sensitive to these allegations of bias, embarked on “the
        wholesale dismantling of the [Talks] department” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511419450">Scannell, 1980</xref>: 26). The resulting exodus of
        liberally inclined production staff included Mary Adams. The reconstituted Talks department
        which replaced the earlier one had a more conservative slant, and was marked by a “retreat
        from dealing with contentious issues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511419450">Scannell and Cardiff, 1991</xref>: 69). Programme form, content and production became
        more systematised and routinised. Producers increasingly “played safe,” and invoked
        professional judgements on speakers, such as “poor broadcaster,” as reasons to deny the
        microphone to controversial speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511419450">Lambert, 1940</xref>: 81). The later 1930s were also marked by a sharp decline in adult
        education output as the BBC became less and less willing to fund the local activities that
        its adult education broadcasts were intended to sustain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511419450">Briggs, 1995</xref>: 206–207).</p>
      <p>Following her departure from Talks in 1936, Adams moved to the fledgling BBC television
        service, where she enjoyed a long career producing arts, science, and children’s programmes,
        eventually becoming Head of Talks for television. After retiring from the BBC in 1958, she
        worked at the Consumers Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511419450">Adams, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Adams’s replacement in Talks in 1936 was Ian Cox, also a scientist by training. He remained
        in post until the outbreak of war, and returned briefly after the war. During his tenure, as
        might be expected in the more conservative administration, science-and-society broadcasts
        disappeared from the schedules. In addition, as mentioned earlier, there was a steep decline
        in adult education. Nevertheless, Cox’s general approach was not greatly different from
        Adams’s. Major series on <italic>Scientists at Work</italic> (autumn/winter 1936),
          <italic>What More do You Want from the Scientist?</italic> (autumn 1937), <italic>The
          Story of the Rocks</italic> (autumn of 1938) and <italic>Modern Inventions</italic>
        (spring 1939) would not have been out of place during Mary Adams’s tenure. Cox also revived
        regular, topical science programming, with <italic>Science Review</italic>, which had
        languished since the cessation of Gerald Heard’s <italic>This Surprising World</italic>
        series in 1934. Like Adams, Cox believed that, provided basic requirements of accuracy were
        met, a speaker’s most important asset was an engaging style at the microphone, “no matter
        how learned an authority he may be” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511419450">Cox, 1939</xref>).</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Despite the absence of science from the historiography of British broadcasting, and from
        the contemporaneous memoirs and commentary from the early days of broadcasting, science was
        by no means a negligible part of BBC output during the early 1930s. Mary Adams was a key
        figure in the development of science broadcasting during this time. Furthermore, as with
        other areas of broadcasting, this was a period when producers were experimenting with
        programme formats, abandoning them and refining them, as they invented the institution and
        profession of broadcasting “on the job.”</p>
      <p>Adams should be viewed not as a proselytiser for science, or even as a promoter of science
        proselytism by others. Indeed her attitudes to science and science presentation were
        somewhat equivocal. Rather she should be viewed as a practitioner of a new profession – that
        of the professional public-service broadcaster. Her role was to create entertaining and
        informative scientific broadcasts, not because science could transform society for the
        better (as members of the social relations of science movement maintained), but because
        education – broadly interpreted, and across all subjects – could transform society for the
        better. This was a founding belief of public-service broadcasting in Britain. As an exponent
        of the new profession, she, like other producers, had to construct a professional
        jurisdiction. This jurisdiction encompassed such activities as editorial control, claiming
        insight into the audience’s tastes, and justifying decisions by appeal to specialist
        broadcasting knowledge.</p>
      <p>In suggesting that Mary Adams acted as a broadcasting professional rather than as a science
        promoter, I do not suggest she was isolated from, or antagonistic to, the world of science.
        Rather, I suggest that the interests she sought to serve were those of the listener (as she
        conceived them), guided by the values of her profession. In fact, far from being isolated
        from the world of science, Adams valued the advice and help of selected scientists, or
        quasi-scientists, with whom she maintained cordial relations. Principal among these were
        Gerald Heard and Julian Huxley. Figures such as these, and more formal advisory
        arrangements, helped to define the boundary of the broadcasting profession pragmatically.
        Nevertheless, Adams’s primary orientation was not towards scientists, who, for her, were a
        resource to draw on rather than a constituency to represent. In this there is probably a
        general message for any group, not just scientists, that seeks promotion through channels
        that lie within other professional domains.</p>
      <p>Finally, this paper has illustrated how Reith’s paternalistic conception of public-service
        broadcasting did not amount to a prescription for how broadcasting should be done in
        practice. Rather, BBC staff had to work out for themselves what “public service” meant, and
        ways of performing it. In Mary Adams’s case, this led her to a conception of science
        broadcasting somewhat different from traditional science pedagogy. It was a conception
        centred more on what science represented – in its practices and social relations – than on
        what science constituted as a body of knowledge.</p>

          <p>There is a suggestion that there was a science specialist, or specialists, before
            Adams. It comes in a letter dated 31 February [<italic>sic</italic>] 1928 from the BBC’s
            Head of Talks Hilda Matheson to science journalist J. G. Crowther. Matheson says:
            “Regular science talks are not my domain, but I learn from the section responsible for
            them …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511419450">Matheson, 1928</xref>).</p>

            (4 broadcasts), <italic>Animals in Captivity</italic> (4 broadcasts) and
              <italic>Behaviour of Apes</italic> (4 broadcasts). That gives a total of 48, which, as
            a percentage of the 420 broadcast in this timetable, is about 11.5%. For comparison,
            literary talks in the table comprise <italic>Book Review</italic> (12 broadcasts),
              <italic>Readings from the Victorian Poets</italic> (12 broadcasts), <italic>Six
