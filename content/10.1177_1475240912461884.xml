<p>This article questions the notion of global citizenship, arguing that it is not possible in strictly legal terms as there is no global state that could guarantee citizenship. However, metaphorically there are several possible conceptions of global citizenship. These are examined along with associated notions of global education. The issue of for whom such global citizenships might be possible is addressed, as is the issue of what citizenship might mean in failed states. It is suggested that international schools will respond variously to this variety of conceptions of global citizenship, and that where they locate themselves within this complex of metaphors will have major impact on their presentation of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Strictly and legally global citizenship is not possible, as citizenship is a concept ineluctably associated with the nation state. Proof of citizenship is the possession of documents that guarantee that a particular state accepts the individual as a member. It is, of course, possible to obtain multiple citizenships under specific circumstances, although many states require the surrender of citizenship should one choose to embrace the citizenship of another country. Migration between states is increasingly a feature of our contemporary world and it is apparent that citizenship of some states is more desirable than that of others. In fact there is clearly a hierarchy of citizenships with many individuals attempting to migrate, legally or illegally, upwards through the hierarchy.</p>
<p>But citizenship, as well as being a statement of belonging, is also a mechanism of exclusion. It defines who may and may not access the benefits offered by membership of a particular state – be they political, economic, institutional or legal. Circumventing such exclusion is frequently difficult as, apart from some small humanitarian migration, desirable states often set the barriers to citizenship high – accepting only those with high level skills, impeccable personal histories and, often, sound economic/entrepreneurial credentials.</p>
<p>Those seeking such migration for themselves or their children invariably turn to education as the primary mechanism through which high-level skills can be developed and demonstrated, and through which access to advanced education and membership in first world countries can be gained. The explosion in the number of international schools in developing countries over the past two decades can be seen as a direct result of this thirst both for positional advantage within the home country and for the race up the hierarchy of desirable states. Multiple citizenships are often the result of the possession of high level educational qualifications, and prestigious international schools are seen as the access route to prestigious first world universities and first world citizenship.</p>
<p>The possession of such multiple citizenships and the ability to migrate easily between countries in the higher echelons of the world hierarchy constitutes a form of global citizenship, even though it does not fulfil the requirements of belonging to a single global state. However, it does suggest the development of a more broadly based global elite and a metaphorical global citizenship, often associated with global industries and agencies. Such industries and agencies require global mobility not only through multiple citizenships, but also through easy access to visas that allow access to multiple countries. Such global mobility may well be the foundation for one particular definition of global citizens – those who roam the globe more or less at will through the possession of multiple citizenships or visiting rights through multiple visas.</p>
<p>However, as noted above, citizenship is both a statement of belonging and a mechanism of exclusion. Clearly the great majority of the world’s population are excluded from the possession of the kind of global citizenship suggested here. Being born into states that provide little in the way of citizenship rights – to security, employment, health or education, for example – clearly limits the possibility of translating those rights into more broadly ‘global’ citizenship. Circumstances of birth, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240912461884">Shachar (2007</xref>: 257) suggests, ‘bequeath to some a world replete with opportunity and condemn others to a life with little hope’.</p>
<p>Such an analysis suggests that the form of global citizenship described here is open only to the few, since no more than 3 per cent of the world’s population acquires citizenship through naturalization in countries other than their country of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912461884">United Nations, 2002</xref>). The question then arises as to what form of global citizenship might be developed that is not based upon such exclusion, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461884">Balarin (2011</xref>: 355) suggests:<disp-quote>
<p>The aim of developing a global form of citizenship stands in rather tense relation with the vast numbers of marginalised citizens across the globe, to the extent that marginality appears to be the hidden other of global citizenship.</p>

<sec id="section2-1475240912461884">
<title>Transcending national citizenship</title>
<p>Some clues as to how national citizenship might be transcended for a broader group than the transnational elite can be gained from an examination of two contemporary phenomena: firstly the attempt to establish transnational communities through formal political, economic and social means and, secondly, the development of transnational diasporas.</p>
<p>The prime example of the attempt to establish a formal transnational community is that of the European Union. Here we see an attempt to establish transnational structures and norms that allow the free circulation of people, goods, assets and capital across national borders and to develop transnational political, economic, juridical and social norms and institutions. This attempt is both formal, in terms of the establishment of political and economic institutions, and informal, in that the European ‘space without borders’ is:<disp-quote>
<p>an open space where various associative networks converge in networks of information, influences and interests that favour action across national borders and give rise to an identification with a new, developing political entity under construction. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912461884">Kastoryano, 2007</xref>: 161–162)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Europe is, in this sense, an imagined community that is under construction, a work in progress. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240912461884">Lawn (2003</xref>: 325–326) suggests, such a project depends fundamentally upon the role of education:<disp-quote>
<p>Rising free from older ideas of territory and people [Europe] is a political and cultural project, an idea and a conduit, a projection and a form, in which meaning is created, delivered and maintained … Europe is not a place, [a] warehouse full of cultural artefacts, institutions and asymmetrical relations. Europe is a project, a space of meaning, a state in process, and education is the core technology in which governance, ordering and meaning can be constructed. Without education, there can be no Europe.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, while the European Commission might argue for ‘Accomplishing Europe through education and training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912461884">1997</xref>) and while the European project may continue at the bureaucratic level, at a cultural level Europeans are becoming more, rather than less, aware of differences as well as convergences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>). The attempt to consolidate the European project by ‘offering a European vision to her young people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912461884">European Commission, 1997</xref>: 1) faces the difficulty of the resistance of traditional communities to the subordination of their traditional, individual and cultural identities. The fluidity of population movements within Europe creates anew questions of what it means to be French, German, Polish <italic>and</italic> European, and what such multi-level citizenship might entail. Such questions inevitably translate into how such identities are to be managed within education systems that remain under national control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240912461884">Sayer, 2006</xref>). However, attempts to coordinate curriculum and assessment throughout Europe as well as the encouragement of exchanges between national systems may eventually bring about a sense of European identity in addition to national, or even local (Basque, Scottish, Breton) identity. Such a European identity may well be a form of citizenship that transcends national borders, even though it cannot be in itself global in nature.</p>
<p>Diasporas, that is a dispersion of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic identity across borders, are another form of supra-national identity and a form of transnational community. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240912461884">Dufoix (2008</xref>: 106) points out, in the contemporary world:<disp-quote>
<p>The technological possibility of proximity between people who resemble each other in some way – whether religious, national, ethnic, cultural, professional or other – allows non-territorialized links (networks) to emerge. Their spread favors a vision of the planetary reality, or part of the reality in terms of a ‘global world’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Traditionally diasporas originated in the dispersion of those with a national identity facing extreme circumstances (the Irish following the Potato Famine of the 1860s, for instance) or a religious identity facing persecution (such as Protestant sects in Catholic countries following the Counter-Reformation). But there are also instances of diasporas without territorial origins such as the Roma and the Jews. In the case of Roma neither territorial origins nor ambitions apply. For Jews the opposite is the case; that of a diaspora seeking a national identity through the formation of a Jewish state. In the case of diaspora the issue of multiple identities (citizenships?) also arises as the attempt to maintain traditional national, religious, ethnic identity is set alongside the adaptation to the demands of citizenship in their adopted country. Such multiple citizenships may also be a precursor to the development of a more global imagination and open up the possibility of ‘global’ citizenship. They may also, of course, open up the possibility of tension or even conflicts between multiple identities, as well as attempts to resolve them.</p>

<title>The political economy of globalization and citizenship</title>
<p>The emergence of global elites, transnational imaginaries such as Europe, and global diasporas must, however, be set within an understanding of the political economy of globalization as this determines who can, and cannot, access the rights and privileges of emerging transnational/global citizenships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240912461884">Robinson (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240912461884">Sklair (2001)</xref> have described the emergence of the transnational capitalist class and the transnational state. They also describe the concomitant rise in a transnational class of marginalized citizens – the ‘global proletariat’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240912461884">Robinson (2004</xref>: 157) argues, for instance, that:<disp-quote>
<p>Global society is increasingly characterized by a three-tiered social structure that transcends national boundaries. The first tier is made up of some 30–40 percent of what traditionally have been core countries and less in peripheral countries, those who hold ‘tenured’ employment in the global economy and are able to maintain and even expand their consumption. The second tier, some 30 percent of the population in the core countries and 20–30 percent in the periphery, form a growing army of ‘casualized’ workers who face chronic insecurity in the conditions of their employment and the absence of any collective insurance against risk previously secured by the welfare state. The third tier, comprising some 30 percent of the population in the traditional core capitalist countries and some 50 percent or more in peripheral countries, represents those who have been structurally excluded from productive activity and completely unprotected since the dismantling of welfare and developmentalist states, the ‘superfluous’ population of global capitalism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If Robinson is anywhere near right in his analysis, then the prospects for global, or even transnational, citizenship vary hugely between the tiers of global society. For at least a percentage of the first tier, multiple citizenships, easy access to visas and global mobility are at least a possibility. This transnational elite would, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240912461884">Brown and Lauder (2011)</xref> have suggested, not see themselves linked to particular territories or institutions, but hold a particularly abstract notion of citizenship and imagine themselves as close to a cosmopolitan ideal. The education they seek is ‘international’ in both orientation and outcomes.</p>
<p>The second tier, those in the ‘middle’ (especially the emerging middle class in developing economies), have some small chance of developing as global citizens, but concentrate on enhancing their local citizenship through chasing positional advantage for their children – largely through access to private education as state education is seen as less likely to provide such advantage. The bottom tier comprises a new transnational (that is, they exist across national borders) class of marginalized citizens whose claims to the privileges of national citizenship are in themselves insecure as the ability (and in some cases willingness) of the state to provide essential services such as quality education is minimal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240912461884">Broadfoot (1999</xref>: 228) indicates the extent of this problem where:<disp-quote>
<p>in the 49 least developed countries of the world, 50% of the children are not in school; 50% do not finish the first 4 years of schooling; 60–80% of these have no place to sit and write and 90% learn in a strange language.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, even where children do attend schools this is no guarantee that learning is taking place, as the <italic>Public Report on Basic Education in India</italic> discovered during visits to schools where only in 53 per cent of schools was any ‘teaching activity’ occurring, and where in 33 percent of cases the headteacher was absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240912461884">PROBE Team, 1999</xref>: 47). The development of citizenship among such marginalized groups and under such circumstances is highly problematic. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461884">Balarin (2011</xref>: 359) argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Not only is this class of marginalized citizens territorially fixed, but … their imagination of citizenship is highly influenced by the material circumstances in which they live, and by the institutional frameworks of the state which, more often than not, are either unable to deal with, or actively involved in creating, the conditions of their marginality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such marginality not only precludes any notion of <italic>global</italic> citizenship, but also shows how citizenship within the nation state is meaningless as far as support for the development and exercise of capabilities is concerned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240912461884">Nussbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240912461884">Sen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240912461884">Walker and Unterhalter, 2007</xref>). This is not because formal citizenship rights are absent from the constitutions of impoverished nation-states, but rather that these rights are not enacted in citizens’ everyday lives and because the institutional structures through which they might be made available are so weak. It may also be that ‘the weakening of the state as a mediator of social conflicts and social differences in the context of neo-liberal globalization … generates a very individualized and fragmented imagination of citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461884">Balarin, 2011</xref>: 361).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461884">Balarin (2011</xref>: 362) supports this analysis through research in the slums of Lima where she explored dispossessed young people’s ideas of citizenship in an attempt to link their accounts of citizenship with approaches to state development in Peru, in particular to ‘make connections between policies, material conditions of living and the imagination of citizenship’. The results showed an almost complete lack of any imagination of citizenship seen as being a member of a collectivity with access to national (or even local) community and institutional support. Progress in achieving one’s goals was seen as resulting from personal effort, chance or the purchase (either directly or through bribery) of access to education, health and other services. Moreover these young citizens had little or no conception of the state, little sense of community, no knowledge of regional or national history and no resources with which to further their high but unrealistic ambitions. In short:<disp-quote>
<p>Young citizens’ main story, then, is one where individual effort is seen to be the only way forward, mainly through education and amidst a generally hostile spatial, communal and institutional context that leaves them to their own devices to find their ways through a highly privatised and unregulated system of education, and with little opportunity for fair employment to secure the resources this would require. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461884">Balarin, 2011</xref>: 363)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The political economy of globalization, and especially the marginalization of a significant proportion of the world’s population in terms of access to a viable imagination and practice of citizenship and citizenship rights, rather calls into question the viability of an inclusive notion of global citizenship. Can such individuals become global citizens without first becoming citizens of their own countries?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1475240912461884">
<title>The citizen and global citizenship education</title>
<p>So it seems that for a significant proportion of the world’s population the struggle to access the constitutional guarantees proclaimed by the state with regard to its citizens is so difficult that they withdraw into an individualism that has little regard for collective action. If <italic>state citizenship</italic> and the legal rights pertaining to it are so difficult to achieve then the prospects <italic>for democratic citizenship</italic> based upon the idea of active involvement in the decision-making processes of a political community must be even more vestigial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240912461884">Kivisto and Faist, 2007</xref>: 75–76). This being so, the idea of global citizenship must seem little more than a chimera.</p>
<p>For those who are reasonably secure in their state citizenship and have reasonable access to both state and privately provided rights and institutions, as well as the opportunity to realize some of the practices of democratic citizenship, the possibility of multiple citizenships and some degree of global mobility suggests that access to global citizenship education that qualifies them for possible entry into the privileged category of the global transnational elite will be a priority. For those who are already members of the global transnational elite, global citizenship education would need to take a form that extends and deepens their membership status and guarantees continuance of their roles in managing global affairs.</p>
<p>The threefold division of global society suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240912461884">Robinson (2004)</xref> not only implies different forms and realizations of local and global citizenship but also differing demands on global citizenship education and the role of schools. There is, however, no simple correlation between these different forms of citizenship and particular forms of global citizenship education (GCE). Rather, particularly within the West, various forms of GCE have developed, based upon various conceptions of global citizenship. While there is enormous diversity in these conceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz (2007)</xref>, for instance, argues that there are fundamentally three general categories of GCE: neo-liberal, radical, and transformational.</p>
<p>In the <italic>neo-liberal</italic> view the purpose of GCE is to prepare global citizens as travellers whose economic and social relationships can be constructed freely ‘across time and space without being encumbered by national boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>:251). The citizen produced by this form of GCE ‘strives to create a space beyond traditional boundaries and local restrictions where he or she can access political, social, economic and environmental rewards of participation in a global society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 251). Cultural understanding and language acquisition are key components of this form of GCE which is essentially Western-centric. However, the ethnocentricity of this approach to GCE ‘implies that the welfare of the world’s majority matters only inasmuch as it affects our own well-being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240912461884">O’Connor and Zeichner, 2011</xref>: 523). Such GCE is ‘based upon a fundamental understanding that as individuals we should be able to move throughout the world freely, enjoying the rewards regardless of national or other boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 252) and that global citizenship ‘is primarily linked to global economic participation, either through participation in business or an instrumental interventionalism that mediates the uneven effect of such global actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 252). Here, the links with Development Education become clear as the justification for ‘development’ is embedded in developmentalist mythologies that emphasize a development discourse ‘supporting an on-going epistemic violence of imperialism of the so-called ‘First World’ over the ‘Third World’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240912461884">Mannion et al., 2011</xref>: 452). Such development is directed towards helping the Third World ‘catch-up’ through becoming more civilized or globalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240912461884">Mannion et al., 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912461884">Andreotti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240912461884">Spivak, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, the <italic>radical</italic> approach to GCE focuses upon analyses of the global structures that create deep global inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>:252). Constructed mainly through the neo-liberal approach to globalization, such global structures are seen to be ‘implicated in the intensification of global poverty, deprivation, conflict and violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240912461884">McGrew, 2000</xref>: 351). In particular, the ‘structural adjustment’ programs enforced by the IMF and World Bank are seen to reinforce the hegemony of international (Western) institutions over the Third World. GCE, in this view, should serve to call people to action against such global institutions, ‘particularly financial institutions that are the main architects of global economic liberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 254). In this view, GCE is focused on understanding the link between ‘the economic activities of these institutions of political, economic and social oppression and economic destruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 254). Such links are complex and GCE must serve not only to explicate these links but also to produce activists committed to the redress of inequality.</p>
<p>The <italic>transformationalist</italic> view of GCE rejects both the neo-liberal commitment to a single global market economy and the radical view of global institutions as simply new mechanisms of imperialism. Rather, it recognizes that globalization has ‘resulted in a complex and dynamic set of international, national and local relationships that has created new patterns of inclusion and exclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 254–255). This is not simply a matter of North/South divide but a recognition that this geographic division is being supplanted by a socioeconomic division that cuts across nations and regions. Within both the North and South ‘there exist concentrations of wealth and power along with increasing poverty and exclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461884">Schultz, 2007</xref>: 255). Such understanding requires a more complex and less ideological GCE than that presented by either neo-liberal or radical advocates. Fundamental to this view is a conception of the global citizen as one who is concerned about economic and social justice, about protecting the earth, about social and cultural diversity and about peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240912461884">Noddings, 2005</xref>). Moreover, GCE in this view is directed at understanding the vast network of personal relationships possible through the embrace of diversity and shared purpose across national boundaries.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Understanding that the complexity of citizenship in a global world is created by and creates a vast network of diverse relationships, the global citizen seeks to include and engage others based on their shared common humanity. The overarching theme of the social justice work being done to eradicate poverty and improve the life possibilities of the marginalized is <italic>a better world is possible</italic>. Not content to just challenge the unjust structures that exist, people throughout the world are joining together to create social justice … through creating democratic spaces for building inclusive community, and through action that links the local experience with the global experience.

<title>Varieties of international education</title>
<p>In discussion of education and global citizenships, Leslie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman (2003)</xref> suggests a four-fold typology: intellectual tourists, consumers of difference, democratic civilizers and relational genealogists. Each uses ‘international’ education in a distinctively different way.</p>
<p><italic>Intellectual tourists</italic>, for instance, engage in exchanges with unfamiliar people, places and cultures, the educational aim of which is to ‘achieve “cultural immersion” for the sake of promoting diversity and understanding through cultural exposure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 272). Both schools and universities promote such tourism as an educational experience that will broaden students’ experiences of other cultures and ways of life and develop an appreciation of diversity. This may well be so, but such intellectual tourism, whether real or virtual, runs the risk of confirming ‘the sense of cultural (and geographical) difference between the local defined as the Western self and the global constructed as the non-Western ‘other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 274). Such intellectual tourism may well, therefore, serve to confirm stereotypes, rather than to achieve deeper understanding of the social, political, cultural and economic factors that have shaped the lives of the ‘other’. While such educational experiences are often seen as an immediate way to internationalize or globalize the curriculum, they may also reinforce the division between national and international spaces:<disp-quote>
<p>creating the possibility for particular national spaces to function as legitimated hidden norms. While they exaggerate and reify ‘difference’ as ‘international’, ‘foreign’, ‘Third-World’, or ‘non-Western’, educational experiences of intellectual tourism freeze in time and space particular stereotypes of what such differences mean. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 274)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, the mobility of intellectual tourists only serves to confirm the <italic>immobility</italic> of those being toured, something that may well be taken for granted by the tourists. This contrast is often invisible to the tourists whose status is vastly different from the experience of those who are ‘trapped in states of class, racialized and gendered immobility [for whom] moving from place to place in global space and time becomes much the experience of being ‘unwanted vagabonds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 274). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240912461884">Bauman (1988</xref>: 93) further explores this contrast between tourists and vagabonds in observing that:<disp-quote>
<p>The tourists move because they find the world within their reach <italic>irresistibly attractive;</italic> vagabonds move because they find the world within their reach <italic>unbearably inhospitable</italic>. The tourists travel because they <italic>want to</italic>; the vagabonds because they have <italic>no other bearable choice</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Intellectual tourism as an educational device seems, therefore, to run several risks, among the most important of which are the possibility of reinforcing cultural stereotypes; confirming a sense of cultural, racial, economic superiority; and assuming that the immobility of the visited is a ‘natural’ condition without recognising the stark difference between their status as tourists and that of the visited whose limited mobility defines them as ‘unwanted vagabonds’ and ‘the waste of the world’.</p>
<p><italic>Consumers of difference</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>) are defined by a cultural and educational relationship that sees difference as a commodity. Here, linguistic and cultural behaviours become packages for consumption where ‘desirable’ behaviours (speaking English; familiarizing with Chinese or Japanese cultural norms and so on) are sold in a global market where such behaviours allow the repositioning of the individual. As Roman (1993: 276) suggests, such an approach frames the educational relationship in particular ways that serve the needs of the global marketplace:<disp-quote>
<p>Framed as consumers of international and national difference, learners and educators become differentially entitled citizen-consumers in a global marketplace in which cultural practices are mere commodities. For example, the idea of linguistic and other cultural differences becomes reduced to a marketplace commodity that can be bought or sold in exchange for particular cultural capital perceived as useful in the realm of social or workplace communication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is especially apparent in the relationship between employment and naturalization, where educational qualifications in areas of ‘skill shortage’ count towards the accumulation of points required for the achievement of citizenship. For example in Australia during the 1990’s hairdressing and cooking were listed as areas of skill shortage, resulting in the instant and widespread establishment of fly-by-night colleges and training programs designed to attract large numbers of fee-paying international students with the specific promise of Australian citizenship at the end of their course. Citizenship was for sale and the currency required for its purchase was a qualification, sometimes of dubious validity. Cultural difference, in this case Australian citizenship, was commodified through educational provision.</p>
<p>Similarly, the extensive development of English (and recently Chinese) language schools across the world also speaks to the commodification of specific cultural attributes in the pursuit of migration between states and employing organizations. Such cultural commodities, organized through educational institutions, play a significant part in the hierarchization of cultural attributes attached to global employment and migration:<disp-quote>
<p>Key to this discourse is the manner in which particular notions of cultural and linguistic difference organize what counts as effective cultural capital in a particular national space of the global market. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 277)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Roman’s <italic>democratic civilizers</italic> are the third category of educators who see education as essentially an imperial tool bringing ‘civilization’ to under-developed societies. Education in such societies is often portrayed as indoctrination, as in Western accounts of Madrassas in Pakistan which were, after 11 September 2001, portrayed as breeding grounds for anti-Western (and especially anti-American) <italic>jihadists</italic>. This point is illustrated by Willinsky (2002, quoting <italic>New York Times</italic>, 31 December 2001: 21) who points to a quotation from the New York Times where the caption to a photograph of a Madrassa reads:<disp-quote>
<p>Islamic teachings: many religious schools, or Madrassas like this one in the Northwestern Frontier Province of Pakistan, have been breeding grounds for anti-Western sentiment and have sent Muslim fighters to the front lines.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such education is seen as fostering submission to authoritarian and extremist views and in need of rectification through the establishment of alternative schools in, for instance, Pakistan (by the USA) and Indonesia (by Australia). Such schools are seen as important in establishing an extension of the democratic rights and freedoms assumed to be the ‘natural’ order or meritocratic achievement of the West, to the rest of the world. Their export to other less privileged areas of the world is part of the ‘civilizing’ mission of the West. In the discourse of this mission:<disp-quote>
<p>Democratic rights and freedoms [of Western nations] figure either as ‘natural entitlements’ … or they figure as meritocratic ones – purportedly earned by opposing ‘oppressive’ others who are thought not to appreciate democracy or freedom. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 280)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The resultant fascination with the ‘barbaric or the not-quite-civilized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 280) is matched by an uncritical lack of curiosity about the less than democratic practices in Western societies and the resultant marginalization of minorities. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240912461884">Rizvi (2003</xref>: 37–38) notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Democratic reforms are not only necessary in schools in the Islamic world but also in the West, where the goal of internationalization of the curriculum needs to be viewed more broadly than those commercial modes of practices which enable some Muslim students to buy a Western education. It must focus on the values of intellectual complexity and openness. Students need to be taught to think and speak with subtlety and depth, and to listen to others. They must be taught to become more attentive to global issues and to cultures that they have been taught in the past to consider as remote and disconnected from their everyday life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such an education is as necessary in Western societies as elsewhere in order to ‘move beyond older imperial models of a world divided between the civilized and the barbaric’ (Willinsky, 2002). In short, the discourse of democratic civilizers needs to be replaced by a ‘global intelligence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912461884">Benhabib, 2002</xref>: 253) that prepares students as partners in a global civilization that acknowledges the struggles of those who are unfamiliar to us but also not so different from struggles in our own past. Global intelligence requires the development of moral imagination through which we see the world through the eyes of others, and through which we commit ourselves to build cultural bridges across regimes of fear and suspicion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240912461884">Rizvi, 2003</xref>: 25).</p>
<p><italic>Relational genealogists</italic> are the fourth group of Roman’s curricular theorists; those who see the local and global not as fixed entities or cultures as people with essentialist characteristics but both as socially and historically constructed sets of relationships and as inter-related across time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 283). This alternative focuses on the interconnectedness between communities and, in particular, the ways in which these interconnections have been shaped by historical struggles. Comparisons between cultures and communities are to be viewed through a discourse focused on ‘historical, genealogic relationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461884">Roman, 2003</xref>: 283):<disp-quote>
<p>This entails teaching educators and students how to pay historical attention to the uneven, contradictory and often conflicting interests of power in the social relations that define the stakes in and boundaries of belonging to particular communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Global processes and interconnections are fundamental to such an approach, as are issues of social justice and global/local social struggles and their connections to social movements. Discourse of this kind is expected to unearth common interests and struggles as well as what is interconnected, shared or different in educators’ and learners’ experiences. It pays attention to the ways in which communities, interests and voices are constituted and to whose voices are included or excluded from public debates. It pursues issues that are common across boundaries despite uneven and unequal material contexts.</p>

<title>International education and international schools</title>
<p>So where does all this leave international schools? The first thing to recognize is that there is a huge variety of international schools serving different clienteles and managed with differing aims in mind. The second is to recognize that, as with most schools, individual international schools may serve several masters and embrace a variety of views as to the curricular purposes of the school. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240912461884">Caffyn (2011)</xref> suggests, the micro-politics of schools constantly exhibit the conflicts between such views and the struggles for dominance.</p>
<p>These struggles often centre on the three basic message systems of the school: curriculum (what counts as official knowledge), pedagogy (what counts as approved forms of instruction) and assessment (what counts as appropriate realization of knowledge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240912461884">Bernstein, 1975</xref>). Each of these message systems can be defined in differing ways – especially, as in the case of international schools, where both local demands and international standards and criteria must be met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912461884">Bates, 2011</xref>). Moreover the development of new technologies such as the Internet allows the subversion of ‘official’ curricular boundaries by teachers and students alike. For instance, while the official curriculum may well focus on skill formation appropriate to continuous innovation in technology and production in the global economy, the Internet also gives access to information on the negative impact of the globalization of production – instability, gross inequalities, environmental degradation, political and economic repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>: 287). The dimensions of debates over curriculum are likely to follow the distinctions set out above regarding differing forms of citizenship and global citizenship education. However, it is arguable that a truly international curriculum would be one that allowed the development of the skills and dispositions necessary for the construction and maintenance of both a global economy and a global society: both production and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>: 287).</p>
<p>If what is to count as knowledge (the curriculum) is a matter for debate, then so is what are to count as approved forms of instruction (pedagogy). Here the contemporary problem facing teachers is that of the motivation of pupils. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912461884">Elliott (2007</xref>: 182) puts it:<disp-quote>
<p>If the traditional view of knowledge … continues to be deeply embedded in school cultures … then schools will fail as educational institutions, not because they are failing to maintain ‘standards’ but because they are failing to supply the culturally appropriate form of motivation for pupils to learn.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Elliott’s view the culturally appropriate form of motivation is that of autonomous learning. Contemporary technologies make such autonomous learning realizable, but this requires a change in the role of the teacher from didacticism towards helping students develop creativity, values and commitments through which to structure their learning. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240912461884">Taylor (1989)</xref> has argued, creativity, values and commitments are both individual <italic>and</italic> social constructions. Indeed, how the social context of creativity, values and commitments is understood is vital to the students’ construction of their selves. Locating autonomous learning within the debates outlined above is a crucial ingredient of international pedagogy.</p>
<p>The third message system of the school – assessment – is also subject to contemporary shifts in understanding. While traditional views of assessment are largely focused on the comparison of student performance against the official curriculum, changes in knowledge production and dissemination as well as a shift towards autonomous learning that integrates knowledge acquisition with creativity, values and commitments presents a significant problem to traditional forms of assessment. Rather than the relatively simple task of ranking pupils against each other or against specific definitions of knowledge:<disp-quote>
<p>The central assessment issue for educational institutions has now become that of how teachers and learners are to devise ways of testing validity claims – of testing the validity of information and knowledge claims that are new to both. This is by no means a simple issue, but contemporary circumstances force the issue to the centre of the curriculum and pedagogy of educational institutions. The open curriculum and an autonomous pedagogy require tests for truth and utility that are centred around individual and social purpose. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>: 289)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such purposes are shaped by both global and local understandings. Global forces associated with economic and social change shape local contexts, but it is the local context that provides particular experiences that shape the activities of students and their families. Assessment of the validity and utility of knowledge at both local and global levels becomes ineluctably associated with the idea of purpose, purpose arising from the particular concerns of autonomous learners. This makes traditional ideas of assessment of performance against set criteria, determined externally from the classroom and school, highly problematic. Again, assessment must be set within the debates over purpose, creativity, values and commitments arising from the debates outlined above rather than be seen as a simply technical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461884">Bates, 2008</xref>: 289, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912461884">2011</xref>: 162).</p>

<title>Global citizenship and international schools</title>
<p>Returning to the question with which this article began: ‘is global citizenship possible, and can international schools provide it?’, various answers have been provided in the preceding discussion. While in strict legal terms global citizenship is not possible, in metaphorical terms a number of different possible definitions and categories of global citizenship and global citizenship education have been outlined. Moreover, the issue of for whom such global citizenship might be possible has been raised, as well as the issue of how it might relate to the marginalized whose citizenship of their own nation states is insecure. International schools will locate themselves within this variety of approaches to global citizenship in different ways depending on context, clientele and ambitions. Where they locate themselves will affect the message systems of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment that they adopt.</p>
<p>So the answer to the question is that international schools can contribute to the development of various global citizenships. Indeed, they are busy doing so. The idea of citizenship does, however, imply obligations as well as benefits. Citizens of nation states have obligations to all other citizens of that state. It follows, therefore, that global citizens have obligations to all other citizens of the globe, privileged or not. How members of international schools might address these obligations is, therefore, an issue of some importance, for the idea of global citizenship presupposes the inclusion of the excluded and marginalized as global citizens with rights and obligations similar to those who currently see themselves as global citizens. The enhancement of such citizenship is a worthy goal for international schools.</p>
