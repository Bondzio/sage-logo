<title>Introduction</title>
<p>John M. Dunn, President of Western Michigan University, said “Truly great universities must be diverse. They must be inclusive and there must be programs committed to recruiting and supporting others who may feel excluded” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192711435562">Dunn, 2009</xref>, p. 272). He asserted that “we must have a greater presence of individuals who come from underrepresented communities in our professional ranks as faculty members, scholars, and researchers” (p. 275). To that end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge and Wiggins (2010)</xref> advocate establishing principles and policies to successfully recruit and hire more African American faculty in physical education (PE) programs and departments at doctorate-granting universities in the United States. In this article, we extend that advocacy to include Hispanic faculty.</p>
<p>The presence of full-time faculty of color at colleges and universities in the United States has increased from 13% to 17% in the years 1995 to 2007, based on a total faculty count excluding persons whose race/ethnicity was unknown. More specifically, Asian American (7.6%), Black (5.4%), Hispanic (3.6%), and Native American (0.5%) faculty made up about 17% of full-time faculty in fall 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1538192711435562">Snyder, Dillow, &amp; Hoffman, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, most (76.8%) full-time faculty at U.S. colleges and universities are White (44.7% men, 32.1% women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1538192711435562">Ryu, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, and still today, Hispanic faculty are underrepresented, particularly women at leading doctoral-granting universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1538192711435562">Towns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1538192711435562">Turner, 2002</xref>). Many of them work at community colleges and Hispanic serving institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538192711435562">1</xref></sup> rather than at leading doctorate-granting universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1538192711435562">Provasnik &amp; Planty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1538192711435562">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>). Typically, leading doctorate-granting universities are predominantly White institutions. Today, there is a wealth of literature on the experiences of Hispanic faculty in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435562">Aguirre, Martinez, &amp; Hernandez, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero, Manlove, Manlove, &amp; Hernandez, 2007</xref>), but little is known about Hispanic faculty in physical education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to discuss challenges and identify strategies to increase the representation of Hispanic faculty in the academy, particularly in PE programs and departments. First, we discuss the historical representation and contemporary status of Hispanic faculty in higher education. Second, we discuss challenges faced by Hispanic faculty in the academy, particularly those at doctorate-granting universities with a focus on recruiting, hiring, retaining, tenuring, and promoting Hispanic faculty. Third, we propose ways to increase the presence and improve the experiences of Hispanic faculty in the academy.</p>

<title>Representation and Status of Hispanic Faculty</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1538192711435562">U.S. Census Bureau (2008)</xref> estimated that by the year 2050 one in three U.S. residents will likely be identified as Hispanic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538192711435562">2</xref></sup> (non-White). <italic>Hispanic</italic> is an ethnic category, not racial category; as Hispanic groups may be of any race but with their own ethno-specific values, attitudes, and behaviors. The U.S. Department of Education defines Hispanic as persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1538192711435562">Planty et al., 2009</xref>). Today, Mexican Americans are the largest Hispanic group in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192711435562">American Community Survey, 2007</xref>). Despite a growing Hispanic population nationally, the proportion of Hispanic faculty in the academy has not changed markedly over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1538192711435562">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2010</xref>). Data from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) show that from 1995 to 2007 full-time higher education faculty as a whole experienced a 28% increase, totaling 703,463 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192711435562">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, even though Hispanic faculty increased by 93% from 12,942 to 24,975 during that same time period, they still were less than 4% of the overall full-time faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1538192711435562">NCES, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192711435562">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1538192711435562">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>). Admittedly, important growth has occurred in the number of full-time Hispanic faculty in the academy. Still, the growth is minimal, compared to the disproportionate representation of full-time White faculty in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1538192711435562">Ryu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1538192711435562">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Hispanic Faculty in Colleges of Education and PE</title>
<p>Broadly speaking, Hispanic faculty members are underrepresented in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538192711435562">Jones &amp; Castellanos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1538192711435562">Perna, Li, Walsh, &amp; Raible, 2010</xref>). Specific to physical education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192711435562">Ayers and Housner’s (2008)</xref> national survey revealed that physical education teacher education (PETE) programs were comprised of mostly White faculty with nearly equal proportions of men (51%) and women (48%). They explained that 92% of the programs consisted of 60% or more faculty cohorts who were White. However, when the six historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) were removed from the data set, the share of programs reporting 60% or more White faculty increased to 96%. The majority (60% to 79%) of PETE programs had fewer than 10% African American, Asian, or Hispanic faculty, and some programs had no faculty of color. Although research about Hispanic faculty in physical education is undeveloped, it appears that the underrepresentation of these faculty follows similar historical trends as that in the field of education as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). Our discourse draws on the extant literature about Hispanic faculty in higher education, which reflects the status quo in PE programs. Overall faculty in education increased by 35% between 1992 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192711435562">NCES, 2009</xref>). In that time frame, Hispanic faculty increased by 1,176 additional positions. That is, the increase of Hispanic faculty in education was from 3% in 1992 to 5% in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192711435562">NCES, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1538192711435562">Perna et al. (2010)</xref> analyzed the <italic>equity status</italic> of Hispanic students, faculty, and administrators at various 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The equity index compares the proportional representation of groups for a particular outcome (e.g., retention) with the representation of the group among the relevant reference population. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1538192711435562">Perna et al. (2010)</xref>, equity indices are useful in assessing equity for several reasons, for instance, “the results of the calculation are easy to interpret and provide clear benchmarks” (p. 150). Furthermore, an equity “index that is equal to one indicates that equity has been achieved, whereas an index that is less than one is below equity and an index that is greater than one is above equity” (p. 150). Perna et al. used equity index formulas to analyze data on high school graduates from Florida and Texas (two of the states with the largest Hispanic populations). They found disparities and inequalities for enrollment among Hispanic students particularly at predominantly White universities in both Florida and Texas (38% and 59% below the equity index, respectively). Inequalities were also observed for full-time faculty status in public 4-year colleges and universities. Furthermore, they identified marked inequities for Hispanic persons in executive, administrative, and managerial staff positions. The largest disparities in equity occurred for full-time Hispanic faculty and at the public flagship universities in both states. Perna et al. concluded that the equity index for Hispanic persons declines as they move along academic ranks. In general, their findings support the argument that not enough has been done to address the lack of Hispanic faculty in institutions of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192711435562">Castellanos &amp; Jones, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538192711435562">
<title>Status of Hispanic Faculty</title>
<p>The trend for more than two decades has been that colleges and universities tend to fill what previously were full-time tenure-track faculty positions with part-time adjunct faculty or graduate assistants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192711435562">Cooper, 2009</xref>). From 1992 to 2007, for instance, the total number of part-time faculty and instructional staff increased by 77% compared to a 33% increase of full-time faculty. In that time, there was a 50% increase in White part-time faculty and instructional staff. But much larger proportional increases took place for faculty of color. There were increases of 104% for Asian American, 169% for Black, and 138% for Hispanic part-time faculty and instructional staff.</p>
<p>Specific to institutional type, Hispanic faculty represented 5.9% of all full-time faculty and instructional staff at public 2-year institutions (e.g., community and junior colleges). However, they were only 3% of the full-time faculty at the 6,705 Title IV degree-granting institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538192711435562">3</xref></sup> in the United States and its outlying areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1538192711435562">Knapp, Kelly-Reid, Whitmore, &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>). Today, there are greater percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at 2-year community colleges than at public or private 4-year colleges and universities. Nonetheless, 80% to 85% of the faculty at all three types of institutions are White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1538192711435562">Provasnik &amp; Planty, 2008</xref>). Moreover, 32% of Hispanic faculty work at Hispanic-serving institutions. For Hispanic faculty at 2-year community and junior colleges, this proportion was even higher, with more than half working at Hispanic-serving colleges. Hispanic persons accounted for 25% of all employees at Hispanic-serving institutions in 1999. They were the second largest racial/ethnic group after White, non-Hispanic faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1538192711435562">Stearns, Watanabe, &amp; Snyder, 2002</xref>). In 2007, there were l80 Hispanic-serving institutions in the continental United States and another 32 in Puerto Rico that were members of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538192711435562">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192711435562">de los Santos &amp; Vega, 2008</xref>). Hispanic-serving institutions are concentrated mostly in either the Western (42%) or Southwest (33%) states, which reflects the high concentration (60%) of the general Hispanic population in these two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1538192711435562">Li, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another issue is that Asian American and White faculty are more likely than Black and Hispanic faculty to be promoted, hold tenure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192711435562">Table 2</xref>), and work at leading doctorate-granting institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla, 2003</xref>). In contrast, Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely to be hired into part-time adjunct positions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538192711435562">Table 3</xref>) rather than hired into the ranks of full-time faculty at leading doctorate-granting universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1538192711435562">Knapp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1538192711435562">Snyder et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Challenges Associated With Hispanic Faculty in the Academy</title>
<p>There is rich body of research on the experiences of Hispanic faculty at U.S. colleges and universities across various career areas including education, educational administration, library and information science, medicine, and theological education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435562">Aguirre et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711435562">González, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435562">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1538192711435562">Martinez, Hernandez, &amp; Aguirre, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1538192711435562">Quezada &amp; Louque, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1538192711435562">Soto-Greene, Sanchez, Churrango, &amp; Salas-Lopez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1538192711435562">Turner, Hernández, Peña, &amp; González, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1538192711435562">Verdugo, 2003</xref>). In this article, we focus mainly on the experiences of Hispanic faculty in higher education in regard to challenges they have voiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435562">González, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>The status of Hispanic faculty is that they are mostly located at master’s colleges and universities, baccalaureate and associate colleges including Hispanic-serving institutions (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching). Hispanic faculty may “find themselves in relatively low-status, non-tenure-track positions with little hope of advancement or entry into the power structure of academia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero et al., 2007</xref>, p. 37). They are more likely to be hired into nontenure track positions than Asian and White faculty. This means less job security. Hispanic faculty, particularly women can expect lower salaries with less potential for financial growth or social mobility. To date, however, the research base is undeveloped on the experiences of Hispanic faculty in physical education at leading doctorate-granting universities.</p>

<title>Recruiting, Hiring, Retaining, Tenuring, and Promoting Hispanic Faculty</title>
<p>Increasingly there has been dialogue about recruiting, hiring, retaining, mentoring, tenuring, and promoting faculty of color at doctorate-granting universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192711435562">Dumas-Hines, Cochran, &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538192711435562">Ibarra, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1538192711435562">Turner, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge and Wiggins (2010)</xref> assert that the goal to faculty diversification, both culturally (changing the academic culture) and politically (exposing hidden agendas and biases), is complex and therefore difficult to accomplish. Mindful of such complexities, eight areas where challenges are common to recruiting, hiring, retaining, tenuring, and promoting Hispanic PE faculty are discussed next.</p>
<p>First is the low presence of Hispanic students in PE doctoral programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1538192711435562">Thomas (2003)</xref> argued that difficulties common to attracting faculty of color to leading doctorate-granting institutions are “a direct result of our failure to attract students of color to our doctoral programs” (p. 8). He also asserted that to realize a diverse faculty in the academy that reflects the world’s diversity, our graduate programs must start by achieving a diverse cohort of doctoral students. Though research on the experiences of Hispanic doctoral students in PE was not identified, only <italic>6</italic> (2.6%) of the 228 doctoral degrees conferred in physical activity–related disciplines in academic year 2007-2008 were awarded to Hispanic graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1538192711435562">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the academic year of 2007-2008, there were 29,931 bachelor’s, 4,440 master’s and 228 doctoral degrees conferred in Park, Recreation, Leisure, and Fitness Studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538192711435562">5</xref></sup> at colleges and universities in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1538192711435562">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2010</xref>). Degrees conferred across this mix of disciplines (e.g., exercise science, motor behavior, PE pedagogy) were awarded mostly to White (73.9%) followed by international (11.2%) graduates. Much less so, doctoral degrees were awarded to Asian/Pacific Islanders (2.6%), Black (2.6%), Hispanic (2.6%), and Native American (0.4%) graduates across those disciplines. Recent empirical studies also confirm the low numbers of Hispanic students in PE programs. For example, based on data from a national survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192711435562">Melville and Hammermeister (2006)</xref> reported that most PE majors/minors were White (83%) and male (62.5%). On the other hand, only 8% were Hispanic (6% men, 2% women) students.</p>
<p>Second, even with the best intentions, frequently very few, if any, diverse candidates are hired when the hiring cycle ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435562">DiversityWorks, 2003</xref>). Arguably there is hesitancy, mostly by some Whites, to hire Hispanic and other faculty of color into higher education positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538192711435562">Heaggans &amp; Polka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1538192711435562">Stanley, 2006</xref>). This is especially true where faculty or administrators question the credibility or quality of degrees earned at HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions, which are institutions that serve a large proportion of Black and Hispanic students, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). Third, some administrators and faculty at leading doctorate-granting institutions insist that there are too few Hispanic students in the academic pipeline to draw on for qualified candidates from which to expand the ethnic diversity of faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1538192711435562">Opp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1538192711435562">Smith, Turner, Osei-Kofi, &amp; Richards, 2004</xref>). That is, the low number of Hispanic students in higher education limits the pool of Hispanic students likely to become higher education faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538192711435562">Jones &amp; Castellanos, 2003</xref>). This argument is supported by reports from the NCES where Hispanic students received only 7.8% of bachelor’s and 5.8% of master’s degrees in academic year 2007-2008. In fact, Hispanic students were more likely to receive an associate degree (12.2%) than a bachelor’s degree or graduate degree from a 4-year institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192711435562">NCES, 2009</xref>). Hispanic graduates received only 3.5% of doctorate degree awarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192711435562">NCES, 2009</xref>). In other words, the
<disp-quote>
<p>projected increase of school-age Latinos will increase the pool of students at the K-12 end of the educational pipeline; however, without effective interventions, the higher education end of this pipeline will remain narrow, and only a small number of Latinos with graduate degrees will be produced. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435562">Chapa &amp; De La Rosa, 2006</xref>, p. 203)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The pipeline phenomenon limits the pool of Hispanic persons who are prepared to assume faculty positions in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192711435562">Chapa &amp; De La Rosa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435562">González, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, Hispanic faculty are typically not a part of the main networks of senior faculty and administrators from leading doctorate-granting institutions and consequently may not be informed about or invited to apply to a position opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1538192711435562">Turner, 2002</xref>). Fifth, a common belief among some faculty at leading doctorate-granting institutions is that degrees from their institutions are more credible than degrees from HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions. This view is manifested in the reluctance of some at doctorate-granting institutions to hire Hispanic individuals who graduate from or work at such institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sixth, although in the name of diversity a number of leading doctorate-granting institutions recruit faculty of color (e.g., African American and Hispanic), only a limited number of these universities institutionalize specific programs designed to retain such faculty when hired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1538192711435562">Thompson, 2008</xref>). Seventh, and also troubling, some academic units give full attention to hiring faculty of one particular group while neglecting potential faculty of other underrepresented groups. In recent years, for instance, many doctorate-granting institutions have “diversified their faculty” by hiring Asian faculty with greater frequency than persons from all other ethnic minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). There is evidence of this phenomenon in that the number of Asian American faculty increased by 72.4% from some 31,060 to 53,557 between 1997 to 2007 constituting the second largest numerical gain after White faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1538192711435562">Ryu, 2010</xref>). Faculty must avoid biases in their hiring practices that advantages one ethnic group over another.</p>
<p>Another troubling issue is that Hispanic faculty may experience discrimination (e.g., biases in the tenure and promotion process) linked to racism or White male hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192711435562">Delgado-Romero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1538192711435562">Reyes &amp; Halcón, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1538192711435562">Villalpando &amp; Delgado Bernal, 2002</xref>). For years, Hispanic faculty have voiced concerns about racism, discrimination, tokenism, sexism (particularly Latinas), isolation, marginalization, and White privilege in academe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435562">Aguirre et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435562">González, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1538192711435562">Verdugo, 2003</xref>). Under such conditions, Hispanic members may feel isolated, particularly as the <italic>only one</italic> or one of a small number of persons of color in higher education programs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192711435562">González (2007b)</xref> interviewed Hispanic women (Latinas) about their doctoral education experiences. Although the women were resilient during their doctoral programs, they spoke about feelings of isolation and how they overcame these feelings. They spoke of “having to search for mentors, peers, and colleagues outside of their department because many times they were the only Latinas in their departments” (p. 294). González asserted that the women “used resistance in the process of maintaining their autonomy because in racially and ethnically discriminatory institutions they felt the constant need to refute negativity about their ethnicity, gender, and culture” as they “continued to excel academically” (p. 296).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435562">Aguirre et al. (1993)</xref> found that faculty of color (i.e., African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American) were typically less satisfied than White faculty with employment, salary, promotion opportunities, performance evaluation, and everyday relations with colleagues at predominantly White colleges and universities. The extant literature indicates that Hispanic faculty experience feelings of marginality due to their exclusion from mainstream decision making, and a lack of status and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192711435562">Aguirre et al., 1993</xref>). Notwithstanding diversity-related roles and positions, Hispanic faculty typically have few opportunities in academe for assuming leadership roles or positions with the potential for advanced leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1538192711435562">Martinez et al., 1993</xref>). That is to say, Hispanic and other faculty of color are often marginalized by way of exclusion from institutional activities that govern academic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1538192711435562">Martinez et al., 1993</xref>). This jeopardizes their success in the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another issue is the marginalization or discrediting of research <italic>about</italic> and <italic>by</italic> Hispanic and other persons of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>).

<p>By discrediting feminist and minority research, the academic workplace reinforces the peripheral position of women and minority faculty and questions the legitimacy of their presence in academe . . . In discrediting their research, academia also negates the professional socialization of women and minority faculty, especially their membership in a community of scholars . . . That is, women and minority faculty receive the message that their research is not worthy of merit and, as a result, does not legitimate their inclusion in the academic community. (p. 34)</p>

<p>In such a White male hegemonic culture, even the most diligent and productive Hispanic faculty member is disadvantaged in the tenure and promotion process.</p>

<title>Recommendations With Promise</title>
<p>Scholars in physical education have identified strategies to guide faculty and administrators in establishing principles and policies for diversifying student and faculty groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192711435562">Hodge, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192711435562">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192711435562">Hodge, Faison-Hodge, &amp; Burden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1538192711435562">King, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1538192711435562">King &amp; Chepyator-Thomson, 1996</xref>). Next, we expand on their ideas for recruiting, hiring, retaining, tenuring, and promoting Hispanic faculty in academe, particularly in PE doctoral programs. We firmly believe that these strategies can be generalized to all faculty of color in academe.</p>
<sec id="section8-1538192711435562">
<title>Sustainable Commitments to Diversity in Times of Economic Crises</title>
<p>Sustainable commitments to diversity go beyond periodic ethnic festivals and celebrations but rather are based on establishing and implementing principles, policies, and goals that advance diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192711435562">Allison, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1538192711435562">Palermo et al. (2008)</xref> discuss how programs can advance ethnic diversity of faculty despite cutbacks in federal funding for such programs. The Northeast Consortium for Faculty Diversity is such an example. The goal of the Consortium is to increase the diversity of the nation’s college and university faculties. There are several Consortium campuses, and each brings one or more doctoral-level graduate students of color (e.g., African American, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Native American) to its campus for a 12-month period for advanced study. While on these campuses, the students of color can devote ample time and focus on the completion of their dissertations as well as become familiar with their host campus and host department. Likewise, PE programs and departments could establish and sponsor university-based consortiums to expose Hispanic and other graduate students of color to research and scholarship, identify and bond with established faculty mentors, provide access to technologies and other resources, and expand interpersonal contacts through networking. Pooling economic and human resources through such consortium initiatives would help increase the presence and retention of talented Hispanic students in graduate programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1538192711435562">
<title>Increase Representation of Hispanic Students in Doctoral Programs</title>
<p>Greater efforts must be made by leading graduate programs in recruiting Hispanic students to pursue doctoral degrees to increase the pool of Hispanic students in the academic pipeline. They are underrepresented in leading PE doctoral programs, for example. Undoubtedly, there is a direct relationship between obtaining a doctoral degree in a particular discipline and the potential to secure a faculty position in that discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192711435562">Aguirre, 2000</xref>). Therefore faculty at leading doctorate-granting institutions should do more to identify and mentor students of color early on in the educational pipeline (e.g., undergraduate students) so they are prepared to undertake study and eventually careers in various disciplines, such as physical education.</p>
<p>Of particular importance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711435562">Davis (2008)</xref> examined the mentoring component of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation’s (CIC) Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP). This program is implemented on various college and university campuses throughout the United States. Its goal is to establish a diverse faculty by encouraging the enrollment and completion rates of doctoral students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711435562">Davis, 2008</xref>). On 15 different campuses, Davis found that faculty mentorship in the CIC’s SROP was essential in nurturing the academic socialization processes of students of color. The importance of mentoring was realized across several dimensions: (a) individual, (b) interpersonal, (c) group, and (d) extraprogrammatic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192711435562">Davis (2008)</xref> explained these dimensions:</p>
<list id="list1-1538192711435562" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The individual influence of mentorship refers to the impact of experts’ mentoring in promoting self-assessment, personal development or acquisition of skills for novices. A mentorship’s individual influence may also affect one’s aspirations or values.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mentorship’s interpersonal influence refers to its role in building professional relationships through face-to-face interaction between a mentor and protégé (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435562">Davis, 2005</xref>). Such interactions may take place in a professional, social, or academic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435562">Davis, 2005</xref>). Getting to know mentors beyond the lecture hall yields moral support, enhances training, and facilitates socialization, benefits not generally experienced in the traditional classroom setting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mentorship’s collective influence refers to interaction within a group, such as that which occurs in a student’s relationship with their SROP cohort, other CIC program participants, or peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435562">Davis, 2005</xref>). Student participants “accepted responsibility for each other,” providing a communal sense of accountability for individual program completion. Such a culture of accountability created a positive environment for the SROP and may have contributed to its high completion rate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mentorship’s impact on the extraprogrammatic realm refers to influence occurring outside the immediate program environment–at the institutional, family, or societal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192711435562">Davis, 2005</xref>). (pp. 282-289)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Davis’ results further confirm the importance and influence of mentoring students of color in academe. Higher education faculty should actively participate in the CIC’s SROP and mentor students of color who are interested such disciplines as physical education teacher education.</p>
<p>Educational departments independently and through consortium initiatives should develop strategic or <italic>diversity action plans</italic> to identify their diversity-related goals. They should articulate in such plans, strategies to achieve the stated goals, persons or groups responsible for leadership on specific initiatives, timelines for meeting the goals, and mechanisms to evaluate successes and failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, these plans should include long-term efforts to increase Hispanic students completing PE degrees from undergraduate to graduate levels through mentoring in research and grant writing, workshops, and networking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge and Wiggins (2010)</xref> asserted that such plans should also include public recognition (e.g., Diversity Award) and financial rewards (honorariums, scholarships) as incentives and to acknowledge and reward faculty, staff, and students who are diversity leaders and activists. They point out the importance of leadership in these types of efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1538192711435562">
<title>Valuing Diversification and Hispanic Faculty Representation</title>
<p>Commitment to diversification of programs should go beyond simply hiring one Hispanic faculty. Rather, it should be reflective of a conscious commitment to restructuring the underlying values of the program about diversity and representation of the Hispanic community in PE programs and departments in doctorate-granting universities. First, faculty surely must avoid biases in their hiring practices that advantages one ethnic/racial group over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, faculty, administrators, and search committees must spend adequate time understanding what conditions affect whether or not a “diverse candidate applies, accepts, or stays” and listen to the <italic>voices</italic>, “experiences, perceptions, and recommendations of diverse faculty” at their respective colleges and universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192711435562">DiversityWorks, 2003</xref>, p. 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192711435562">González (2007a)</xref> asserted that recruitment and hiring of Hispanic faculty should be focused on academic disciplines in greater need and for certain ranks (e.g., tenured-track) and deliberate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538192711435562">
<title>Strategic Advertisement of PE Faculty Positions</title>
<p>Search committees for PE programs and departments interested in recruiting Hispanic faculty must take steps to disseminate and advertise positions within and beyond the traditional avenues (e.g., the <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic>). Search committees and/or administrators should also contact Hispanic faculty who may recommend other colleagues and/or to suggest where searches may be advertised. In addition, searches may also be conducted by contacting leading Hispanic academic organizations (e.g., American Association of Hispanics in Higher Education, Hispanic and Bilingual SIGs of the AERA) who may disseminate among its memberships the faculty search positions (R. Garza, personal communication, May 11, 2010).</p>
<p>Lastly, a useful strategy in the search process is to advertise faculty positions in popular as well as scholarly publications with a large readership of Hispanic individuals, these include <italic>Diverse Issues in Higher Education, Hispanic Research Journal, International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism, Journal of Hispanic Higher Education, Journal of Health, Physical Education and Recreation</italic>, and <italic>The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education</italic> as examples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1538192711435562">
<title>Personalized Recruitment of Hispanic Faculty</title>
<p>In addition to advertising PE faculty positions in popular and scholarly publication outlets and networking with Hispanic organizations, faculty search committees should also engage in active and personalized recruitment efforts (L. Vela, personal communication, May 11, 2010). That is, assuming that a candidate would take a position at an institution where people of color have historically been marginalized may not be a realistic idea unless the university and/or search committee undertakes an active approach to establish relationships with Hispanic-serving institutions and Hispanic community organizations. In addition, personalized strategies as phone calls, direct one-on-one communication, and invitations to campus to interact with candidates who are targeted to fill a faculty position are important. In addition, search committees must share with the candidate relevant information about the university and community. It is important to understand that when considering whether to take a new faculty position at a given institution Hispanic candidates will likely look beyond just earning an income but also for a place they will likely feel they belong, a place they may call home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1538192711435562">
<title>Retain Hispanic Faculty</title>
<p>Once hired, to retain Hispanic faculty, academic programs must be committed to cultural shifts where these faculty benefit from mentoring, guidance, collegial support, and respect as opposed to experiencing isolation, exclusion, or tokenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192711435562">Hodge et al., 2004</xref>). The types of successes that support retention also leads to a higher likelihood of Hispanic faculty receiving tenure and promotion being largely contingent on many often complex and interrelated factors. These are discussed next.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge and Wiggins (2010)</xref> insist that “administrators, personnel committees, and senior faculty [should] explicitly articulate standards, expectations, and procedures for career advancement to newly hired faculty” (p. 53). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1538192711435562">Wilkinson (2007)</xref> asserted that no one faculty member should be expected to “serve on all the committees on which you’d like your department to be represented as ‘diverse’, for example, and ‘one person can’t instantly diversify your faculty’” (p. 170). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla (2003)</xref> discussed the “obligation factor” wherein Hispanic faculty will often feel obligated to “accept onerous administrative assignments and service work” (p. 188). This may include service on various college and departmental committees, student advisory roles, and community work. For sure, “administrative and service work takes away from the faculty member’s efforts to conduct research, publish, and develop a record of teaching excellence” (Padilla, 2007, p. 188). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1538192711435562">Wilson (2007)</xref> discussed the politics associated with the denial of tenure to a Hispanic faculty member, who ironically was responsible for promoting diversity at her institution. Mentoring and other efforts and incentives should be geared to improve each faculty member’s research, publications, and evidence of teaching excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1538192711435562">Mendoza, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Strong leadership by administrators and academic faculty is a key in establishing a climate and culture that welcomes, embraces, and facilitates the success of Hispanic faculty at leading doctorate-granting universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192711435562">Gordon, 2004</xref>). Black and Hispanic faculty must be protected from unrealistic expectations and overburdening obligations. These faculty groups must be confident that their research foci and methodologies are valued and respected by their colleagues. This is critical to receiving tenure and promotion in the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). Yet sometimes “a junior professor espouses a theory or method that goes counter to the senior professors in the department or the college, the untenured professor runs the risk of bad reviews for tenure and promotion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla, 2003</xref>, pp. 186-187). Padilla argued that the less than favorable reviews are typically credited to concern for the quality of the candidate’s work. Realistically, “it is very difficult to distinguish between poor academic work and paradigm clashes” and typically “the senior professors prevail, thus opening the way for distortions” (p. 187) in the process and the marginalizing of research focused on such issues as social justice and ethnic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192711435562">Padilla, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>More and more professional organizations including the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance; Association of American Universities; American Association of University Professors; American Council on Education; and National Association of Kinesiology and Physical Education in Higher Education have supported diversity initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). These professional entities can more aggressively promote faculty diversity in PE programs and departments by instituting annual recognition of those who have mentored graduate students of color in research and scholarship; instituting consortiums or symposia on issues of diversity and social justice; and identifying students of color, particularly Black and Hispanic, who are raising talents for recruitment as doctoral students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1538192711435562">Wilson, 2003</xref>) and ultimately as faculty to leading doctorate-granting universities.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>Administrators and faculty who seek to optimize the learning environment for Hispanic and all other college students should strive to increase the number of Hispanic faculty who are hired and retained. This is important because Hispanic and other faculty of color bring diverse cultural perspectives, knowledge, and life experiences that make campus environments more conducive to learning and personal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538192711435562">Hubbard &amp; Stage, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192711435562">Harris, Joyner, and Slate (2010)</xref> asserted that although
<disp-quote>
<p>increasing the number of Hispanic faculty members does not necessarily narrow the gap with the number of White faculty, not doing so is guaranteed to result in the maintenance of the status quo at best and in widening the gap, at worst. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Congruent with the aforementioned recommendations, they argue that “specialized efforts should be made to intentionally and affirmatively identify, recruit, hire, and retain Hispanic faculty members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192711435562">Harris et al., 2010</xref>, p. 73). We also agree with their assertion that
<disp-quote>
<p>Whatever strategy is used, it should involve careful, intentional planning that includes an array of stakeholders. The conventional, parsimonious practice of making hiring decisions based on a narrowly circumscribed circle of professional and personal acquaintances has to end. The socio-economic implications for not ending such practices are enormous, especially as the rapidly changing demographics in the nation are considered that point to an ever-increasing presence of Hispanics in United States communities, workplaces, and educational institutions. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is clear that a need exists for establishing principles and policies to recruit, hire, mentor, tenure, and promote greater numbers of Hispanics in the academy successfully, particularly in PE programs at leading doctoral-granting colleges and universities. This will require putting forth institutionalized effort and having realistic expectations, ensuring they have culturally relevant mentoring, supporting their research agendas, and protecting their workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192711435562">Branch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192711435562">Hodge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538192711435562">Hodge &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). We are hopeful that socially just faculty diversification will be realized within the nation’s leading doctoral-granting programs.</p>
