<abstract>
<p>Many explanations exist for the resurgence of the Major League Baseball (MLB) fan base following the 1994-1995 strike. The most prevalent explanations include the 1998 McGuire-Sosa homerun race and Cal Ripken Jr.’s consecutive games record. While such explanations certainly impacted fan interest in the sport, it is remiss to ignore the impact of online fantasy baseball leagues, which surfaced in 1997. This article examines the extent to which participating in a fantasy baseball league influences the MLB game attendance. The results strongly suggest that fantasy baseball participation positively influences MLB game attendance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 1993, when the Gallup organization began its survey, 49% of Americans on average have claimed to be fans of baseball.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511409120">1</xref>
</sup> This figure has remained fairly steady with the exception of the drop in 1995 to 45% which was most likely due to the 1994-1995 players strike and the rise to 56% in 1998-1999 on the heels of the McGuire-Sosa home run derby and Cal Ripken Jr.’s consecutive game record.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511409120">2</xref>
</sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511409120">Isley (2006)</xref>, “the scientific polling data trend offers convincing evidence that baseball is about as popular now as during any period since the late 1930s.”</p>
<p>Even with the long list of alternative leisure activities available to younger audiences today, and the apparent dominance of a few franchises in the past decade, baseball still appears to be one of America’s favorite pastimes, managing to keep, on average, a fan base of almost one out of every two Americans for each of the past 15 years. Part of the explanation is surely due to tradition, as baseball has played a significant role in U.S. history. However, tradition alone is unlikely to explain all of the trends observed in Major League Baseball’s (MLB’s) fan base over the past decade or so. One additional explanation (and one that has received little to no attention in the academic literature) is the phenomenon known as fantasy sports, or more specific to this article, fantasy baseball.</p>
<p>A fantasy sport is a game where individuals act as “managers” of a team that competes against other “managers” using various statistics accumulated by the team’s players over the sport’s regular season. Although variations of fantasy sports existed as early as the 1950s, it was really the advent of Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980 (which is credited to Daniel Okrent) that started the fantasy sports craze.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002511409120">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When joining a Rotisserie Baseball League, managers draft players from the list of active MLB players and use their statistics to compete against other managers in the league. The statistics used in standard Rotisserie Baseball Leagues typically include offensive statistics such as batting average, home runs, runs scored, and runs batted in (RBIs) and pitching statistics such as wins, saves, earned run average, and walks plus hits per inning pitched. League participants either had to do the calculations themselves based on box scores from newspapers or assign this job to one person in the league who was often referred to as the league’s “commissioner.”</p>
<p>Okrent’s affiliation with the media allowed the concept to spread quickly among sports journalists. During the 1981 MLB strike these journalists had very little to write about so often times wrote columns about the Rotisserie League. In the next few years, fantasy baseball started to gain momentum. Businesses and experts began to emerge offering their services to Rotisserie League managers. Baseball Weekly was created by USA Today focusing almost exclusively on statistics and box scores. Books containing statistics, software simulating draft picks, and even 900 numbers emerged to cash in on this new form of entertainment.</p>
<p>Although it is estimated that the fantasy sports industry grew to 3 million participants by 1994, the industry would experience a rapid expansion in the mid-1990s with the proliferation of online, automated games. The Internet lowered the barriers to entry for individuals wanting to play, making fantasy games more readily available. In addition, the Internet’s capabilities for compiling statistics online allowed for news and information to be only a few clicks away.</p>
<p>In 1997, two websites were developed and opened which dramatically impacted the fantasy sports industry. The first website, Commissioner.com, was the first to offer real-time stats, league message boards, daily updated box scores and other features for a price of $300 per league. Commissioner.com was sold to Sportsline in 1998 for $31 million in cash and stock (which was then sold to CBS) and is now the fantasy sports engine behind CBSsports.com’s fantasy zone.</p>
<p>The second website, RotoNews.com, was the first to invent and implement the idea of the “player note” which offers up-to-date information on the status of each player. It took only 2 years for RotoNews.com to become one of the top 10 visited sports sites on the web. In 1999, RotoNews.com was sold to Broadband Sports and is known today as RotoWire.com.</p>
<p>Today, numerous sites on the web offer fantasy leagues and/or fantasy sports advice for a multitude of sports. There are now fantasy games for all of the major sports, including MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, and NASCAR, among others. Fees to participate in a league typically range from free-to-play ($0) to approximately $150 per league.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527002511409120">4</xref>
</sup> Yahoo currently holds the largest market share for free-to-play leagues, although Fanball, CBS Sports, Fox Sports, and ESPN among others are also prominent providers of automated free-to-play fantasy leagues. Smaller companies such as All-Star Stats, Sports Voice, and RotoWire are also popular sites for those who are not looking for all of the frills that the bigger companies offer.</p>
<p>The idea of modern-day fantasy games has blossomed into a multimillion dollar a year industry. Fantasy sports players are estimated to spend an average of 3 hr per week engaged in researching and managing their fantasy teams.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527002511409120">5</xref>
</sup> Such time devotion allows for profitable advertising banner space on the fantasy sports websites. According to a survey released by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) in 2007, there are over 19.4 million people in the United States and Canada engaging in fantasy sports which is bringing in about $500 million a year worldwide in fees, advertising, and other revenue. In a separate report released in 2006, the FSTA estimated a $4 billion annual impact across the sports industry from fantasy sports alone.</p>
<p>If it is true that fantasy baseball does exert a large and positive impact on the MLB fan base, it calls into question the motive behind the recent appeal by the MLB and players association to prevent the free usage of players' names and statistics by fantasy sports organizations. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the appeal on June 2, 2008. However, if the Court would have found in favor of the MLB and players associations, fantasy sports organizations would have had to pay for all the sports information needed for the games, greatly reducing profit margins. As such, fewer leagues, particularly free-to-play leagues, would likely exist. This would lead to fewer fantasy players and for those who still play, they would play in a fewer number of leagues. If fewer fantasy players does, in fact, lead to a smaller and less dedicated fan base, as is hypothesized here, the rejection of the MLB appeal may be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this article is to determine what effect, if any, fantasy baseball participation has on MLB game attendance. It is our contention that fantasy baseball may have played a role in attracting and maintaining fans, particularly young fans, to the sport over the past decade. If managing a fantasy baseball team causes one to attend more games, then the MLB and players both benefit, either directly or indirectly, through increased revenues and salaries. As such, the free use of player names and statistics by the fantasy sports industry may be in the best interest of all involved.</p>
<p>Although the impact of playing fantasy sports on game attendance has already been analyzed as it relates to NFL game attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit &amp; King, 2010a</xref>), an extension of this analysis to baseball is important for a variety of reasons. First, the ability to purchase tickets at or near face value is much greater for the MLB than they are for the NFL. It is quite uncommon for a NFL game to not sell out while sell outs are much less common in the MLB. Indeed, half-empty stadiums are the general rule rather than the exception in the MLB, with some exceptions, of course. Given the differences in these capacity constraints, fantasy sports participation can arguably have a much more sizable impact on the number of games an individual attends for baseball as compared to football.</p>
<p>Second, the complexity of fantasy baseball contributes to a much different mind-set when it comes to the time commitment relative to fantasy football. Perhaps the largest difference is in regards to the length of the regular season; MLB has a 162-game schedule while the NFL season is composed of only 16 games. Fantasy football managers are only required to make changes to their teams once a week while fantasy baseball managers are often making lineup changes daily. In fantasy baseball, much more attention must be paid to hot streaks and slumps throughout the long season. This requires fantasy managers to spend more time researching a larger number of lesser known players in an effort to take advantage of fantasy free agents and of the manager’s benched players when the opportunities arise. Players are dropped and added daily, so managers must be well informed and ready to make acquisitions at any time to help improve their team. This means that managers must be paying attention to upcoming matchups to ensure that they are putting together an optimal lineup for future games. While much of the above discussion is also true for fantasy football, the longer season and increased number of fantasy-relevant players in baseball increases the relevance for fantasy baseball.</p>
<p>Third, strategies in baseball are arguably more complex relative to fantasy football. For example, decisions like whether to start the number one pitcher against a leading offense or to sit the star hitter against a Cy Young winner are much more involved than decisions in fantasy football such as which wide receiver and kicker should start. Overall, the amount of decisions and research that it takes to put together a winning strategy in fantasy baseball can far outweigh that of fantasy football. In baseball, managers can build a team based on pitching or slugging percentage, power, or speed, whereas in football, managers are usually just hoping that their star running back (or quarterback) gets more yards and touchdowns than their opponents' players in those positions each week. Often times, choosing a successful fantasy football lineup ends up being more about the initial fantasy draft and luck rather than strategy and good decision making which is vital in developing a successful baseball lineup. As such, the successful fantasy baseball managers can often be described as much more knowledgeable of their sport relative to many successful fantasy football managers as it is not uncommon for an unknowledgeable first-time fantasy player to win a fantasy football league largely due to chance.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: The section Literature Review provides a brief literature review regarding sports with a focus on MLB and fantasy sports. The section Data and Empirical Model details the empirical model and the survey data employed in this study, while the section Concluding Remarks presents and discusses the estimation results. The final section provides concluding remarks.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Numerous publications in the popular press have dealt with topics such as the popularity of fantasy sports and the business and economic side of the enterprise. However, despite the rapid growth of the industry as a whole, there are relatively few scholarly research articles on fantasy sports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527002511409120">Lomax (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527002511409120">Woodward (2005)</xref> both provide concise synopses of the history and economics of fantasy sports, primarily citing popular press articles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527002511409120">Wirakartakushumah (2003)</xref> examined the profitability of advertising banner space on sports websites hosting fantasy sports relative to those not hosting fantasy sports. The results of this study indicate that both revenue and profit were higher for those websites hosting fantasy sports. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit and King (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527002511409120">2010b</xref>) have shown that fantasy sports participation has increased television viewership for both the NFL and MLB and game attendance at NFL games. It should be noted that Nesbit and King do not address how fantasy sports participation impacts MLB game attendance, which is the issue we address in the current article.</p>
<p>Unlike the academic literature on fantasy sports, the literature related to MLB (and professional sports, in general) is much more extensive. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511409120">Fort (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527002511409120">Rottenberg’s (1956)</xref> seminal work serves as the basis for much of the sports–economics literature today. For example, most of the more recent sports labor market research, including research on salary determination and exploitation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527002511409120">6</xref>
</sup> discrimination,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002511409120">7</xref>
</sup> attendance demand,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002511409120">8</xref>
</sup> competitive balance,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1527002511409120">9</xref>
</sup> among many others all employ models based on the ideas expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527002511409120">Rottenberg (1956)</xref>.</p>
<p>Since this article is primarily focused on how fantasy sports has impacted MLB game attendance, it is important to consider how attendance demand has been modeled in the past. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527002511409120">Rottenberg (1956)</xref> was the first to consider attendance at baseball games in regards to issues in the monopolization of the sport. Since then, a variety of articles have used models of attendance to answer various sports-related questions, often employing a common set of variables.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002511409120">10</xref>
</sup> These variables can be classified in four categories: characteristics of the good, price, team performance, and regional demographics. Characteristics of the good often include a measure of park factor, construction of the stadium, stadium capacity, age of the stadium, and new/classic stadium. Price ideally includes the cost of the entire experience but often times this is reduced to ticket price and sometimes concession expenses. Measures of team performance include winning percentage, number of all-stars and award winners (i.e., gold glove), and an appearance in the playoffs/world series. The regional demographic category includes many standard variables such as age, race, and so on. Some studies include measures of available substitutes and the occurrence of a player’s strike.</p>

<sec id="section3-1527002511409120">
<title>Data and Empirical Model</title>
<p>Before describing the empirical model of MLB game attendance used in this study, it is worthwhile to first describe the primary data source employed in the analysis. The ESPN Sports Poll, a survey conducted by the Sport, Events, &amp; Sponsorship division of TNS, serves as our primary data source.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002511409120">11</xref>
</sup> From the ESPN Sports Poll, we extract data relating to the demographics, fan interest, fantasy sports participation, and game attendance, among other pertinent variables for each of the survey respondents. This survey conducted at the individual level allows us to conduct a microlevel analysis of how fantasy baseball participation impacts MLB game attendance. The data covers the time period beginning April of 1999 and ending December of 2007. After deleting observations with missing data (no response and responses of “I don’t know”), the number of observations used in our analysis varies between 13,653 and 13,913, depending on the specification.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1527002511409120">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The empirical analysis employed here uses similar modeling and the same primary data source as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit and King (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527002511409120">2010b</xref>) studies of NFL game attendance and MLB and NFL television viewership. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit and King (2010a)</xref>, the authors find that, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, fantasy football participation increases the likelihood of an average individual attending at least one NFL game by about 13 to 15 percentage points and increases the average number of games attended by roughly 0.2 to 0.6 games per season. Consistent with the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit and King (2010a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1527002511409120">Equation (1)</xref> presents our basic empirical model of MLB game attendance:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1527002511409120">

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511409120">Table 1</xref> defines each variable used in this analysis. <italic>Attend<sub>i</sub>
</italic> represents our two measures of attendance used in the two specifications of the model. First, we measure attendance as a binary variable equal to one if the individual has attended at least one MLB game over the past 12 months. In the second specification, attendance is measured as the number of games the individual has attended over the past 12 months. The number of games attended specification includes 260 fewer observations due to more missing observations and to the deletion of numerous observations which were identified as outliers. While the sample as a whole originally had a mean of 1.87 games attended with a standard deviation of 4.18, some respondents reported attending as many as 40 games over the past 12 months. While the attendance of 40 games is possible in a 12-month span, such extreme values were interpreted as outliers due to either being uncharacteristic of the typical fan, data entry error, or incorrect reporting by the respondent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1527002511409120">13</xref>
</sup> As such, all observations for which the number of MLB games attended exceeded 15 (three standard deviations from the mean, rounding up) were removed from the final sample. However, the results presented below are robust to the sample restriction applied.</p>

<p>MLB_Fantasy Participation, a dummy variable equal to 1 if the respondent played fantasy baseball over the past 12 months and 0 otherwise, serves as our primary independent variable of interest. A priori, the relationship between fantasy baseball and MLB game attendance is unclear. Fantasy baseball participation may educate the participant on the intricacies of the sport and therefore spark the individual’s interest, leading them to want to attend more games. Fantasy participants may also grow loyal to players on their fantasy team, and they may want to see them play in a live game. In both of these cases, fantasy baseball can be argued to be a complement of MLB game attendance.</p>
<p>Fantasy baseball participation may instead serve to crowd out game attendance as it becomes more difficult to track one’s fantasy players while at the game. As such, fantasy participants may prefer to watch the game on television while simultaneously tracking their fantasy team on their computer. In this case, fantasy participation serves as a substitute for game attendance. With cell phone advancements and fantasy sports applications for cell phones, it is becoming possible to track fantasy team performance almost anywhere, diminishing the substitutes argument. However, given the above discussion, we expect the complements relationship to dominate, suggesting a positive relationship between the two variables.</p>
<p>The respondent’s interest in MLB is controlled for through the inclusion of Avid Fan. Those individuals more interested in the sport are expected to attend more games, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. Each ESPN Sports Poll respondent was asked to characterize their answer to the question “How interested would you say you are right now in Major League Baseball?” into one of four categories: “not at all interested,” “a little bit interested,” “somewhat interested,” or “very interested.” Avid Fan was then constructed as equal to 1 if the respondent identified him or herself as “very interested” and equal to 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Given that those individuals who are more interested in MLB should also be the same individuals who are most likely to participate in fantasy baseball, MLB_Fantasy Participation may be endogenous.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1527002511409120">14</xref>
</sup> A Wu-Hausman test was conducted on both specifications of the model to test for the endogeneity of the fantasy baseball participation variable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1527002511409120">15</xref>
</sup> The results for this test using the probit model indicate that fantasy baseball is endogenous; however, the null hypothesis of exogeneity could not be rejected in the negative binomial (number of games attended) model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1527002511409120">16</xref>
</sup> Given the inconsistent results across the two specifications, we report both the standard and instrumental variable estimation results for both specifications. Fantasy football participation and Internet usage are used as instruments (in addition to all of the exogenous variables from the second-stage regression) for fantasy baseball participation in the two-stage model. Fantasy football participation and Internet usage are argued to be good instruments because they should both be highly correlated with fantasy baseball participation, while not correlated with MLB game attendance. Given the online nature of fantasy games in general (in recent years, at least), Internet usage is a near necessity for playing fantasy games. Furthermore, one of the barriers to playing fantasy baseball is learning the ins-and-outs of fantasy gaming. The learning curve can be particularly daunting for fantasy baseball; by having already played fantasy football, the learning curve can seem much less intimidating. Furthermore, if fantasy gaming is argued to be habit-forming, as is argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527002511409120">Spenner and Crooker (2004)</xref>, having played fantasy football will create an interest to play fantasy games for other sports.</p>
<p>The model also includes variables to control for respondent demographics and home and favorite team descriptors. Demographic control variables included in the model are age, parental status, gender, race, marital status, education, and income. Team characteristics were matched with the individual’s identified home team and the individual’s favorite team, where applicable. The individual’s favorite MLB team, if one exists, is provided by the respondent during the survey. We designate home teams for all those respondents who live within a team’s Designated Market Area (DMA). Those individuals living in the New York, San Francisco-Oakland, and Chicago DMAs were assigned two home teams since two teams reside in the same DMA. In these cases, team performance statistics were averaged. However, the playoff appearance and World Series appearance dummy variables are coded as equal to one if at least one team in the DMA made the playoffs or World Series, respectively, rather than being averaged. We include the same set of team performance measures for both home and favorite teams. We distinguish between home and favorite team performance variables by the prefixes “H_” and “F_,” respectively. Win percentage, playoff appearance, and World Series appearance are included to control for team performance. The park factor of home and favorite teams is also included in the model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1527002511409120">17</xref>
</sup> Values of park factor greater than 100 indicate a hitter’s ballpark (favorable to more runs scored) and values less than 100 indicate a pitcher’s ballpark. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511409120">Clapp and Hakes (2005)</xref> suggest that consistently high-scoring games generate more fan interest (and attendance).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1527002511409120">18</xref>
</sup> Thus, park factor is expected to be positively related to MLB game attendance. Each of the three team performance variables and park factor were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.baseball-reference.com">http://www.baseball-reference.com</ext-link>. Finally, to capture the price of the good, we use the average (face value) ticket price as reported by the Team Marketing Report.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1527002511409120">19</xref>
</sup> Descriptive statistics of all variables used in our model can be found in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1527002511409120">Appendix</xref> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1527002511409120">Tables A1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1527002511409120"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1527002511409120">A3</xref>.</p>
<p>The regression results for the attend-at-least-one-game over the past 12 months binary specification are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511409120">Table 2</xref>. The standard (single-stage) probit results appear in columns 1 and 2, while the two-stage probit results are presented in columns 3 and 4. We conduct a Wu-Hausman test to determine whether or not fantasy baseball participation is endogenous. The results indicate that fantasy baseball participation is endogenous, suggesting the two-stage model is appropriate. As such, we only discuss the two-stage estimates. According to these results, more highly educated White, unmarried males with higher income are more likely to attend at least one game per year relative to other individuals not fitting this description. The results also indicate that the probability of attending at least one game per year falls with age. While having a favorite team increases the probability of attending at least one game, team characteristics are generally statistically insignificant with the exception of favorite team win percentage, which is negatively related to the dependent variable. Average ticket price is negatively related to attendance; a one standard deviation ($6.91 or 31.1%) increase in the average ticket price leads to a 2.18 percentage point reduction in the probability of attending at least one game over the past 12 months.<sup>

<p>While the estimated coefficients from the probit model qualitatively suggest that self-identified avid fans of MLB and fantasy baseball participants are more likely to have attended at least one MLB game over the past year, the coefficients cannot be directly interpreted due to the nonlinear nature of the probit model. As such, we compute the marginal effects based on assumed values for each of the control variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511409120">Table 3</xref> summarizes the predicted probabilities and marginal impacts of Avid Fan and MLB_Fantasy Participation for our characteristic individual: average aged, White, married male with no children, a high school diploma, income between $50,000 and $100,000, a home and favorite team with an average win percentage, number of all-stars, and park factor and no playoff or World Series appearances. The marginal impact of Avid Fan can be found in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511409120">Table 3</xref>. If we assume that our characteristic individual does not participate in fantasy baseball, the marginal impact of being an avid fan is 28.38 percentage points, meaning that the probability of attending at least one game increases by over 28 percentage points. The marginal impact falls to 12.30 percentage points if the individual is instead a fantasy baseball participant. The bottom row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511409120">Table 3</xref> presents the marginal impact of playing fantasy baseball. We find that the marginal impact of being a fantasy baseball participant is larger than that of being an avid fan. The marginal impact of MLB_Fantasy Participation is estimated to be 40.89 percentage points if the individual is not an avid fan and is 24.81 percentage points if he is an avid fan. This suggests that the individual is between 25 and 41% more likely to have attended at least one game over the past year if he or she had played fantasy baseball.</p>

<p>Estimation results for the count model of MLB game attendance over the previous 12 months can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511409120">Table 4</xref>. The results provide strong evidence in support of the relationships indicated from the probit model. Once again, we present both the standard estimation and the two-stage Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation of the model. However, unlike the probit results, we are unable to reject the null of weak exogeneity based on the Wu-Hausman test, suggesting that IV estimation is consistent but inefficient. As such, we favor the standard negative binomial estimation results. The demographic variables perform similarly (both in sign and in statistical significance) as in the probit model. The one notable difference is that people of non-Black minority race are shown to attend more games on average than those not fitting this description. Team descriptors also performed similar with the exception that home team win percentage and World Series appearance are statistically significant while favorite team win percentage is no longer significant. A one standard deviation increase in ticket price is estimated to reduce the number of games attended by our representative individual by only 0.09 games per year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1527002511409120">21</xref>
</sup> An increase in home team win percentage is associated with an increase in the games attended; however, a World Series appearance by the home team (holding constant the winning percentage, among other included variables) is surprisingly affiliated with a reduction in games attended. This counterintuitive result can possibly be attributed to increased fan interest as a result of the World Series appearance, leading to a greater demand for tickets generally. With this greater demand, tickets become more difficult to find in the primary market. Furthermore, prices in the secondary market will also likely rise significantly, leading some season ticket holders to offer more of their tickets for sale and to each nonseason ticket holder to purchase tickets to fewer games. As such, a World Series attendance can be explained to reduce the number of games attended by a given individual.<sup>

<p>The marginal impacts of MLB_Fantasy Participation and Avid Fan for our representative individual are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511409120">Table 5</xref>. Our representative individual who is neither an avid fan nor a fantasy baseball participant is estimated to attend 1.14 games per year, on average. If, instead, that person is an avid fan, he is estimated to attend 3.38 games per year, on average. Thus, the marginal impact of being an avid fan is estimated to be 2.24 games if the individual does not play fantasy baseball. If he were a fantasy baseball participant, the marginal impact of being an avid fan is 3.15 games per year. Unlike the binary estimation results, the marginal impact of MLB_Fantasy Participation is shown to be smaller than that of Avid Fan. The marginal impacts suggest that if we assume our characteristic individual is not an avid fan, he or she attends only 0.47 more games over the course of the year if the person is also a fantasy baseball participant. The marginal impact increases to 1.38 additional games per year if the person is an avid fan. Overall, playing fantasy baseball is estimated to be less important as a determinant of the number of MLB games attended than is fan interest in the game. However, fantasy baseball participation is still shown to be an important determinant of attendance and its impact on attendance is larger in magnitude than any of the demographic variables included with the sole exception of income of $150,000 or more.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Major League Baseball has surely rebounded from the plunge of its fan base following the 1994-1995 players strike. There are many factors that have influenced the return of the MLB fan; however, fantasy baseball has received very little attention in this regard despite the proliferation of automated online fantasy games over the past decade. This article has attempted to determine what role participation in fantasy baseball leagues has had on the probability of an individual attending at least one MLB game per year and what impact such participation has on the number of games attended.</p>
<p>The results strongly indicate that fantasy baseball has positively influenced both the probability of attending at least one game and the number of games attended. Nonavid fans of the MLB who are participants in fantasy baseball leagues—relative to nonparticipants—are estimated to be nearly 41 percentage points more likely to attend at least one MLB game per year. Similarly, fantasy participants who are avid fans are nearly 25 percentage points more likely to attend at least one game relative to otherwise identical nonparticipants. In addition, fantasy baseball participants attend more games on average than nonparticipants. Specifically, the average fantasy participant attends 0.47 and 1.38 more games per year (nonavid fan and avid fan, respectively) relative to their nonparticipant equals. This represents roughly a 41% increase in the number of games attended by the average individual.</p>
<p>Given the results of this analysis, the Supreme Court’s rejection of the recent appeal by MLB and the players' association to limit the use of players' names and statistics to only those fantasy providers who pay a licensing fee may have been a blessing in disguise. If their appeal were successful, both MLB and the players would likely both realize increases in short-run revenues/incomes. However, fantasy providers would likely reduce or eliminate the availability of free-to-play leagues and increase the price of current pay-to-play leagues. The number of fantasy players would be expected to fall as would the number of fantasy leagues each player participates. Given the results of this article, with fewer fantasy players, the MLB would observe a reduction in attendance over time, reducing long-run profits. On the other hand, had the Supreme Court found in favor of the MLB and players' association, MLB.com may have been able to take advantage of monopoly powers to increase its market share of the fantasy baseball industry, offsetting the losses affiliated with a smaller fan base.</p>

<p>Fantasy leagues with entry fees as high as $1,000 or more do exist. However, these leagues also offer cash prizes as high as $25,000 and cater to the less risk adverse population. Furthermore, the free-to-play and the low-fee leagues are far more common.</p>

<p>The FSTA estimates the average fantasy football manager spends 3 hr per week on the activity; FoxSports.com reports an equal amount of time spent on average by the fantasy baseball manager. The Fantasy Sports Association (FSA) suggests that an average of 5 hr per week for the “highly engaged” fantasy sports managers.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-1527002511409120">
<label>13.</label>
<p>The reestimation of our model without deleting our identified outliers actually strengthens the conclusions of this article in regards to the impact of fantasy baseball participation on game attendance.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1527002511409120">
<label>14.</label>
<p>Depending on the sample (binary or count model), 75–77% of fantasy participants are avid fans. However, only 5.4–5.8% of all avid fans are also fantasy baseball participants.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-1527002511409120">
<label>15.</label>
<p>An argument can be made that ticket price may also be endogenous. While this very likely may be the case in an aggregate model, we contend that ticket price is theoretically exogenous in our case given the individual-level survey data used in the analysis. The ticket demand by a single individual should not influence ticket price in this large of a market.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-1527002511409120">
<label>16.</label>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002511409120">Nesbit and King (2010a</xref>) could not reject the null of exogeneity in either specification of their model examining the impact of fantasy football participation on NFL game attendance. The endogenous nature of fantasy baseball participation further suggests that there is a need to examine the impact of fantasy sports participation on baseball separately from football.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1527002511409120">
<label>17.</label>
<p>The results reported herein are based on the computation of park factor using pitching statistics. However, the results are qualitatively identical when using the batting statistics instead.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1527002511409120">
<label>18.</label>
<p>As suggested by an anonymous referee, replacing Park Factor with runs scored and runs allowed may better account for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511409120">Clapp and Hakes (2005)</xref> suggestion that fans find high-scoring games more interesting. Our results are robust—both qualitatively and to a large extent quantitatively—to the use of runs scored and runs allowed rather than park factor. Furthermore, the runs scored and runs allowed variables, like Park Factor, are never statistically significant.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1527002511409120">
<label>19.</label>
<p>Replacing the average ticket price with the Fan Cost Index (FCI) leads to no qualitative differences in our results. We opt for the average ticket price as many of the assumptions included in the construction of the FCI are unrealistic.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn20-1527002511409120">
<label>20.</label>
<p>This assumes the same characteristic individual used other calculations of marginal effects with the additional assumptions of being neither an avid fan nor a participant in fantasy baseball. The marginal impact of a one standard deviation increase in ticket price is –0.55 percentage points if the individual is both an avid fan and a fantasy baseball participant.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn21-1527002511409120">
<label>21.</label>
<p>This calculation assumes the individual is neither an avid fan nor a fantasy baseball participant. If the person is both an avid fan and a fantasy baseball participant, the marginal impact increases in magnitude with the one standard deviation increase in average ticket price, reducing the number of games attended by a 0.36 games, on average.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn22-1527002511409120">

<p>We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this explanation for the counterintuitive sign on the World Series Appearance variable.</p>
