<abstract>
<p>Although access to higher education has helped many minority ethnic men and women improve their labour market position compared to prior generations or the less qualified, it remains unclear to what extent higher level qualifications facilitate an equalization of labour market outcomes with comparably educated white UK born men and women. This article critically examines ethnic differences in graduate level over-education, unemployment and wages as potential markers of discrimination or broader ‘ethnic penalties’, defined as the differences in labour market outcomes persisting after accounting for observable human capital and demographic characteristics. To estimate ethnic penalties a novel approach using covariate matching is applied. The findings reveal that despite their levels of educational attainment penalties persist among several minority ethnic groups. The implications of pre-labour market social disadvantages for explaining patterns of over-education are highlighted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethnic differences in occupational attainment, wages and unemployment cannot fully be explained by differences in human capital or demographic characteristics. The remaining unexplained component of such differences has been termed the ‘ethnic penalty’ in recognition that it may reflect discrimination but also other labour market disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458021">Berthoud, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012458021">Cooke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012458021">Heath and Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0950017012458021">McGinnity and Lunn, 2011</xref>). Studies of ‘over-education’ or ‘over-qualification’ suggest that a disproportionate number of minority ethnic men and women are employed in jobs which do not require their level of educational attainment both in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>) and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458021">Chiswick and Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012458021">Green et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0950017012458021">Nielsen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnic differences in over-education are of interest to the study of ethnic penalties in that they could reflect discrimination or other barriers to the meritocratic matching of workers and jobs. Although sociological literatures examine ethnic differences in relation to occupational attainment or social mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012458021">Castilla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012458021">Khattab, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017012458021">Platt, 2007</xref>) much of the general over-education literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458021">Burris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0950017012458021">Vaisey, 2006</xref>) and research specifically on over-education and ethnicity is currently found within labour economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458021">Alpin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458021">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>). These studies furthermore tend to examine ethnic <italic>differences</italic> in over-education rather than ethnic <italic>penalties</italic>, as currently defined, and so do not provide full information on whether penalties persist after accounting for important compositional differences between ethnic groups such as levels of educational attainment.</p>
<p>The aims of the current article are consequently twofold. First, through drawing on broader literatures on ethnicity and social disadvantage, a deeper theoretical understanding is sought of the relationship between ethnicity and over-education, critically examining whether between-group differences in over-education can be considered as markers of ‘ethnic penalties’. Relevant explanations put forth for the occurrence of over-education are critiqued. Based on a labour market discrimination account, patterns of over-education by ethnicity may reflect differences in skill underutilization due to discrimination in the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2002</xref>). In contrast, according to a human capital or qualification heterogeneity explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012458021">Green and McIntosh, 2007</xref>), over-education does not necessarily solely reflect skill underutilization but wider differences in skills or the quality of education among individuals with equivalent level certificates, such as by qualification subject, grade achieved or institution attended. Differences in over-education between ethnic groups could therefore partly reflect aspects of education quality often not fully captured in survey data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>Both of these accounts as currently presented, it is argued, require broader sociological interpretation. Whereas a qualification heterogeneity-based explanation needs further elaboration regarding the role social disadvantages related to ethnicity, social class and gender play in influencing patterns of educational and occupational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458021">Bradley and Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458021">Collins, 2004</xref>) rather than just individual ability and rational choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">2003</xref>), discrimination-based accounts require more attention to how pre-labour market disadvantages may preclude the risk of over-education for those with no or low levels of educational attainment. Ethnic penalties in over-education therefore need to take into account variation in attainment between groups.</p>
<p>Ethnic penalties are consequently explored through a study of graduate (NVQ level 4 or above) over-education. The second and empirical aim of the article asks the question to what extent do penalties occur after accounting for compositional differences in human capital and demographic characteristics? With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458021">Alpin et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0950017012458021">Wilton (2011)</xref>, which draw contrasts between the white/majority and the entire ‘non-white’/minority ethnic population, little research has been conducted on ethnic differences in graduate level over-education. Although the expansion of higher education has been conceived as a mechanism towards greater social equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458021">Boliver, 2011</xref>) and has helped improve the employment position of many minority ethnic men and women compared to prior generations or the less qualified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012458021">Heath and Cheung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017012458021">Platt, 2007</xref>), the extent to which such developments have facilitated an <italic>equalization</italic> of labour market outcomes to those of comparably educated white men and women remains unclear. The ‘business case’ for equality and diversity related to recruiting and retaining talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017012458021">Kirton and Green, 2010</xref>) may be stronger in higher skilled professions or higher qualifications may provide access to occupations with formalized career ladders, potentially mitigating against discrimination. Higher levels of graduate level over-education, however, could indicate minority ethnic men and women are disproportionately not gaining access to such occupations. Graduate level unemployment and wages are further examined to see whether ethnic penalties in these outcomes persist after accounting for degree subject, an important aspect of ‘educational choice’ in qualification heterogeneity accounts of over-education and wage and unemployment gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0950017012458021">Machin and Puhani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0950017012458021">Ortiz and Kucel, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0950017012458021">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Over-education occurs when people hold qualifications in excess of those required for their job. In comparison to those better matched to their job, research indicates over-educated people exhibit wage penalties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017012458021">Hartog, 2000</xref>), lower job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458021">Battu et al., 1999</xref>) and higher turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0950017012458021">Sloane et al., 1999</xref>). A large proportion of the literature on over-education has drawn on economic theory (Ortiz, 2011: 48). For example, over-education has been considered in terms of temporary imbalances in supply and demand for qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012458021">Freeman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0950017012458021">Tsang and Levin, 1985</xref>), although its long-term persistence conflicts with this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2003</xref>), or ‘qualification inflation’, where employers upgrade job requirements when screening candidates in response to rising educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012458021">Brynin, 2002</xref>). It has also been considered as short term worker/job skill mismatches that should decline over time through between-job transitions, although over-education is not necessarily short term or confined to recent labour market entrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458021">Battu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0950017012458021">Sloane et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear how such accounts explain ethnic differences in over-education. In the absence of ethnicity related labour market barriers, the effects of changes in skill supply and demand, or short term job mismatches would be expected to be the same across ethnic groups. Barriers that prevent minority ethnic individuals obtaining employment matching their qualifications, however, could produce ethnic differences in over-education. There is significant evidence of discrimination in the UK labour market which may differ by skin colour and ethnic, cultural or religious group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012458021">Khattab, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0950017012458021">Modood, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0950017012458021">Riach and Rich (2002)</xref>, summarizing UK field studies, suggest that around 30–40 per cent of job applications made by minority ethnic candidates were refused on grounds of race/ethnicity. Where minority ethnic groups are only employed if they have greater qualifications than majority ethnic applicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458021">Alpin et al., 1998</xref>), are less likely to be promoted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2002</xref>), experience performance evaluation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012458021">Castilla, 2008</xref>) or are given less access to training, such practices could lead to higher levels of over-education. Over-education could also occur where minority ethnic applicants are overlooked during recruitment, making some individuals more likely to accept jobs at a lower level than appropriate for their level of qualification or alternatively spend a longer time unemployed seeking better matched employment.</p>
<p>The study of ethnic penalties concerns the theoretical explanation of ethnic labour market differences in terms of whether these reflect unmeasured disadvantages such as discrimination or can be explained by observed factors such as human capital levels. If ethnic differences in over-education reflect discrimination they could indicate genuine differences in skill underutilization between ethnic groups. At the same time, whether measured over-education in the broader population reflects skill underutilization has been questioned. According to human capital or qualification heterogeneity accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012458021">Green and McIntosh, 2007</xref>), the occurrence of over-education is partly explained by differences in the quality of education or skills held by individuals who, based on the level of their highest qualifications or schooling, appear to have the same level of education. Labour market demanded skills or employability signals may vary within certificate levels in terms of qualification type, subject studied, grades obtained, institution attended and by wider employment experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012458021">Dolton and Silles, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012458021">Garcia-Espejo, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Between-group variation in such factors could contribute to ethnic differences in over-education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>). In terms of high school achievement, Black Caribbean, Black African, Pakistani and Bangladeshi students on average score below the mean attainment of their white British peers, whereas Chinese, Indian and Irish students on average score higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012458021">Department for Education and Skills, 2006</xref>). Other sources of disadvantage relate to the (perceived) value of overseas qualifications or English language ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458021">Dale et al., 2002</xref>). Regarding higher education, although overall minority ethnic groups are generally over-represented relative to their population proportion, except Black Caribbean men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458021">Barnard and Turner, 2011</xref>), generally they are less likely than white students to achieve first and upper second level class degrees and more likely to attend ‘new’ post-1992 universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>). White students in the UK, however, are less likely than minority ethnic students to study traditional university degree subjects which confer specific professions such as medicine, dentistry and law, although differences also exist between minority ethnic groups.</p>
<p>As well as influencing the risk of over-education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0950017012458021">Ortiz and Kucel, 2008</xref>) differences in degree subject or college major are also important to explaining graduate wage differences and unemployment risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>). For example, in relation to the gender wage gap, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0950017012458021">Machin and Puhani (2003)</xref> found that 8–20 per cent of the gap for graduates (24–30% of the total explained component) in the UK and Germany was attributable to differences in degree subject. Building on this work and broader research on wage and unemployment gaps related to ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012458021">Blackaby et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458021">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012458021">Clark and Drinkwater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017012458021">Leicht, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0950017012458021">Longhi and Platt, 2008</xref>) and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012458021">Blau and Khan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017012458021">Grimshaw and Rubery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0950017012458021">Olsen and Walby, 2004</xref>), differences in degree subject are also likely to contribute to graduate level ethnic wage and unemployment gaps.</p>
<p>In addition to finer grained variation in skills among equivalent level qualification holders, a further critical issue concerns how differences in overall levels of educational attainment influence patterns of over-education. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0950017012458021">Table 1</xref> presents the incidence of over-education by educational attainment level, using a common ‘modal’ measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>) indicating whether respondents hold qualifications above the modal level for their two-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) occupation. Around 74 per cent of those who are defined as over-educated have post-secondary school qualifications (NVQ level 3 or above). One observation is that, given those with no or the lowest levels of educational attainment are typically the worst off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458021">Barnard and Turner, 2011</xref>), over-education is likely to be a poor marker of disadvantage for the most vulnerable in the labour market. Ethnic penalties among those with fewer or no qualifications may be more likely to manifest as other outcomes such as job insecurity, unemployment or lower wages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017012458021">Leicht, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Levels of educational attainment furthermore vary significantly by ethnicity and gender. For example, whereas Black African men and Chinese and Indian women are among the most likely to have degree level or above qualifications, Pakistani and Bangladeshi men and women are among the most likely to have no formal qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012458021">Heath and Cheung, 2006</xref>). Prior studies examining ethnic differences in over-education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458021">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017012458021">Lindley, 2009</xref>) do not explicitly seek to estimate ethnic penalties and so are limited in this respect by drawing comparisons across the entire qualification distribution. Where differences in educational attainment remain unaccounted for, the interpretation of findings on over-education becomes ambiguous. For example, is it a good thing that one group exhibits less over-education than another if this merely reflects that on average they have lower levels of educational attainment? Higher levels of qualification may further reflect minority ethnic groups over-compensating through educational attainment to mitigate against labour market disadvantages, meaning matched comparisons to comparably educated white UK born men and women reveal penalties concealed in simple overall comparisons.</p>
<p>The current article attempts to address these issues by specifically examining ethnic penalties (rather than just ethnic differences) using human capital and demographically matched comparisons. A focus is further placed on graduate level (NVQ level 4 or above qualifications) over-education. Although this approach helps restrict contrasts to similarly educated individuals, differences in graduate outcomes may still reflect qualification heterogeneity such as degree subject, institute attended or grade achieved. Qualification heterogeneity explanations put forth in the economics literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2003</xref>: 527), however, are problematic if applied to explaining ethnic differences in that they largely focus on differences in individual ability, preferences or rational choices regarding educational investment. A greater emphasis is consequently required on how ethnic variation in educational attainment reflects broader social disadvantages. Some older universities exhibit admission biases against minority ethnic students that persist after controlling for parental background, type of school background and attainment scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0950017012458021">Modood, 2004</xref>). Part of the reason some minority ethnic groups appear less likely to attend older institutions or are less likely to achieve first or upper second class degrees relates to their poorer A-level results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>). However this may partly be because of differences in the quality of pre-university education received. For example, minority ethnic students and individuals from poorer backgrounds are more likely to attend further education colleges than school sixth forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>), which affects not only access to university but subsequent degree performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458021">Barnard and Turner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0950017012458021">Richardson, 2008</xref>). Similarly, they are more likely to take alternative entry routes to university than A-levels or equivalent Scottish qualifications less preferred by more prestigious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0950017012458021">Purcell et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Socio-economic disadvantage and the greater risk of poverty among minority ethnic and immigrant households are additional factors that could contribute to attainment gaps such as through developmental or health impacts or a lack of economic or social resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458021">Barnard and Turner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458021">Behtoui and Neergaard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0950017012458021">Strand, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0950017012458021">Verhaeghe et al., 2012</xref>). However, although social class advantages and disadvantages remain important to explaining educational attainment and social mobility in the general population, they do not fully explain ethnic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458021">Archer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017012458021">Platt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0950017012458021">Rothon, 2008</xref>). A number of studies show that ‘black-white’ attainment gaps in compulsory education persist after controlling for socio-economic background – other potential explanations cited include institutional racism within the education system or low teacher expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0950017012458021">Strand, 2011</xref>). In addition to Black Caribbean men, white men from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds are also among the most poorly represented in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458021">Barnard and Turner, 2011</xref>). Independent of ethnicity, men and women from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to gain access to more prestigious higher education institutions even after accounting for prior educational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458021">Boliver, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender is also important in explaining ethnic differences in qualification heterogeneity. Black Caribbean girls, for example, generally perform better in their GCSE high school qualifications than boys do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0950017012458021">Strand, 2011</xref>). In terms of choice of higher education institution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al. (2004)</xref> found that Muslim women were over twice as likely as Muslim men to state family influence as reason for their selection, with proximity to family home important to family considerations. Choices of educational vocational pathways further differ by gender within ethnic groups. For example, Black Caribbean women are concentrated in health and social care, although this may partly reflect historical patterns of immigration and occupational settlement or discriminatory barriers towards shifting occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458021">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0950017012458021">Smith, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnicity, gender and social class when taken together therefore provide a more nuanced picture of ethnic differences in labour market outcomes, interrelating in varying ways both between and within ethnic groups and shaped by the material and cultural contexts in which individuals exert agency towards socio-economic goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458021">Carter and Virdee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017012458021">Platt, 2007</xref>). Intersectional perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458021">Browne and Misra, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458021">Collins, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0950017012458021">Walby et al., 2012</xref>) in this respect consider how such dimensions, as socially constructed categories, interact to form patterns of power, privilege and disadvantage, related to access to productive or social resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458021">Bradley and Healy, 2008</xref>) and pervasive across both public and private spheres. Such accounts also hold relevance to explaining ethnic differences in graduate level employment. Intersections between gender and ethnicity, rather than being additive, may create unique or multiple forms of discrimination or disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458021">Bradley and Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458021">Browne and Misra, 2003</xref>). For example, prejudices against women in management or professional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012458021">Bolton and Muzio, 2008</xref>) can be reinforced by the stereotype that ‘black people can’t manage’, whereas stereotypes regarding Asian women not being career orientated may further hamper employment advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458021">Botcherby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458021">Bradley and Healy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the family context, women face additional employment constraints related to cultural practices surrounding gender roles, marriage, fertility and family size, although diversity both between and within ethnic groups should not be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458021">Dale et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012458021">2008</xref>). In the case of Pakistani and Bangladeshi women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458021">Bradley et al. (2007)</xref> found that some husbands may place restrictions on employment if it is not seen as compatible with household responsibilities (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012458021">Cooke, 2007</xref>), whereas Black Caribbean women have a higher rate of lone parenthood and are more likely to be employed full-time. For some Pakistani and Bangladeshi women the cultural expectation or preference to live at home prior to marriage or maintain proximity to the parental or marital home may affect geographical mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>), potentially restricting job search area. Geographical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0950017012458021">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>) or a lack of social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0950017012458021">Yeandle et al., 2006</xref>) could contribute to labour market penalties, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458021">Battu and Sloane (2002)</xref> found that living in a ward with a high level of unemployment was not predictive of an increased risk of over-education.</p>

<title>Methods and data</title>
<p>Using the UK Labour Force Survey (UKLFS) the rationale of the method is to identify gender specific comparison groups from the white UK born majority sample, matched in their observable characteristics to the minority ethnic samples in the survey. The outcomes of these groups can be compared and the remaining differences after matching taken as the ‘ethnic penalty’. This is expressed as the average treatment effect for the treated (ATT) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0950017012458021">Sekhon, 2009</xref>) indicating the difference between the average of an outcome for a given minority ethnic group to that which they would exhibit if members of the British born white majority as estimated from the comparator group. The outcomes considered are whether or not respondents work in a SOC (HE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458021">Elias and Purcell, 2004</xref>) graduate occupation (1=yes, 0=no), are unemployed (1=yes, 0=no) and hourly wage rate. For the first two outcomes, the ATT multiplied by a hundred gives the percentage difference between the minority ethnic and matched comparison group, whereas for the wage estimates the ATT expresses hourly wage rate differences.</p>
<p>The SOC (HE) classification of graduate jobs is comparable to a combination of ‘realized match’ and expert assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2003</xref>: 514) measures of over-education, combining statistical information regarding concentrations of graduates within occupations with job analysis data on job descriptions and qualification requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012458021">Elias and Purcell, 2004</xref>). The SOC (HE) identifies four categories of graduate occupations, two of which consist of occupations for which employers typically require a degree, these being ‘traditional’ graduate occupations (e.g. solicitors, doctors, scientists, lecturers and secondary school teachers) and ‘modern’ graduate occupations. The latter group represents newer professions, which graduates have been entering since the expansion of higher education in the 1960s (e.g. senior managers in large organizations, IT professionals and primary school teachers). A third category, ‘new graduate jobs’, represents occupations where graduates have increasingly been recruited, providing significant scope to exercise degree level skills and knowledge (e.g. occupational therapists, quantity surveyors and management accountants). In the fourth category, ‘niche graduate jobs’, although the majority of people are non-graduates significant groups of occupations require degrees or provide scope to exercise degree level skills and knowledge (e.g. planning and quality control engineers, hotel and accommodation managers and nurses). Occupations not classified above are termed ‘non-graduate occupations’, reflecting jobs where graduate level skills are inappropriate. This category was used to define over-education.</p>
<p>A repeated cross-sectional dataset from the years 1992–2010 of the UKLFS was constructed to give sufficient minority ethnic sample sizes. For the wage estimates, the dataset utilized the UKLFS wage sub-sample (1993–2010). Both samples were restricted to respondents holding NVQ<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0950017012458021">1</xref></sup> level 4 or 5 qualifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0950017012458021">2</xref></sup> UK Census definitions of ethnicity were used although sample sizes necessitated a focus on larger minority ethnic populations and the combining of some ethnic groups (Bangladeshi and Pakistani respondents). Matching was based upon the two<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0950017012458021">3</xref></sup> closest matched members of the comparison group sample who were most comparable to a given member of the minority ethnic sample based on Mahalanobis distances and propensity scores<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0950017012458021">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0950017012458021">Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0950017012458021">Rubin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0950017012458021">Sekhon, 2009</xref>). This matching was conducted on degree subject/type of higher level qualification (first degree, higher degree, nursing or teaching/other vocational qualification e.g. BTEC/NVQ), length of time in current job (tenure), number of hours worked per week, whether respondents had a partner (1=yes, 0=no), youngest dependent child age, region, age and year. The LFS does not include a lifetime employment experience measure, although age and job tenure were included in the matching process. For unemployment estimates, tenure and working hours were excluded. Matching confers a number of advantages over alternative regression based methods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0950017012458021">Oaxaca and Ransom, 1994</xref>). These latter methods as generally applied do not restrict estimates to individuals comparable in their characteristics, a situation which for current purposes risks mis-specifying estimates of ethnic penalties (regarding gender gaps, see both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012458021">Frölich, 2007</xref> and Ñopo, 2009: 290).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0950017012458021">Table 2</xref> gives the incidence of graduate level over-education for the minority ethnic and entire (i.e. not just matched) UK born white samples. Comparisons between these groups provide the ‘raw’ pre-matched ‘ethnic differences’ (as opposed to matched ethnic penalties) in over-education. Overall the representation of people with higher level qualifications in non-graduate occupations was greater for minority ethnic groups than for white UK born men and women. Black African and Pakistani/Bangladeshi women and men with graduate level qualifications were among the least likely to work in graduate jobs. Around 37.7 per cent of Black African women and 36.4 per cent of Pakistani/Bangladeshi women with higher level qualifications worked in non-graduate occupations compared to 24 per cent of white UK born women. The equivalent figures for men were 36.4 per cent and 33.4 per cent respectively compared to 18.8 per cent of white UK born men. Based on raw differences, Indian men and women tended to have lower levels of over-education although they were still more likely to be employed in non-graduate jobs than their white UK born counterparts. The representation of Black Caribbean women graduates in non-graduate jobs was fairly similar to white UK born women (25.9%). UK born white women nonetheless remained 5 per cent more likely than white UK born men to work in non-graduate occupations.</p>

<p>In addition to discrimination, labour market disadvantages such as poorer English language ability, less developed social networks or a lack of knowledge about the UK labour market and job application conventions are more concentrated among immigrant compared to native born minority ethnic men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012458021">Dustmann and Fabri, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012458021">Fleischmann and Dronkers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017012458021">Kogan, 2004</xref>). In the current study, however, the relationship between migration status and occupational attainment based on the raw pre-matched differences was mixed. UK born Black Caribbean and Pakistani/Bangladeshi women with higher level qualifications were considerably more likely to work in non-graduate occupations than their non-UK born counterparts (30.2% and 39.2% compared to 20.5% and 31.9% respectively). When the sample was restricted to the UK born, Chinese men were also among the most likely to be over-educated (32.7%). For some ethnic groups, however, levels of over-education were higher among immigrant men and women. This was particularly the case for Black African men where 38.1 per cent of those not born in the UK worked in non-graduate jobs compared to 29.3 per cent of the UK born.</p>
<p>The pattern of relative differences between ethnic groups remained fairly stable across the observation period with Black African and Pakistani/Bangladeshi men and women and Black Caribbean men consistently exhibiting the highest levels of over-education (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0950017012458021">Figure 1</xref>). With the exception of Indian women, who experienced a relative improvement in their representation in graduate jobs, a general upward trend in graduate over-education was observed which was more pronounced for minority ethnic men and women. For example, the percentage of Chinese women with higher level qualifications working in non-graduate occupations increased from 17.3 per cent to 31.6 per cent between 1992–2005 and 2006–10 (14.3 percentage points) whereas Pakistani/Bangladeshi men witnessed an increase from 27.7 per cent to 38.3 per cent (10.6 percentage points). This compared to an increase of around 2.7 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points for white UK born women and men respectively. Within the context of the expansion of higher education over the last two decades it would appear that the relative position of graduates from several minority ethnic groups has deteriorated. This could partly reflect compositional changes in graduate populations such as minority ethnic students disproportionately filling places at new universities rather than at traditional universities during the expansion of higher education.</p>

<p>The greater specialization in traditional graduate subjects among minority ethnic groups observed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>) was reflected in the type of graduate jobs undertaken (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012458021">Table 3</xref>). Indian and Chinese men and women and Pakistani/Bangladeshi women with NVQ level 4 or 5 qualifications were more likely to concentrate in traditional graduate occupations than white British men and women. Around 24.8 per cent of Chinese men with higher level qualifications worked in traditional graduate occupations compared to 18 per cent of white UK born men. Black African women with higher level qualifications in contrast were poorly represented in traditional graduate jobs with only 9.5 per cent of those with such qualifications working in these occupations compared to 16.5 per cent of white UK born women. Their employment was instead concentrated in non-graduate and ‘niche’ occupations – the latter being the most heterogeneous SOC (HE) graduate occupation category where most jobs do not require a degree. Despite their better overall representation in graduate compared to non-graduate occupations, a similar finding held for Black Caribbean women. These findings taken together are consistent with the high overall concentration of black women in nursing and other caring ‘niche’ professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458021">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0950017012458021">Table 4</xref> presents the matching estimates of ethnic penalties in graduate level over-education. The ATT here, taken as the ethnic penalty, denotes the difference between the proportion of a given minority ethnic group employed in a non-graduate occupation and the estimated proportion that would be expected to be so employed if they were members of the white UK born majority. For example, for Black African UK born graduate men, an ATT of 0.12 indicates they were 12 per cent more over-represented in non-graduate jobs compared to equivalent matched white UK male graduates. Covariate balance summary statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0950017012458021">Table 5</xref>. These indicate the extent to which covariate matching reduces the difference between the values of covariates between comparator groups, facilitating ‘like-with-like’ comparisons.</p>

<p><italic>Notes</italic>: Std mean difference is the difference between the standardized mean covariate value for a specific minority ethnic and matched comparator group multiplied by 100. Standardization uses the pooled standard deviation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0950017012458021">Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985</xref>). After matching t-test indicates the number of mean differences for covariates that remained statistically significant between compared groups following matching. A smaller number indicates better matching.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Matching highlighted the varying effects compositional differences in observable characteristics play in shaping labour market outcomes. After matching, compared to the raw differences the penalties for some groups were larger whereas for others they remained similar or were smaller. For Indian and Chinese men and women in particular, the pre-matched raw estimates concealed the extent of over-representation in non-graduate occupations. Thus whereas the raw difference suggested an over-representation of just 2.9 per cent for Indian men, after matching this figure increased to 7 per cent. For Black Caribbean men and Pakistani/Bangladeshi women in contrast the size of gap estimated was smaller following matching. The larger magnitude of the pre-matched ethnic differences witnessed for these groups was therefore attributable to observed human capital and demographic characteristics related to poorer labour market outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite the pre-matched differences suggesting a mixed picture regarding the relationship between immigration status and over-education, the relative position of foreign born compared to UK born men and women following matching was generally worse than suggested by the raw differences. For Black African and Pakistani/Bangladeshi men ethnic penalties were particularly higher for foreign born men, although this was not the case for Black African and Pakistani/Bangladeshi women. Consequently, whereas the raw differences suggested foreign born Pakistani/Bangladeshi women fared better in their representation in graduate occupations than their UK born counterparts, matching revealed a similar penalty of around 10 per cent for both groups (ATT=0.10, p &lt;0.01). Despite Black Caribbean women exhibiting similar levels of over-education to white women, Black Caribbean men experienced greater over-education penalties than white men, although this appeared largely due to penalties among non-UK born first generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Barriers to obtaining work matching qualification levels could also lead to longer job search or greater turnover, increasing levels of unemployment. Minority ethnic groups who were more poorly represented in graduate occupations also tended to have the highest levels of unemployment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0950017012458021">Table 6</xref>). The size of the differences between the raw pre-matched unemployment gaps and matched ethnic penalty estimates were generally smaller though than for over-education (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0950017012458021">Table 7</xref>). This suggested that the raw unemployment gaps were more consistent with what would be expected based on observed human capital and demographic characteristics. Apart from Black African men and Black Caribbean women, unemployment penalties were most pronounced among non-UK born respondents with Pakistani/Bangladeshi foreign born men experiencing the largest penalty at 17 per cent (ATT=0.17, p &lt;0.01).</p>

<p>For the wage estimates, due to the smaller wage sub-sample the Black Caribbean and Black African groups were combined into a single category. Overall patterns of hourly wage rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0950017012458021">Table 8</xref>) were similar to those observed for patterns of over-education. Among men, black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi respondents exhibited the biggest wage penalties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0950017012458021">Table 9</xref>). Notably, although the pre-matched wage gap and matched (ethnic penalty) estimates were similar for Pakistani/Bangladeshi men (-£3.89 and -£3.61 respectively) the pre-matched estimate considerably underestimated the wage penalties experienced by black men (-£2.95 compared to -£5.89 matched ethnic penalty). The matched wage penalty for Indian men in contrast was much smaller (-£0.54) and was not statistically significant. The pre-matched wage gap estimates nonetheless also concealed the wage penalties experienced by black women. After matching black women exhibited a mean hourly wage rate of around £2.46 less than white women, compared to a raw difference of -£0.58. Non-UK born Pakistani/Bangladeshi women similarly exhibited a wage penalty of around £2.19 per hour based on matched comparisons, although a similar penalty was not observed for those born in the UK. Based on their observed human capital and demographic characteristics a substantial proportion of minority ethnic men and women with higher level qualifications appear underpaid compared to their white UK born counterparts.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>Although past research suggests education for many minority ethnic men and women has provided a route to better employment or higher occupational status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012458021">Dale et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0950017012458021">Modood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017012458021">Platt, 2007</xref>) the current findings indicate higher level qualifications still do not appear to provide a panacea or facilitate an equalization of labour market outcomes to those of comparably educated white UK born men and women. Graduate level ethnic penalties were witnessed for several minority ethnic groups across labour market outcomes. Despite some groups such as Indian and Chinese men and women appearing to have comparatively favourable labour market outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017012458021">Khattab, 2009</xref>), matched contrasts to comparably educated white UK born men and women revealed labour market penalties concealed in simple overall comparisons. The extent of wage penalties experienced by Black African and Black Caribbean men and women were similarly only exposed through matching. Unemployment also precludes the risk of being classified as over-educated to a greater extent for some ethnic groups, warning against solely focusing on employed populations when examining ethnic penalties.</p>
<p>An important question remaining is why after controlling for compositional differences in individual characteristics ethnic penalties varied between minority ethnic groups? Although more fine-grained aspects of qualification heterogeneity between minority ethnic groups such as the greater concentration of Black African men and women in new universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012458021">Connor et al., 2004</xref>) could contribute to differences in labour market penalties, differential levels of discrimination towards specific minority ethnic groups relating to varying prejudices or stereotypes are a further likely factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0950017012458021">Modood, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, qualification heterogeneity-based explanations of over-education as currently formulated, focusing on individual ability and educational investment decisions remain problematic for explaining ethnic differences in over-education. Broader sociological literatures discussed earlier highlight how patterns of educational attainment are partly shaped by social advantage and disadvantage, related not only to ethnicity, but other important dimensions such as social class and gender.</p>
<p>Although vocational differences between ethnic groups may partly reflect historical patterns of geographical and occupational settlement, ethnic or racial stereotyping and workplace cultures related to both gender and ethnicity can place significant barriers to accessing professions, career advancement, or moving occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012458021">Bolton and Muzio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458021">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0950017012458021">Stainback et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, given degree subject was controlled for in the current study, labour market penalties also persisted after accounting for an aspect of vocational ‘choice’ or preferences emphasized in qualification heterogeneity accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458021">Chevalier, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458021">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0950017012458021">Machin and Puhani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0950017012458021">Ortiz and Kucel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnic penalties as currently measured, however, still only tell part of the story of the disadvantage experienced by minority ethnic groups, given they do not fully capture the influence of pre-labour market disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017012458021">Heath and Cheung, 2006</xref>: 19). Although the effects of such factors may be harder to identify in labour market data, they are implicit in the distributions of characteristics such as educational attainment between ethnic groups. Graduate level ethnic employment penalties nonetheless remain of concern to the employment prospects of minority ethnic graduates, as well as to broader issues of social equality and widening access to education, given they may reflect the cumulative effects of disadvantage not just within the labour market but in the wider education system and society.</p>
