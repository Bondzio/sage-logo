<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: This study examines the early impact on care coordinators’ (care managers’) work activity patterns of implementing the current personalization agenda within English local authorities. The Individual Budget (IB) pilots operated between 2005 and 2007 and provided a basis for personalization that, ultimately, sought to give personal care budgets to every eligible service user in England. Of particular interest was how the pilots impacted upon the roles, responsibilities and activity of care coordinators, who are expected to play a key role in this transformation of social care. A self-administered diary schedule was completed by 249 care coordinators, including teams directly involved in delivering IBs and a comparative sample of teams not involved in the pilots. These data were supplemented by semi-structured interviews with 48 care coordinators and 43 team managers.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: The study found that on most measures there were no differences in working patterns between care managers with and without IB holders on their caseload. However, the results do show that – contrary to expectations – more time was spent assessing needs, and that more time generally was required to conduct support planning activities.</p>
<p>• <italic>Application</italic>: The findings are necessarily dependent upon the early experiences of the pilot phase of IBs. As personal budgets are rolled out across all eligible service users, it will be interesting to examine whether the time-use of frontline staff, and indeed the wider organization, structure and function of local authority frontline teams, changes further.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468017311410681"><title>Personalization in English social care policy</title>
<p>In recent years, policy-makers in England have faced growing pressure to give greater influence to service users over the resources used to fund social care. Some recipients of publicly-funded adult social services have reported that their independence is constrained by the parameters of traditional care, and proponents of the Independent Living Movement have demanded alternative means of care delivery beyond direct provision of services, including a cash alternative to enable people to purchase their own support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311410681">Morris, 2006</xref>). The concept of a more personalized social care service suggests new roles for the individual service user and practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311410681">Foster, Harris, Jackson, Morgan, &amp; Glendinning, 2006</xref>) and indicates a shift in the relationship between policy maker and service consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311410681">Leadbeater, 2004</xref>). A consequence of this shift is that the ‘script of services’ may need to change, and that social workers could act more as brokers/agents for service provision, or even that this task might be removed from professional activity altogether.</p>
<p>These concepts and objectives, together with international developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311410681">Da Roit, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311410681">Timonen, Convery, &amp; Cahill, 2006</xref>), have increasingly influenced English policy initiatives in social care. In Europe, for example, a range of so-called ‘cash-for-care’ schemes were implemented in a number of different countries demonstrating variable impact, albeit within very different political, economic and social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311410681">Ungerson, 2004</xref>). In the context of a longstanding commitment to independence and choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311410681">Department of Health (DH), 1989</xref>), the 1996 Community Care (Direct Payments) Act similarly gave local authorities in England the power to offer ‘willing and able’ adults a Direct Payment – a cash payment in lieu of care services. In 2001, this became a mandatory requirement. However, amongst other factors, strict legislation and implementation, both in terms of which service users could use these payments and what the money could be spent on, have limited their take-up. The White Paper <italic>Valuing people</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311410681">DH, 2001</xref>) led to the development of a new type of user-held budget (supported by the ‘In Control’ social enterprise organization). Initially implemented with people with learning disabilities, this approach established the shape for the ambitious Individual Budget (IB) pilots to follow. The Cabinet Office's (2005) <italic>Improving the life chances of disabled people</italic> and subsequent White Paper <italic>Our health, our care, our say</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311410681">DH, 2006</xref>) detailed pilots that would act as a catalyst in subsequent changes in publicly funded social care services for adults.</p>
<p>Several principles underpinned this new policy and distinguished IBs from previous initiatives, including: more opportunity for users to define their own needs and desired outcomes (e.g. using self-assessment); more information about the amount of money they would receive and the cost of existing services; and greater control over how best to meet their needs using the available funding. IBs also aimed to bring together a range of resources from different funding streams. Finally, IBs were intended to allow users to take advantage of some of the flexibility and control offered by Direct Payments without the necessity of having to ‘manage the money’ by offering a range of options for controlling the budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311410681">DH, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since IBs have been piloted, the personalization agenda in English health and social care policy has continued. In 2007, the DH announced that personal budgets were to be rolled out across adult social care departments in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311410681">DH, 2007</xref>). Personal budgets are very similar to IBs, but do not integrate different funding streams, including only adult social care monies. More widely, successive UK governments have reiterated their aim of developing more personalized services. For example, in 2009, the broad ranging <italic>Building Britain's future</italic> (Her Majesty's Government [HMG], 2009) explicitly focused on the need for more personalization and choice. The UK government, elected in May 2010, continued the commitment to personal budgets promising to ‘extend the greater roll-out of personal budgets to give people and their carers more control and purchasing power’ (HMG, 2010: 30).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311410681"><title>Social services workforce</title>
<p>The social work profession has evolved in light of continuous social, organizational, political and legislative change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311410681">Barclay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017311410681">Younghusband, 1978</xref>). Writing over 30 years ago Sir William Utting commented that social services departments had succumbed to the ‘Goldilocks syndrome’, which is characterized by a restless testing of everybody else's bed, but without knowing which is one's own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311410681">Utting, 1975</xref>). This restlessness remains even today, and against this shifting environment several debates about the nature of the profession have developed (General Social Care Council [GSCC], 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311410681">Social Work Scotland, 2008</xref>). For example, there is discussion about the balance in the social work role between direct work (tasks involving face-to-face contact with the service user) and indirect work (usually office-based tasks).</p>
<p>The role of the social worker in the UK was substantially redefined by the community care reforms of the 1990s, which introduced care management for all adult user groups. Although this was a nationwide reform, differences in implementation led to significant variations in practice across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311410681">Challis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017311410681">Weiner, Hughes, Challis, &amp; Pedersen, 2002</xref>). Originally considered only as an intensive service for those with complex and severe needs, more often this became the usual system response to whatever level of support was required by the service user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311410681">Challis, 1999</xref>). This generic approach to care management shaped the subsequent practice of social work with adults. There has been a concern that it led to an increase in the administrative tasks required of social workers, thereby taking time away from direct contact with clients and perhaps reducing the more therapeutic aspects of the role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311410681">Leece, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311410681">Postle, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In children's services there have been calls for a renewed emphasis on a social workers’ responsibility to build a strong relationship with service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311410681">Blewett, Lewis, &amp; Tunstill, 2007</xref>) together with a promotion of the therapeutic nature of tasks such as assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311410681">Aldgate &amp; Seden, 2005</xref>). For social work with adults, however, the concept of direct contact is perhaps more problematic. The definition of ‘direct work’ has often lacked consistency, since several tasks defined as ‘directly’ helping service users do not take place face-to-face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017311410681">Statham, Cameron, &amp; Mooney, 2006</xref>). Indeed this ‘indirect’ work is believed to be essential to user well-being: for example, one Swedish study found greater time engaged in indirect activities could minimize the need for care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311410681">Björkman &amp; Hansson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The transformation of adult social care envisaged by the government has raised further questions about the roles of social workers. The functions of assessment and developing support plans, or care packages, can sometimes be undertaken by a wider number of people. For example, the increasing use of direct payments is likely to mean that people using services and carers are to play a much more active role in these aspects. Furthermore, a range of different organizations are likely to take some role. For example, third sector organizations such as Centres for Independent Living may offer support planning and brokerage services. There has been much speculation that social workers will only work with more complex cases, or where safeguarding issues are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017311410681">Manthorpe et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>While these developments have tended to downplay the role for social work in adult social care, there have been signs of government commitment to the importance of the profession as a whole. In 2009, the then Labour government commissioned a ‘Social Work Taskforce’ (SWTF), to do a major review of social work. This was prompted by impressions that recruitment and retention problems, training and public perception were preventing the profession from developing. This process resulted in a set of recommendations covering the education, management and continuing development of social work practice as well as the instigation of a college of social work (SWTF, 2009). Despite a change in government in 2010, there are continued plans to implement much of the recommended changes. The Social Work Reform Board (SWRB), initially set up under the Labour government published detailed proposals late in 2010, to develop an overarching ‘Professional Capabilities Framework’, standards for employers, education, continuing professional development and partnerships (SWRB, 2010). This suggests a continuing commitment to the social work profession in both adult social care and children's services. However, none of the publications discuss the role of social work with adults in any detail, nor do they reflect on the implications of the personalization agenda for practice.</p>
<p>Diary study methods can be a useful way of documenting professionals’ time use and can be used to assess any changes as a result of new service developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311410681">Diwan, 1999</xref>), and have been successfully implemented elsewhere. One such study explored the working practices of care managers and made comparisons with previous studies of social workers undertaken before the community care reforms of the 1990s. It found that although the amount of time spent in direct contact with the service user did not decrease, more time was spent on assessment and less, therefore, on monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017311410681">Weinberg, Williamson, Challis, &amp; Hughes, 2003</xref>). A similar study compared the working practices of care managers in community mental health settings with those in older people's services and found a more clinical approach to care management in the former, with more time spent on support and counselling activities than on administrative tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311410681">Jacobs, Hughes, Challis, Stewart, &amp; Weiner, 2006</xref>). This article follows up these previous studies by exploring whether or not the introduction of IB cases onto care coordinators’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468017311410681">1</xref></sup> workloads had any effect on the use of their time during an average working week.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468017311410681">Box 1</xref> outlines the main differences between (existing) care management and (new) IB processes. It has been hypothesized that the introduction of IBs would impact on the time use of frontline staff and perhaps that the care management role would need to be rebalanced or indeed diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311410681">Leadbeater, 2004</xref>). It has been speculated that for all users, less care coordinator time might be spent on gathering assessment information whilst more time might be spent on monitoring and reviews. It has also been suggested that less time overall will be spent on support planning, except for a few users requiring intensive support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311410681">Duffy, 2007</xref>). Others have suggested that there will be more time spent on safeguarding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311410681">Manthorpe et al., 2008a</xref>).

<p>Individual Budgets were piloted between 2005 and 2007 in 13 English local authorities chosen by the Department of Health. The data presented here were collected as part of an extensive national, multi-method evaluation of the initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311410681">Glendinning et al., 2008</xref>). This evaluation sought to assess the impact of IBs on user experiences and outcomes on the basis of a randomized controlled trial, but it also endeavoured to understand the processes underpinning those changes and the wider effect of the policy. Central to these ‘process’ enquiries was a mixed methods investigation of the impact of IBs on the practice of care coordination, primarily (although not exclusively) conducted by care managers with a social work background employed in local authority social services departments.</p>
<p>Altogether 12 of the 13 pilot sites were involved in workforce aspects of the research; one site was excluded because their unique approach to the pilots (which seconded two social workers to process all IBs) may have compromised the representativeness of the sample. A diary study of care coordinators was carried out in six pilot sites during May to July 2007 and a further six were asked to participate during September to December 2007. All care coordinators in teams working on IBs were invited to participate, whether or not they themselves had any IB users on their caseloads. In addition, care coordinators from a small number of teams from each site with no involvement at all in the pilot process were invited to take part.</p>
<p>Care coordinators were asked to complete a structured diary schedule every working day for a period of one week. The diary schedule was adapted from previous research which had successfully used this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311410681">von Abendorff, Challis, &amp; Netten, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311410681">Jacobs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017311410681">Weinberg et al., 2003</xref>). Forty-one job related activities were identified within six broad areas of care coordinators’ working time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1468017311410681">Box 2</xref>) and the diary schedule was divided into half-hour time slots from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm. Participants were asked to record the appropriate code for the activity in which they had been predominantly engaged for each half-hour period. Background information was additionally sought from each respondent together with their views of their work environment. Data were entered and analysed in SPSS (Version 14.0) and <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to detect statistically significant differences in time spent on different categories of activity between care managers with and without IB holders on their caseload. Correlation analysis and multiple regression techniques were then employed to explore variations in time spent care planning and arranging services.

<p>In addition to the diary study, four care coordinators and between two and four team managers were selected for interview from each of the 12 sites. Team managers were asked to identify care coordinators who had very little, or a great deal, of experience with IBs, to compare and contrast their views. Interviews were carried out with care coordinators from teams working with the full range of adult social care service users (people with learning disabilities, older people (including those with mental health problems), younger physically disabled people, and users of adult [i.e. not old age] mental health services). These semi-structured interviews complemented the diary study by enabling a more detailed investigation of how IBs affected care coordinator time use, and interviews therefore included:

</list>Altogether 48 care coordinators (including one local authority-employed broker) and 43 team managers were interviewed. The interviews with care coordinators were conducted face-to-face and those with team managers by telephone. All interviews were audio recorded with the consent of the participant and fully transcribed for analysis. A thematic coding frame was developed, using NVIVO 7, guided initially by the interview schedule but latterly substantially informed by the data. Transcripts were fully coded, data saturation being reached towards the end of the process, that is, no further codes were being generated.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468017311410681"><title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>In total 851 booklets, containing diary documents and background data collection forms relating to the respondents’ work setting, were distributed with 249 usable responses being returned. This represented a response rate of 29 percent, ranging from 13 to 58 percent across individual pilot sites. Our sample consisted of 22 (9%) care coordinators from teams not involved in any pilot work, 64 (26%) from teams involved in the pilot but without any IB cases themselves and 121 (49%) with IB users on their caseloads. Forty-one returns (16%) had missing data regarding the numbers of IB holders on their caseloads. Of those remaining, 199 returns were usable for the present analysis, having both background information questionnaires and diary sheets completed. Comparing our sample with the (limited) national data available from the Personal Social Services staff return in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311410681">Information Centre for Health and Social Care, 2007</xref>), there is some evidence that survey respondents were slightly less likely to be female (75% vs 84% nationally) and slightly more likely to work full-time (80% vs 70% nationally). This is not surprising since it might be expected that a higher proportion of full-time staff would be involved in piloting a new initiative such as IBs, and further that full-time staff would be more likely to respond to an invitation to participate in this research.</p>
<p>As the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311410681">Table 1</xref> show, the care coordinators in the study, both those with and those without IBs on their caseloads, had broadly similar characteristics. The average respondent in each group was in their early 40 s, and the majority of both groups were female, worked full-time and were qualified social workers. Overall, the majority of care coordinators were employed by the local authority. However, those with some IB users on their caseloads were significantly less likely to be employed by the NHS; this is unsurprising given that IBs were primarily introduced though local authorities.

<p>The aim had been to generate two groups of respondents: one of care coordinators working directly with one or more IB users on their caseloads, and another without any. It is therefore important to note that care coordinators completing the diary study had mixed caseloads. The stated numbers of IB users on the caseloads of those in the ‘some IB users’ group (<italic>n</italic> = 117) varied from one to 16 (mean 2.7) with 85 percent having four or fewer IB holders. It is possible, however, that these care coordinators may have had more IB users ‘in the pipeline’ (i.e. not yet in receipt of an IB) with whom they were having preliminary discussions. This group had total active caseloads<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468017311410681">2</xref></sup> of between three and 52 (mean 22 cases, with no significant user group differences). Moreover, we were cautioned by some respondents that the week of recording the diaries might not capture any of their time spent in relation to this small number of IB users. Thus, the differences between the figures for this group and those for the ‘no IB users’ group are unlikely to represent the full difference in time spent on various activities and, in particular, may under-estimate the IB impact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311410681"><title>Overall impact on workload</title>
<p>The diary study recorded an average working week of 38.5 hours for care coordinators with some IB users on their caseloads, and 37.0 hours for those without. This difference was not significant. However, the perception of many care coordinators raised during the interviews was that having IB users on their caseload was increasing their workload, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>Last week I spent three of my days on individual budgets alone. Which is having an impact now on the other work which I'm not able to process because of the constant doings of the IB. So everything's having a knock on effect. Things are just not getting done. I am working longer hours. (Care Coordinator, Older People)</p></disp-quote>Partly, this was thought by respondents to have been because authorities were ‘running two systems at once’, and partly it was felt to be due to learning new processes. However, care coordinators believed that this extra work was at the expense of other service users, creating a backlog of work, and that it could ultimately lead to more ‘fire fighting’ as the needs of unmonitored service users slipped into crisis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017311410681"><title>Time spent in direct contact with service users and carers</title>
<p>The diary study revealed that approximately one-sixth of care coordinators’ time each week was spent in direct contact with service users. This was not significantly affected by whether or not the care coordinator had any IB users on their caseload (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468017311410681">Table 2</xref>) and was similar to earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311410681">Jacobs et al., 2006</xref>). Care coordinators who had some IB users on their caseload did, however, spend significantly more time completing assessment documents with the service user and discussing care or support plan options.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>In the interviews, most care coordinators believed that IBs had resulted in more of their time being spent directly with service users, in particular around support planning activities and, to a lesser extent, on the assessment process:<disp-quote>
<p>The longest has taken probably about three working days. And that doesn't include the putting it together, the writing of the plan. That's just the actual preparation, getting the service user to talk about things … If I had gone to do an ordinary social work assessment I would've allowed two hours for an assessment. I would say it's a full day's work to do the assessment, write it up, put a little care plan together. (Care Coordinator, Transitions team)</p></disp-quote>Some relished the extra time they were spending with service users, in particular on support planning activities, and felt it was a return to their social work roots:<disp-quote>
<p>I think with IBs I can actually go out, meet with people, sit down with them and say, ‘Look, now we've got something that's perhaps going to meet your need.’ Beforehand, you were very restricted in what you could actually do. Whereas IBs now are giving me a little bit more of a helping hand to actually sit down and do real social work in some respects. (Care Coordinator, Physical Disabilities – Older People)</p></disp-quote>Others, especially in sites where the care management role was fragmented and where dedicated support planners had been brought in, expressed concern that care coordinators had less opportunity to spend time with service users than previously. In these instances there was sometimes a belief that their social work skills were being eroded:<disp-quote>
<p>I just feel like I'm doing an office job most of the time now. You know, when you train to be a social worker, you get trained in counselling techniques and different therapeutic approaches. What I do is go out with a tick box form and read it out to somebody and then get somebody to come back to tell me how much money they are allowed and that's not a social worker. It's getting worse and worse. (Care Coordinator, Older People)</p></disp-quote><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468017311410681">Table 2</xref> also shows that a similar proportion of care coordinators’ time in both groups was spent in direct contact with carers. However, those care coordinators with some IB users on their caseload spent significantly more time (0.8% vs 0.3%) assessing carers’ needs (either through a separate carers’ assessment or as part of the service user's Resource Allocation System [RAS]). Whilst only representing a very small part of a care coordinator's time overall, this finding is consistent with views expressed during interviews that IBs gave more opportunity to acknowledge the role played by carers:<disp-quote>
<p>Although we do routinely speak to carers, there is a section of the RAS that does actually ask the carers to think quite deeply about the impact of caring for the person, the impact that has on their life. It is overlooked on the [standard community care assessment] questions. If you ask somebody quite directly, ‘How much, on the whole, do you feel you are in control of your life?’ it can be quite surprising what people say. Quite thought provoking.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468017311410681"><title>Time spent on indirect casework</title>
<p>Over a third of a care coordinator's working week was spent engaged in indirect casework activities, for example, contacting services related to the service user and/or their carer, generally completed in the office. These activities constituted the largest part of a care coordinator's time, with the completion of assessment and other related paperwork making up the bulk of this work. This was also comparable to earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311410681">Jacobs et al., 2006</xref>). According to the diary study data, care coordinators with some IB users on their caseload did not spend significantly more time in indirect activity, or in completing paperwork, than other colleagues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468017311410681">Table 3</xref>).

<p>A mixed picture emerged from the interviews regarding the impact of IBs on the volume of paperwork involved in care coordination. Several argued that the IB process involved less desk-based paperwork as they completed the necessary forms in the service user's home. However, several interviewees involved in the pilot felt the IB process had increased the office-based work they had to complete. Respondents offered several reasons for this increase, including problems with adapting to a new working process generally, and specific aspects of the IB process which they felt had increased paperwork:<disp-quote>
<p>It adds time in little bits really because … you might come back with a self-assessment but then that's got to go to your team manager which will be waiting for whatever length of time that takes. Then that comes back to you so you've another half an hour's work to do …. then you've got to send letters out telling people what the budget … so you've got to wait for a response to that and then another half an hour's work. (Care Coordinator, Physical Disabilities)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468017311410681"><title>Time spent on organizational activities</title>
<p>Overall, a large proportion (about 12 hours) of the care coordinators’ working week was spent on agency-related activities (not attributable to individual service users) for both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468017311410681">Table 4</xref>). The only significant difference in this category was that care coordinators who had at least one IB user on their caseload spent a higher proportion (an extra hour, on average) of their week involved in training activities; this is perhaps unsurprising for an emerging service and reflects the efforts made in the pilot sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311410681">Manthorpe et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311410681">2010b</xref>).

<sec id="sec11-1468017311410681"><title>Time spent on different care management tasks</title>
<p>An alternative way of examining time use is to group care coordinators’ weekly activities by the core tasks of care management (assessment; care planning and arranging services; monitoring and review; support and counselling; administrative tasks; interface with health services). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468017311410681">Table 5</xref> illustrates, about one quarter of a care coordinator's working week was spent completing administrative tasks and this was not affected by the presence of IB users on a care coordinator's caseload. A further quarter of their time was spent on tasks relating to the assessment process, which seemed to occupy a larger part (about an hour more) of the working week for those working with IB users, although this was not a significant difference. However, most care coordinators interviewed felt that IB-related assessments did take more time to complete than traditional care management assessments. Some believed ‘it's like doubling your work’ and estimated that it could take an extra day to complete the assessment in addition to the time needed to write this up. A common complaint was that the IB assessments were being used in parallel with the existing care management assessment, causing a degree of duplication.

<p>Of particular interest, care coordinators with at least one IB user on their caseload did spend significantly more time (just under an hour) each week on support planning and arranging services. As mentioned earlier, most care coordinators agreed when interviewed that they spent more time in support planning activities when working with an IB user than in the traditional care management process. It was generally estimated that a traditional care plan would take a care coordinator between half an hour and an hour to draw up, often back at the office. For an IB support plan, this estimate increased to between six hours and three working days because the process required several additional visits to the service user and time for data entry.</p>
<p>However, estimates did vary according to whether a dedicated support planner was used or if service users or their families assumed a greater role. As suggested earlier, several respondents believed that the extra time spent on the support planning process could be beneficial to the user as it was a way of ensuring that they were fully involved. However, several were concerned about the range of financial information with which users and carers were being expected to become quickly familiar.</p>
<p>The data offer little indication that the increase in time spent by care coordinators working with at least one IB user on their caseload was at the expense of time spent on monitoring and review activities, although this would of course be less evident in the earlier stages of implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468017311410681"><title>What affects time spent care planning and arranging services?</title>
<p>As we have stated, the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468017311410681">Table 5</xref> demonstrate that care coordinators working with at least one IB user spent significantly more time care planning and arranging services. To establish whether this variation could be associated with factors other than the presence of IB users on a caseload, the correlations (Pearson's) between the number of hours spent ‘care planning and arranging services’ and a range of other characteristics were explored. The total number of hours worked (<italic>r</italic> = .204); whether the care coordinator worked with physically disabled adults (<italic>r</italic> = .138); holding a social work qualification (<italic>r</italic> = .184); and whether they worked on a team involving IBs (<italic>r</italic> = .156) – as well as having IBs on a caseload (<italic>r</italic> = .185) – were all significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) associated with greater time spent care planning. These variables were then entered into a regression model to identify which factors were independently associated with variation in the number of hours spent undertaking care planning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468017311410681">Table 6</xref>). Whether the care coordinator had IB cases on their caseload remained a significant factor in this regression, as did the total number of hours worked and whether the care coordinator held a social work qualification. Working with physically disabled adults (i.e. service user group) was no longer a significant factor.

<sec id="sec13-1468017311410681" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article presents the first systematic and detailed assessment of how the ongoing personalization agenda in social care might impact on the role of care coordinators, using data from the IB pilots. However, it is important to also understand the necessary limitations of the study. First, the sample for this study was modest due to a relatively low response rate. Despite efforts to provide support and clarification, there was reluctance on the part of many care coordinators to participate, in particular because of the pressures of being involved in a pilot authority in addition to normal workloads. However, the sample achieved is reasonably representative of this staff group, as shown in the comparisons described above. It is also important to note the unavailability of a true ‘control’ vs ‘intervention’ comparison. As detailed in the methods section, the way in which IBs were being introduced in pilot sites meant that staff involved in the pilot had mixed caseloads, and therefore the majority were also working with people receiving standard services. Nevertheless, we were able to investigate likely impacts in more detail using data from face-to-face interviews providing a more detailed picture of time use effects, and mixed caseloads may be a reasonable representation.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that this study evaluated an intervention in its early stages of implementation, and the number of IB holders on care coordinators’ caseloads was very small, especially considering the policy intention that all eligible service users should have IBs in the future. In the longer-term service users and carers may become more used to taking a greater role in support planning as the idea becomes more familiar. Further, there were early attempts by some pilot sites at contracting elements of support planning and particularly brokerage (identifying services and arranging the actual provision required) out to voluntary organizations and private sector companies. If such practices became more common, this will also impact on care coordinators’ roles and time use.</p>
<p>It is clear from our evaluation that personal budgets are likely to alter care coordinators’ roles and working patterns. In particular, the diary study suggests that aspects of assessment and support planning processes were taking up a larger proportion of time than in standard care management. Moreover, interviews with a wide range of care coordinators suggest that the nature of their work may be markedly affected by the introduction of personal budgets, possibly leading either to a reinvigoration or erosion of social work skills, dependent upon the nature of local implementation. Interestingly, the positive responses we have reported were akin to the views of staff working two decades ago in the devolved budget case management pilot studies, where the freedom to use resources flexibly and creatively for service users was highly motivating (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311410681">Challis &amp; Davies, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>One major aspect of these changes relates to assessment mechanisms: in all of the pilot sites new processes were being developed, intended to both promote a greater focus on service user outcomes and to facilitate a transparent and fairer allocation of resources. There were also movements in some sites towards a greater degree of self-assessment, in particular around the use of new assessment tools. It has been speculated that moving towards more self-assessment could lead to a diminished role for care coordinators in this part of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311410681">Duffy, 2007</xref>). However, this study found no evidence of a reduced role in assessment for care coordinators involved with IBs, in fact there was some indication of the reverse. Further, the national evaluation of self-assessment pilots in social care has demonstrated that, rather than being a substitute for a professional assessment, self-assessment is often conceptualized more as an adjunct to that process, informing the professional assessment which nonetheless continues to be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311410681">Challis et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, evidence from the wider IB evaluation suggests that new assessment processes were often running alongside existing ones, and that care coordinators were still struggling to fully understand the differences involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311410681">Glendinning et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, although greater time was being spent on assessments, it is possible this may diminish with greater familiarity and improved processes. This study also suggests that more time was being spent assessing carers’ needs under IBs, although this still only represents a very small proportion of their time.</p>
<p>A key point to emerge from this study is the impact of the intervention on the support planning role. These data found that care coordinators working with at least one IB user spent significantly more time care planning and arranging services for that user. Prior to the pilot it was suggested that only users with complex needs would require more time spent on support planning, and that this would be balanced out by less time required by others. It is not possible to conclude from these data whether complex cases received greater support planning assistance from staff, although qualitative data do suggest that the increase in time required to complete a support plan is perhaps universal. Although there are obvious potential benefits for the service user from the increased time spent tailoring a care plan to their needs, the impact on the workload of a care coordinator should also be recognized, especially if this extra time is required for all users and not only the smaller number with complex needs.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the debate about the nature of the social work role has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311410681">Barclay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311410681">Blewett et al., 2007</xref>; GSCC, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017311410681">Younghusband, 1978</xref>). With the introduction of self-directed support this debate continues, often centred on the balance between direct and indirect work. The diary study data presented here suggest that for both groups the same amount of time is spent undertaking tasks associated with direct work (where there is face to face contact with the service user) and indirect work (non-face-to-face tasks). Therefore, comparable to other work which considered the working practices of care managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017311410681">Weinberg et al., 2003</xref>) and social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311410681">Baginsky et al., 2009</xref>), the balance of a working week spent between these two types of tasks did not alter during the pilots. In any event, there is evidence to suggest that indirect work is as important, if not more so, in achieving some of the positive outcomes for service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311410681">Björkman &amp; Hansson, 2000</xref>). Perhaps the amount of direct or indirect tasks carried out is of less importance than the nature of this work? Our interview data suggest that, in fact, the nature of work carried out when working with IBs can lead to an increased use of social work skills such as spending time with service users and evaluating care and support activities.</p>
<p>As personal budgets are rolled-out across all eligible service users, it will be interesting to examine whether the time-use of frontline staff, and indeed the wider organization and structure of local authority frontline teams, changes further. We may see a greater degree of specialization and perhaps outsourcing of tasks, whereby some staff focus on developing skills to operate as support planners, whilst others retain gate-keeping roles to local authority funding or specialize in adult safeguarding. We may also see demarcation of responsibilities based upon levels of need, and a differentiation of response with some staff offering more intensive support (but with a smaller caseload of IB holders) than others. This will need to be reflected by the SWRB and the College of Social Work, in the professional and employer standards they are developing. One implication is that social workers may be practising in a wider variety of organizational contexts, making the implementation of social work standards and particularly employer standards much more difficult.</p>
