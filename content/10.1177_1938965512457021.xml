<abstract>
<p>The U.S. hotel industry faced two major external shocks in the decade of the 2000s, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the financial crisis of September 2008, which led to an economic recession. Using data from STR covering nearly 35,000 hotels, this study isolates the specific effects of the two shocks by controlling for other market factors (e.g., inflation, seasonality) and hotel characteristics (e.g., hotel size, segment, or operation type) that affect a hotel’s daily operations. The study shows that hotels were significantly affected by both events, but they started to recover relatively quickly, within four months of each shock. Because of the nature of the shock, the 9/11 terrorist attacks had an abrupt and dramatic impact in reducing hotels’ occupancy, and rates briefly followed occupancy downward. The effects of the financial crisis took longer to develop but were less striking and apparently well handled by most hotel managers. Looking specifically at New York City’s hotels which stand next to ground zero for both shocks, the study found a pattern of occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR similar to that of the nation as a whole. New York’s luxury hotels felt the brunt of the shocks, but they were able to recover. Overall, the study paints a picture of an industry that maintains its ability to address the effects of environmental shocks, and focuses well on revenue management. Far from being in disarray, hotel management addressed the effects of these two shocks, as evidenced by the hotels’ recovery.</p>

<p>The U.S. hotel industry has already experienced two major external shocks in this century, the terrorist attacks in September 2001 and the financial crisis that began in late 2008, and to an extent, continues to this day. Shocks to a hospitality firm can take many forms, including major shifts in economic forces, technologies, natural disasters, and political regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965512457021">Marino et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965512457021">Meier and O’Toole 2009</xref>). The conventional view is that shocks such as 9/11 and the economic implosion are damaging to the industry’s revenues, but it is also possible that the impact of environmental jolts is overstated. Instead it may be that hotel firms are able to absorb this type of environmental uncertainty and adjust within a short period. At the same time, the fact that the locus of an external shock was geographically close to a hotel may have a strong influence on how well a hotel weathers the shock. Clearly, the impact of external shocks can vary to a large extent across industries and locations. For this reason, we have focused our attention specifically on the hotel industry in the United States, which was heavily affected by the 2008 economic failure, and also conduct a separate subsample analysis of New York City, which was ground zero for the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>In this study, we explore how these two environmental shocks affected performance in the hotel industry in the month of the shocks and subsequent months. We seek to isolate the impact of shocks from other market factors and hotel characteristics or attributes that together shape hotels’ performance. While speculation and opinion has flourished on the impact of these shocks to the lodging industry, little attempt has been made to devise empirical models to isolate and then explore the effects of these events on hotel performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965512457021">O’Connor et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512457021">Faulkner 2001</xref>). Many commentators believe that these external shocks led to unpredictable fluctuations in demand that seriously affected hotel performance and growth for an extended period of time. However, most studies that led to those conclusions were macroeconomic analyses. Instead, our study adopts a microeconomic focus and puts attention on data at the hotel property level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965512457021">Ozler and Rodrik 1992</xref>). In particular, our analysis of property-level data allows us to examine whether these shocks had a differential impact on hotels in New York City and hotel chain scale segments at all levels.</p>
<p>The collapse of the financial markets and the devastating events of September 11 were both expected to have an important impact on lodging industry demand. In the wake of 9/11, as documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512457021">Hanson (2001)</xref>, prices dropped in lodging stocks in anticipation of declines in tourism and travel. However, beyond the impact of an external shock, a drop in real disposable incomes of U.S. consumers is likely to lead to a decline in aggregate demand for lodging products and services as individuals curtail discretionary leisure travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965512457021">Walsh, Enz, and Canina 2004</xref>). Similarly, convention and business travel may also decline as financial constraints put pressure on business enterprises to cut their travel costs. Overall, firms that do not adjust their operating strategies to cope with economic and market realities are likely to face declines in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965512457021">Fischer, Lee, and Johns 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965512457021">Marino et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to resource dependence theory, organizations rely on their environments for critical resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965512457021">Pfeffer and Salancik 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512457021">Enz 2010</xref>). Consequently, the literature in organizational theory has explored many ways that firms manage their dependencies and buffer themselves from environmental uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965512457021">Thompson 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965512457021">O’Toole and Meier 2003</xref>). While mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, supplier contracting, and other activities help a firm to buffer itself from the environment, disruptions from external shocks can nevertheless be destabilizing.</p>
<p>We know that air transportation was disrupted in the wake of September 11, and consumer confidence in safe travel was eroded. What remains a matter of speculation even now is how long it actually would take for a rebound in demand to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965512457021">Walsh 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965512457021">Fischer, Lee, and Johns (2004)</xref> warn that external shocks may threaten firms’ long-term performance. Again, little systematic empirical research has focused on this matter.</p>
<p>While we are considering operating results here, other researchers have considered the effects on hotel equities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512457021">Cam (2008)</xref> found that the airline, hotel, and leisure industries exhibited negative abnormal equity returns following September 11, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965512457021">Chang and Zeng (2011)</xref> report that hospitality stocks’ returns following terrorist attacks were well in excess (10 to 15 percent) of those experienced by the rest of the stock market, following an initial negative reaction. The overall mixed results of these empirical studies support the view that we have yet to fully understand the relationship between terrorism behavior and the postevent tourism industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965512457021">O’Connor, Stafford, and Gallagher 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the economy remains turgid at this writing, the critical moment for the financial crisis of 2008 can be dated as September 15, the day after Lehman Brothers shocked the financial world by declaring bankruptcy. The stock and housing markets subsequently collapsed, taking with them untold personal wealth and leading to declines in consumption and business investment. Again, demand for travel dropped, along with the lodging industry’s performance.</p>
<p>In this study, we focus on these two broad, albeit distinctive shocks, for several reasons: First, both shocks were presumed to have a severe impact on the industry, as noted in industry publications. Second, both have origins in New York City, one of the largest hotel markets in the United States. Third, detailed data on lodging performance before and after these events were available, making it possible to identify the industry’s reaction to these events. Finally, despite their differences, the two shocks both were unforeseen, external to the industry, and created substantial uncertainty.</p>
<p>To study the effects of these environmental shocks directly on the performance of individual hotels, we deploy a longitudinal modeling approach that not only controls for various hotel and market characteristics, such as hotel size and age, monthly seasonality, unemployment, population, and other market-specifics, but also (to us) unobserved hotel heterogeneity across hotels (i.e., hotel fixed effects) such as good or bad hotel management. Empirical models that include critical controls are necessary because all such factors tend to affect hotel performance at the same time as the external shocks and if omitted one could mistakenly attribute their impact to external shocks.</p>
<p>Using data on 34,695 hotels in the United States from 2000 to 2009 we explore how September 11 and the financial crisis have affected three critical performance measures: hotel-level occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR) within the U.S. lodging industry. We argue that the unexpected nature of these shocks creates fluctuations in all these performance measures, and that these shocks to the business environment will have a differential impact on various hotel segments (e.g., luxury vs. economy). While some external shocks have a short-term impact (e.g., a few days or weeks), others have longer-lasting effects (e.g., months or longer). The duration of these effects depends in part on how managers and customers conceptualize and interpret their external world. Hence, we also explore the duration of these shocks in order to determine when a rebound in lodging demand began after each shock. Finally, we explore whether different segments experience different durations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938965512457021">
<title>The Data: STR</title>
<p>Monthly hotel performance data on room demand, room supply, and room revenue, as well as hotel census data providing various hotel characteristics including hotel opening date, segment, operation type, and geographic location were obtained from Smith Travel Research (STR). The STR database covers more than 98 percent of U.S. hotel properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1938965512457021">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dependent variables of interest in this study are monthly measures of revenue per available room (RevPAR), average daily rate (ADR), and occupancy for each hotel. Because of the reasons discussed further below, we deflate ADR and RevPAR using monthly price indexes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to obtain monthly real ADR and real RevPAR.</p>
<p>To control for time-varying market characteristics, we combined the STR data with annual information from the U.S. Census Bureau and BLS on county demographics and employment. For each county, these variables include population (from the Census Bureau’s annual population estimates); the unemployment rate (from the BLS); employment in arts, entertainment, and recreation; employment in food and drinking establishments; employment in the accommodation industry; and the number of establishments in the accommodation industry (all from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns data).</p>
<p>Our sample includes 34,695 hotels distributed across 2,283 counties, over periods of twelve months for ten years. The final regression sample included a total of 3,454,362 observations when the dependent variable is real RevPAR and 3,420,006 observations when the dependent variables are occupancy and real ADR. The largest number of hotels in our sample operates in the economy segment (11,745 hotels) and midscale without food and beverage segment (10,686 hotels; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965512457021">Exhibit 1</xref>). Not surprisingly, the largest hotels in terms of average number of rooms operate in the luxury (368 rooms) and upscale segments (155 rooms). Meanwhile, the oldest hotels on average are independents (35 years old), and branded midscale hotels with food and beverage (26 years old). The means and standard deviations for occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR show that average occupancy rate in our overall sample was 49 percent, while real ADRs averaged $55.88 and real RevPARs were on average $34.91. Notable standard deviations of performance variables also reflect the important price and revenue differences across hotel segments.</p>

<title>Patterns of Inflation, Seasonality, and Segmentation</title>
<p>Before examining the impact of external shocks on hotel performance and to further motivate our empirical analyses, we provide an overall picture of annual average ADR, occupancy, and RevPAR performance between 2000 and 2009. Using monthly STR data, we calculated hotel mean values for our three performance variables for our regression sample of 34,695 hotels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1938965512457021">2</xref></sup> In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965512457021">Exhibit 2</xref>, the annual means are provided in both nominal and real values. While nominal data rely on the face value of currency over the ten years, real values are corrected for inflation by adjusting them to the same monetary value as of January 2000 (start of our sample) using monthly Consumer Price Indexes (CPIs) reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1938965512457021">3</xref></sup> Average daily rates rose substantially in nominal terms during the period 2004-2008, but the same data in real terms indicate that this increase was driven by overall price inflation. In addition, occupancy appears to have dropped more substantially after the financial crisis in 2008 than after the events of September 11. These data show the effects of inflation and support the practice of deflating the nominal monthly figures for the sake of comparability.</p>

<title>Monthly variation in performance—the role of seasonality</title>
<p>Looking at monthly variation helps us to understand the lodging industry’s seasonality patterns and to explore the shocks in the context of these monthly patterns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965512457021">Exhibits 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938965512457021">4</xref> provide monthly ADR, occupancy, and RevPAR values in both nominal and real values for the year before and after the terrorist and economic shocks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 3</xref> suggests that overall seasonal dynamics were quite similar in 2000-2002, with notable drops in occupancy and hence RevPAR after September 11. Note that <italic>regular</italic> drops in all performance measures occur each year in September when compared to summer months. Hence, even without external shocks, seasonal lows regularly occur in the fall and to a greater degree in December and January. Seasonal highs are evident in the summer months.</p>

<p>Looking at the pattern in the data before and after the financial crisis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938965512457021">Exhibit 4</xref> suggests a more dramatic impact from the crisis beyond the usual seasonal dynamics. In real terms, occupancy rather than ADR changed substantially after the financial crisis. Furthermore, ADR appears to have declined more gradually after the crisis than did occupancy.</p>
<p>Overall, regardless of whether we adjust for inflation and regardless of whether any environmental shock occurred, we see strong patterns of seasonality in all performance measures. This shows the importance of controlling for seasonality in the empirical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938965512457021">
<title>Do segments matter?</title>
<p>Industry observers often note that the impact of events on various segments of the industry differs. For example it is often thought that the luxury segment is the first to feel the effects of economic problems, but thanks to high levels of customer loyalty and service quality, luxury hotels are also thought to be the first segment to recover. The mean performance variables by segment for the ten years of our study, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938965512457021">Exhibit 5</xref>, suggest that several segments have slightly different patterns of behavior as shown by the points in which segments intersect or have less parallel performance over time. These results suggest that our empirical analysis should also control for differences across hotel segments when analyzing the impact of shocks.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1938965512457021" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Overall, these aggregate examinations of the industry data indicate that our efforts to identify the impact of external shocks necessitates the separation of potentially confounding factors such as aggregate monthly inflation, monthly seasonality typical in the hotel industry, and segment differences. Therefore, in all our estimations we use real dollar values for our financial performance measures to control for monthly inflation. In addition, our empirical approach controls for monthly seasonality and cross-segment differences as well as market and hotel characteristics, as described next.</p>

<p>To isolate the effects of the external shocks, our empirical models controlled for various observed hotel and market-level characteristics. Seasonality typical for the hotel industry, unobserved hotel heterogeneity (i.e., hotel fixed effects), and unobserved aggregate changes (e.g., general fluctuations in GDP) are other factors that could affect demand for individual hotel properties and thus hotel performance. The empirical models of firm performance developed here include variables similar to those used in the empirical industrial organization or strategic management literature. In the specific context of the hotel industry, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965512457021">Kosová, Lafontaine, and Perrigot (forthcoming)</xref> as an example of a similar modeling strategy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965512457021">Canina, Enz, and Harrison (2005)</xref> also estimate hotel performance using similar models, but rely on cross-sectional hotel data for a given year not panel data across many years as we do in this study.</p>
<p>Given the discussion above, the empirical model we estimate can be written in the general form as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>i</italic> indexes individual hotels, <italic>m</italic> indexes month (1-12), and <italic>t</italic> indexes year (2000-2009), and <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>imt</italic></sub> stands for our three performance measures of interest: occupancy rate (in percentage), real ADR, and real RevPAR.</p>
<p><italic>Shock</italic><sub><italic>Sept01</italic></sub> and <italic>Shock</italic><sub><italic>FC08</italic></sub> represent the binary (dummy) variable indicators equal to 1 in the month and year when a given shock occurred and equal to 0 otherwise. To explore the duration of each shock, in later analyses we include additional dummy variables for the subsequent four months, a standard practice in event studies within the economics and finance literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965512457021">Wooldridge 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965512457021">Belasen and Polachek 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965512457021">Strobl 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1938965512457021">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We include in all our analyses the following control variables:</p>
<p><italic>HotelCharact</italic><sub><italic>imt</italic></sub> represents the set of hotel characteristics including hotel age; monthly hotel capacity or size (monthly number of room-nights available); binary indicators (dummies) for each segment, including five branded segments (luxury, upscale, midscale with F&amp;B, midscale without F&amp;B, and economy) and independent (unbranded) hotels to account for differences in performance across segments that typically occur because of different quality levels of service offered; and hotel operation-type dummies (i.e., whether a hotel is operated under chain management, franchised, or operated by the independent owner as classified by STR). The hotel operation dummies help us to capture unobserved changes in ownership and hotel organizational structure that could potentially bias our estimates of external shocks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1938965512457021">5</xref></sup> The variables of hotel size, age, and population are in logarithmic form to allow for a nonlinear impact on performance and smooth out the potential impact of outliers as these variables have large ranges of values.</p>
<p>In addition, we include a one-month lag of occupancy when the dependent variable is real ADR. This is consistent with business practice in the hotel industry as we expect hotel management to change prices in reaction to observed occupancy rates in the previous month as part of the usual revenue management and capacity handling strategies. Similarly, we include a lag of (real) ADR when the dependent variable is occupancy since customers usually book rooms in advance based on past-period prices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1938965512457021">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>MktCharact</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents the set of market characteristics that we measure at the geographic level across 2,283 counties in our sample, namely, population, unemployment rate percentage, and employment (in 1000s) in related industries (arts, entertainment, and recreation; food and drinking), as well as employment and number of establishments in the accommodation industry. Omitting these variables could also potentially bias our estimates of the shocks. In addition, employment in the accommodation industry helps us to capture county-level business cycles specific to the hotel industry (e.g., time-varying changes in county demand [or supply] for hotel services, changes in wages or employment laws affecting hotel employees).</p>
<p><italic>Season</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> represents the set of binary indicators (dummies) for each of the twelve months to capture seasonal variation in performance typical for the hotel industry. Monthly dummies are coded 1 if a particular observation appears in a given month <italic>m</italic> and 0 for other months. In the empirical economics literature, including the vector of monthly dummies is the standard way to “deseasonalize” the data (e.g., see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965512457021">Wooldridge 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Year</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents dummies for the ten years in our sample. They help control for unobserved aggregate changes in the overall lodging industry over years that may occur because of reasons other than environmental shocks, including changes in demographic or technology trends, changes in U.S. tourism due to globalization trends, annual fluctuations in GDP (and thus yearly changes in overall lodging supply or demand relative to GDP), as well as policy changes (e.g., immigration) or political changes (e.g., elections).</p>
<p>Given the ten-year time frame of our data we have a sufficiently large period between the two shocks, enabling us to more reliably estimate the impact of <italic>other</italic> unobserved aggregate changes. The large time period between shocks also facilitates a reliable estimation of the monthly seasonality, market characteristics, and some hotel characteristics such as age that tend to vary only yearly.</p>
<p>Finally, µ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents unobserved hotel attributes or hotel-level unobserved heterogeneity and ϵ<sub><italic>imt</italic></sub> is an idiosyncratic error term. Unobserved heterogeneity includes such things as a good or bad hotel manager, specifics of hotel location (e.g., near a beach, mountains, noisy corner of the street, or area with typically low (or high) taxes or real-estate prices), brand affiliation, or whether a given hotel is a “typical” underperformer even without the external shocks. Although such “hotel-specific effects” are not measurable or observed in our (or any) data, their presence will definitely influence how much different hotels will be affected with external shocks. Consequently, we control for such unobserved hotel heterogeneity (or “hotel-specific effects”) by using standard panel data fixed-effects estimation approach (hence, “hotel fixed effects”). For a detailed discussion of the mechanics of the fixed-effects estimator, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938965512457021">Wooldridge (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>Controlling for hotel fixed-effects in our estimations is essential, especially given the large number of observations (with 34,695 hotels we have the same number of “hotel fixed effects”) relative to the number of time periods (120 months), as it helps us to eliminate bias in our estimates of the shocks due to the self-selection problem, which might occur, for example, when a hotel’s poor performance occurs because of poor management, a bad location, or a weak brand, rather than the shocks. To ensure more robust results, beyond controlling for the variables discussed above, we correct standard errors in all our estimations for heteroscedasticity and hotel-level clusters.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 6</xref> shows the results from fixed effects models estimating the impact of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis on lodging performance (i.e., occupancy, real ADR, and real RevPAR), controlling for numerous other factors including hotel and market characteristics, unobserved hotel heterogeneity (i.e., hotel fixed effects), seasonality, segment differences, and other potential macro-level changes, as discussed in the methods section. As the coefficients suggest, both external shocks had a significant immediate impact on hotel performance, with the effects due to September 11 being much greater than those flowing from the 2008 financial crisis. The terrorist attacks contributed to a 4.17-percent decline in occupancy rates, while ADR dropped (in real dollars) by about $1.00 and real RevPAR experienced a decline of $4.16. Given the mean values of ADR and RevPAR in our sample, these estimates imply that the ADR dropped by 1.8 percent, while RevPAR fell by 11.9 percent. These magnitudes suggest that while 9/11 profoundly affected occupancy and subsequently real RevPAR, the impact on real ADR was modest.</p>

<p>The effects of the financial crisis were much smaller. Occupancy dropped by 0.80 percent, while the drop in real ADR was only 28 cents. Ultimately, real RevPAR dropped by about 70 cents because of the crisis. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> indicating the within-hotel variation for each of the models is relatively large given the panel nature of our data. Our models show a good fit and provide reliable estimates when explaining the variance in lodging performance.</p>
<sec id="section7-1938965512457021">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Although the control variables are not the primary interest of our study, their coefficients suggest that hotel characteristics such as size (i.e., monthly number of room-nights available), age, and segment are significant predictors of a hotel’s performance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 6</xref>). While larger hotels show better performance in terms of all three measures, older hotels charge significantly lower (real) ADRs than younger hotels and enjoy higher occupancy and higher (real) RevPARs on average.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938965512457021">
<title>Segments and prior month occupancy and ADR</title>
<p>The analysis also highlights the differential performance of the various hotel segments. For instance, if we look at real ADR and RevPAR (columns 2 and 3), the negative coefficients of segment dummies indicate that compared to the luxury segment (our control group) all the other segments have significantly lower ADRs and RevPARs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis also confirms our expectation that hotel managers tend to change prices in reaction to observed occupancy rates in the prior month. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 6</xref> (column 2) shows, a 1-percent increase in the past-month occupancy rate is associated with 0.188 (about 19 cents) increase in the (real) ADR in the current month. Similarly, the significant coefficient of lagged ADR when the dependent variable is occupancy (column 1) supports our expectation that customer booking behavior is shaped by pricing in a prior time period. Given that hotel prices are often perceived by customers as signals of quality, we consistently find that a higher price in the prior month is associated with higher hotel occupancy in the current month. So including these variables in our ADR and occupancy models as additional controls is statistically warranted and critical to isolating the effects of external shocks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1938965512457021">
<title>Employment and population density</title>
<p>The results also demonstrate the effects of such factors as unemployment rate, population levels, and employment in complementary industries such as the arts, entertainment, food, drinking, and recreation. Hotels in locations with larger populations, for instance, have relatively high ADRs and RevPAR but lower occupancies, most likely because of the large supply of hotels. Large-market hotels can charge rate premiums but face more challenges in filling rooms. Finally, the monthly dummies in our analysis accounted for hotel-industry seasonality and year effects. All the dummies were significant at 1 percent, indicating important differences in performance across years and months or seasons, consistent with the aggregate industry patterns discussed earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1938965512457021">
<title>Duration of Shocks—When Did the Rebound in Performance Start?</title>
<p>We explored the duration of shock effects for a four-month period after the shock, the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965512457021">Exhibit 7</xref>. In addition to “event dummies” that capture the immediate impact of 9/11 and financial crisis, we also included the vector of four dummies equal to 1 (0 otherwise) for each month following each shock. We experimented with longer periods, but found that the four-month time frame sufficiently captures the start of the industry rebound. Our analysis of the postshock period allows us to reliably control for other unobserved annual and seasonal shocks and thus isolate our examination to focus on specific shock effects. Although specifications in all the columns include the same control variables as those included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 6</xref> (including seasonal, hotel operation type, and yearly dummies), to save space we report only the coefficients related to the shocks.</p>

<p>As the results indicate, the impact on occupancy rates was an immediate drop after September 11, with the negative impact diminishing in subsequent months. Occupancy had still not rebounded four months later, though the drop attributable to 9/11 by that point was quite small, about 0.2 percent in January 2002.</p>
<p>The behavior of ADR was noticeably different. The greatest drop occurred in the third month after 9/11—a reduction of $2.21 or 4 percent on average in December 2001. ADR began to recover in January 2002, when ADR rebounded to about $0.44 on average compared to the months without shocks. This indicates that ADR jumped by $2.60 between December 2001 and January 2002. RevPAR followed occupancy down in September, gradually improved thereafter, and (on the strength of improved ADR and recovering occupancy) was higher than the historical average by about $0.60 in January 2002.</p>
<p>While occupancy dropped in the wake of the September 2008 financial crisis, ADR wavered only briefly and then resumed its rise. Occupancy dropped for the three months after September 2008, and then rose in January 2009, when average occupancy improved by 1.05 percent. The impact of the financial crisis on ADR, while significant, was modest in real dollar terms, and was negative only in September (a drop of 25 cents). Thereafter, ADR experienced significant increases in November 2008 through January 2009, with an average rise of $3.35 or 5.99 percent in January. Real RevPAR, like occupancy rates, was negatively affected by the financial crisis, particularly in November (average drop of $3.23) and December (average drop of $2.71). The average drop of about $3.00 for these two months represents an 8.5 percent drop in RevPAR given our sample mean of $34.91. However, an average rise of $2.89 was experienced in January 2009, representing a rise in RevPAR of 8.28 percent on average. Overall, four months after the terrorist attacks, both ADR and RevPAR had improved compared to months without shocks, while occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR had all gradually improved by January 2009, following the financial crisis.</p>

<title>Segment-by-Segment Analysis</title>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965512457021">Exhibit 6</xref> indicated significant variation in performance between segments—consistent with our discussion of aggregate data patterns. However, the set of dummies captures only differences in “intercept shifts” (not slopes). So to further explore whether performance differences across segments go beyond the intercept shifts and also affect responses to the two shocks, we split the sample into different segments and replicated the analysis separately for each of our six segments—including branded hotels (luxury and upscale) and the set of independent (unbranded) hotels. One additional advantage of separate analyses by segment is that such analyses allow us to estimate the total impact of each shock and its duration on each segment. Thus we can better understand potentially different segment dynamics and the impact of environmental shocks on hotel performance across segments.</p>
<sec id="section12-1938965512457021">
<title>Impact on Occupancy</title>
<p>Occupancy levels in the top end of the market saw the greatest effect from 9/11, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965512457021">Exhibit 8</xref>. During this period, the monthly drops in occupancy attributable to the 9/11 attacks ranged between 3.0 percent and 7.2 percent for luxury, and between 1.6 percent and 5.5 percent for upscale hotels. By contrast, economy and independent hotels were least affected by the terrorist attacks, with occupancy drops between 1.4 and 2.6 percent. Midscale hotels experienced only slightly larger drops due to 9/11 during the same period, between 1.4 and 3.8 percent. However, by January 2002, only economy hotels continued to show a significant, though tiny (0.7 percent), drop in occupancy due to the terrorist attacks, and the effect had disappeared for all the other segments.</p>

<p>Turning to the financial crisis, the luxury segment of the industry again experienced the hardest hit, but this was most noticeable in November, two months after the Lehman bankruptcy. Indeed, all hotel segments were hardest hit in the second month after the crisis (November), suggesting that the situation worsened over time, unlike the more immediate negative impact of the terrorist attacks. Four months after the start of the financial crisis, however, only luxury and upscale hotels still continued to experience negative occupancy affects. Even so, these were only about 2 to 3 percent compared with the 5- to 6-percent drops in November 2008. Economy and independent hotels again saw the smallest negative effects as a result of the financial crisis. Interestingly, our data show that economy and midscale hotels experienced slight rises in occupancy in January 2009, while the negative effect due to the shock disappeared for independent hotels by January 2009. Our results suggest that the drops in average occupancy shown for the aggregate (not hotel-level) data between 2008 and 2009 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938965512457021">Exhibit 5</xref> must be due to the other factors controlled for in this study, rather than the isolated result of the financial crisis. This finding is a cautionary tale that illustrates how aggregate data that do not take into consideration inflation, unemployment, seasonality, and other market and hotel characteristics (e.g., hotel size and age) overstate the impact of the external shocks studied here.</p>

<title>Impact on ADR</title>
<p>The impact of September 11 on real prices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965512457021">Exhibit 9</xref>) shows that luxury and upscale hotels were once again most negatively affected. Unlike occupancy levels, however, the negative impact was greatest for upscale hotels in November 2001 and luxury hotels in December 2001. In December, the attacks contributed to a drop in real ADR on average of $10.60 for luxury hotels and $5.22 for upscale hotels. The negative impact of the terrorist attacks on ADRs for midscale, economy, and independent hotels in the three months following September 2001 was significant. While the numbers were not large in absolute terms (ranging from $0.78 to $1.54), such reductions still represent economically relevant percentages when taking into account the mean ADR for each segment. For example, the impact of terrorism on luxury hotels in October 2001 was a $3.07 per room reduction (constituting a 2.4% drop in rate) while the impact on real ADR in economy hotels was 79 cents (a 2% drop in rate), the impact on upscale hotels was $3.38 (a 3.9% drop in rate), and the impact on midscale hotels without food and beverage was 82 cents (a 1.3% drop in rate). By the start of 2002, however, all segments except the economy segment experienced significant improvements in real ADR. Only a mild negative impact due to the terrorist attacks (about 42 cents, representing a 1% drop in rate) remained for economy hotels.</p>

<p>The financial crisis of 2008 had a shorter and less negative impact on lodging prices than was the case for the terrorist attacks of 2001, keeping in mind that the ADRs were adjusted for monthly inflation in our models. After September 2008, on average, the price for a midscale hotel without food and beverage was the least negatively affected among all the segments. Price drops in luxury hotels (from 51 cents to $1.80) and upscale hotels (from 18 to 80 cents) again represent the worst real price drops among branded hotels attributable to financial crisis. At the same time, independent hotels did not experience any statistically significant declines after the month of September. Midscale and economy hotels likewise did not experience negative effects attributable to the financial crisis during that period. In fact, the impact of the financial crisis on these segments was positive, albeit modestly so. Furthermore, by January 2009 no hotel segment experienced reductions in real ADR attributable to the financial crisis (noting again that we controlled inflation and other factors). Once again, the data show that the isolated effects of the external shock on price were brief.</p>

<title>Impact on RevPAR</title>
<p>Finally, we explored the impact of the two external events on real RevPAR by hotel segment. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1938965512457021">Exhibit 10</xref> show a similar pattern to those found for occupancy and real ADR. Although luxury hotels again experienced the worst hit (a drop of $13.3 to $25.40), the terrorist attacks had an immediate, large, negative, and significant impact on real RevPAR for all hotel segments. Comparing the impact of terrorism in the first month, luxury hotels experienced a 29-percent drop in RevPAR, while independent hotels dropped 20.2 percent and upscale hotels experienced drops of 19.8 percent. In contrast, midscale hotels with food and beverage experienced RevPAR drops of about 14.2 percent, midscale without food and beverage dropped 9.2 percent, and economy hotels were least affected with a drop of 6.8 percent. However, the industry rebounded relatively quickly; four months after the attacks only the economy segment continued to be negatively affected, with only a 45 cent per room reduction (contributing to a 2-percent drop in RevPAR).</p>

<p>The impact of the financial crisis on real RevPARs, however, worsened over time, with November 2008, two months after the fall of Lehman Brothers, being the worst month. In that month, luxury hotels experienced a drop of $12.08 or 13.8 percent. Upscale hotels dropped $5.71 and independent hotels experienced a drop of $2.85. By December 2008, the negative impact diminished for all lodging segments, and one month later no segment continued to be negatively affected by the original financial crisis shock. Interestingly, midscale hotels without food and beverage were more negatively affected by the financial crisis than were midscale hotels with food and beverage, while the opposite impact was found from the terrorist attacks. Overall, higher-end hotels were more susceptible to the negative impact of these two external shocks but also made strong rebounds after four months.</p>

<p>The exhibit shows an immediate and large drop in occupancy rates in NYC after September 11, with the negative impact diminishing in subsequent months, consistent with the results for the rest of the country. It is interesting to note that while the occupancy rates in NYC improved on average by 1.73 percent in January 2002, the hotels in the rest of the United States still experienced a slight drop of about 0.23 percent on average. The immediate impact on ADR was a drop of $35.48 (a 19.5 percent drop in rate) among NYC hotels, which worsened in the last three months of 2001 to a loss of $57.47 (31.6 percent) in rate for December. This drop in rate is substantial compared to a $1.35 (2.5 percent) drop in ADR experienced in September 2001 in other parts of the United States. By January 2002, however, occupancy rates, ADR, and RevPAR all began to improve, and New York made a strong recovery in terms of both real ADR and RevPAR. Overall, the comparison of results for NYC and the rest of the United States show similar dynamics in terms of effects due to the terrorist attack, but with substantially larger magnitudes for NYC. For example, NYC experienced a rise in real ADR of about $19.5 (10.7 percent) on average in January 2002 when compared to year-months without shocks, while the rest of the United States experienced an average improvement of only about $0.29 (0.5 percent).</p>
<p>Turning to the results of the financial crisis of September 2008, the impact on New York hotels’ occupancy was immediate, worsening during October and November and receding somewhat in December and January 2009. However, while the occupancy rates dropped in NYC in January 2009, hotels in other destinations experienced an occupancy rise of about 1.13 percent. The falling occupancy rates in NYC in January 2009 suggest that while the financial crisis created a shock that was less intense than that of the terrorist attacks, the rebound process from the crisis in terms of occupancy may be longer for New York City than the rest of the United States.</p>
<p>ADR and RevPAR drops were immediate outside of NYC, but in general of much smaller magnitude. In the city, ADR dropped 12.36 percent, and RevPAR dropped 23 percent in December compared to an ADR rise of 1.1 percent and a RevPAR drop of 7.4 percent in other parts of the United States. By January 2009, ADR and RevPAR showed significant rises in all parts of the United States, including NYC, but the city again reported a larger magnitude of gain than the rest of the country.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study, based on an extensive sample of more than three million observations of monthly data for 34,695 hotels over ten years (2000-2009), show the negative effects of two external shocks and relatively quick recovery by U.S. hotels. Given the nature of the terrorist attacks, one might anticipate a more intense and immediate negative impact on hotel performance than after the financial crisis of 2008. Indeed that is what occurred. The resulting drops in performance were abrupt but also of relatively short duration, particularly for ADR and RevPAR. These findings suggest that contrary to the opinions of some commentators, the industry was efficient in its efforts to adapt and rebound from these unpredictable and unprecedented events. The pattern in the duration of impact revealed that the worst effects were immediate in the case of a terrorist attack, while the effects due to the financial crisis worsened over time (along with the world’s economy), with the most negative impact coming two months after the fall of Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>The effects of these two events affected hotel performance in distinctly different ways, not surprisingly perhaps given that these two events are fundamentally different occurrences. Consistent with arguments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965512457021">Drakos and Kutan (2003)</xref> the attacks on civilians on September 11, 2001, resulted in a sizable and immediate negative impact on hotel performance. The effects of the economic crisis of September 2008, on the other hand, accrued more gradually. In contrast to the terrorist attacks, the financial crisis was not a one-time discrete event and the triggers of the crisis were complex and multidimensional. A substantial body of literature on the signaling of economic crisis exists to suggest that economic crises could be to some extent anticipated in advance and potentially managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965512457021">Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965512457021">Blundell-Wignall and Atkinson 2009</xref>), although it seems that any warning signs were either not clear or were ignored in 2008. While macroeconomic studies have analyzed common features of different economic crises trying to derive some observable early warnings or signals, terrorism by its nature is hard to associate with any observable signals. Our results showing the much stronger immediate impact of 9/11 on hotel performance are consistent with such an idea.</p>
<p>For both events, however, our analysis showed a relatively quick rebound— within about four months in both cases. Also, though they are different in nature, both shocks in this study appear to have affected occupancy more than pricing. It is true that hotel rates dropped suddenly after 9/11 (as did occupancy), but rates rebounded in four months. In contrast, the financial crisis by itself appears to have had a modest impact on price with a positive and quick rebound.</p>
<p>Examining the outcomes for specific segments, we found that hotels in the more complex luxury segment are the most susceptible to environmental shocks, but that the economy segment is the slowest in recovering from terrorism. We see the economy segment as being more dependent on leisure travelers and tourists who avoided traveling after 9/11, whereas the higher-end segments rely more on business travelers. The economic crisis in contrast did not have the same sustained negative effect on economy hotels, suggesting that individuals may be trading down to lower segments during difficult economic times, giving this segment more opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>Focusing specifically on New York City, the impact on hotel performance was similar when comparing the United States and NYC, but clearly the magnitude of impact was more profound for NYC. Moreover, while real ADR and RevPAR showed increases by January 2009 in all destinations, the occupancy rates in NYC remained negatively affected by the financial crisis even into January 2009.</p>
<p>We believe that our results indicate effective institutional responses or adaptation on the industry’s part, which allowed the industry to stabilize quickly and adapt to the turbulent environment without substantially eroding the pricing of hotel services. We were able to observe the way hotels maintained or restored price integrity in the face of declining demand because of our ability to control for other factors that influence hotel rates and that traditionally contaminate analyses of the price dynamics based on aggregate industry data.</p>
<p>Our efforts to isolate the effect of the two shocks from the impact of other economic and hotel-specific factors make a significant contribution to the literature and to our deeper understanding of the impact of environmental disturbances on firm performance. Although the direct effects of the economic crisis abated, occupancy rates continued to fall and remained low throughout 2009, especially for higher-tier hotels. Since performance worsened for a few months before rebounding after the immediate impact of the financial crisis, one may worry whether economic shocks may continue to have ripple effects that influence industry performance in the future. We cannot answer that question, since this study only examined the impact of the shocks for the four months following the events (although we saw considerable recovery in that time). It is likely that other macro-economic factors controlled for in our study continue to shape hotel performance over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965512457021">Enz, Kosová, and Lomanno (2011)</xref>, for example, note that average occupancy percentages remained low into the early months of 2010, suggesting some possibility of ripple effects from the financial crisis. However, as our detailed study indicates, the magnitude of such impact will likely be modest. Future research on the ripple effect of specific external shocks is needed, especially those attached to economic crises, because of their complex and multidimensional nature. A longer-term study of postenvironmental shocks would be the next logical extension of the work begun in this study.</p>
<p>Clearly, the effects of the two shocks examined in this study comingled with outcomes more suitably attributable to other market factors, including unemployment, inflation, slowing growth in accommodation establishments, or changing consumer preferences over the years. Within the industry, hotel characteristics that affect performance (e.g., age and size) and monthly seasonality may have helped to shape and amplify perceptions of the sustained negative influence of terrorism and the financial crisis on hotel performance. While the terrorist attacks were temporarily destabilizing for New York City and the rest of the United States, the financial crisis may have a more prolonged albeit less dramatic impact on lodging demand. Anecdotal evidence indicating rather modest impact is also found in the lending community. For example, in a recent industry publication it was noted, “In discussions with the senior managers of many of the major lenders here in New York and with others in the capital markets, it is as though 2008 never happened. All of us in senior positions in the capital markets are astonished at the speed at which lending has suddenly roared back” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965512457021">Ross 2011</xref>). Indeed, a recent Ernst and Young survey reporting optimistic assessments of the economy by senior executives of hospitality and real estate companies provides further support for the temporary nature of these shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512457021">Hotel News Now 2011</xref>), consistent with our findings.</p>
<p>A clear lesson from this study is the need to distinguish causal impacts on performance from simple correlations in aggregate data. Contrary to what many observers thought, just because we see a change in performance at the time of an environmental shock, it does not necessarily mean that all such performance change is attributable to the shock. Since there are many factors that can affect hotel performance at the same time as external shocks, it might be that a hotel would be performing well or poorly even without the presence of such shocks. This is why systematic empirical examinations of the type conducted in our study are essential not only for academics but also for industry leaders.</p>
<p>The media’s assertions of extensive ill effects on the travel and tourism industry may have distorted public perception of the intensity and duration of negative effects, and slowed interest in hotel development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512457021">Hausman (2011)</xref> also points out that “One of the pervading problems in hotel industry analysis is how attached people get to certain perceptions.” These exaggerated interpretations of ill effects may become self-fulfilling prophecies if they lead to a misinterpretation of the ongoing effects of the shock in the lending community. Moreover, unfounded interpretations of performance declines not only influence the perceptions of investors but can scare travelers, making it difficult for hotel managers to construct accurate and positive interpretations of travel. Fortunately these negative perceptions appear to have subsided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965512457021">Ross 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, one of the major contributions of our study for the investment community and hotel operators is that we offer a more comprehensive empirical analysis of the impact of terrorism and the financial crisis on average performance and price behavior of individual hotels. Moreover, we provide such analysis for each hotel segment and independent hotels. Our results underscore the importance of controlling for factors that appear to contribute to observed variations in price and performance outcomes. Unlike some studies that presume the industry is susceptible to major disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965512457021">Pforr and Hosie 2007</xref>), our study suggests a significant but modest and rather short-term impact from these external shocks. With such a large sample of hotels and rich variation in data over time and markets, first steps have been made to produce a relevant literature that outlines the linkage between external events and hotel performance at the microeconomic level. Finally, the short duration of impact suggests that hotel operators were able to make internal management choices that limited and contained the negative effects of these shocks on long-term performance. Recent merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity to improve cash flows in the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512457021">Hotel News Now 2011</xref>) is one example of adaptation behavior identified in the resource dependence literature. Decisions about internal resource allocations may have helped the industry to weather the storm and protect its operations from sustained losses. Current M&amp;A behavior supports the contention that firms successfully adapt to external shocks. In spite of considerable media attention devoted to reporting on the negative impact from these external shocks, our results reveal a sophisticated and complex set of factors to consider when commenting on hotel performance and its antecedents. The hotel industry rebounded quickly from these isolated events, even in New York City, and adjusted to new operational realities. The positive outlook for future merger and acquisition activity as documented by numerous announcements in the hospitality press is further evidence of the hotel industry’s adaptability and resilience.</p>

<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965512457021">Kosová, Lafontaine and Perrigot (forthcoming)</xref> discuss, these organizational form dummies might be endogenous; thus, their impact cannot be interpreted as a casual effect in our analysis (so we do not discuss them in the Results section). See also the argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965512457021">Stock (2010)</xref> on conditional mean independence we provide in the next footnote.</p>

<p>Given that we always include the lag of <italic>other</italic> variable (not the lag of the dependent variable in the given equation), such lagged variables empirically represent <italic>predetermined</italic> and thus (at least weakly) exogenous variables in our fixed effects specifications. Moreover, we include such variables only as controls in order to obtain the unbiased estimates of the impact of external shocks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965512457021">Stock (2010)</xref> points out that even if a control variable might be potentially correlated with the error term, under the conditional mean independence property, the coefficient on the variable of interest (in our case—impact of shocks) will be unbiased and consistent and can be interpreted as a causal effect.</p>
