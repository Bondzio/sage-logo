<abstract>
<p>Home care–managed patients face several barriers making access to holiday difficult. During the trimester from June 15 to September 15, 2012, 54 hematological patients were attended by home care service; of these, only 6 (11%) have moved away from home to reach a holiday destination; advanced or terminal disease and high transfusion rate (&gt;3 units/month) seems to negatively affect patients’ access to holiday in our series. Larger studies should be designed to definitely clarify the main barriers to transfer, enabling physicians to plan interventions aimed to bypass these obstacles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each year, many people return home after a period of vacation and recreation, at seaside, mountain, art places, or anything else, having shared with their family or friends the relaxing beauty of new or well-known places. Although there are no data clearly documenting a positive effect of holiday on the individual (with the exception of vacation during employment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312469817">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312469817">2</xref></sup>), it is a widespread experience and feeling that a holiday, however arranged (transfer to holiday destination with or without any break from work), has beneficial effects on both mind and body, as a form of physical and psychological therapy. Home care (HC) has an increasingly expanding role in the global management of patients (pts) affected by hematologic malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312469817">3</xref></sup> HC managed pts face with several barriers (blood transfusion requirement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312469817">4</xref></sup> disability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312469817">5</xref></sup> pain syndromes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312469817">6</xref></sup> infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312469817">7</xref></sup> and bleeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312469817">8</xref></sup>) making access to holiday often difficult and sometimes seemingly impossible. Moreover, advanced age is already associated with a reduced chance of appeal to holidays, given health, economic, and social problems, so that no more than 20% of elderly (&gt;65 years old) usually plan to spend a holiday period away from home (value extrapolated from Italian Institute National did Statistical—ISTAT online database). On the other hand, family members caring for patients are often forced to limit or give up their holiday periods due to assistance needs. Thus, both for patients and caregiver (family member or not), increasing the possibility of moving to a holiday destination could be beneficial.</p>

<sec id="section2-1084822312469817" sec-type="methods">
<title>Aim and method</title>
<p>The aim of the present brief communication is to examine our experience on patients transfer toward holiday destinations, analyzing access to holiday of pts followed in the 2012 summer (June 15-September 15), trying to identify, first, transfer frequency and second, reasons that have made transfer impossible. Lastly, we will quickly suggest solutions to increase accessibility to vacation in this setting, which could be used, in our opinion, in similar health care models, even if not strictly hematological and/or oncological settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822312469817" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>On June 15, 2012, patients assisted at home by our HC service were 53; on September 15, 2012, patients were 47; from June 15 to September 15, admissions were 1 and discharges were 8 (7 deaths and 1 transfer in hospice). In total, therefore, during the trimester from June 15 to September 15, 2012, 54 patients were attended; mean age was 83 (range 50-83), 33 female and 21 males, diagnosis was cancer in 38 (70, 2%), leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplasia, multiple myeloma, myeloprolipherative neoplasm, and solid tumor in 7 (12, 9%), 3 (5, 6%), 16 (29, 5%), 3 (5, 6%), 6 (11, 0%), and 3 (5, 6%) pts, respectively, and other disease 16 (29,8%) pts; for cancer patients only, disease behavior was aggressive or chronic/indolent disease in 12 and 26 pts, respectively, and disease status was complete remission in 3 (5, 6%) or active disease in 35 (64, 8%) pts (advanced/terminal in 11 (20, 4%) pts), respectively. Blood transfusion requirement was absent, 1 to 3 red blood units/month and &gt;3 red blood cells units/month in 33 (61, 1%), 9 (16, 7%) and 12 (22, 2%) pts, respectively. Caring intensity (interval between access) was high (&lt;15 days) and low (≥15 days) in 20 (37%) and 34 (63%) pts, respectively. Of these, only 6 (11%) have moved away from home to reach a holiday destination; data of patients accessing to holiday were similar to those of the whole sample, but remarkable differences (although statistically not significant, due to limited sample size) were (a) absence of advanced or terminal pts and (b) absence of high transfusion rate (&gt;3) pts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822312469817" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the small and unbalanced number of patients who have had access to holidays does not allow to extrapolate statistically significant data, we emphasize, as reliable, that the proportion of HC hematological patients accessing holiday/vacation seems to be lower to that expected in the same age general population; second, only patients with absent or, at least, low chronic transfusion requirements had access to a vacation period. Lastly, possible solutions to overcome blood transfusion requirement barrier should be the following: (a) overtransfusion prior to transfer, (b) temporary support by other center with or without home care assistance; (c) transfusion at the new destination by the “original team” (e.g., health professionals moving and staying, preferentially caring for groups of patients at the same holiday destination) with or without support from external structures (blood transfusion, laboratory, etc.).</p>
<p>Lastly, we hope that larger studies could be designed to definitely clarify the barriers responsible for the inability to transfer, enabling physicians to plan interventions aimed to bypass these obstacles and to fully evaluate the effects of holiday/vacation on both patient and caregiver (assessing clinical and quality of life parameters), thus identifying which patients (and caregivers) could actually benefit from transfer, and which could not.</p>
