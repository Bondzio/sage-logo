<abstract>
<p>The American Civil War was expected to be short and financed through additional borrowing. As Northern military setbacks mounted, it became obvious that the war would be long, bloody, and expensive. Annual federal budgets called for increased taxes to partially finance the rising costs. The Revenue Act of 1862 created innovative new tax sources and increased revenues dramatically. Tax innovations included the first federal income and inheritance taxes, the creation of the Office of Internal Revenue, and the use of adhesive revenue stamps. This article describes the political strategies and financial battles of the Civil War and post-war period, with particular focus on the Office of Internal Revenue and the introduction of new tax sources at the federal level. The major Civil War era innovation was the introduction of the federal income tax, including how to calculate taxable income and how tax collections were operationalized. The political and financial history of the income tax is a major focus of this article.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The American Civil War (1861–65) brought industrial-age fire power to wage war, generating massive costs for “high tech” weapons and military strategy. The federal government (also called the Union) spent over $3 billion, about 65 per cent of 1861 gross domestic product (GDP). The primary revenue source before the war, customs duties, brought in a miniscule $40 million in 1861. Once the fighting started, the Union ran huge budget deficits, initially financed through borrowing. Skeptical banks and bondholders caused continuing budget crises, requiring increased tax rates and new forms of taxes.</p>
<p>The Revenue Act of 1862 established many of these new taxes and created the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Treasury Department (OIR).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1032373211424890">1</xref></sup> The new tax sources provided funding and generated enough confidence in the financial markets to continue lending to fund the war effort through future Treasury loans. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1032373211424890">Brownlee (1996</xref>, p.23):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was the nation’s first modern war in the sense of creating enormous requirements for capital. Union war costs drove up government spending from less than 2 percent of the gross national to an average 15 percent … The capital requirements evoked a program of emergency taxation that was unprecedented in scale and scope.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe how and why the federal government developed a new tax system for America’s first great emergency in the industrial age, including the political and financial strategies used during the Civil War and post-war period. The major focus is on the three phases of financing (from poor funding at the start, to relatively successful revenue collections, finally lowering and eliminating tax sources), with particular attention to the most significant federal legislation passed – the Revenue Act of 1862. Also discussed is the establishment and operations of the OIR, especially the OIR’s tax collection procedures. The analysis includes a review of economic, political, and institutional considerations used to explain the passage and implementation of specific new tax laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1032373211424890">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A series of new taxes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1032373211424890">3</xref></sup> were implemented by Congress, along with printing currency and loans attempting to keep pace with rising spending levels. In the first funding phase, tax rates were set too low and collection rates proved poorer than expected. Second, a period of relative success in generating taxes and other revenues began with federal fiscal year 1864 and peaked in 1866 (the year the federal government ran its first surplus in the decade). Success depended on increasing tax rates and improved collection procedures. As expenditures declined in the post-Civil War period, political decisions focused on lowering or eliminating specific taxes. In terms of federal fiscal history for the next 50 years, these political battles to eliminate the income tax and inheritance tax while maintaining high tariffs proved particularly significant.</p>
<p>Republicans<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1032373211424890">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1032373211424890">5</xref></sup> controlled Congress throughout the Civil War and post-Civil War (also called Reconstruction) periods. The primary revenue sources during the entire period remained tariff and excise duties on commodities and industrial goods, effectively regressive and generally unpopular. The income tax was instituted to raise necessary revenues during the war, but also to placate constituents by demonstrating that the rich paid their fair share.</p>
<p>The Revenue Act of 1862 introduced new federal taxes and the institutional structure of the OIR that came to dominate federal taxation. The income tax was progressive and aimed at the relatively wealthy. The major reasons cited at the time for an income tax were ability to pay and fairness. George Boutwell, the first Commissioner, established the basic revenue collection procedures used by this office. The structure included collection districts paralleling Representative districts, insuring a significant patronage element in district appointments. “Collection success” depended on the institutional structure and OIR procedures.</p>
<p>This article makes a number of contributions, summarizing a multitude of issues from disparate sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1032373211424890">Lamb, 2003</xref>). The broad focus used provides an important historical model for dealing with financial debacles, a recurring global problem including current budget crises in Europe, America, and elsewhere. The analysis of reasons for the specific legislation and framework comes from Civil War era sources, focusing on political, economic and institutional issues. These include political and economic theories of taxation at that time, the Congressional Record, and an analysis of earlier attempts at taxation in the American colonies, United Kingdom, and the post-independence US. Included in this review are reasons why some recommendations were rejected or adopted at a later date.</p>
<p>The three phases of federal financing are explored in detail, as fiscal needs and political reality changed. The workings of the OIR are described – characteristics explored in only a few usually obscure, often specialized sources. The topics covered include administrative and collection history, tax successes and failures, and necessary changes to increase collection effectiveness. Summary fiscal analyses of revenues, expenditures and borrowing are included to put the accomplishments of revenue generation into perspective. The Civil War period tax innovations had a continued impact on fiscal policy well into the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The first section considers various constructs that may be useful to explain motivations for specific financing sources. The second section considers the context of the Civil War and the early funding strategies and legislation, when it became obvious that the war would be long and costly. The third section discusses the taxation alternatives used before the Civil War, while section four discusses the early Civil War period. Section five reviews the process for formulating the Revenue Act of 1862, perhaps the most innovative tax legislation in nineteenth-century America. The sixth section discusses the implementation of tax collections by the OIR. Section seven considers the later war years, when financing procedures were operating reasonably well but expenditures continued expanding. The eighth section reviews the post-war years, when expenditures subsided. The fiscal debate focused on who should benefit from tax relief and how fast to pay down the national debt. The financial conflict remained fairly constant, but relative political power and motivations changed over time. The last section concludes the study.</p>

<title>Political, economic and institutional considerations of tax legislation</title>
<p>Various economic and political perspectives are used to analyze specific fiscal legislation and financial results, based on political party perspectives, regional differences, special interests, available technology, and institutional structures. Two economically-related concepts of the time were “ability to pay” and “fairness”. Ability to pay was a concept formulated by Adam Smith in the <italic>Wealth of Nations</italic>, first published in 1776 and considered the basis of classical economics – revenue contributions based on tax-paying capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1032373211424890">Mehrotra, 2005</xref>). Smith developed maxims of taxation: taxes should be equal or equitable, individuals should pay in proportion to their ability, taxes should be certain and not arbitrary, and they should be convenient and easy to collect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1032373211424890">Groves, 1974</xref>, pp.18–23).</p>
<p>Ability to pay implies vertical equity, suggesting that wealthy people should pay a higher tax rate. In addition to the equity perspective, politicians argued collection rates should be higher, because businesses and wealthy individuals usually kept complete sets of books and generated sufficient cash to pay taxes when due. Congressional hearings on the Revenue Act of 1862 supported ability to pay as a major consideration in new tax provisions, especially the income tax. Members of Congress concentrated much of the ability to pay argument on the expected higher collection rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.250).</p>
<p>The term “fairness” was used at the time to indicate relative justice for specific regions and professions. For example, western farmers subject to higher prices for imported goods because of higher tariff rates, expected the wealthy benefiting from higher tariffs to pay an income tax to compensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.81). Specific groups or economic classes also preferred to shift the tax burden to other, presumably less influential groups (“burden shifting”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1032373211424890">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1032373211424890">7</xref></sup> Groups with political power were more likely to be successful. New York merchants and professionals failed in their opposition to the income tax and New Yorkers paid a large percentage of income taxes over its first decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1032373211424890">8</xref></sup> They ultimately were successful in getting the tax repealed in the early 1870s, while maintaining high customs duties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.293).</p>
<p>Institutional structure determined specific rules, procedures and policy making, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1032373211424890">Steinmo’s (1993)</xref> thesis. Legal and political structure influences the effectiveness of special interest groups, including tax policy and changes in tax policy. A key characteristic of the US structure is fragmented authority – the checks and balances with the separation of legislative, executive and judicial branches and the split of the legislature into two houses that had different characteristics (for example, Senators were appointed by state legislatures for six-year terms until the Seventeenth Amendment, while House members were popularly elected every two years from specific districts).</p>
<p>Enforceability was a concern. Historically, American citizens resented direct taxes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1032373211424890">9</xref></sup>– a major reason for the American Revolution. Those attitudes continued into the post-Colonial era when Alexander Hamilton’s federal excise tax on whiskey in the 1790s led to the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. Consequently, customs duties, which were indirect and widespread, became the largest federal revenue source before the Civil War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2011</xref>, p.36).</p>
<p>Much of the legislative tax-related deliberation during the Civil War focused on enforceability and relative costs. Thus, the income tax had a relatively high exemption (initially the first $600 of income), in part because collection costs would be large relative to potential revenue generated from low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.72). Tax enforcement was difficult throughout the Civil War era and collection costs were high, especially on income, excise and various stamp taxes. The OIR provided relatively low paying, largely patronage jobs over hundreds of districts, leading to problems of mistaken calculations, fraud, and lack of enforcement, especially in rural areas. It is difficult to estimate the amount of uncollected revenue, but it must have been substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1032373211424890">Mahler, 1988</xref>, pp.viii–ix).</p>

<title>Precursors to the Civil War taxes</title>
<p>Prior to the Civil War, American colonies and states experimented with various taxes, including income taxes, as did Great Britain and other countries. A common characteristic was dynamic changes in tax categories and rates. Specific tax sources were often relative failures, usually because they were unenforceable and/or unpopular. Generally, governments modified unsuccessful tax sources or replaced them with others. Failure to do that could lead to catastrophe – the American Revolution could be considered such a failure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1032373211424890">Rabushka (2008)</xref> provided a comprehensive synthesis of earlier scholarship of colonial American taxation from the founding to 1775. Initially, tax privileges and exemptions were given to founding colonies and settlers. As the colonies became prosperous and taxes rose, the citizens developed considerable skills at avoiding and evading both British and local taxes. Duties on tobacco and other commodities exported to Britain were difficult to avoid except by smuggling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373211424890">Kozub (1983)</xref> identified seven revenue sources of Colonial America: quit-rents; poll taxes; property taxes; fees; miscellaneous taxes; lotteries; and duties (p.100). The first tax in colonial America was a poll tax in Virginia in 1619 (payable in tobacco), only a dozen years after the original settlement was founded. Taxes varied considerably by colony and over time. Specific taxes could be unfair or unenforceable and tax laws changed repeatedly. All of the original colonies used some form of poll (or head) tax, land tax or income-related tax. Taxes were often composites of all three and could be hard to correctly classify.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373211424890">Kozub (1983)</xref> considered vertical equity and social classes attempting to shift taxation to others (burden shifting) as important factors related to specific tax structures by colony. Plantation owners usually were the dominant economic and social class in the Southern Colonies. They had the wealth and political power to insist on capitation (head) taxes and indirect taxes such as custom duties, which placed a greater burden on the poorer classes. Much of the effort in the South in the nineteenth century was to tax the incomes of the growing urban middle class, based on taxing incomes and professional fees. Massachusetts and other New England colonies initially taxed produce and professions as early forms of income taxes. New York first relied on excise taxes, customs duties, and, later, a property tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1032373211424890">Kozub, 1983</xref>, p.101).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1032373211424890">Einhorn (2006)</xref> focused on the relationship of tax aversion to slavery in the development of American government. The Southern elites (plantation owners) preferred a weak federal government to prevent interference with slavery. Einhorn’s thesis focused on democracy and liberty producing competent government; therefore, the Southern colonies stressed anti-government rhetoric.</p>
<p>Britain was the first country to use a broad-based income tax, specifically to fund the wars against Napoleon. Almost immediately after declaring war on France in 1793, Parliament imposed additional taxes. These proved inadequate and the price of British bonds plummeted. A near-income-tax was instituted in 1798, with the wealthiest groups having the largest tax assessments, which were based on perceived wealth rather than income. Because actual collections were less than half of expectations, a direct tax on incomes was imposed under the Income Tax Act of 1799 as a war measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1032373211424890">Utz, 2002</xref>). Although disliked by taxpayers, this tax was considered relatively successful. Four different categories of income were taxed, each requiring a separate tax schedule: landed property; funded property and tenant duties; annuities and dividends; and all other income (which included trade, manufacturing and professions). Taxes were raised, changed, and reduced until Napoleon was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815. This first “modern income tax” expired in 1817, but appeared again in 1842 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1032373211424890">Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The American Revolution was, in part, a protest against British taxes. The Boston Tea Party of 1783, a famous tax-related event, protested the duty on tea. During the Revolution, virtually no taxes were raised by the Continental Congress and relatively little by the Colonies. The inability to levy taxes at the federal level was a major reason for the need of a new government under the Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002a</xref>, p.7).</p>
<p>The Constitution gave the federal government power to “collect taxes, duties, imposts and excise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1999</xref>, p.16). Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton set up the initial federal system. The earliest revenue came from the Tariff Act of 1789. Customs duties would be the largest federal revenue source until World War I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1997</xref>). From 1789 to 1791 customs duties of $4.4 million resulted in a federal surplus of $150,000. During the 1790s excise taxes on carriages, liquor, sugar and salt were added (but abolished by President Thomas Jefferson after 1800). The sale of western land also became a revenue source beginning in the 1790s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1032373211424890">Bureau of the Census, 1958</xref>).</p>
<p>The War of 1812 led to substantial federal deficits and internal revenues were increased. These included taxes on real property and slaves (direct taxes as defined at the time) and various excise taxes. Although income and excise taxes were recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury, these were not passed by Congress. After the war, most federal revenue came from customs duties and the sale of western land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.72).</p>
<p>In summary, Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase and the Congress had a limited history of attempts to raise taxes, including income tax. In Congressional debates, the British tax system was referred to fairly often. In a number of respects, the tax system actually passed was similar to the British system. Generally, Congress attempted to avoid the types of taxes in use by the states as a type of “double tax” unfair to taxpayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, pp.248–66).</p>

<sec id="section4-1032373211424890">
<title>The early Civil War period</title>
<p>The primary cause of the Civil War was slavery and Northern attempts to block the expansion of slavery into western territories. The plantation system in the South relied on large-scale agriculture, with cotton being the dominant crop and requiring the massive use of slaves. Other areas of strife included high tariffs on manufactured goods and the concept of state rights. The 1860 Republican platform called for the banning of slavery for new western states as they joined the Union. When Illinois Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected President in November 1860, Southern states seceded, beginning with South Carolina. The new Confederate states formed their own national government with Jefferson Davis as President. Actual fighting began when Southern forces fired on federally-controlled Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor on April 12, 1861 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1032373211424890">Foote, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The first major Union battle loss was Bull Run on 21 July 1861. The loss turned into a route as federal troops fled back to nearby Washington, DC. A Union loss at the Second Battle of Bull Run and withdrawal from the Peninsular Campaign (an attempt to capture Confederate Capital Richmond, Virginia) were major setbacks the next year. Bloody battles at Shiloh and Antietam in 1862 were nominal Union victories, but not decisive – the war would be long and costly. The 1863 Battle at Gettysburg resulted in 60,000 casualties. Only after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered in April 1865 at Appomattox was a Union victory assured. The war resulted in 650,000 deaths and over a million casualties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1032373211424890">Foote, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The first phase of Civil War era financing (1861–63) was a period of inadequate funding and continued problems meeting cash needs. Based on earlier history (e.g. the Whiskey Rebellion) and the presumption of a quick war, Chase initially wanted to avoid new taxes. Protracted war required additional resources and the concomitant revenues. Chase reported to Congress in July 1861 that the government required $320 million, with $80 million needed from taxes and the remainder from loans. A direct property tax of $30 million, claimed Chase, was necessary to ensure the confidence of creditors to lend the additional funds<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1032373211424890">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>, para.20).</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Thaddeus Stevens started the committee work for writing the necessary legislation. A direct real estate tax faced considerable opposition for fairness, constitutional and administrative reasons. Western farmers, for example, faced high taxes on real property, while New England bankers investing in securities did not. According to the Constitution (Article 1, Section 8), direct taxes must be apportioned according to population by state. One proposal called on the states to collect taxes on behalf of the federal government. Stevens agreed and suggested an allotment by state, leaving it up to the states to collect the tax any way they wished. Other members considered an income tax as an alternative to direct property taxes. A compromise was reached, calling for a direct property tax plus an additional 3 per cent tax on incomes above $600 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>, para.21). The 1861 Revenue Act was passed 5 August 1861; however, no mechanism was established to collect these taxes and the revenues were never collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>, para.44). The law was soon recognized as inadequate and much of it repealed by the 1862 Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, pp.236–8).</p>
<p>Chase borrowed $150 million from a consortium of New York banks late in 1861, paid in gold. Largely because of the drain on their reserves, New York banks went off the gold standard in December 1861, followed shortly by the federal government. The fiscal discipline imposed by a gold standard was gone, due mainly to the perilous financial circumstances of the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1999</xref>, p.92).</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the federal government began issuing its first paper currency. Prior to the Internal Revenue Bill of 1862, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act in February 1862 which authorized some $150 million in Treasury Notes (greenbacks), eventually increased to $450 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.613). The same act also authorized another half billion dollars in bonds. Investors were allowed to buy federal bonds with greenbacks (which depreciated relative to gold), but the bonds were redeemable in gold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1999</xref>, pp.92–4).</p>
<p>The desperate financial situation was apparent by the beginning of 1862. In that fiscal year (1 July 1861–30 June 1862), revenues were only $52 million, while expenditures were almost half a billion dollars. Congressional investigations uncovered military contracts without bids, spending without authorization, and outright fraud. As stated by robber baron Jim Fisk: “You can sell anything to the government at almost any price you’ve got the guts to ask” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1032373211424890">McCullough, 1981</xref>, p.60). Chase had substantially underestimated the cost of the war and the need for additional revenues. Unknown to Chase at the time, expenditures would rise to well over $1 billion for the fiscal year 1865 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1997</xref>, p.94).</p>

<sec id="section5-1032373211424890">
<title>The Revenue Act of 1862</title>
<p>In his message to Congress on 9 December 1861, Secretary Chase estimated expenditures of $475 million for fiscal year ended June 1863. He forecast revenue of $96 million, including $46 million from customs and $50 million from internal duties and direct taxes (poll and property taxes). The remaining $380 million would be borrowed (<italic>Congressional Globe</italic>, 37th Congress, 2nd Session, Appendix, p.23).</p>
<p>Due in part to battle reverses during 1861,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1032373211424890">11</xref></sup> the fiscal problems of the New York banks and the ending of the gold standard, Congress resolved to raise $150 million in revenues, some $54 million or 56 per cent more than proposed by Chase. The rationale was to raise enough revenue to pay ordinary (non-military) expenses, interest on the rising federal debt, and to establish a sinking fund for the later repayment of the war debt. The House Ways and Means Committee (where all tax measures originate) was instructed to provide the legislation and specific revenue sources to provide the $150 million (<italic>Congressional Globe</italic>, 37th Congress, 2nd Session, p.376).</p>
<p>Chairman Stevens introduced the revenue bill in March 1862. As stated by Stevens: “the capitalists must be assured that we have laid taxes which we can enforce, and which we must pledge to them in payment of the interest on their loans, or we shall get no money” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley, 1993</xref>, pp.27–8). At this point, virtually any revenue source was open for discussion, including rates and exemptions.</p>
<p>Many perceived an income tax the fairest source, because of complaints the rich were exempt from sacrifice, including the ability of rich draftees to buy a replacement for $300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373211424890">Banks et al., 2008</xref>). Western and border states viewed earlier systems as unfair (especially tariffs that protected the northeast manufacturers and merchants).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1032373211424890">12</xref></sup> With an income tax, much of the burden would fall on the wealthy in the industrial northeast. As stated by the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> at this time: “The rich should be taxed more than the poor” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, p.39). Politicians from the northeast, on the other hand, generally opposed income taxes. The end result was compromise. As stated by Representative Justin Morrill of Vermont (member and later chairman of the Ways and Means Committee): “The weight must be distributed equally … a tax proportional to his ability to pay … in a just proportion to the means and facility to pay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1032373211424890"><italic>Congressional Globe</italic>, 1862</xref>, p.1194).</p>
<p>Politicians viewed fairness from different perspectives. The result was the use of multiple tax sources, each providing limited revenues but with the intent that taxpayers from each region would consider the final revenue package equitable. The primary rationale at the time was political – to defend the interests of specific constituents and insure that the voters as a whole were tolerant of the new tax program. Apparently, the populace was willing to pay the increased taxes as long as they were considered reasonable to the various regions and groups. The difficulty of predicting collections and the degree of resistance by taxpayers were additional considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.267).</p>
<p>The most significant debate concerned the income tax. Chairman Stevens came from a wealthy family with a fortune from iron works. Despite this background, he favored an income tax based on “ability to pay”. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley (1993</xref>, p.29): “Income taxation itself faced no opposition” in the House. However, specific rates and other provisions were debated. The House version of the 1862 Act exempted the first $600 of income from tax for two reasons. First, without the exemption, it was considered inequitable to tax poor people. Second, it was unlikely that a significant amount of tax net of administrative costs would be collected. This exemption would remain in the final bill. The House version called for a 3 per cent tax on incomes over the $600 exemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.267).</p>
<p>Newspapers at the time were partisan. The <italic>New York Tribune</italic> opposed the tax: “The income tax is the most odious, vexatious, inquisitional, and unequal of all our taxes” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.122). The <italic>New York Times</italic> favored the tax: “In our opinion a tax on incomes more nearly approximates to a just tax than any other yet devised” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.122).</p>
<p>House Ways and Means member Justin Morrill estimated revenues for fiscal year 1863 by source as follows:</p>

<p>This list suggests the diversity of tax sources and emphasizes the importance of excise taxes on manufacturers, spirits, tobacco, and transportation. According to this estimate, the House bill exceeded the $150 million resolution. Only a small amount was budgeted for income tax, $6.2 million or 4 per cent of the total, including the $1.2 million in withholding from salaries of government workers. Despite the complexity, the bill (HR312) passed 125 to 14 in the House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.267).</p>
<p>The Senate received the tax bill from the House in April 1862 and referred it to the Senate Finance Committee. James McDougall (Democrat from California) objected to the House bill, primarily for its complexity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It has a different law for every subject of taxation … I object to the tax on manufacturers … I object to the tax on advertisements … All license systems are more or less unjust … I object to this universal system of stamps. (<italic>Congressional Globe</italic>, 37th Congress, 2nd Session, Appendix, pp.229–31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In its place McDougall proposed higher rates on fewer items, but his amendment was voted down. Other complaints also were defeated.</p>
<p>The revenue expected from income tax was considered inadequate by the Senate, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Fessenden (Maine Republican) proposed a progressive rate system. Under his amendment incomes from $10,000 to $50,000 would be taxed at 5 per cent and incomes over $50,000 would be taxed at 7½ per cent. Fessenden’s amendment was agreed to and incorporated in the final Senate bill, which passed on 6 June by a vote of 37 to 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.289).</p>
<p>The Conference Committee (an <italic>ad hoc</italic> committee of both houses to resolve differences in the bill) made minor changes to the Senate version. The most significant change was reducing the progressive income tax into a 2-rate system: 3 per cent on incomes from $600 to $10,000 and 5 per cent on income above $10,000. The new law created the OIR to administer the new tax programs. Most new taxes began 1 October 1862 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>). Both Houses passed this final version with large majorities and President Lincoln signed the bill on 1 July 1862 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.76). In addition to equity, the rationale for a progressive rate was the expected increase in the total amount of income tax collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.290). The most important aspects of the 1862 Act were: (1) the first adoption of a federal income tax; (2) the creation of the OIR (now Internal Revenue Service);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1032373211424890">13</xref></sup> (3) the first federal inheritance tax based on wealth, called a “legacy tax” at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1032373211424890">West, 1908</xref>, p.89); and (4) the use of adhesive tax stamps and various excise taxes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1032373211424890">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.612).</p>
<p>Shortly after the passage of the Revenue Act of 1862, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1862. This Act increased customs duties to an average 37 per cent. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner (1942</xref>, p.78):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If the Internal Revenue Act had not been passed a few days before, giving a good excuse for some increase of duties … it would have been very difficult to carry through Congress a measure like the tariff of 1862. But under the circumstances … a decided increase of protection was easily carried.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The provisions of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1032373211424890">1862</xref> Revenue Act and subsequent amendments are summarized in Appendices 1 and 2. (The Act is available at the Library of Congress website under <italic>Statutes at Large, 1789–1875</italic>.) The 1862 Revenue Act included three schedules. Schedule A described the income tax and other taxes payable directly to the Office of Internal Revenue. These included inheritance taxes; duties on high-value goods such as yachts, carriages, and plates of gold and silver; a 3 per cent duty on gross receipts of transportation companies; plus excise taxes on liquor, tobacco and related products.</p>
<p>An inheritance tax was levied on estates valued over $1000 at a rate of 0.75 per cent for lineal relatives and scaled up to 5 per cent for others. Personal property taxes were levied on specific items associated with the wealthy, including carriages, yachts, billiard tables, and plates of gold and silver. Business taxes were levied on the gross receipts of railroads, steamboats and ferryboats, as well as advertising receipts. Another duty was placed on railroad bonds and dividends of financial institutions. Additional taxes were levied on public utilities, distilled spirits, and tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1032373211424890">Blakey &amp; Blakey, 1940</xref>, p.3).</p>
<p>Schedule B described the taxes on documents, requiring the use of adhesive stamps directly on the documents. There were 25 major categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, pp.618–20). Schedule C explained retail (proprietary) articles subject to tax, the three categories being: (1) medicines; (2) perfumery and cosmetics; and (3) playing cards. “Each box, bottle, or pack required a proprietary stamp, with the stamp amount based on retail price” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.613).</p>
<p>Income subject to tax included wages and salaries, interest and dividends, but no exemptions were provided for children. Taxes were withheld on salaries of government employees above $600 and dividends paid by corporations – America’s first withholding system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1032373211424890">Witte (1985</xref>, p.68) noted the first tax “loophole”, a 1.5 per cent tax rate on federal government bond interest to encourage the purchase of bonds. This was a compromise between those who wanted no tax on Treasury securities to facilitate raising more funds from bonds, versus those that expected wealthy bondholders to pay their full share of taxes.</p>
<p>As with other taxes and various political issues, the income tax was a regional issue. New Yorkers paid about one-third of total income taxes. For the fiscal year 1863, 79 New Yorkers reported income in excess of $100,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, pp.728–40). At the higher tax rates at the end of the Civil War era, W.B. Astor had the distinction of reporting annual income over $1 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, p.100).</p>
<p>Revenues collected for the 1862–63 fiscal year proved disappointing. Budgeted revenue was $167 million, including $68 million in customs duties and $85 million in domestic revenues. Actual revenues were only $101 million, a shortfall of $66 million or 40 per cent. Customs duties at $69 million were as projected, but internal revenues were only $38 million, less than half of the expected amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.338). Only $2.7 million came from income tax for the 1863 fiscal year, less than 3 per cent of total federal revenues (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1032373211424890">Appendix 3</xref>).</p>

<p>George Boutwell (1818–1905), former Massachusetts governor and a founder of the Republican Party, was asked by Chase to head the OIR as Commissioner in mid-1862. With an office in the Treasury Building and three clerks, Boutwell developed the tax forms needed to collect taxes and the account books for local offices and Washington headquarters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.614). Unlike the 1861 Act, the administration was in place to implement tax collection policies – with tax collections beginning on 1 October 1862.</p>
<p>In his report to Congress on 4 December 1862, Secretary Chase stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue has been organized under the act of last session, and is now actually organized in the labors assigned to it. Collectors and assessors have been appointed in all the districts of the loyal States, and the revenue from the duties imposed by the law is steadily and rapidly increasing. (<italic>Congressional Globe</italic>, 37th Congress, 3rd Session, Appendix, p.28)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By January 1863 the OIR had nearly 4000 employees and was described as the largest government department ever organized up to that time. This number included 60 administrators in Washington and 3822 in the field offices – 366 collectors and assessors, 898 deputy collectors, and 2558 assistant assessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1032373211424890"><italic>IRS Historical Factbook</italic>, 1993</xref>). These were patronage jobs, based in part on political payoffs. Party leaders would hand out jobs from their own states; thus, Chase approved jobs in Ohio, Lincoln in Illinois, and political boss Thurlow Weed in New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, p.43).</p>
<p>The OIR Washington administrators received inquiries from field employees and taxpayers. The Revenue Act, as passed, had many ambiguities, but gave the Commissioner considerable authority to solve these issues. Boutwell reviewed the letters at evening sessions with the division heads. The letters were read and conclusions reached. Boutwell would dictate the answers the next day, which would be issued as rulings or decisions and numbered consecutively. Some were short: “The certificate of the qualification of a school-teacher requires a five-cent stamp” (Ruling No. 213); others considerably longer. Issues related to specific taxpayer matters were usually handled by correspondence (also numbered chronologically). Boutwell issued over 300 rulings and decisions in the first five months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.614). This was the beginning of the ruling process still in use by the IRS.</p>
<p>Boutwell was elected to Congress in November 1862 and resigned as Commissioner on 3 March 1863, having served as Commissioner for less than a year.</p>
<p>Chase would have allowed him to serve both in Congress and as Commissioner; however, posting a performance bond<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1032373211424890">16</xref></sup> was a new requirement, which Boutwell refused to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.614). Joseph Lewis (Republican from Pennsylvania and Lincoln’s first choice) succeeded him as Commissioner. Boutwell served in Congress from 1863 to 1869 as a Radical Republican. He was U.S. Grant’s Treasury Secretary from 1869 to 1873 and Massachusetts Senator from 1873 to 1879 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.614). He served on the Senate Finance Committee in 1876–77.</p>
<p>The OIR divided the North into 185 collection districts, based on Congressional districts. The Commissioner appointed an assessor and a collector for each district. The assessor determined the amount of taxes to be collected, filled out the tax forms, and was responsible for enforcing OIR regulations. OIR operations were decentralized and each assessor had substantial latitude in calculating taxes and deciding who should pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002a</xref>, p.615). For example, Commissioner Ruling No. 10 stated: “In cases where assessors have good reason to believe that persons have not an income of $600, no return need be required” (reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.313).</p>
<p>Annual returns were submitted to local assessors by the first Monday in May. Assessors and assistant assessors were responsible for valuing property and determining annual income and taxes due. If residents did not file a tax return and the assessors determined their income to be above $600, assessors could estimate the tax and add a 50 per cent penalty. The taxpayers could appeal these calculations, but the assessors had the final determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373211424890">Boutwell, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>). Assessors initially received only $3 per day in pay, but this was raised to $4 in 1864. After the income tax was repealed and many other taxes eliminated or reduced in 1873, the position of assessor was abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, pp.614–15).</p>
<p>The collector was responsible for collecting the taxes based on the assessor’s documentation. Newspaper advertising and posting notices that taxes were due and payable were the responsibility of the collector. The collector could serve notice on delinquent taxpayers either by mail or in person (adding a travel fee to the tax bill). Assistant collectors received the taxpayers’ cash and issued receipts. Collectors were initially paid only a commission on cash collected (4% on collections up to $100,000; 2% above that), which changed to a salary plus commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.615).</p>
<p>Inspectors enforced revenue collections on distilleries and tobacco producers, but were not involved with income taxes. The number of inspectors increased to over 1000 as excise taxes were raised and tax laws became more complex. Fees on manufacturers were used to pay inspectors; however, this process proved problematic when excess “fees” were paid for favorable inspections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1032373211424890">Schmeckebier &amp; Eble, 1923</xref>).</p>
<p>Early internal revenue collections were disappointing. In the first 10 months, estimated revenue was $85 million, while actual collections totaled less than $38 million. Collections rose annually, but remained below forecast (e.g. $209 million collected versus $500 million forecast in 1865). Several reasons were suggested, starting with bureaucratic incompetence and dishonesty. The patronage system was inefficient and employee turnover in the Bureau averaged 33 per cent annually, with low pay a primary cause. Errors were rampant: 365 errors over the previous four months were identified in an 1865 Treasury Circular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2011</xref>, p.120).</p>
<p>A major issue was the definition of “income” subject to tax. Congressional debates were often unclear whether the measure of “gross income” or “net income” should be appropriate, particularly important for farmers and various business owners. The final language in the 1862 Revenue Act was ambiguous about this and it was left up to the Commissioner to determine how taxable incomes were calculated. Boutwell and his successors consistently used some definition of revenue less costs of production, roughly net income. Many Commissioner Rulings and Decisions were issued to define specifically what expenses were deemed tax deductible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1032373211424890">Boutwell, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>).</p>
<p>About 10 per cent of Northern households paid income tax, based on a four-page tax form – Form 24, “Detailed Statement of Income, Gains, and Profits”. (A copy of this form can be found at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1032373211424890">Tax Analyst, 2004</xref>.) Allowable deductions included rent, insurance, freight, and employee wages. The annual tax forms were required by the first Monday in May following the taxable (calendar) year. In 1866 over 450,000 income tax returns were filed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, p.102). Corporations were not subject to income tax, although corporations in various industries paid a number of excise taxes as well as taxes on interest and dividend payments.</p>
<p>The administrative costs of the Bureau were about six per cent of collections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1032373211424890">17</xref></sup> According to Commissioner Lewis, this was below the costs of other countries. The same kind of taxes in England cost 11 per cent of collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373211424890">Lewis, 1864</xref>, pp.15–16). After the first year of operations, Commissioner Lewis wrote in his annual report:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he needs of the government have so suddenly increased beyond all proportion to those of its early history, that it has become necessary to create and organize, with unprecedented rapidity, a new system of revenue … Many of the particular provisions of the laws must, for the present, be regarded as experiments, and their administration may be expected to point the way to gradual improvement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373211424890">Lewis, 1864</xref>, p.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lewis recommended substantial increases in income tax rates and excise taxes. He suggested various changes in procedures, especially to make collection and delinquency procedures consistent across the various tax categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1032373211424890">Lewis, 1864</xref>, p.11).</p>
<p>A major difficulty was revenue planning. The fiscal year ended on 30 June. The tax legislation had to pass both houses, signed by the president, and then be implemented by Treasury. However, information on actual collections lagged. The date of Lewis’ Report for the year ended 30 June 1863 was 30 November 1863 and it was published in 1864. Thus, by the time complete information was available for fiscal year 1863, Congress was at work on the fiscal year 1865 budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>, p.619).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1032373211424890">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Revenues in the later war years</title>
<p>The second phase of federal funding was the relatively successful collection of internal revenues from fiscal years 1864 through 1866, although expenditures rose faster than expected. Tax collections increased as the bureaucracy gained experience, but remained below expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, pp.100–5). Customs duties declined as the Confederate navy became more adept at disrupting Northern commerce. With declining customs revenue, Congress increased tariff rates to an average 47 per cent in 1864, the highest rates up to that time. Tariffs at roughly this level continued for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee took up the tax debate in April 1864. Virtually all rates were raised, but the primary debate centered on the income tax.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1032373211424890">19</xref></sup> Progressive rates up to 10 per cent were proposed by Representative J.B. Grinnel (Iowa Republican), again stressing ability to pay. The Senate Finance Committee decreased the top rate in their bill. Senate Finance Chairman Fessenden objected to the higher rates: “No discrimination should be permitted against the wealthy minority simply because it is convenient to lay your hands upon them, so while a graduated rate was proper, it should also be strictly limited” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley, 1993</xref>, p.34).</p>
<p>With the passage of the highest tariffs in history, the Conference Committee compromised on income tax rates. The rates for the Revenue Act of 1864 were 5 per cent on income of $600–$5000, 7.5 per cent on incomes of $5000–$10,000, and 10 per cent on higher incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.72). Interestingly, much of the media reaction was negative, citing the need for even more revenue. The <italic>New York Times</italic> denounced the unwillingness of Congress to impose higher tax rates: “The reluctance to tax heavily which Congress has displayed ever since the war began, and, we regret to say, is still displaying, is very remarkable, and is fast becoming incomprehensible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1032373211424890">Langenderfer, 1954</xref>, p.444).</p>
<p>Bond investor confidence required massive tax revenues. For the 1862–65 period, federal revenues at $763 million were 23 per cent of expenditures ($3.35 billion). Almost $4 billion was borrowed from 1862 to 1865, about half long-term debt (over five years) and half short-term. These included individual bonds (e.g. 6% 20-year bonds in 1864), serial bonds (5–20 year bonds, with varying interest rates), Treasury notes (2-year 5% notes in 1864), and certificates of indebtedness. Each year saw an increase in borrowing and a general shift from short-term to long-term bonds. Treasury bonds were generally sold by competitive bidding. Underwriting syndicates would buy these at a discount and resell them to domestic and foreign bankers, usually at a substantial profit. “Retail” investors were usually financial institutions and wealthy individuals, both domestic and foreign. Large amounts of bonds were purchased by national banks, because they were required to hold federal bonds equal to one third of their capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1032373211424890">Gordon, 1997</xref>, p.94).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1032373211424890">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chase used Philadelphia banker Jay Cooke to sell several bond issues. Uniquely for the time period, Cooke paid roughly par for the securities and received a modest commission of 0.5 per cent. Cooke used advertising and 2500 agents to sell bonds to individuals throughout the North. Patriotism was a key sales pitch. He coordinated sales from a Washington office, relying on the telegraph to confirm purchases and sales, selling over $1 billion in Treasury bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1032373211424890">Brands, 2010</xref>, p.80).</p>

<p>Internal Revenue collections peaked in 1866 at $309 million. According to the Bureau of the Census, income tax collections were more than $347 million for the 1863–73 period (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1032373211424890">Appendix 3</xref>). As taxes increased, so did tax evasion, aided by OIR employees. An 1868 <italic>New York Times</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>, para.95) stated that the OIR had “almost become the synonym of corruption”. Corrupt whiskey rings proved a major scandal, with inspectors and collectors part of the rings. In 1868 the OIR was given authority to hire detectives to find tax fraud. These detectives were the predecessors of IRS Special Agents. Although tax rates dropped in the 1870s, fraud continued. The OIR seized 24 distilleries and 37 other businesses in 1875; over 50 federal officials were prosecuted and over 100 people convicted. Lost federal revenues were estimated at $1.65 million over 10 months<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1032373211424890">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2011</xref>, p.120).</p>
<p>Beginning in 1866, the federal government ran surpluses for almost 30 years. Internal revenues exceeded tariffs by 1864 ($3.15 per capita vs. $2.93 for tariffs) and were almost double tariff revenues by 1866 ($8.46 per capita vs. $4.90 for tariffs). The national debt, which rose to $2.8 billion in 1866, gradually fell below one billion dollars by 1892.</p>
<p>The period after the Civil War, the Reconstruction era, included the military occupation of the South. Southern politicians, mainly Democrats, fought against reconstruction, which stressed liberty for freed slaves. Congressional Republicans refused to seat several Southern Democrats in Congress until Reconstruction ended in 1877. The Republicans remained in firm control of Congress and pushed their own agenda. However, within this group there were major disputes, including on revenue issues. Expenditures declined sharply after the war, although the huge national debt remained. The strategy was to reduce tax rates. The major question was which taxes to cut. New York and other northeastern politicians favored the reduction and quick elimination of income and inheritance taxes, while western politicians favored the reduction of customs duties. Ohio Senator John Sherman, Chair of the Senate Finance Committee (1865 and 1867–77), and other centrist Republicans, favored a permanent income tax at relatively low rates, while maintaining high tariffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, pp.90–5). Some northeastern politicians supporting manufacturers wanted a continuing protective tariff and were willing to pay a relatively small income tax, essentially as compensation to farmers and other interest groups harmed by the protective tariffs.</p>
<p>The 1866 Revenue Act incorporated reductions in the income tax. Republicans won a major victory in the 1866 elections with large majorities in both houses. Their constituents included the major corporations, railroads and banking interests. The focus was on maintaining high tariffs, with no incentive for retaining the income tax. Politicians began claiming major deficiencies with the income tax system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, pp.94–5). Ohio Representative (and future president) James Garfield: “attacked bitterly the progressive income tax as unethical, unsocial, and unconstitutional because it discriminated between rich and poor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.115).</p>
<p>With the Republicans in power, there was little chance that tariff rates would be lowered substantially. The key question was how fast the income and inheritance taxes would be reduced and then eliminated. In 1867 the income tax was reduced to 5 per cent on incomes over $1000. As Democrats regained power in the West and South, they promoted income taxes and lower tariffs. However, Republicans maintained a majority in Congress. As a minority party, the Democrats made no progress on their agenda. Despite opposition from farmers and consumers, the protective tariff remained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1032373211424890">Thorndike, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The inheritance tax was repealed in 1870 and the income tax reduced to a rate of 2.5 per cent on income over $2000. At that rate, Senator John Scott (Pennsylvania Republican) called for its elimination, since the revenue collected hardly justified the expenditures to collect the tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1032373211424890">Ratner, 1942</xref>, p.130).</p>
<p>In the election year of 1872, tariff rates were reduced about 10 per cent to combat the growing tariff reform movement that combined the interests of farmers, merchants and importers. Because budget surpluses in 1870–72 were large, the revenue debate centered on eliminating the income tax. Senator Sherman tried to maintain the income tax, pointing out: “that the lapsing of the income tax would leave a system of national taxes which rested the whole burden of taxation on consumption without one cent of tax on property or income, and which was, therefore, intrinsically unjust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1032373211424890">Sherman, 1879</xref>, p.336). Representative Charles O’Neill (Pennsylvania Republican) retorted: “the tax was inquisitorial, since it required taxpayers to declare details of their personal finance. Further, the tax would encourage perjury” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley, 1993</xref>, p.47). Republican Representative Roscoe Conkling of New York: “complained that it was unfair for New York, with one-eleventh of the nation’s population to pay one-third of the income tax” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley, 1993</xref>, p.47). The income tax was eliminated in 1872, as were most documentary stamp taxes, while other taxes were substantially reduced.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The complex tax structure of the Civil War was a necessary component for financing the federal war effort and paying down the accumulated debt when peace returned. Congressional debate on tax laws was influenced by pragmatic and political considerations, based on regional differences and the impact of specific taxes on particular special interests. The result was a multitude of different taxes at relatively low rates (plus high tariffs), with tax rates increasing throughout the war period.</p>
<p>The institutional framework of the federal government and political considerations dominated the legislative process. Income taxes were imposed in 1862 because of the desperate need for revenue – fairness and ability to pay were the overriding philosophical and political reasons used to justify their passage. Tax rates rose to generate enough revenue to provide confidence for bond investors to continue to fund the large federal deficits. After the Civil War, rising surpluses led to political demands for lower revenues. Since Republicans dominated, the income tax was lowered and eventually eliminated, while high tariffs remained, ignoring both the ability to pay and the fairness arguments.</p>
<p>The OIR (now IRS) became a permanent federal agency. In addition to the first federal income tax, the federal government imposed inheritance taxes, excise taxes and adhesive revenue stamps. A substantial sum of revenues was raised from income tax (over $347 million, 1863–73) and stamp taxes (over $200 million, 1863–83). A complex tax administration was established quickly, with thousands of employees. Withholding was adopted for taxes on federal salaries and dividend income, deductions were developed, as were various tax credits and exemptions. This was also the origin of issuing interpretative rulings and the use of special agents to investigate tax evasion. Although non-compliance and fraud were major problems, these taxes proved relatively successful, with total collections of over half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>In a time of financial desperation, the federal government turned to new sources to increase revenue, changing rates and various rules to increase revenue during the war years and increase collection efficiency. Over the next 60 years, the federal government experimented with similar tax policies. Inheritance taxes and stamp taxes were used during both the Spanish-American War and World War I. An income tax was attempted in 1894, but declared unconstitutional. The 16th Amendment introduced what became a permanent income tax in 1913, and the major federal revenue source from World War I. Tax collection procedures until World War II were similar to those used during the Civil War.</p>
<p>In summary, taxes used during the Civil War were reasonably successful in collecting necessary funds. Both legislative and administrative implementation procedures used then were repeated in future federal fiscal policy. As a fiscal experiment, certain taxes and administrative procedures worked, while others did not. The income tax was a slow starter as a revenue source, partly because of low rates and partly because of inefficient and corrupt administration. The tax proved a more lucrative source as rates increased and administrative procedures improved. Fiscal “experiments” continue to the present day, based in part on the results of this first fiscal crisis.</p>

<title>Revenue Act amendments</title>
<p>The Revenue Act was changed by new Congressional acts periodically.</p>
<p>During the remainder of 1862, 33 trades or professions were required to have a federal license. An excise tax on alcohol was imposed. On 25 December taxpayers were no longer required to match stamps category, only the correct monetary value. All official documents of the US government were exempted from the stamp tax.</p>
<list id="list1-1032373211424890" list-type="simple">

Many taxes were simplified; e.g. 50¢ for each $500 or fraction on conveyance. Tax rescinded on telegraph dispatches and lottery tickets. New proprietary taxes on matches, photographs, and taxes on playing cards increased. Inheritance taxes (now called succession tax) rose from 1% for lineal relatives to 6% for distant relatives and others.</p>
<p>1867 – Taxes begin to be reduced or eliminated (e.g. the tax on photographs is eliminated). Income taxes were reduced to 5% on incomes over $1000.</p>
<p>1870 – Income tax rates were lowered to 2.5% on incomes over $2000 to apply to years 1870 and 1871, and “no longer”. The legacy and succession (inheritance) taxes were repealed.</p>
<p>1872 – The income tax and all stamp taxes under Schedule B (documentaries) were eliminated (beginning 1 October 1872) except on bank checks.</p>
<p>1883 – Internal revenue stamp taxes repealed.</p></list-item>

<p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue was established for the first time in 1792 (and disbanded in 1802). The Bureau was re-established in 1813 (and lasted about five years) when taxes were created to finance the War of 1812. The Office of the Commissioner of Revenue was established in 1861. The fourth attempt, creating the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (often called the Bureau of Internal Revenue), was permanent.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1032373211424890">Seligman (1921)</xref> was a prominent economist and proponent of progressive income taxes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He based his analysis both on ability to pay and the benefits doctrine. According to Seligman, ability to pay represented each citizen’s contribution to the common welfare based on taxpaying capacity. Under the benefits doctrine taxes were justified as the price paid for services provided by government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1032373211424890">Mehrotra, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1032373211424890">Stanley (1993</xref>) had a particularly interesting perspective, focusing on the agenda of the Radical Republicans, relative to other political groups. The Republicans generally supported the establishment of the income tax and other internal revenues, but they successfully eliminated the income tax while maintaining high tariff levels after the Civil War when budget surpluses developed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1032373211424890">King et al. (2006)</xref> compared the income tax innovations of the Civil War with the current US income tax system. Innovations still in use include the income tax withholding, deductions, penalties and tax credits systems, as well as an administrative framework to collect the tax.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the political rationales used by the administration and Congressional leaders to justify laws and actions taken, based on Congressional records, memoirs, and other written sources. The political factors in both passing tax legislation and implementation in the new OIR are analyzed.

<p>Domestic taxes (including excise, income, and property taxes) are collected at the “individual level,” requiring substantial administrative bodies to enforce them. Import duties are the major external taxes, collected at the point of import and then passed on to consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1032373211424890">Weisman, 2002</xref>, p.25).</p>

<p>The Republican Party started in 1854 as disparate political groups formed to oppose the Democratic Party, partly in opposition to the expansion of slavery in the west. When the Democrats nominated two candidates for president in 1860 (essentially, one representing Northern interests, Stephen Douglas, and one Southern, John Breckinridge), Republican Abraham Lincoln won the election with only 40 per cent of the vote. Lincoln and many other Republicans favoring business interests and a strong federal government, were considered moderate Republicans. Those favoring the abolition of slavery were called Radical Republicans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1032373211424890">Myers, n.d.</xref>). There were additional regional issues, with westerners favoring farmers and border-state Republicans remaining nominally pro-slavery.</p>

<p>Radical Republicans favored immediate emancipation of the slaves, and, after victory, a harsh Reconstruction involving military government in the South. A major focus was protecting the political and economic rights of former slaves. Thaddeus Stevens, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during most of the Civil War period, was a leader of the Radical Republicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1032373211424890">Brands, 2010</xref>, pp.47–8).</p>

<p>Economists developed concepts for the complexity of taxes. The first involves the regulators’ decisions to “fool the public” by using many tax sources. Fiscal illusion is the perception of the taxpayer that tax rates are much lower than they actually are, since taxes are spread out over multiple sources including many indirect taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1032373211424890">Wagner, 1976</xref>). This makes it difficult for the individual taxpayer to see through the complexity of taxes. The other rationale for tax complexity is the “portfolio effect” of tax diversity (also called revenue breadth). By relying on many distinct tax sources, total tax collections should be higher. The cost of tax complexity is the additional burden on both the taxpayers and administrations to determine the taxes owed and actual collection costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1032373211424890">Pechman, 1971</xref>).</p>

<p>One economic construct not in evidence at the time was income redistribution, a form of social engineering to limit income disparity between the rich and poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1032373211424890">Groves, 1974</xref>). Although progressive rates were introduced during the Civil War to increase revenues, the focus was ability to pay. The rise in power of the Progressive movement, related to labor and rural interests, the Democratic Party and others, would increase the demand for progressive income taxes as a method of income redistribution later in the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1032373211424890">Brands, 2010</xref>, p.484). Economics began to focus on progressive income taxes late in the nineteenth century, with economist E.R.A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1032373211424890">Seligman (1921)</xref> a major proponent.</p>

<p>The Constitution limits the ability of the federal government to use direct taxes. At the time, direct taxes included head taxes (poll or capitation tax) and property taxes. However, an income tax was not considered a direct tax. Court cases challenging the constitutionality of the Civil War income tax as a direct tax were settled in favor of the government (e.g. <italic>Springer</italic> v. <italic>United States</italic> was settled unanimously by the Supreme Court in 1881).</p>

<p>Tariffs had a dual effect. Customs duties were the largest revenue source at the federal level. Imports were more expensive, since the customs duties would be added to the price of goods. However, they protected domestic manufacturers, who could raise their prices to the level of the imported goods. Thus, tariff duties caused higher prices. With a gold standard in place, inflation was unexpected. Consequently, the usual result was wages held down and the impact of higher prices on manufactured goods felt primarily by the lower classes.</p>

<p>Taxes placed on documents using embossed stamps (similar to a modern notary seal) started in the Netherlands in 1624. England introduced embossed revenue stamps in the late seventeenth century, then required embossed revenue stamps on American documents beginning in the mid-eighteenth century. The US federal government and various states used embossed revenue stamps beginning in the late eighteenth century. Britain invented the adhesive postage stamp in 1840, requiring the pre-payment of postage, followed in 1847 by the US. The 1862 Revenue Act introduced adhesive stamps for revenue collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1032373211424890">Giroux, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1032373211424890">Friedberg, 1994</xref>).</p>

<p>By contrast, the Confederacy focused on printing paper currency. Some $1.5 billion was issued, about 75 per cent of Confederate spending. Major factors were the lack of a bureaucratic infrastructure to collect taxes and a public policy believing in states’ rights. Taxes were initially low but rose substantially in 1863–64. Collection rates were poor and taxes represented only 2 per cent of total spending. Bonds also were issued, but sold poorly. In total, bond proceeds represented about 23 per cent of spending.</p>
<p>Because of the reliance on paper, inflation topped 9000 per cent before the collapse of the Confederacy. Most Confederate states levied some form of income tax during the War, usually based on existing pre-war tax laws. For example, Virginia raised existing tax rates in 1862 and 1863, including a 17 per cent tax on bond interest and 10 per cent on specific professions. Virginia collected $178,944 from income tax in 1863, its highest collection amount until the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1032373211424890">Samson, 1985</xref>).</p>

<p>The National Banking Act of 1864 created the national banking system, which reduced the financial chaos associated with only state chartered banks. The requirement that part of their capital be invested in Treasury bonds (they could also issue national bank notes backed by the Treasury bonds) was a major component, since it increased the demand for federal debt.</p>

<p>Political corruption grew throughout the nineteenth century. The most infamous example was Tammany Hall in New York City. The post-Civil War period saw the rise of Boss William Tweed, perhaps the greediest of the political bosses. Corruption existed at all government levels. Credit Mobilier (the construction company that built the Union Pacific Railroad) was the most notorious of the federal-government-level scandals. Stock in the company was given to cabinet officials and members of Congress to facilitate favorable legislation. The Credit Mobilier scandal and direct cash payments from lobbyists from the 1872 election were subject to Congressional hearings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1032373211424890">Brands, 2010</xref>, pp.320–2).</p>
