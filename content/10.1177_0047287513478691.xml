<p>Air travel is forecast to grow globally at around 5% per annum over 30 years, in direct conflict with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 60% and 80% by 2050. Many authors identify individual behavioral change, with consumers choosing fewer flights, as a contributor to reducing growth. An increasing number of studies examine knowledge about climate change and how this influences decisions to take holidays by air, although these have focused on tourists from developed countries where aviation growth is slowing, whereas future high growth will come from emerging economies. This article explores attitudes to flying from one emerging economy, Poland. A survey of Polish nationals conducted in Cracow in 2010 revealed concern over climate change although knowledge of its causes was poor. Analysis, using a social representations perspective, showed significant societal structures embed air travel as the norm and identified both internal and external barriers to behavioral change.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>International tourist arrivals by air have grown dramatically, producing global growth rates for air travel of between 5% and 6% per annum between 1970 and 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287513478691">Gössling and Peeters 2007</xref>). These very high rates of air transport growth have receded over recent years, with several important markets, such as the United Kingdom, showing a decline in air passenger numbers in both 2009 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287513478691">Department for Transport 2012a</xref>). Clearly, the economic recession has impacted on demand for air services. The close correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) and air traffic is well established in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287513478691">Symth and Christodoulou 2011</xref>), and although UK passenger numbers rose slightly in 2011, they remain about 7% below the 2008 figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287513478691">Department for Transport 2012a</xref>). Despite these recent falls, most forecasts predict continuing longer-term global air traffic growth rates of 4.7%-5% per annum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287513478691">Airbus 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478691">Boeing 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287513478691">Rolls Royce 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287513478691">Symth and Christodoulou 2011</xref>) although there is much variability between markets. The world’s largest air passenger market, the U.S. domestic market, is demonstrating signs of reaching maturity, and a modest growth of 2.7% per annum is forecast, while at the other end of the scale the Pacific /Asia region is growing most rapidly, particularly China (8%) and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287513478691">Rolls Royce 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Europe, like the U.S. domestic market, is showing signs of maturity, which is reflected in annual growth forecasts below the global figures, at about 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287513478691">Rolls Royce 2009</xref>). The regional figures however hide significant differences within Europe. The 15 European Union (EU) countries (the member states prior to expansion to 25 states in May 2004) display the characteristics of maturity, where the low-cost carriers (LCC) market is well established but beginning to slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287513478691">Symth and Christodoulou 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, air traffic in Eastern European countries, including this case study country of Poland, continued to grow rapidly, with new LCC routes being developed. LCCs saw a dramatic growth of 190% in passenger numbers carried to and from Poland between 2005 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Tourism’s contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is estimated to be around 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287513478691">UNWTO 2008</xref>). Transport is the dominant component of the tourism contribution, with air transport accounting for 40% of tourism’s emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287513478691">UNWTO 2008</xref>). This is higher than the share for surface transport, despite the lower frequency of international holidays by air compared to the consumption of shorter land-based holiday trips. Continued global growth rates of around 5% per annum will see a significant rise in tourism’s contribution to global GHG emissions and a rise in aviation’s contribution to the tourism share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287513478691">Bows 2010</xref>). Several factors are leading to aviation’s disproportionate increase in overall tourism emissions: the growing distance traveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287513478691">Peeters and Landré 2012</xref>); the trend toward shorter stays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287513478691">Alegre and Pou 2006</xref>); and in comparison to air travel, increasing mitigation in the accommodation sector in part driven by cost savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287513478691">Filimonau et al. 2011</xref>). Inevitably, environmental trade-offs lie at the heart of sustainable development policy in the tourism sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287513478691">Jones and Munday 2007</xref>). While at a destination level, tourism is seen as a relatively sustainable activity, the safeguarding of long-term ecological systems is brought into question when origin to destination travel comes into the equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287513478691">Høyer and Aall 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287513478691">Gössling, Hall, and Lane 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been many technological developments to reduce GHG emissions per seat or per passenger kilometer, and aircraft today are around 70% more fuel efficient than those of the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287513478691">Lawrence 2009</xref>). Improvements in both engine and airframe technology have brought about approximately 95% of the improvements in fuel consumption and hence have reduced emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287513478691">Lawrence 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287513478691">Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2002</xref>). Future improvements of 0.5% to 1.0% per annum are thought achievable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287513478691">Horton 2010</xref>). For example, the introduction of Boeing’s new 787 (Dreamliner), with construction from light-weight composite materials, is 20% more fuel efficient than existing planes such as the Boeing 767. Additional emissions reduction is attainable through improved flight management, with fuel savings of between 8% and 18% potentially available via improved air traffic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287513478691">ATAG 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287513478691">Lawrence 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been rapid progress in the use of biofuels for aviation. Following an inaugural flight by Virgin Atlantic between London (Heathrow) and Amsterdam in February 2008, where one of the four engines was powered by a biofuel manufactured from Brazilian babassu nuts and coconut oils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287513478691">BBC 2008</xref>), more than 1,500 commercial flights have been undertaken trialing a range of biofuel sources, including algae, babassu, switchgrass, and jatropha in combination with regular jet fuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287513478691">Gardner 2012</xref>). Biofuels have the potential to produce significant reductions in GHG emissions, with a 35% improvement in carbon intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287513478691">Committee on Climate Change 2009</xref>) and already there are challenging targets for their adoption, with the EU aiming for sustainable fuels in aviation to reach 40% by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287513478691">COM 2011</xref>). However, the use of biofuels is still at the development stage. Although several products have been certified for use on commercial flights in a 50% blend with standard jet fuel, production has been in small quantities. The transition from this development and evaluation phase to mass manufacture is uncertain. Key barriers remain, most notably the inability to raise the finance for construction of large commercial-scale refineries. The most significant concerns are the reliable supplies of sufficient raw feedstocks and price. Edible vegetable oils are expensive, with much competition for finite supplies. The cultivation of these crops has resulted in both direct land-use change such as deforestation and indirect land-use change such as displacing food production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287513478691">Committee on Climate Change 2009</xref>). Second-generation biofuel crops such as algae and jatropha are much less land intensive and can be cultivated on marginal or even degraded land, thus removing some of the ethical and social conflicts; however, the production cost is much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287513478691">IEA 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these technological developments, it is widely accepted that the forecast growth in demand will increase emissions at a faster rate than the technological developments can decrease them. As a consequence, aviation alone could contribute 15%-40% of global GHG emissions by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287513478691">Dubois and Ceron 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>If targets for reductions in GHG emissions of between 60 and 80% by 2050 from 1990 benchmark levels are to be met in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287513478691">COM 2007</xref>), continued high rates of growth in the demand for aviation need to be addressed. There is little agreement on how to achieve such a reduction. Strategies to decrease demand through increased taxation of aviation, resulting in higher prices, are unlikely to achieve international agreement. Furthermore, some authors argue that any tax on fuel would have to be set very high to have a serious impact on demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287513478691">Olsthoorn 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478691">Tol 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The EU is seeking to control GHG emissions from aviation with its inclusion in phase 3 of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). ETS has been in operation since 2005, initially covering sectors accounting for around 40% of total EU emissions, with aviation being added to the scheme in 2012. The scheme establishes a clear target to restrict aviation emissions in 2020 to the emissions levels of 2005 with a cap set at 95% of the average emissions for 2004-2006, the “historical aviation emissions.” Governments allocate 85% of the available emissions to airlines free of charge and the remaining 15% of emissions are either retained for new start-up airlines or are auctioned. The concept of the scheme is simple. For airlines to expand, they have a number of options. They either have to become more carbon efficient, and it is argued that the ETS will encourage airlines to accelerate the adoption of new technologies and the replacement of older less-efficient aircraft in their fleet. Or, they will have to purchase additional carbon allowances, or a combination of the two. Additional carbon allowances can be acquired through the auction process for the 15% of retained permits, or by purchase of carbon permits from other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The ETS scheme has run into international protest and legal challenge because its scope includes the carbon emissions incurred by the entire flight from EU destinations, not just the component of the flight over EU airspace. It is argued that this is a unilateral and extraterritorial scheme that infringes sovereignty of non-EU airspace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287513478691"><italic>The Guardian</italic> 2012</xref>). There are 20 countries that have formally signed up to oppose the EU ETS, known as the coalition of the unwilling, led by China, India, United States, and Russia, and 10 airlines have failed to comply with new EU regulations by failing to report their emissions for 2011 by March 31, 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287513478691"><italic>New York Times</italic> 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear whether ETS will make a significant impact on air transport demand. Much will depend on the price paid to purchase additional carbon emissions, but if current prices, in the magnitude of €7 per tonne, are maintained the total cost by 2020 will be around €2 billion by 2020, a relatively small share of airline costs compared with an estimated fuel bill of €168 billion. It has been suggested that the initial impact on the cost of a transatlantic ticket will be as little as $2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287513478691">Aviation Environment Federation 2011</xref>). A number of authors have therefore argued that individual behavioral change, with consumers choosing to take fewer flights, has a very important part to play in the longer-term reduction of air traffic–related GHG emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478691">Dickinson, Robbins, and Lumsdon 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287513478691">Gössling et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In comparison to the most developed countries, Poland currently has a relatively low proportion of the population taking flights. The population of 38 million is responsible for little more than 7 million outbound trips by air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287513478691">Institute of Tourism 2011</xref>). This is in comparison to a UK population of 61.4 million taking 54.7 million outbound trips by air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287513478691">Department for Transport 2012b</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that research on attitudes to flying and its environmental impacts has focused almost exclusively on consumers from developed countries. However, aviation growth in the most developed economies is showing the early indications of a mature market and is slowing down. The future regions of expansion that will continue to drive global growth in aviation of 5% per annum will be emerging economies where current penetration levels are low. This paper’s practical contribution therefore lies in assessing the climate change knowledge, the attitudes toward aviation, and the aviation practice of consumers in an emerging East European economy, Poland. On a theoretical level, the sustainability trade-offs are analyzed using Moscovici’s social representations theory, which offers an account for how new concepts, such as climate change, become contextualized in society.</p>

<title>Tourism and Aviation in Poland</title>
<p>Polish patterns of tourism travel behavior currently show that of all tourist travel, the share of air travel is low. The historic political development of Poland led to a dominance of domestic rather than international tourism that remains today. Relatively short trips to neighboring countries remain important destinations for outbound trips, with Germany by far the most important destination with 1.25 million trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287513478691">Institute of Tourism 2011</xref>). The mode of transport used by Poles for all holiday travel (domestic and international combined) is car or motorbike 57%, air 15% and rail 14% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287513478691">Eurobarometer 2009</xref>). The air share is well below the average of 36% for the 27 current members of the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>). However, the air share for international trips by Poles in 2010 is larger than average at 39% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287513478691">Central Statistical Office 2011</xref>). Coach travel accounts for a 15% share and rail for a mere 2% of international trips, in part due to low levels of investment and poor coordination with neighboring countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287513478691">Mintel 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From 1989, Poland has transformed from a communist state with a planned economy to a market-based economy with closer links to “the West.” The initial and rapid transformation has come to be known as a “shock therapy” period for Polish society, resulting in regional poverty, lack of guaranteed employment, and very high rates of inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287513478691">Kicinger 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287513478691">Morgan, Lugosi, and Brent Ritchie 2010</xref>). The economy contracted, with GDP falling by around 7% in both 1990 and 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>). However, following this initial painful transition, the Polish economy has adapted and performed well, with an annual GDP growth rate of 5.2% between 1992 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>), although since accession into the EU in 2004, economic growth has slowed and Poland has now been affected by the global economic downturn. Despite this, Polish outbound tourism has continued to grow. The number of Poles traveling abroad, the frequency of travel, and the range of destinations they visit have all grown since accession to the European Union (CBOS 2009). Moreover, the Polish tendency of taking their main holiday domestically is decreasing, although there is growth in the domestic short break market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287513478691">Institute of Tourism 2011</xref>). Significantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287513478691">CBOS (2009)</xref> indicates the majority of Polish outbound travelers consist of young, professional individuals with higher income and education, and generally from larger towns and cities.</p>
<p>Given the strong youth market, Poland is seen as a long-term region of growth, albeit starting from a low base. A high level of emigration has been important to aviation development in Poland. The easing of barriers of entrance to Western Europe following accession into the EU has created increased movements of Polish migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287513478691">CBOS 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287513478691">GUS 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287513478691">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287513478691">Hall, Smith, and Marciszewska 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>). Emigration has a number of potential impacts on air traffic growth in Poland. At one level, the expectation is that it will deflate air traffic growth as there is a reduced core population to make outbound tourist trips by air. Furthermore, the greatest decline in population will be in the age group 20 to 29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>), who also show the greatest propensity for international holidays. On the other hand, much of the emigration is not permanent, generating return migratory travel. Furthermore, while abroad, the young emigrants will generate a sizeable visiting friends and relatives (VFR) market with flights home from EU member states. There is also some scope for an outbound VFR market.</p>
<p>Related in part to migration, the growth of LCCs also provides reason to focus on Poland, which has seen a dramatic increase in the number of routes and number of passengers carried. For example, Davison and Ryley (2007) identified that Poland experienced by far the greatest growth rates in passenger numbers between the United Kingdom and EU countries between 1997 and 2007 (a growth of 1,150%), albeit from a very low base of 348,000 passengers in 1997. LCCs are now very significant to the Polish aviation market with around 52% of the total market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287513478691">Urzad Lotnictwa Cywilnego 2011</xref>). The high growth rates since 2005 illustrate the very real potential for outbound travel by air from Poland, which given the very low base of demand makes Poland an important case study for future contributions to GHG emissions. However, continued growth is forecast to be a slower long-term process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>) with significant barriers to growth in the immediate future. In addition to the global financial downturn, high rates of unemployment and a very price-sensitive market are perceived to limit the immediate growth of international tourism flows from Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>). The aviation market has stagnated over the past 4 years, as it has in many other EU countries, and a return to the high growth rates of the previous decade await a global economic recovery.</p>

<title>Tourist Travel Practice</title>
<p>There are an increasing number of studies that explore consumer attitudes to flying in the context of climate change. These studies fall broadly into two categories: studies assessing knowledge and attitudes to increased flying and measuring consumer behavior (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287513478691">Araña et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas 2006</xref>) and studies within the sociology of consumption, drawing particularly on social practice theory, that examine how practice, such as flying, is structured by society (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478691">Dickinson, Robbins, and Lumsdon 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478691">Miller et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478691">Randles and Mander 2009</xref>). It is clear from existing studies that attitudinal concerns about climate change and flying are not reflected in behavior patterns. Social practice theory offers some explanation of this contradiction. It focuses on the practice (in this instance air travel) that is embedded both in collective cognition and society’s physical and social structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287513478691">Reckwitz 2002</xref>). These studies seek to explain why frequent flying has become habitual, socially acceptable, and even desirable, although in many cases individuals are aware of its harmful environmental consequences, and conclude that individual values and beliefs are weaker than the socially constituted norms and structures of society.</p>
<p>Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287513478691">Gössling et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478691">Miller et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas 2006</xref>) found that a minority of respondents were aware of the environmental cost of air travel or at least the impacts of their behavior. However, recent UK studies suggest a growing awareness of climate change and the link to air transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287513478691">Department for Transport 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287513478691">Higham and Cohen 2011</xref>). On the other hand, studies exploring individual responsibility for flying have produced mixed results. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287513478691">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon (2006)</xref> found 52% would be prepared to fly less frequently to reduce their impact, this propensity to change behavior is not supported by other studies. Many studies have identified inconsistencies between consumer attitudes and their subsequent behavior, the value-action gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287513478691">Barr 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287513478691">Blake 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287513478691">Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002</xref>). Converting environmental concern into action and behavioral change is a major challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287513478691">Anable, Lane, and Kelay 2006</xref>). Studies suggest the discrepancy between attitude and behavior arises from the conflict between perceived personal benefits from tourism travel by air and the environmental costs to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas 2006</xref>), with the personal benefit carrying much greater weight in the final choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes (2010)</xref> provide an alternative perspective suggesting that while awareness of the climate change impacts of air travel is fairly well established, this fails to translate into an attitude that flying is an environmental concern. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes (2010)</xref> argue the gap lies between awareness and attitude rather than a gap between attitude and behavior.</p>
<p>Other studies explore the denial mechanisms and guilt suppression strategies used by people to continue to enjoy high levels of air travel (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>). The main arguments include the following: holidays are different to everyday life and thus attitudes toward holiday activities are compartmentalized, resulting in concern and responsibility for the environment being temporarily suspended; responsibility lies with others such as government and industry, though government controls and “green” taxes are resisted; there is a skepticism about the science behind climate change; alternatives are lacking; tourism creates social and economic benefits; and a perception that individuals lack the power to act, so any sacrifice made to forgo air travel is incidental and futile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478691">Dickinson, Robbins, and Lumsdon 2010</xref>). Holidays are also attributed a high level of importance, and personal freedom is highly valued. Given that research on attitudes to flying and the climate change impacts has been conducted almost entirely in developed countries, there is a need to better understand consumer views of tourism’s contribution to climate change in an emerging economy and the implications for subsequent tourism travel practice.</p>

<title>Social Representations Theory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287513478691">Moscovici’s (1981)</xref> social representations theory takes the view that social groups evolve consensual understandings (social representations) of the world around them. It is particularly relevant where new concepts, such as climate change, are establishing themselves in society and are linked to the cause of events. As new concepts emerge, people initially struggle to comprehend them and representations of new phenomena emerge from media portrayals, everyday informal discussion, and communication. Essentially, people seek to understand ideas and contextualize them in their world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287513478691">Hogg and Abrams 1988</xref>). People initially draw on a pool of familiar ideas that circulate in society from which they assemble new concepts, and past experience shapes new representations. It is through a series of small steps that the unfamiliar is turned into something concrete and germane even where there is no direct contact with the phenomenon or its consequences, as is often the case with climate change.</p>
<p>Once established, social representations have considerable inertia and people will distort information and experience to fit their representation. This goes some way to explain the value–action gap since there is a strong desire to maintain a stable reality and social representations can adjust a reality to fit through selective filtering of relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287513478691">Fredline and Faulkner 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287513478691">Hogg and Abrams 1988</xref>). Here the theory helps explain the emerging understanding of tourism impacts on climate change, especially how particular elements of the representation come to the fore and create barriers to behavioral change and are institutionalized in society.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0047287513478691">
<title>Research Instrument and Respondents</title>
<p>Based on previous research findings and research instruments exploring tourism and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478691">Randles and Mander 2009</xref>) a questionnaire was developed to explore awareness of climate change and implications for tourist behavior. It is acknowledged as a limitation that items in the questionnaire were largely derived from a UK perspective, given the preponderance of UK studies; however, items were adapted to the Polish context. For example, since the UK government has taken an international lead through the Climate Change Act 2008, items relating to the government’s commitment to climate change were amended.</p>
<p>The survey instrument was administered to Polish nationals visiting the old town in Cracow, which is the central tourist district of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287513478691">Mika 2011</xref>) and a popular walking and meeting place for both local residents and visitors. Cracow was selected for the survey as it is Poland’s second largest city and has Poland’s second largest airport, which hosts many of the new low-cost routes. Furthermore, it is the largest city destination for tourism in Poland, making tourism a high-profile activity. The self-completion survey was administered from 11:00 <sc>am</sc> to 5:00 <sc>pm</sc> over a two-week period in May 2010 using a nonprobability sampling strategy on a next to pass basis. There is a general reluctance on the part of Polish nationals to take part in surveys. This was overcome by a face-to-face introduction by a researcher in Polish who assured anonymity and introduced the tourism topic focus. The researcher also remained available to answer any questions. No incentives were provided.</p>
<p>The response rate varied considerably by age with a much higher response rate for those 35 or under (75%) compared with those older than 35 (17%), since older Poles are more suspicious of people asking questions. In order to address the age imbalance, older people were targeted in the latter days of the survey. Despite this, the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 369), though broadly representative of the Polish population in relation to gender and socioeconomic characteristics, was overrepresented by people under 35 (75%) which reflects Cracow’s status as the largest academic centre in Poland. Therefore, this group is overrepresented in the city’s population.</p>
<p>The questionnaire incorporated items on general awareness and understanding of climate change; tourism-specific understanding of climate change; tourist behavior with respect to climate change; and barriers to behavior change. In the main, these items were operationalized using a 5-point agreement scale; however, five items relating to tourist behavior were explored using a 3-point scale (I do this: a lot, a little, not at all). Additional items explored patterns of international tourism travel over the last three years and compiled sociodemographic data. The items describing barriers to behavior changes were divided into internal (individual level) and external (societal level) barriers. These were derived from previous studies on tourism and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>) together with more generic studies examining behavior change that could lead to lower GHG emissions and theoretical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287513478691">Anable, Lane, and Kelay 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287513478691">Lorenzoni, Nicholson-Cole, and Whitmarsh 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478691">Randles and Mander 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287513478691">Stoll-Kleemann, O’Riordan, and Jaeger 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>International Holidays</title>
<p>The majority of respondents (88%) had taken an international holiday in the past 3 years. Ninety-five percent of these had taken holidays within Europe, but respondents had also traveled to North (11%) and South America (2%), Africa (17%), Asia (15%), and Australasia (2%). The plane was the most popular mode for international travel (66%), followed by car (52%) and coach (47%). The train (25%) and ferry (17%) were less well used. Of those who had taken an international holiday, the mean number of holidays in the last 3 years was 2.8 (SD = 2.483). The respondents therefore reflect a young, educated (51% have a degree, though this is not unusual in Poland), and relatively child-free (35% have children in the household) population who enjoy more international holidays and air travel compared to the Polish population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478691">Mintel 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0047287513478691">
<title>Awareness and Understanding of Climate Change</title>
<p>Response to statements exploring awareness and understanding of climate change reveal mixed findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287513478691">Table 1</xref>). Driving a car is the top item identified as contributing to climate change. On the other hand, the contribution of air travel, both in general and in relation to tourism, is relatively uncertain. Air travel is a significant contributor to GHG emissions and, in a population with a good understanding of climate change, this might be expected to be at the top alongside driving a car. Conversely, coach travel is overall rated as having a higher contribution to climate change than air travel, yet it is the most energy-efficient form of tourism transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478691">Dickinson, Robbins, and Lumsdon 2010</xref>). Going on an international holiday is considered to make the least contribution, suggesting respondents did not understand the impact that traveling further had on GHG emissions. On the other hand, attitude items indicate a level of concern about climate change (“I believe that climate change is a serious threat to the future of our planet,” <italic>M</italic> = 2.1, SD = 1.03; and “I am greatly concerned by climate change issues,” <italic>M</italic> = 2.6, SD = 1.12). Therefore, while there is concern about climate change and the contribution of car travel to climate change is relatively well established in the Polish population, there is a much less developed understanding of the role of other forms of transport, especially air travel.</p>

<p>An understanding of climate change is considered a prerequisite for concern and subsequent behavior change. To examine this theoretical linkage, a structural equation model (SEM) was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287513478691">Figure 1</xref>). The data fitted the model very well (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.364, df = 7, <italic>p</italic> = .123; RMSEA = .043 [90% CI = .000, .087]; pCLOSE = .541; CFI = .993; Hoelter[.05] = 414.000, Hoelter[.01] = 543). This model displays a significant positive regression weight from the latent construct “understanding of climate change in a tourism context” to the latent construct “concern about climate change” (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .31). Given the poor understanding of climate change in a tourism context, this will therefore not instigate concern among the Polish population in a tourism setting. Analysis failed to find a significant regression coefficient between either of these latent constructs and tourism behavior. The absence of a link between “concern about climate change” and tourism behavior is consistent with the value–action gap identified previously by several studies in other geographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287513478691">Barr 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287513478691">Blake 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287513478691">Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Impact of Climate Change on Holiday Behavior Decisions</title>
<p>In order for concerns about climate change to have an influence on holiday behavior decisions, an understanding of climate change is paramount. A criticism of many previous studies is the assumption that generic survey data, that often reveals a relatively poor grasp of the relationship between actions and climate change, can usefully be applied to test people’s behavioral intentions in relation to climate change. Therefore, while analysis has explored the behavior intentions of the whole sample to provide a baseline, it is vital to consider the group that demonstrates better understanding of air travel impacts (reported “air travel/flying to the destination” as having either a large or very large impact on climate change, n=140). Further analysis found that this group was not associated with any particular demographic or socioeconomic group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287513478691">Table 2</xref> shows that respondents make little link between their holiday plans and climate change concerns. The subsequent actions were geared to relatively low commitment activities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287513478691">Table 3</xref>), but revealed much less willingness to reduce flights. The group that has better understanding of air travel impacts demonstrates slightly higher impact on all behavior intention items, which suggests some understanding–behavior alignment.</p>

<p>Previous research exploring tourism and social representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287513478691">Dickinson, Robbins, and Fletcher 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287513478691">Dickinson and Robbins 2008</xref>) suggests representations are related to context. Context is considered an important factor in both psychologically derived behavior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>) and sociological perspectives such as the social practices perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>). In this sample, 12% (n=45) had not been on an international holiday. In addition, <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing this group with those engaging in overseas tourism indicated stronger behavioral intention with respect to flying less (<italic>t</italic> = 2.738, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). This suggests an attitude–behavior alignment. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, this group is purposefully choosing to avoid international holidays because of environmental concern. Second, this group has traveled less and the attitude is aligned to justify the lack of international tourism experience; that is, the behavior prompts the attitude. It is often assumed that attitude precedes behavior; however, studies show behavior also precedes attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287513478691">Eiser and van der Pligt 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287513478691">Golob and Hensher 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287513478691">Tertoolen, van Kreveld, and Verstraten 1998</xref>) as the cognitive dissonance creates an unpleasant tension. This attitude–behavior alignment requires further study.</p>
<p>In order to find natural groups of individuals who are more predisposed to modify their tourist behavior, a cluster analysis was conducted. Cluster analysis is a useful technique in social representation studies where the focus is on similarities between respondents. It explores whether there is consensual agreement between individuals and thus an established representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287513478691">Fife-Schaw 1993</xref>). A hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s method and squared Euclidean distance was conducted with input variables related to behavior intentions. Using an inductive strategy and exploration of the dendrogram, a four-cluster solution appeared most stable and useful. Each cluster was profiled against the input variables:</p>
<list id="list1-0047287513478691" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cluster 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 34): group showing most willingness to change behavior.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cluster 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 95): reluctant to reduce flying but concerned that tourist impacts cannot be offset in other ways.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cluster 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 117): ambivalent about all behavior change items.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cluster 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 113): group showing least behavior change intention.</p></list-item></list>
<p>While cluster 1 identifies a group most willing to change behavior, this is a relatively small group and indicates that there is little behavior intention associated with climate change issues in the tourism context among the Polish population. There was little evidence of an association between cluster membership and particular demographic or socioeconomic groups.</p>

<title>Barriers to Behavior Change</title>
<p>Barriers to behavior change were divided into internal and external barriers. Of the internal barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287513478691">Figure 2</xref>), those related to general concern about climate change are less of a barrier to behavior change (means closer to 5). This indicates a relatively widely held concern about climate change; however, there is a high degree of uncertainty about tourism-specific items (means close to 3) which suggests the finer details of the social representation of tourism and climate change are less well established. External barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287513478691">Figure 3</xref>) are generally more significant with items related to social norms and expectations to consume and instrumental factors being stronger barriers (means closer to 1).</p>

<p>Analysis of the responses of those aware of flying impacts compared to less aware participants indicates broadly similar response patterns for internal and external barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287513478691">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287513478691">3</xref>). In response to the internal barriers, a number of items become a less significant barrier for the aware groups.

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>The projected growth of air travel globally directly conflicts with efforts to reduce GHG emissions in order to meet international and national targets related to minimizing risks of climate change. Much of the future growth of aviation is projected within emerging economies, and hence this study has focused on an emerging Eastern European economy, Poland. The study found that the Polish population has an awareness of climate change and there is a degree of concern among the population, although this is far from universal. On the other hand, understanding of causes is relatively poor both in general and in relation to the impacts caused by tourism. This is very similar to a number of studies conducted in the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand, and among visiting tourists from developed countries to Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287513478691">Gössling et. al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478691">Miller et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478691">Randles and Mander 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas (2006)</xref>, for example, found most of their respondents uncertain about climate change facts, and only three respondents out of a total of 18 international students expressed concern about the environmental cost of air transport. Several studies confirmed a lack of awareness about the environmental impact of aviation compared to other transport modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478691">Randles and Mander 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478691">Shaw and Thomas 2006</xref>), although more recent studies show an increasing awareness of the aviation contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287513478691">Higham and Cohen 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The link between climate change concerns and holiday decisions is not established in Poland, a finding similar to studies in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478691">Becken 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478691">Miller et al. (2010)</xref> identify a UK frequent flyer who believed that reusing carrier bags, using low-energy light bulbs, and insulating his home were more important to the environment than changing holiday behavior. Similarly, in Poland, people appear to be willing to take relatively low commitment actions such as carbon offsetting; a finding also congruent with studies elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>). However, given approximately two-thirds of the Polish sample did not identify flying as a contributor to climate change, it is not surprising that concerns relative to tourism are poorly established. SEM identified that an understanding of the impacts of tourism on climate change predicts concern. Other studies have failed to account for the degree of understanding. To address this, the study selected a group that demonstrated greater awareness of aviation’s contribution to GHG emissions since conclusions about awareness, understanding, and subsequent practice can only logically be drawn from this group. This group demonstrated marginally more positive behavioral intention with respect to reducing their impacts of tourism on climate change; however, this understanding–behavior alignment was far from universal and was a poor fit in attempted modeling. This suggests the value–action gap is a firmly rooted problem as established elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287513478691">Barr 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478691">Barr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287513478691">Blake 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478691">Cohen, Higham, and Cavaliere 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287513478691">Kollmuss and Agyeman 2002</xref>). This is further confirmed by a cluster analysis, which identified a relatively small group (<italic>n</italic> = 34% or 9%) showing willingness to change behavior.</p>
<p>From a social representations theory perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287513478691">Moscovici (1981)</xref> argues that where a new phenomenon appears, new concepts and explanations emerge through everyday discussions in society and media representations. The threat of climate change is a concept familiar to the respondents, though beyond car use there is relatively little familiarity with the concepts causing climate change. Understanding in the tourism context is weak and the population has yet to assemble any salient link between tourism and climate change. At the same time, respondents are accustomed to view tourism positively and recognize air travel as the best option for many international trips on the grounds of both cost and viability. From these familiar concepts, the population established new ideas. Given the common concepts that people draw from, it is likely that the practice of flying for international tourism will remain strong even if climate change awareness and understanding grows. The inertia of the established social representation firmly positions tourism as a relatively benign and desirable activity.</p>
<p>Given that experience also shapes social representations, the study also examined the group that had not been on an international holiday. The stronger behavioral intention with respect to flying less indicates some contextual–behavior alignment though it is not known whether this is the attitude driving the behavior or the attitude aligning with a lack of international tourism experience.</p>
<p>An exploration of barriers to behavior change suggests that external barriers (societal level) were generally more significant than internal barriers (individual level). The strongest barriers were related to social norms and expectations to consume and instrumental factors related to the structure of travel options. These circulate in the pool of societal ideas about tourism and have been assembled within the social representation as forces that directly encourage air travel through the desire and expectation to take international holidays by air. This is perhaps strengthened by Poland’s recent economic and political history where such consumption is an indicator of both individual economic progress and personal freedom and the structural travel constraints that make it difficult to use other modes. The Polish rail network is particularly poor because of lack of investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287513478691">Prokopowicz 2011</xref>) and currently has poor connections with neighboring countries. The lack of high-speed rail services further limits the potential of rail as a competitor for short international trips, although there are now proposals for a new high-speed line (the Y line) to link Warsaw–Łódź–Kalisz. Critics point out that the current plans do not include links to the high-speed rail lines of neighboring European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287513478691">Prokopowicz 2011</xref>). An understanding of the structures leading to less sustainable travel behavior can aid policy to steer tourist flows to more energy-efficient patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287513478691">Becken and Schiff 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287513478691">Becken, Simmons, and Frampton 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While the barriers to behavior change for both a more aware group and a less aware group were broadly aligned, internal barriers are less significant for respondents in the aware group who demonstrate more commitment to individual action. On the other hand, the lack of political action and lack of industry action were more significant barriers for the aware group. This suggests the population with a better understanding of the issues will be less tolerant of industry and government prevarication. This reflects the individual denial mechanism that responsibility lies with others such as government and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287513478691">Hares, Dickinson, and Wilkes 2010</xref>); however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287513478691">Sheldon and Park (2011)</xref> argue this stimulates corporate action.</p>
<p>This study clearly shows that individual behavioral change, with consumers choosing to take fewer flights, will not bring about significant constraints on the growth of air travel from an emerging economy such as Poland. Even if the population of Poland is educated to a higher awareness of the impacts of climate change, translating this concern and knowledge into action and behavioral change is a major challenge as was found in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287513478691">Anable, Lane, and Kelay 2006</xref>). From a policy perspective, to achieve reductions in air travel emissions it seems inevitable that governments will need to lead in the form of adopting strategies to restrain demand, such as increasing the price through some form of international agreement in environmental taxation or adoption of a rigorous global carbon trading scheme. This will also address one of the main denial mechanisms, lack of governmental action, for not adapting personal behavior.</p>
