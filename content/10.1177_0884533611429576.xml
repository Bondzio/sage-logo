<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exerts a significant impact on children’s growth and development. In infants and children with CKD, feeding-related problems are not infrequent, leading to protein-energy malnutrition and resulting in retarded physical development. Because spontaneous energy intake is usually inadequate in children with CKD, special dietary counseling with supportive procedures are often required. Placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is one practical way to allow home tube feeding. Such nutrition support is valuable in children with CKD, and although it is not free from complications and technical problems, it seems to be helpful in providing required nutrition intake. In this report, the authors describe their own experience with PEG implantation and use in 3 children with CKD.</p>

<body>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as irreversible kidney damage, manifested by structural or functional abnormalities with impaired glomerular filtration rate, significantly affects children’s growth. Children are prone to adverse effects of CKD in various stages of their development, unlike adults with completed physiological and intellectual maturation. The childhood population is considered at a high risk for protein-energy malnutrition. This deficiency may manifest itself as low body weight, growth retardation, or both. The difficulties associated with feeding of infants and young children with chronic or end-stage kidney disease are well-recognized problems. Refusal of meals, reduced spontaneous oral food intake, and frequent episodes of vomiting result in failure to provide adequate food and nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611429576">1</xref></sup> This, in turn, may bring about renal osteodystrophy, anemia, metabolic acidosis, and salt wasting, which are critical factors leading to growth impairment. In addition, multiple restrictions of the diet recommended for CKD patients, including low intakes of protein, potassium, vitamins and small daily fluid volumes, can also contribute to problems with growth. Moreover, approximately two-thirds of pediatric patients requiring dialysis need chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD), which is associated with significant protein loss into the dialysis fluid, leading to protein malnutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611429576">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because growth rates are maximal in infancy, the magnitude of growth suppression during that time is a very significant factor, as well as the ability to maintain further growth potential in unfavorable conditions. Therefore, prevention and treatment of long-term consequences of CKD should be oriented toward early developmental stages, especially during the first 3 years of life, when human growth is almost exclusively dependent on nutrition. Because spontaneous energy intake is usually inadequate in children with CKD, special dietary counseling and procedures are often recommended. Specific nutrition support for children with CKD involves low-phosphate and high-caloric food supplements and the use of nasogastric tubes, gastrostomy feeding, and partial or total parenteral nutrition (PN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611429576">3</xref></sup> Additional forms of nutrition therapy include intradialytic nutrition (amino acids containing dialysis fluid) or growth factors (recombinant human growth hormone).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533611429576">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611429576">5</xref></sup> Feeding via a nasogastric tube has many disadvantages, including frequent tube repassage and the risks of food aspiration, reflux esophagitis, inhibited oromotor development, and altered cosmetic appearance of the child. Gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy is an alternative route for long-term enteral feeding, accomplished via open gastrostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611429576">6</xref></sup> The PEG button after implantation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533611429576">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In this report, the authors describe their own experience with PEG implantation and use in children with CKD with a retrospective analysis of data from case histories of children with CKD stage 5. Those children were administered intensive nutrition support with frequent monitoring of their clinical status in attempt to optimize their growth and development rates. A broad analysis took into account commonly used anthropometric parameters, including body height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), total serum protein content, and serum albumin levels. Three consecutive cases are described in chronological order.</p>

<title>Presentation of Cases</title>
<sec id="section2-0884533611429576">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>Patient 1 was admitted to our department as an 11.7-year-old girl. Her past medical history revealed several episodes of urinary tract infections during infancy and early childhood. A bilateral vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed at age 7 years, followed by recommendation of conservative treatment, but the girl’s parents did not comply with regular follow-up care, failing to appear for appointments at the Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Nephrology. Five years later, the patient was referred to the pediatric ward because of poor general condition, short stature, and pallor. Laboratory investigations revealed disturbances typical for CKD, with a serum creatinine level of 826.7 µmol/L (9.4 mg/dL; normal range, 35–77 µmol/L) and serum urea level of 16.5 mmol/L (99.4 mg/dL, which corresponded to a serum urea nitrogen level of 46.4 mg/dL; normal range, 3.2–7.1 mmol/L). End-stage renal failure was diagnosed based on long-term clinical symptoms, laboratory tests results, and ultrasound examination of the girl’s abdomen. Chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) was introduced immediately. At the beginning, the patient remained on maintenance hemodialysis, but during the second month of hospitalization, after a prolonged and very detailed training of the child’s mother in peritoneal dialysis technique, a decision was made to change the RRT method. A 2-cuff Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter was implanted, and continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was started. Several months after the first discharge, that method was converted to automated peritoneal dialysis (APD).</p>
<p>The main complications during the first period of maintenance therapy included 2 incidents of peritonitis (7 and 10 months from RRT onset) and persisting nutrition problems—loss of appetite and recurrent vomiting, according to psychological diagnosis, partly self-evoked by the patient. All those episodes contributed to serious disturbances in the girl’s metabolic status, presenting with hypercatabolism and progressive physical impairment, including unsatisfactory gain of body weight and height. Special nutrition, periodically supported by the use of a nasogastric feeding tube, was applied, but it was poorly tolerated by the patient and eventually was not accepted by the patient or her family. To resolve these issues and improve the nutrition status of the patient, PEG implantation was performed after 20 months of RRT. The endoscopic insertion procedure was uncomplicated, but 4 days later, symptoms of peritonitis were observed, implying infectious complications from the PEG implantation procedure. Peritonitis was treated and resolved without any consequences. During several subsequent months, the PEG tube was effectively used to increase nutrition intake, which, in combination with rhGH (recombinant human growth hormone) treatment, brought about satisfactory improvements regarding physical development, especially growth gain. Unfortunately, the use of the PEG tube was not trouble free. A considerable amount of granulation tissue was detected around the PEG exit site 3 months after implantation. Because of its tendency toward bleeding, surgical removal of that tissue was necessary. Six and 7 months after PEG implantation, 2 consecutive incidents of peritonitis were diagnosed, but it was obvious if they could have been directly attributed to the PEG as its direct complication. The PEG tunnel was at that time completely formed, and any gastroperitoneal leakage was almost impossible. Nine months later, the problem of frequent vomiting appeared again, followed by a diagnosis of sliding, esophageal hiatal hernia requiring laparoscopic surgery for Toupet’s fundoplication. During that period, feeding through the PEG tube remained the main mode of nutrition, based on home-prepared, blended meals. The contribution of oral intake to daily consumption was then below 20%. The PEG tube was also used for drug administration (eg, antihypertensive agents and alkali). After the surgical intervention, no major PEG-related complications were noted, and nutrition support was maintained for another 6 months with very good results. Fifteen months after implantation, the PEG was removed because natural oral feeding was sufficient enough to fulfill all nutrition needs of the patient. Six months later, our patient was referred for cadaveric renal transplantation. Her physical development revealed changes in body weight, body height, and BMI values, together with changes in serum total protein and albumin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533611429576">Figure 2</xref>). Comparing the physical development parameters with growth charts, we confirmed that body height values were slightly below the third percentile during the whole observation period, whereas weight values were significantly below the third percentile, rising, however, in parallel to the curve of the third percentile. The BMI values did not improve during the observed period of development (between the ages of 12 and 15 years). We conclude that the complex treatment with intensive nutrition support did not give any spectacular improvement in physical development in patient 1. However, it sufficiently suppressed the progression of hypostature, hypercatabolism, and weight loss.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>Patient 2 was admitted to our ward for the first time at the age of 2 months with CKD in stage 3/4, diagnosed immediately after birth. His basic disease was bilateral hydronephrosis with megaureters complicated by chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. His prognosis for stable renal function was poor from the very beginning, so the plan of his treatment was focused on proper preparation for maintenance RRT. Because the boy’s family was compliant to prescribed therapy, a preemptive renal transplantation was chosen for him as the optimal option of RRT. For successful kidney transplantation in a small child, the kidney recipient’s body weight must be ≥10 kg. At the age of 7 months, a significant decline in kidney function was observed (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] value dropped to 12 mL/min), indicating a necessity to start RRT within a short time. At that time, the patient’s body weight was 8.4 kg. Although it was still within the normal range for age and gender, the child was too small for renal transplantation in the immediate future. Moreover, the parents started complaining about feeding problems. Therefore, a PEG tube was implanted (at age 7 months), and feeding through gastrostomy was introduced. Soon after, PEG tube feedings became a dominant nutrition method with the approximate contribution to daily food intake exceeding 70%. Modified milk and homemade blended meals were used for tube feeding. It resulted in rapid and continuous gain of the patient’s body weight and height, enabling proper physical development of the child. Simultaneously, a conservative treatment for CKD (renoprotection, antihypertensive drugs, alkali) enabled avoiding dialysis for several months. The only PEG-related complication involved its incidental removal in the 10th month of nutrition treatment. The second gastroscopy was performed immediately, a gastrocutaneous fistula was localized, and a new PEG system was implanted during the same procedure. The new PEG tube was used without any disturbances for another 18 months. Finally, the child at age 3 years, with body weight of 14.5 kg, was referred for preemptive renal transplantation with functioning PEG tube, providing the ability to proceed with nutrition support treatment after transplantation. Physical development of the boy revealed positive changes in his body weight, body height, and BMI values, together with changes in serum total protein and albumin levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0884533611429576">Figure 3</xref>). Looking at the growth charts, it is clear that body height values were between the 10th and the 25th percentiles, and body weight values were almost always at the 50th percentile during the entire observation period. Therefore, the early introduction of complex treatment was fully successful in terms of achieving proper physical development of patient 2.</p>

<title>Case 3</title>
<p>Patient 3, a girl with congenital nephrotic syndrome, diagnosed in the first week of life, was treated in the neonatal intensive care unit for 8 weeks and then transferred to our ward for therapy continuation. Because of excessive proteinuria, resulting in significant protein loss, the patient depended on intravenous infusions, repeated daily or every second day. As a result of the natural course of the disease, the patient’s discharge was impossible, as well as outpatient care; therefore, further hospitalization was necessary, amounting to 2 years. After the diagnosis of congenital nephrotic syndrome was made based on a structural defect of the glomerular filtrating membrane with total resistance to any form of pharmacological treatment, a plan of further therapeutic management was established. The main steps of that plan included unilateral nephrectomy, maintenance of peritoneal dialysis, opposite-side nephrectomy, and qualification for renal transplantation. The final aim was to perform renal transplantation at a relatively young age. Clearly, one of the fundamental problems concerning the management of patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome is ensuring their proper physical development with adequate body weight at the time of transplantation (≥10 kg). The massive protein loss with constant hypoproteinemia, dysproteinemia, and the secondary impairment of total nutrition status and metabolism (typical for treatment-resistant nephrotic syndrome) are serious barriers to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>After a period of symptomatic treatment (albumin infusions, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, correction of acidosis, calcium and vitamin supplementation, L-thyroxin administration), a right-side nephrectomy was performed when the girl was 9 months old and her body weight was 7 kg. During the subsequent 5 months, conservative treatment was continued. During that period, a progressive impairment in renal function and increasing nutrition problems were observed, resulting in physical development suppression (the patient gained &lt;1 kg of body weight during that time). To resolve feeding problems and guarantee better developmental progress, a PEG tube was implanted at the age of 14 months. An intensive feeding support by means of gastrostomy (including night feeding as well), based on modified milk, blended homemade meals, and some special low-phosphate nutrition formulas, recommended for specific demands of a child with CKD (Renilon, Nutricia Clinical Care, Wiltshire, Trownbridge, UK; Kindergen, SHS International, Liverpool, UK), combined with intravenous albumin infusions, led to a body weight increase to 10 kg before the girl was 2 years old. At that time, a Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter was implanted, and APD was started. Two months later, the opposite-side nephrectomy was performed. Since then, the child has waited to have a cadaveric renal transplantation. Now the child is 44 months old, and the total period of PEG usage is 30 months. No PEG-related complications have been noted during that period, and feeding through the gastrostomy tube has been an effective and well-tolerated way to improve the nutrition status of our patient. In fact, it remains the dominant way of feeding, as the oral route gives a rather low contribution to daily intake (&lt;20%). As in the other 2 cases, the PEG tube was also helpful in allowing both conservative treatment of renal failure (alkali, antihypertensive drugs, etc) and peritoneal dialysis to continue. The girl’s physical development demonstrated changes in body weight, body height, and BMI values, together with changes in serum levels of total protein and albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0884533611429576">Figure 4</xref>). Referring to growth charts, we can demonstrate that body height values were between the 25th and the 50th percentiles, and body weight values were approximately at the 10th percentile during the whole observation period. So again, the introduction of complex treatment at a very young age was sufficient to ensure proper height and weight gain of patient 3.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proper nutrition in children with CKD seems crucial for their physical and mental development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611429576">7</xref></sup> Clearly, when spontaneous oral intake is inadequate, specific nutrition intervention should be considered. Oral nutrient supplementation is the first dietary intervention. Enteral feeding through a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube should be considered in patients who fail to meet their nutrition goals by the oral route. The available evidence regarding the importance of nutrition for development during the first years of life supports the hypothesis that enteral nutrition (EN) would be the method of choice during this period.</p>
<p>The results of the studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of enteral supplementation in growth stimulation and nutrition improvement in infants with CKD vary according to different authors. A study by Coleman and Watson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611429576">8</xref></sup> concluded that long-term enteral feeding in infants with CKD requiring PD prevented weight loss or improved the growth rate. EN seems to be effective both in children on dialysis and in those in predialytic stages of CKD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611429576">9</xref></sup> The early introduction of nutrition support may be effective enough to delay and minimize more expensive kinds of therapy, such as recombinant growth hormone treatment. That was the case with our younger patients (cases 2 and 3) with good clinical outcomes. Ramage et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611429576">10</xref></sup> and Kari and Rees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611429576">11</xref></sup> enthusiastically described the results of gastrostomy feeding not only in infants but also in older children on PD. In contrast, the results of the North America Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies on the effectiveness of supplemental feeding in children younger than age 6 at dialysis onset show no differences regarding anthropometric parameters in children with and without supplementary feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611429576">12</xref></sup> Moreover, van Dyck et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611429576">13</xref></sup> showed that early and adequate conservative management can prevent progressive growth retardation in infants with CKD with no need for additional enteral feeding. Regarding the results of the above-mentioned studies and considering clinical indications for EN support in the patients described in this report, we conclude that the decision to provide PEG tube feedings should be made only when oral feeding seems to be really insufficient. Following our experience, enteral feeding via PEG tube could be of great benefit for both infants and older children. However, its early application (at a younger age) seems to be tolerated by patients, acceptable to their parents, and, as a consequence, effective. Feeding by the PEG method, although ensuring proper nutrition, together with recombined growth hormone therapy (in selected patients) and an appropriate control of metabolic acidosis, renal osteodystrophy, and anemia, may be of key importance for the majority of CKD-affected children with growth retardation to attain normal body height in adult age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611429576">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The efforts to continuously provide adequate nutrition intake in children often create enormous stress for their parents. The placement of a gastrostomy tube for nutrition support can, to some extent, alleviate parental stress and markedly reduce feeding time. However, it is also important to consider the actual limitations of different supportive techniques of EN. Gastrostomy feeding complications are uncommon but include gastrocolic fistulae, paraesophageal hernia, and, in children on PD, postsurgical fungal peritonitis. There is also an increased risk of exit site infection and the necessity of dialysis catheter removal due to prolonged infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611429576">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611429576">16</xref></sup> According to several authors, PEG implantation, following PD onset, carries a high risk for peritonitis and potential PD failure, caused by the lack of adequate sealing between the stomach and the abdominal wall, resulting in peritoneal contamination with gastric contents and leading to fungal peritonitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611429576">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611429576">18</xref></sup> Bacterial peritonitis, occurring shortly after PEG insertion, occurred in one of our children, but there was no clear evidence that it was a direct PEG implantation-related consequence. That girl already had experienced 2 episodes of bacterial peritonitis in her past medical history. Nevertheless, von Schnakenburg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611429576">18</xref></sup> recognized some risk for fungal peritonitis after PEG insertion in patients on PD but not as high as suggested. This risk may be reduced if open, rather than percutaneous, surgery is carried out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611429576">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611429576">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, proper nutrition, including the application of PEG enteral feeding, is fundamental to maximize the growth potential and general physical development in pediatric patients with CKD and is one of the fundamental factors for most growth-retarded children with CKD to achieve normal body height in adult age.</p>
