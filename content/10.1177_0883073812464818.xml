<p>
<italic>A Color Handbook: Pediatric Neurology</italic> is a new soft-cover text for the primary care provider, including pediatricians, pediatric emergency physicians, family practice physicians, hospitalists, or physician assistants. The text aims to provide insight into the field of pediatric neurology, especially in light of the many recent advances in the area of medical imaging, metabolic diseases, and genetics. The authors are pediatric neurologists, and the book has contributions and input from pediatric geneticists, ophthalmologists, radiologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, and trainees.</p>
<p>The book is divided into 2 main sections. The first one is Core Concepts, which covers information to help with differential diagnosis and management. This section covers concepts including neuroradiology, electrophysiology, genetic and metabolic testing, cerebrospinal fluid testing for infectious disease, and neurotransmitters. The second section, A Problem-Based Approach to Pediatric Neurological Disorders, gives a signs and symptoms–based approach.</p>
<p>The main strengths of this book are its illustrations and tables that assist in making the concepts of neurology more approachable by simplification. There are clear text boxes for tables that are a quick summary of how to categorize topics. For example, in the neuroradiology section, there was a text box for different sequencing and when it may be useful to use. The images, especially in the electrophysiology section, seemed to be very helpful for a provider when explaining study results to parents. There are also diagnostic algorithms, such as the approach for developmental delay that can serve as a quick guide of basic steps for the primary care provider to take before the pediatric neurologist sees the patient. The chapter on newborn screening and metabolic testing had a contrasting set of tables—one that explains the reason and rationale for certain tests and the next table that shows what you may want to order based on certain clinical symptoms. This provides a nice way to give two approaches to simplify the complexity of metabolic testing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of this text primarily involve the second half of the book because of its simplicity at times and failure to mention some of the newer treatments. In the management sections, especially in the headache section, the authors do not highlight all of the newer treatments, such as the longer-acting triptans, and fail to mention some of the treatments that neurologists may use. Similarly, newer medicines used in the treatment of seizures and epilepsy were not mentioned. Also, there was no table of common side effects associated with the anticonvulsants, which could be very helpful for the primary care provider.</p>
<p>In summary, I think this illustrated guide for pediatric neurology has many positive features, including its ability to break difficult concepts down into easily grasped categories. <italic>A Color Handbook</italic> is a good text as an introduction to pediatric neurology for the primary care provider to initiate management of a patient prior to neurological evaluation.</p>
