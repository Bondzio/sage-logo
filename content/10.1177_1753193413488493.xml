<p>Carpal tunnel decompression (CTD) is the fourth most common orthopaedic procedure carried out in Scotland, and as such, is of major interest when delivering a healthcare system with waiting time targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413488493">Review of Orthopaedic Services, Audit Scotland, 2010</xref>). Lange describes a potential alternative to nerve conduction studies (NCS), traditionally an investigation with a long wait in the UK.</p>
<p>Lange’s article reports a high correlation between the cross-sectional area of the median nerve and diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). He postulates that an ultrasound scan may be useful in the first-line diagnosis of CTS, or in confirming the diagnosis if there is ambiguity on NCS. This concept is not new, but Lange carried out these tests as an orthopaedic trainee with previous experience in musculoskeletal imaging.</p>
<p>In today’s world it is increasingly standard practice to confirm a diagnosis with a test, prior to consideration of surgery. Is it, therefore, necessary to investigate CTS? We know from the literature that there is a high degree of correlation between the classical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel decompression (CTD), and positive nerve conduction findings. We also know that CTD, although a relatively safe procedure, can give rise to significant early morbidity from wound tenderness, and most patients require time off work following this procedure. A small proportion of patients have long-term problems with pillar pain. Given, then, that we are subjecting our patients to risk, it seems sensible to objectively document the CTS with a measurement that can be used, in particular, to help answer the question ‘What happens if I do not have surgery’?</p>
<p>Should this measurement be an ultrasound scan, as reported by Lange, or a traditional nerve conduction study (NCS)? There are many published studies that have examined the relationship between a specific questionnaire or test with the presence of CTS confirmed by NCS. If NCS are selected as the ‘gold standard’ with which comparisons are made, then the obvious solution is to have a local and efficient neurophysiology service. Ultrasound scan, however, as Lange points out, may be a useful tool in the absence of such a service, or as an adjunct to NCS.</p>
