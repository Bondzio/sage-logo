<abstract>
<p>Previous research has provided contradictory findings on how important it is for elderly patients to actively participate in the meeting with their doctors. Using descriptive and exploratory interview study with 20 elderly patients discharged from medicine and geriatric hospital care in Sweden, the authors describe how elderly patients experience their meetings with their doctor in the hospital setting. The results indicate that the meetings between elderly patients and doctors are influenced by the nature and shape of the conversation, which are influenced by power and interaction. A good relationship between an elderly patient and his or her doctor leads to reduced apprehension and increased faith in the health care system. This study was inspired by the sociocultural perspective and highlights the importance of the health care sector becoming a learning organization in which doctors are trained to prevent misunderstandings in their meetings with elderly patients.</p>

<body>
<p>In Swedish health care, great emphasis is laid on patients’ rights. There is growing demand that patients should receive information on their conditions and available treatment options so they can make informed choices and become involved in meetings with their doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027512436430">Larsson, Sahlsten, Sjostrom, Lindencrona &amp; Plos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027512436430">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0164027512436430">SFS, 1982</xref>:763; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0164027512436430">SOU, 1997</xref>:154).</p>
<p>Swedish legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0164027512436430">SFS 1982</xref>:763) requires that patients be actively involved in the health and medical care process. Despite this requirement, it has not followed that patients actually become involved in meetings with their doctors. Furthermore, the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027512436430">SFS 1998</xref>:54) stresses that care providers should be aware of patients’ inequality in relation to medical personnel and that personnel should behave in a manner inspiring confidence and involving patients in their care. Generally, patients want to hear and also respect their doctors’ advice and insights into their conditions and treatments; the meeting between patient and doctor is a “teachable moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027512436430">Godolphin, Towle, &amp; McKendry, 2001</xref>). Doctors may be poor at precisely assessing patients’ desire for information and involvement. Difficulties in communication are likely to appear when patients suffer from sensory deficits, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations, especially when the time available for information is limited (Adelman, Greene, &amp; Ory, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027512436430">Godolphin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0164027512436430">Robinson &amp; Thomson, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0164027512436430">
<title>Previous Research on Meetings Between Elderly Patients and Doctors</title>
<p>Medical interaction generally starts and ends with the communication between patient and doctor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027512436430">Bensing, 2000</xref>). Previous research has shown that how doctors provide information is more important for patients than the information itself. A meeting between an elderly patient and a doctor can be facilitated by, among other things, the doctor’s medical knowledge and interpersonal skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027512436430">Carlander, Eriksson, Hansson-Pourtaheri, &amp; Wikander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027512436430">David, Dugdale, Epstein &amp; Pantilat, 1999</xref>). Other studies have focused on trust and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0164027512436430">Scotti &amp; Stinerock, 2003</xref>), the patient’s active participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027512436430">Leard, Savides, &amp; Ganiats, 1997</xref>), the duration of the consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027512436430">Beisecker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027512436430">Greene, Adelman, Friedmann, &amp; Sharon, 1994</xref>), and the importance of the doctor clearly explaining the information provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027512436430">Teutsch, 2003</xref>). Other studies have focused on shortcomings in meetings between elderly patients and doctors. These studies discussed factors such as poor communication, a lack of attention to patients’ questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027512436430">Coe &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027512436430">Sator, Gstettner &amp; Hladschil-Kermer, 2008</xref>), and doctors’ body language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027512436430">Mast, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has provided contradictory findings on how important it is for elderly patients to actively participate in meetings with their doctors. Some studies have indicated that elderly patients would rather hand over responsibility to their doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027512436430">Pinguart &amp; Duberstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027512436430">Bastiaens, van Royen, Pavlic, Raposo, &amp; Baker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027512436430">Reed, Mikels, &amp; Simon, 2008</xref>), while others have found that elderly patients want to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027512436430">Kim, Healey, Goldstein, Hasher, &amp; Wiprzycka, 2008</xref>). One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027512436430">Eldh, Ehnfors, &amp; Ekman, 2006</xref>) showed that patients differed in their desire to participate. Another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0164027512436430">van der Brink-Muinen et al., 2006</xref>) found that the participation of elderly patients has not increased over time.</p>

<sec id="section3-0164027512436430">
<title>Theoretical Frame and Sociocultural Perspective</title>
<p>This study takes its starting point in sociocultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0164027512436430">Vygotsky, 1987</xref>), in which the relationship between thinking and communication is underlined. It is through communication that an individual comes in contact with and learns new ways of thinking, reasoning, and behaving. Thinking can be seen as an internal discussion that one carries out with oneself using language. The link between individuals and the world around them presupposes communication among individuals and is based on thought processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0164027512436430">Vygotsky, 1987</xref>). The health and hospital care sector is a hierarchically organized institutional system with socially established activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027512436430">Rogoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0164027512436430">Wertsch, 1998</xref>). This context is characterized by an asymmetric power and dependency relationship between patients and doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027512436430">Johanson, Larsson, Säljö, &amp; Svärdsudd, 1998</xref>). This asymmetry may influence the outcome of meetings between them. This means that the ability of patients to participate in meetings with their doctors depends on the sociocultural conditions. The collaboration between patient and doctor does not take place in a social vacuum. Health and hospital care takes place in a sociocultural context, which means that skills, insights, and knowledge are shaped by the prevailing cultural values. Health and hospital care can be seen as an institutional activity with its own values, ideas, and knowledge. How a meeting is understood and developed depends on the parties’ previous social and cultural experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0164027512436430">Vygotsky, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of elderly is increasing in Sweden. This puts more pressure on health care organizations. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0164027512436430">World Health Organization’s (2003)</xref> definition of elderly (aged 65 years and older) is used. In recent decades, studies have explored problems concerning patients’ participation in care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027512436430">Coe &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512436430">Direktiv, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027512436430">Sator et al., 2008</xref>). The results show that the majority of elderly patients want true dialogue with their doctors, including that doctors pay attention to patients’ questions, but that this is often not the case. Great efforts have been made in the past few years to clarify and strengthen the patient’s position in health care. Elderly patients’ situations are often made more complex by chronic physiological and psychosocial health problems. Many patients complain about poor handling by care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0164027512436430">Socialstyrelsen, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027512436430">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0164027512436430">2008</xref>). Patients and doctors initiate information, involvement and communication with different, even contradictory, perceptions, leading to misunderstandings and doubt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0164027512436430">Socialstyrelsen, 2003</xref>). How elderly patients experience meetings with doctors in the hospital setting is an important issue to clarify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0164027512436430">Socialstyrelsen, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to describe elderly patients’ experiences of meeting with their doctors in the hospital setting. The following research questions were investigated: What is of importance for the experience of the meeting? How is the meeting experienced by the elderly patient?</p>

<title>Design, Setting, and Subject of Study: A Descriptive and Explorative Interview Study</title>
<p>A qualitative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>) has been used to understand the meanings of meetings between elderly patients and their doctors taking place in social, cultural, and institutional contexts. This approach makes it possible to study people’s perceptions and experiences by letting the participants express them in their own words.</p>
<p>The data in this descriptive and explorative study are derived from interviews with elderly patients. The qualitative descriptive study approach is suitable when one wishes to obtain deeper knowledge about a phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027512436430">Polit &amp; Beck, 2006</xref>). The qualitative interview was deemed the most suitable method for data collection in this context, because interviewees are allowed to express themselves freely, enabling a study of individuals’ experiences and views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027512436430">Kvale, 1996</xref>). An interviewer and an elderly patient recently discharged from hospital care met face to face. The interviewer endeavored to understand the interviewee’s views and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027512436430">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>). Although the interview naturally entailed interaction between the two parties, its subject matter was the content, not the interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0164027512436430">
<title>Setting and Sampling</title>
<p>A selection of 20 elderly patients was deemed to give enough information about elderly patients’ experiences of meeting their doctors. Often studies interview fewer patients, so 20 interviewees is a relatively high figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027512436430">Fuller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027512436430">Hellström, Lindqvist, &amp; Mattsson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027512436430">Ishikawa, Roter, Yamazaki, &amp; Takayama, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027512436430">Barr &amp; Threlkeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0164027512436430">Sayers &amp; Bethell, 2004</xref>). They all lived in a large city in Sweden. The patients had to meet the following criteria: aged 65 years or older, Swedish speaking, capable of responding to questions individually, recently discharged from somatic hospital care specialized in geriatrics and medicine, and admitted to home care.</p>
<p>The manager of primary and home care services was contacted to obtain the names and telephone numbers of first-line nurse managers in home care, who provided names and numbers for home nurses. These nurses identified elderly patients who had recently been discharged from hospital care and transferred to home care. Informational letters were sent to the selected patients, and informed consent was obtained from all the interviewees, who received a written guarantee of confidentiality. Subsequently, each participant was contacted by phone to agree on a time for the interview. This study was approved by the appropriate research ethics committee of the Medical Faculty at Gothenburg University.</p>
<p>Of the 20 interviewees, 11 were women and 9 were men. Their ages ranged from 68 to 95 years. The average age was 80 (82 for women, 79 for men). The patients had one or more of the following conditions: urinary tract infection, pneumonia, dizziness, respiratory problems or chest pain, and cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0164027512436430">
<title>Data Collection Method</title>
<p>Open-ended interviews were carried out in the elderly patients’ homes to ensure a safe and reassuring setting and lasted 30 to 90 minutes. Each interview was conducted within 1 week of discharge from hospital and was recorded. The thematic interview guide covered four themes: (a) meeting the doctor, (b) expectations regarding information, (c) expectations regarding involvement, and (d) expectations regarding the meeting. The themes were not dealt with in any particular order. The interviewer listened actively throughout the interview, seeking to detect when the interviewees themselves spoke of issues related to the themes. When an interviewee initiated a theme, additional questions were asked. Only when an interviewee did not initiate a theme would the interviewer initiate the theme with relevant questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0164027512436430">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the recorded interviews was carried out in stages using manifest and latent content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0164027512436430">2006</xref>). In the first stage, all interviews were transcribed verbatim from recordings and read several times to obtain an overall view of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027512436430">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027512436430">Polit &amp; Beck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>). To gain a holistic view of the material, all interviews were read in their entirety. This overall reading confirmed the assumption that 20 interviews would provide enough information. Subsequently, meaning units (words, sentences, and/or expressions) used by the interviewees to describe phenomena relevant to the aim of the study were identified and marked. This concluded the manifest analysis. In the second stage, the meaning units were condensed. In the third stage, the meaning units were grouped in terms of content. From this, a pattern emerged, and the groups were given preliminary names. These groups were reduced or expanded as new aspects emerged during the continued work on the analysis, and themes, and within them subthemes, were identified and given suitable headings on the basis of their content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>). This concluded the latent analysis. Last, quotations representative of the themes and subthemes were selected to provide representative examples of interviewees’ answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027512436430">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027512436430">Polit &amp; Beck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>). Following this, the results (i.e., themes and subthemes) were analyzed using sociocultural theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0164027512436430">
<title>Credibility</title>
<p>Our background in nursing can be a force (i.e., we are familiar with the care environment and the position that is made in the health sector). This experience may be important in understanding and interpreting what elderly patients describe about meeting with their doctors. On the other hand, this experience may be known and be taken for granted, and this could in turn cause certain nuances to be lost. Therefore, efforts are constantly made to maintain a conscious and critical approach to understanding and what it can mean for the interviewer implementation and analysis of them.</p>
<p>The atmosphere during the interviews allowed the patients to be very frank and outspoken, which strengthens our interpretation that patients’ statements about their experiences of meeting with their doctors are both extensive and varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate data during the data collection phase, patients were given the opportunity to elaborate and to correct misunderstandings that had arisen during the interviews. These corrections were made after the researcher asked questions such as “Do you mean that . . . ?” and “Have I understood you correctly when I say . . . ?”</p>

<title>Communication Affects Perceptions of the Meeting</title>
<p>The nature of the communication between elderly patients and doctors depends on whether doctors allow patients to become involved in the discussion and let them ask questions. For elderly patients, it is crucial that doctors be aware of their body language. Elderly patients appreciate having an opportunity to get support from family members when meeting their doctors, because it might be difficult for them to choose between alternative treatments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0164027512436430">
<title>Importance of the Doctor’s Body Language</title>
<p>Elderly patients are sensitive to both doctors’ spoken message and to their body language. A doctor’s body language is an important factor in a meeting; good body language indicating understanding of the patient’s situation can promote an atmosphere of trust and help develop a sense of affinity with the patient. Elderly patients want their doctors to show interest in informing them. They focus on the situation and want help and advice to improve it. Elderly patients feel belittled when they are given information in passing. If the doctor does not take time to inform the patient, the latter may fear that his or her condition is being erroneously diagnosed and treated.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In a rush, no time to inform, too much to do. . . . Not enough doctors, they are burnt out and can’t cope. . . . No worthwhile information, they had so much to do. . . . His body language showed he was in hurry. (I1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0164027512436430">
<title>Information Was Understood With the Help of Relatives</title>
<p>With the help of their relatives, elderly patients can better understand their doctors’ information. For instance, the role of a relative may be to translate the medical and care-related terminology and expressions or to translate the patient’s life story for the doctor. This can provide safety and support for elderly patients in the difficult situations in which they find themselves. When a relative has knowledge about hospital care and hospital routines, this offers the elderly patient a greater sense of security with regard to his or her condition and in meeting with his or her doctor.

<title>Active Interaction Enhances Patient Understanding</title>
<p>Elderly patients feel that the doctor’s role is to encourage patients to become actively involved in meetings and show patients that they (patients) are the focus of attention. Patients believe that this will improve their own understanding of their lives and health situations, give them experience, and create new knowledge, thereby increasing their motivation and self-confidence.</p>

<title>Patients Are Interested in Shared Responsibility for Treatment</title>
<p>When elderly patients are hospitalized, they are in a foreign environment and feel that their doctors’ demeanor influences their experiences of communications. These communications include instructions and advice from doctors concerning both medical and pedagogical aspects of the patients’ situations. The medical aspect of communication concerns diagnoses and alternative treatments. The pedagogical aspect concerns how illnesses and symptoms can be handled. For an elderly patient to understand the instructions and advice provided by his or her doctor, the patient feels that there is a need for interaction between the parties. When an elderly patient is not given a chance to interact with the doctor, the patient feels that the relationship is asymmetric. The asymmetry consists of the patient’s needing information in the doctor’s possession. If the patient does not dare ask the doctor for explanations, this affects the patient negatively and leads to feelings of discomfort.</p>

<title>Power Relationships Make Patients Passive</title>
<p>According to the elderly patients’ statements, a doctor’s qualifications should include the ability to take into consideration a patient’s needs and situation. Elderly patients believe that the doctor’s role is to empathize with patients, to see patients as people, to take a genuine interest in patients, and to have a humanistic approach. This finding shows that a potential problem is that doctors do not always understand and see the situation through their patients’ eyes.</p>

<title>Health Care Organization Makes Patients Powerless</title>
<p>Often, patients are not familiar with the health care organization’s routines, which can make them feel powerless. Patients underlined factors such as time shortages, hospital routines, and rules.

<title>Patients Feel Subordinated to Their Doctors</title>
<p>The results show that elderly patients find themselves in a subordinated position. According to the patients, the medical profession is a respected one, and patients see doctors as powerful individuals belonging to a profession with power in society. This makes some patients feel that they cannot go against or be critical of their doctors. An elderly patient’s upbringing and social and cultural experiences affect his or her relationship with his or her doctor. According to the patients’ statements, some doctors may have an authoritarian demeanor, which makes patients uncomfortable and fearful of asking questions. This means that elderly patients are subordinated their doctors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to describe elderly patients’ experiences of meeting with their doctors in the hospital setting. The results show that elderly patients are dissatisfied with meetings with their doctors and that the reason for this may be that the two parties have differing views on the situation, the illness and the treatment. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö (2000)</xref>, this can be due to people’s acting and perceiving situations differently depending on their previous experiences. On the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö’s (2000)</xref> reasoning, this means that elderly patients and doctors come to these meetings carrying different experiences. Doctors have gathered experiences using language and their observations, reflections, and feelings from previous patient meetings. On the basis of these experiences, doctors have learned to interact with elderly patients and to widen and deepen their knowledge and perspectives. There is therefore a risk that elderly patients can perceive meetings negatively in cases in which doctors have not had experience developing relationships with such patients.</p>
<p>The elderly patients in this study who felt they had true dialogues (i.e., collaborative listening and discussing) with their doctors also felt more confident about the chosen treatments. One can therefore assume that all elderly patients need dialogue, at least when different forms of treatment are being discussed. Doctors should make use of patients’ knowledge about their illnesses during these dialogues.</p>
<p>This argument is in line with a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0164027512436430">Sayers and Bethell (2004)</xref>. Most of the patients in the study stated that doctors merely conveyed information and were poor at listening and discussing. This can be a result of the information transfer from doctor to elderly patient being one way and can be related to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027512436430">Linell (1999)</xref> described as a transmission model that disregards the mutuality in the conversation. Similar results have emerged in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027512436430">Braddock, Fihn, Levinson, Jonsen, &amp; Pearlman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027512436430">Delvaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027512436430">Ruiz-Moral, Perez Rodriguez, Perula de Torres, &amp; de la Torre, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Society expects doctors to create a safe and confidence-inspiring relationship with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027512436430">Holm, 2007</xref>). Elderly patients believe that doctors need interpersonal competence and ability to convey information. The patients in this study stated that meetings with their doctors were important for their feelings of participation in the situation but that they were not offered sufficient room to do so. They think that doctors should let them participate in meetings and also respect their right to self-determination. In this way, meetings can contribute to strengthening elderly patients’ position, which in the long run could improve and safeguard the quality of meetings with doctors and medical care.</p>
<p>Patients adapt to the prevailing culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027512436430">Säljö, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0164027512436430">Vygotsky, 1987</xref>). This may explain why patients underlined their subordinated position, which may make it difficult for them to make active choices concerning their medical care and treatment. It emerged that patients feel that the doctor’s knowledge contributes to making it difficult to contradict the doctor. This knowledge asymmetry can hamper the development of a trusting relationship. In other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027512436430">Johnsson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0164027512436430">Socialstyrelsen, 2008</xref>), it has emerged that doctors should be aware of the asymmetry in the relationship so that they treat elderly patients in a manner that inspires confidence and makes patients positive toward the health and hospital care.</p>
<p>How elderly patients understand the information received from their doctors depends on their familiarity with the health and hospital care environment. As a rule, it is doctors who dominate the institutional discussion. Doctors speak the most, take initiatives, summarize and end the discussion, and contribute the most strategic and important statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027512436430">Agar, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027512436430">Mishler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027512436430">Mäkitalo &amp; Säljö, 2002</xref>). Elderly patients who are familiar with the institutional setting find it easier to understand doctors’ information. This means that the health and hospital care organization should consider meetings between elderly patients and doctors as an important part of doctors’ duties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027512436430">Holmes-Rovner et al. (2000)</xref> argued that one way of improving the conditions for good relationships in meetings between elderly patients and doctors is to develop care programs providing comprehensive care instead of sending patients to and fro between clinics and wards. Similar results are underlined in other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027512436430">Naik, Schulman-Green, McCorkle, Bradley, &amp; Bogardus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027512436430">Quinn, Hudson, Ashby, &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027512436430">Reuben et al. (2009)</xref> found that the investment of extramural and institutional funds in geriatrics education substantially influenced undergraduate, graduate, and practicing physician education at Reynolds Foundation–supported schools.</p>
<p>Elderly patients find that staff shortages hamper positive meetings between them and their doctors. The hierarchical system of the health and hospital care organization may limit the room available for doctors’ development, especially considering that administrative duties have come to take such a large share of their time. One even comes across the view that the “experts” who control the health and hospital care organization have no understanding of the actual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027512436430">Pingel &amp; Robertsson, 1998</xref>). This means that the health and hospital care organization has been influenced by approaches and models taken from the private market, which have been neither adapted to nor accepted by the professional groups in the field of health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027512436430">Andersson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, it emerged that the conversation is central in the meeting between elderly patients and doctors. How patients experience the conversation is to a great extent determined by doctors’ demeanor. In the situation, a doctor’s body language is observed and interpreted by a patient and thereby influences the experiences and direction of the meeting. The interaction between patient and doctor is fundamental for there to be a mutual exchange of information. A doctor may either facilitate or hamper a patient’s ability to find time to speak and ask questions. By giving elderly patients a chance to express their situations, experiences, and insights about their life situations, one offers them an opportunity to be involved. However, elderly patients are not always offered this opportunity and instead feel powerless, because they do not perceive an opportunity to gain control over the situation. Health care routines and doctors’ authority make it difficult for elderly patients to get involved in their care. Power relationships and interaction during the conversation influence how meaning can be created in the meeting. When a doctor offers an elderly patient space to express his or her views and uses language the patient can understand, this contributes to creating understanding and meaning. Power and interaction affect how the conversation is shaped during a meeting and are therefore of importance for the ability of all parties to create meaning in the meeting. The dialogue is therefore the core of the meeting between an elderly patient and a doctor.</p>

<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>There were limitations to the researcher’s description of the interview informant’s experience, because at the time of the interview, the informant might not say what he or she wanted to say. Therefore, the informant’s words are always merely a fragmented picture of his or her experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>). This risk was minimized by letting the informants freely express their experiences of meetings with their doctors by providing opportunities to elaborate on statements and by asking follow-up questions to prevent misperceptions and misunderstandings to validate answers during the interviews.</p>
<p>The transcribed interviews were analyzed by the first author. From a perspective of reliability, this might be seen as a limitation. However, we do not claim in this study to provide any quantification of the findings. The interview text has been analyzed to gain understanding of the relatives’ experiences of the actual questions. The first author’s experience in elderly care nursing is expected to have facilitated the understanding of the often elderly informants’ expressions of meanings of involvement. It is unlikely that using a second analyzer would have strengthened the analysis. To offset the problem that analyzing an interview text always involves the analyzer’s interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027512436430">Silverman, 2001</xref>), and the fact that analysis might be influenced by the researcher’s prior understandings of the topics involved, we have judged the consistency of the results of the analysis. To strengthen the analysis, quotations from the interviews have been used to illustrate the results. To further test the validity and increase the clarity of the results, regular discussions about the data and the analysis method were held with the coauthors.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The main conclusion of the study is that doctors’ position of power makes it difficult for elderly patients to participate in meetings with their doctors. How successful the meeting between an elderly patient and a doctor will be depends on different factors, such as experience, attitude, perspective, and interpretations. It would be helpful if doctors had a patient-centered and humanistic attitude and translated medical terminology into language elderly patients can understand. To achieve collaboration between doctors and elderly patients and to allow patients to express themselves, doctors need to be aware of their body language and learn to acknowledge the questions elderly patients may have and consider their medical conditions and personalities in communication and when building relations.</p>
<p>A patient-centered perspective is needed, which means not only actively involving patients in their own care with their individual needs and preferences but respecting patients’ autonomy and points of view in decisions on medical care and improving the quality of meetings between patients and doctors. The health care sector needs to become a learning organization in which doctors are trained to prevent misunderstandings in their meetings with elderly patients. Future research could, for instance, focus on efforts to integrate geriatrics into the full curricula of medical schools.</p>
