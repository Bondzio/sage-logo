<abstract>
<p>In recent years there have been several culturo-criminal discursive shifts, which have oriented political and public concerns away from ‘real world’ sex crimes against children and the people most likely to commit them. These include the construction of the dangerous stranger as the primary threat to children; the widespread use of the terms ‘paedophile’ and ‘child pornography’ in the common lexicon and the placing of both the paedophile and pornography in virtual rather than real space. Such discourses not only fail to protect children, but may even work to fetishize youth and youthful bodies colluding with the widespread commercial sexualization of children. In the ‘cyber-paed’ the news media have created the monster of our age and orchestrated what some criminologists might term a moral panic about both ‘cyber’ and ‘paeds’. This has occurred in a culture that, simultaneous with the castigation and outrage of the ‘cyber-paed’, routinely sexually objectifies children and infantilizes women to sell products, or pleasure as product; a culture that also largely ignores the evidence that most sexual crime against children happens in families. This article explores the contradictions and deflections inherent in contemporary constructions of sexuality and childhood and assesses the panic about paedophiles in cyber-space.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712459314" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the late 1990s, culturo-criminal discursive shifts have oriented political, policing and public concerns away from ‘real world’ sexual abuse of children, usually by male family members. Instead there has been an emphasis on the threat posed by strangers, the dangerousness of public spaces, the failure of the law to protect children from sex offenders released into the community and the new monster of our age, the ‘paedophile’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712459314">1</xref></sup> This rather narrowly conceived framework followed a small number of high-profile cases of child abduction, rape and murder in the 1990s and 2000s (including that of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in 2000) and the introduction in 1997 of a national sex offenders register containing the details of anyone convicted, cautioned or released from prison for a sexual offence against children or adults. Since then, the media have continued to play a significant role in public perceptions and policy directives, leading to child sexual abuse being described as ‘the most significant moral panic of the last two decades’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712459314">Jewkes, 2004</xref>: 94). The construction, in media discourses and policy initiatives, of child sexual abuse as a crime perpetrated by strangers – typically paedophiles snatching unsupervised children from public spaces – was also instrumental in changing patterns of social interaction and reorganizing middle-class childhood, as children were equipped with computers and other communications technologies to create safe home-based entertainment. As childhood became an increasingly privatized experience concerns were voiced about children and young people’s vulnerability in cyberspace, and new threats emerged in the form of technologically savvy paedophiles and online ‘groomers’.</p>
<p>Anxieties about ‘stranger danger’ and the application of technologically deterministic characteristics to the internet have positioned both the ‘paedophile’ and pornography involving child victims in virtual rather than real space; a shift which has had three somewhat perverse consequences. First, relocating child sexual abuse to the virtual realm problematizes public understanding as information sources struggle to explore the phenomenon: police lack the technological understanding to detect and investigate; journalists lack ‘legal’ access to the problem itself and global cultural and legal differences and complexities impede identification and prosecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712459314">Jewkes and Andrews, 2007</xref>). Second, positioning child sexual abuse as a ‘virtual’, technology-enabled offence (even when perpetrated in ‘real time’) removes it from the domestic setting, leaving the norm of sexual abuse within the family so low down on the news agenda as to render it almost invisible. Third, the positioning of child sexual abuse in the remote and intangible sphere of cyberspace deflects from the everyday sexualization of children in numerous cultural forms and works to maintain widespread public tolerance toward that. Anxiety around ‘cyber-paeds’ has become a smokescreen diverting attention from the real sites of sexual harm to children: men in paternal/familial settings and a socio-economic context that constructs children as sexually desirable. This article explores these phenomena as interconnected and, in view of criminologists’ enduring commitment to the concept, assesses the value of moral panic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712459314">Cohen, 1972</xref>) as a means of understanding them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712459314">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712459314"><title>The emergence of the ‘paedophile’</title>
<p>From the 1960s western sex liberationists promoted sexual freedom largely through feminist and gay activism, both of which movements took issue with the <italic>monogamic conjugal cell</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712459314">Foucault, 1979</xref>) of the heterosexual family. In 1967 the Sexual Offences Act in the UK finally decriminalized consenting sex in private between two men over the age of 21 years, despite the age of consent for heterosexuals being 16, leading to an immediate struggle to lower it by gay activists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712459314">Angelides (2005)</xref> argues that the discursive alignment of paedophile with child sexual abuse emerged during the 1970s as a consequence of both consent arguments and the perceived sanctity of marriage. This placed child sexual abuse firmly at the door of the ‘dangerous stranger’ and/or the gay man,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712459314">3</xref></sup> rather than with the most likely perpetrator the ‘father figure’. This backlash against sexual liberation placed the paedophile on the news agenda and by the 1990s missing children, abduction and assault narratives had become recurring themes in news and television drama in the UK, Europe and USA. There were several catalysts for the propulsion of the paedophile into the global public consciousness. The UK press revealed that several ‘halfway houses’, accommodating sex offenders released from prison, were situated close to schools and playgrounds. At the same time, cases came to light of child sexual abuse in residential child-care homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712459314">Barter, 2003</xref>). In Northern Ireland (and, latterly in Italy) priests were accused of sexual offences against children, which fuelled accusations of high-level cover-ups within the Catholic Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712459314">Greer, 2003</xref>). The arrest and conviction of former British pop star Gary Glitter for downloading images of sexual abuse of children on his computer (he later served a three-year sentence in Vietnam for actual sexual offences against children) resulted in headlines including ‘Beast raped me aged 8’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363460712459314"><italic>News of the World</italic>, 1999</xref>) and ‘Monster masquerading under the mask of glam rock’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712459314"><italic>Daily Mail</italic>, 1999</xref>) and precipitated several other cases involving ‘celebrity paedophiles’ (NB This article was written before the Jimmy Savile case, described by the Metropolitan Police as a watershed moment in child abuse investigations, was reported). In the autumn of 1996, Marc Dutroux, a released paedophile was charged with a series of child murders in Belgium with accusations of a cover-up, involving politicians, police and civil servants. In the USA, ‘Megan’s Law’ was created in 1996, giving parents access to information on paedophiles living nearby, following the rape and murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka by a twice-convicted sex offender living in her street.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712459314">4</xref></sup> By the time of Sarah Payne’s abduction and murder, in the UK by a previously convicted child sex offender in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363460712459314">Pank, 2001</xref>), cases were being reported in the popular media as if to indicate some kind of child molester pandemic with calls for a ‘Sarah’s Law’ publicizing names and addresses of sex offenders. The fact that most children who are sexually abused are, and always have been, assaulted by a man known to them was lost or neglected in the coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712459314">5</xref></sup> Simply, the media persisted in peddling the myth that children are most at risk from strangers.</p>
<p>The reporting, as if new, of an old phenomenon is familiar territory to criminologists who continue to test the validity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712459314">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> moral panic model in relation to media reporting of crime and deviance. The origins of almost all contemporary moral panics go back a considerable length of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363460712459314">Pearson, 1983</xref>) and the sexual abuse and sexualization of children is no exception. In England, there was no law against incest until 1908 and indeed in some societies in earlier times, sexual relations ‘between adult males and pubescent girls have been considered perfectly acceptable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712459314">Jones, 1998</xref>: 384). In the Victorian era, erotic images of children in both art and the new medium of photography were relatively common among collectors and semi-clothed children featuring in early advertising such as for Pears’ soaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712459314">Higgonet, 1998</xref>) evidently caused no public furore. The contemporary criminological concern with the trafficking of girls and young women from eastern Europe to the UK to work in the sex trade also has parallels with Victorian England when newspapers reported that English girls as young as 10 were being abducted and sold to brothel owners in Paris and Brussels for the enjoyment of wealthy clients. A press campaign against child prostitution eventually resulted in the age of consent being raised from 13 to 16.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712459314">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet despite historical and contemporary evidence, most actual child sexual abuse barely makes the news because it happens within the private sphere of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712459314">Saraga, 2001</xref>). Moreover ‘ordinary’ abuse does not resonate with media audiences: it grates, it transgresses cultural ideals. In the UK, ‘ordinary’ familial sexual abuse of children has barely featured in the news since the furore in Cleveland in 1987 when two paediatricians diagnosed sexual abuse in 121 children from 57 families in the area. Most of the children were removed from their homes under place of safety orders, yet it was not fathers that were the focus of attention and blame, but diagnosing doctors and social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712459314">Campbell, 1988</xref>). In the few exceptional cases of familial abuse and incest that have been reported since this time, there is little that can be said to be ‘ordinary’ about either the events or the reporting of them. The best-known case is that of Austrian Josef Fritzl who confined his daughter in an underground chamber for over 24 years, raped her and fathered seven children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363460712459314">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>). The fact that the crimes took place in Austria permitted the British press to present Fritzl in terms of his ‘otherness’ as ‘Incest Monster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363460712459314">Paterson, 2010</xref>) with Nazi associations. Far less detail was published about a 2009 case in the UK, when a 56-year-old Sheffield man was convicted of raping his two daughters who had 19 pregnancies between them. He was simply referred to by newspapers as the ‘British Josef Fritzl’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712459314">Irvine, 2008)</xref>, underlining Fritzl’s perversely iconic status and yet again deflecting from patriarchal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712459314">7</xref></sup> sexual abuse within the family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712459314"><title>The (curious) linking of paedophilia and the internet</title>
<p>A further consequence of the continuing prominence of paedophiles and ‘stranger danger’ in the public imagination may be partly causal of a reorganization of childhood and adolescent experience. Children (or, more accurately, the children of the middle classes) are subjected to a greater degree of protective control and regulation than at any time previously. A morbid expectation that something terrible might happen to one’s children has resulted in ‘paranoid parenting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712459314">Furedi, 2008</xref>). Today’s child rearing is no longer about managing the risks of everyday life but of avoiding them altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712459314">Furedi, 2008</xref>). The increasing tendency for parents to accompany their children in all public spheres coincided with the rapid emergence of the internet and new technologies. Together, these new social trends constituted a profound change in the way that young people’s identities are shaped and social skills learned. Adventure is for many children now a virtual pleasure; competitiveness is honed at the games consul rather than on the sports field, and sexual development occurs in chat rooms, on social networking sites and via mobile phones.</p>
<p>The extent to which pleasure and leisure have become privatized is illustrated by the finding that by 2005, 94% of young people were going online from home, with most having multiple points of access, including from their mobile phones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712459314">Haste, 2005</xref>). According to media regulator Ofcom, by 2008, 35% of children aged 12–15, and 16% of children aged between 8 and 11, had internet access in their bedrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712459314">Social Trends, 2009</xref>). Social networking sites such as Bebo, MySpace, Twitter and Facebook have led a revolution in how young people communicate and interact with each other. In 2009 Facebook was used by 72% of 11–15 year olds, 80% of 17–25 year olds, and 83% of those who are currently at, or who have already been to university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712459314">Magee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As these forces came together – that is, the growing fear of predatory paedophiles, the privatization of social interaction and the exponential rise of mobile digital communications – a common media discourse linking the predatory stranger with the internet as sources of danger to children emerged. To return to Gary Glitter, not only did the press consistently label him as ‘sicko’, ‘paedo’, ‘pervert’, ‘depraved’ and ‘evil’, but accounts played into emerging cultural anxieties about cyberspace and enabled powerful headlines such as Twisted Secrets of the Web (The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363460712459314"><italic>Sun,</italic> 1999</xref>) and Who is Policing the Internet? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712459314"><italic>Daily Mirror</italic>, 1999</xref>). In a typically hysterical editorial, <italic>Daily Mail</italic> columnist Lynda Lee-Potter claimed:<disp-quote>
<p>Paedophiles are cunning, devious, ruthless and incurable … Police officers and social workers are forced to protect men who only want to defile unformed bodies. <italic>Through the Internet, their numbers are growing and their sick desires are being inflamed.</italic> (Date unknown; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712459314">Critcher, 2002</xref>: 531, our emphasis)</p></disp-quote>Put simply, then, escalating cultural anxieties about new communication technologies relocated abuse from <italic>strangers</italic> in the parks and on street corners to <italic>cyber-paeds</italic> in virtual worlds, both, of course, being deflections away from ‘fathers’ and homes. Despite the fact that in the UK the Protection of Children Act 1978 prohibited the production and distribution of indecent images of children years before the World Wide Web came into existence, computer-mediated child sexual abuse became high profile in media reporting, with an emphasis very much on the technology. For example, when reporting the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre’s (CEOP) successful prosecution of self-styled ‘Son of God’, Timothy Cox, who was running a paedophile ring from his parent’s home in Suffolk, journalists reported that Cox’s own hard drive contained thousands of images of children; he had disseminated 11,491 images to other site users. Reports further emphasized the technology by describing chatrooms, webcams, pay-per-view, p-2-p, downloads, online aliases, encryption and the ‘ghostly glow of the computer screen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363460712459314">Townsend, 2007</xref>). The children, by contrast, were peripheral to the narratives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460712459314"><title>Parents and paedophiles: Mutually exclusive categories?</title>
<p>In all the news coverage of Timothy Cox’s paedophile ring, just two sentences in The <italic>Observer</italic> newspaper underlined why there had been no outcry about the children featured in Cox’s live web-cam sites: ‘The truth is they were never missing. The babies and children ritually abused via web-cam were rescued from their own homes’ (<italic>Observer</italic>, 2007). Yet there is no critical discussion of this and the same newspaper reports, again without critical comment, on ‘restricted Scotland Yard documents’ showing that Britain's child abusers are usually white males aged between 36 to 45 years and in a long-term relationship, married and/or have children. Similarly, the raid on the infamous Wonderland paedophile ring (that resulted in the police operation ‘Ore’) revealed the global spread of online sexual abuse of children with arrests being made across the UK, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the USA. All of the children involved were under 16 and in one case the child was only three months. More than 1,263 children were featured in the pictures but only a very few were identified – six in the UK, seven in the USA, one in Portugal, one in Chile, and one in Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712459314"><italic>BBC news</italic>, 2001</xref>). The images found on computers led to calls for an international database of missing children, thus ignoring the evidence that most children are abused at home and so are not ‘missing’ children.</p>
<p>This absence in reporting is because news ‘simplifies’ events and constructs a mediated vision of crime with no shades of grey, just an incontestable message. News reporting tends to formulate events within a context that emphasizes good versus evil, folk heroes and folk devils, black against white, guilty or innocent, ‘normal’ or ‘dangerous’ and so on. Such polarized frameworks of understanding result in the construction of mutually exclusive categories; hence, parents (good) cannot also be paedophiles (bad), which, regardless of race or nation, prevents a construction of families as sites of sexual danger for children. Yet, family life is far from the ideal(ized) state promoted by politicians and the media. While reliable statistics are hard to find, most academic researchers and government agencies support Childline’s estimate that 95% of child victims of sexual and physical violence know their abuser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712459314">Grubin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1363460712459314">Thomas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Paedophilia and incest occur not just in families but also in close community environments that are also often strongly patriarchal. Established religions such as the Catholic Church provide abusers with the authority to cover their activities and protect them from public exposure, but non-traditional religions and cults have also involved sexual abuse of children. Paedophile cult leaders invent theological justifications for their sexual predilections. Dwight York, leader of a cult called the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, was convicted of 197 offences in Georgia in 2002, including the sexual molestation of 13 children aged between 4 and 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1363460712459314">Wilson, 2000</xref>). Generally family-like organizations with structures that embody a phallocentric group orientation and place great emphasis on religion/belief, culture, patriarchy and age-associated status, not only nurture dependency along those lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363460712459314">Segal, 1999</xref>), but can also foster secrecy around socially taboo practices hiding the practices and deflecting attention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, child sexual abuse exists globally regardless of the presence of new communication technologies. In remote Indigenous communities in Australia, better telephone services are of a higher priority than internet access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363460712459314">Smillie-Adjarkwa, 2005</xref>) yet in some of these communities there are high trends of child abuse, with children being exposed to pornography and then oddly being implicated in their own abuse: ‘Indigenous children are acting out what they have seen in pornographic material’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712459314"><italic>ABC news</italic>, 2007</xref>), with some as young as 5 years old testing positive for sexually transmitted diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712459314"><italic>BBC News</italic>, 2007</xref>). In recent years the incidence and impact of child sexual abuse have also been increasingly recognized in Asian communities, especially those originating from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh with offenders being most likely to be male family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712459314">Gilligan with Akhtar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712459314">Moghal et al., 1995</xref>). Yet media coverage of child sexual abuse in Asian communities, including those based in the UK, is negligible because of the extreme ‘taboo’ and ‘hidden’ nature of the issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712459314"><title>Cultural hypocrisy and the ambiguity of childhood ‘innocence’</title>
<p>Yet, as noted earlier, despite global and historical prevalence and pre-existence, the paedophile was ‘discovered’ only in the 1990s. Through derogatory labelling, the news media perpetuated the belief that paedophiles are a separate species, a breed apart. That reinforced the theme of ‘stranger danger’ but also moved child sex abuse outside of any framework linked to adult male heterosexuality and the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363460712459314">Kitzinger, 1996</xref>) relegating it to an extreme end of a continuum of deviant behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363460712459314">Taylor and Quayle, 2003</xref>). Moreover the discovery coincided with the rapid growth of the internet and offending was quickly associated with mysterious, virtual websites, chat-rooms and networks rather than the real, familiar domestic and private settings.</p>
<p>Yet this construction of the ‘paedophile’ as sub-human, abnormal, secretive, cyber and not ‘of’ society, sits uncomfortably within a culture which, in other arenas, such as fashion, beauty and art, fetishizes youthful bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712459314">Greer and Jewkes, 2005</xref>). In these commercial arenas, not only are young girls encouraged to act like mature, sexually active women, but adult women are objectified, reconstructed and commoditized via fashion, dieting and cosmetics to appear as little girls. As Adler observes, ‘we are enthralled – anguished, enticed, bombarded – by the spectacle of the sexual child’ (2001: 209). The ‘paedophilia of everyday life’, a phrase Mohr (1999) has coined, is everywhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sexualization of children by commercial outfits, or ‘corporate paedophilia’ as it has been termed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363460712459314">Rush and La Nauze, (2006a)</xref> is pervasive in western nations where (often partially clothed) children emulating adults are routinely used to sell products and aspirations. Rush and La Nauze, were so concerned as to call for bringing ‘all media regulation under one statutory system’ (2006b: 6) Examples include an image promoting Armani's Junior range of children's clothes in 2004 that sparked 74 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712459314">Hiscott, 2004</xref>). That advert was withdrawn before the ASA made its decision but, in another case, the ASA ruled that images used by clothing company Jack Wills, including one of a young looking girl lying on a bed wearing only knickers and with one of her breasts visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712459314"><italic>BBC News</italic>, 2009</xref>) were neither offensive nor overtly sexual. An online interview with one of the female models used in the catalogue reveals how young she was and the target audience of the advertising: ‘Jack wills wasnt my first shoot, i started modelling when i was 13,… we all got the catalogues sent through to our boarding houses [sic]’ (The Tribe, n.d.).</p>
<p>Premature sexualization of youth is also evident in many inappropriate products aimed at very young children. Stores have been criticized for, among other things, selling lingerie, adult style ‘toys’ and T-shirts carrying suggestive messages such as ‘So many boys so little time’, sold by high-street store Next to girls in the 5–9 age bracket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712459314">Fernandez, 2006</xref>). In the same year the big international retailer Tesco removed a ‘£50 pole-dancing kit’ from its toy departments in the face of public condemnation and political pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712459314">Fernandez, 2006</xref>). In 2010, chain store Primark was forced to withdraw a child’s bikini featuring a padded bra after <italic>Mumsnet</italic> initiated a campaign described by the liberal <italic>Guardian</italic> as ‘organised moral outrage’ by a ‘faux-feminist family values brigade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712459314">Penny, 2010</xref>). The article discussed children’s need to experiment sexually but still didn’t manage to point out the sexual dangers of the family.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of culturally endorsed images of youthful bodies and the emergence of the internet as a form of social retreat, children and teenagers, denied many of the freedoms enjoyed by their parents and grandparents in their own youth, are finding that social networking sites provide certain liberties quite unlike anything they have at their disposal in the physical world. In turn, this may encourage young people to engage in more ‘extreme’ behaviours than they would in the ‘real’ world; for example, any rudimentary trawl of social network sites reveals numerous revealing pictures of girls apparently aged 15 and 16 posted by themselves. The willingness of the young to take risks with their online activities is highlighted with alarming frequency in the popular media with several reported cases of bullying and even suicide following the circulation of images sent by young women to their boyfriends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363460712459314">Meacham, 2009</xref>) and intended for their eyes only (a phenomenon coined ‘sexting’).</p>
<p>A further ambiguity in notions of childhood ‘innocence’ lies in the fact that while child sexuality is the subject of concern in many countries, the legal and cultural definitions of ‘child’ are not uniform and in countries where legislatively there is an age of consent it typically varies between 12 and 18 years, making any generalizable model of abuse impossible to formulate. In addition, pornography involving children has not always been universally prohibited. For example, in Holland pornographic imagery of children was commercially produced until the death of a 6-year-old from cocaine during a photography session in 1984 prompted legislative change and heralded more stringent controls in other sexually liberal countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363460712459314">Taylor and Quayle, 2003</xref>). All of this suggests very contradictory discourses of childhood sexuality at work, which on the one hand celebrate, excite, promote and enable children’s exploration and enjoyment of their own sexuality whilst simultaneously working effectively to merchandise goods. Yet these legal, liberal, commercial and cyber contexts provide titillation for audiences and markets, perhaps legitimating, for some, child sexual abuse. Indeed it might be argued that asking children to pose ‘attractively’ for advertising and enjoying looking at those images is just the soft end of a continuum of abuse. Yet, frequently the ‘panic’ seems to be more focused on representations of sexual abuse of children than either actual real harm or the socio-economic culture that depends on both legal sexual representations and the whole illegal area of the sale of sex – real and represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712459314">Jeffreys, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The presumed causal link between sexual images and contact offences at the heart of panics around child abuse ‘remains unclear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363460712459314">Taylor and Quayle, 2003</xref>: 74). Most available information comes from clinical studies of convicted offenders and studies of current users/abusers are extraordinarily rare, not only because gaining access to them is difficult, but because it is against the law to seek and view ‘evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363460712459314">Kincaid, 1998</xref>). In fact, there is a ‘stunning lack of available information on the current realities of child porn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2001</xref>: 10) and even less on the extent of child sexual abuse that is involved to produce it, let alone who perpetrates such violations. In the USA the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712459314">Internet Safety Technical Taskforce (2008)</xref> has claimed that the increased popularity of the internet has not been correlated with an overall increase in reported sexual offences. In addition, in January 2009 the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University concluded that there is not a significant problem and that the reality of online grooming runs counter to popular accounts of the dangers.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more certain is that the news media have played a significant role in public perceptions, and even policy directives such as the Sexual Offences Act 2003 that includes online grooming, by representing child sexual abuse as a serious and extreme problem of cyberspace rather than a common occurrence in familial organizations. ‘Ordinary’ abuse challenges consensual ideas of the family, security, childhood and fathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363460712459314">Wykes and Welsh, 2009</xref>), but the construction of the child sexual abuser as, not a family member at home but, first, the stranger in dangerous places, and then the cyber-paed in virtual space, has multiple outcomes. Foremost, it makes the topic less uncomfortable as it feeds into a familiar stereotype and enables the public to disassociate themselves from the individual described: the unseen, unknown predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712459314">Ashenden, 2002</xref>). In addition, the construction of the dangerous stranger who once hovered outside school gates but now surfs the net perpetuates the notion that paedophiles are loners, strangers, even sexually abnormal geeks, who use the intimate, ‘clubby’ atmosphere of cyberspace to seek out likeminded others and justify or ‘neutralize’ their behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712459314">Jewkes and Andrews, 2007</xref>). Such accounts leave intact the very institutions so often actually implicated in child sexual abuse – the family, patriarchy and male heterosexuality – because they do not critically engage with the part they play in the crimes reported. Further, the construction of the paedophile as a shadowy figure lurking in cyberspace avoids any real risk to the essential structures of society and closes down aetiological inquiry. At one and the same time, then, moral panics over the paedophile and the internet have perpetuated the notion that sexual dangerousness resides in strangers (‘them’, not ‘us’), takes place in peculiar ‘chatrooms’ not homes and can be attributed to new communications technologies not powerful social structures.</p>
<p>Such a focus has a number of practical and policy implications. It gives a statistically false impression that the public sphere is unsafe and the private sphere is safe. It influences decisions about the prioritization of resources towards very visible preventative measures, such as funding the Internet Watch Foundation and legislating to ensure that internet service providers (ISPs) protect users and block insecure sites. It mobilizes discourses of otherness and dangerousness to legitimate government initiatives to control and monitor communications technologies with implications for all our personal freedoms, privacies and human rights. Most serious perhaps, while the focus of politicians, policy-makers, the police and the law is on surveillance tactics, legislative controls, data access, invasions of privacy and even miscarriages of justice, resources are being directed away from initiatives such as Child Protection Units with the result of actually putting children at risk.</p>
<p>Another consequence of the panic is misidentification. In the early 2000s, several vigilante-style attacks on suspected paedophiles were reported, including an infamous and ignorant attack on the house of a paediatrician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712459314">Allison, 2000</xref>). Moreover, 35 people questioned during Operation Ore in the UK committed suicide and several news commentators have questioned whether these individuals were not paedophiles but the victims of identity theft via stolen credit cards. As a report in The <italic>Telegraph</italic> bluntly put it: ‘It's not easy to think of many things that are worse than being convicted of a paedophile offence when you are innocent of that ghastly crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363460712459314">Palmer, 2009</xref>). Such sensibilities may leave people unable to report misuse of their card to the credit company or to the police for fear of being implicated in illegal online use. Thus the cyber-paed ‘panic’ is not only deflecting from those most likely to offend against children but could also be deflecting attention from other online crime such as identity theft and fraud.</p>
<p>Why then does society collectively collude with the idea of ‘stranger danger’, when we are all too aware that most children will be abused by someone they know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712459314">Jewkes and Andrews, 2007</xref>)? Part of the explanation may be that most of us are ‘informed’ about child sexual abuse by the mainstream media and in practice very few of us experience or witness sexual violence first-hand; indeed only about 1% of recorded crimes are sexual offences in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460712459314">Home Office, 2006–2007</xref>). However, the reluctance on the part of journalists, and the wider public for whom they write, to acknowledge the reality of abuse perpetrated mainly by men within the family or pseudo family reflects a powerful emotional and intellectual block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712459314">Greer, 2003</xref>) evidenced perhaps in the way that child sexual abuse (even in articles such as this) is described in terms that rarely include the words ‘incest’ or ‘rape’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363460712459314"><title>Moral panic: Theorizing the ‘cyber-paed’</title>
<p>Thinking about the ‘panic about cyber-paeds’ raises questions not just about sexual crimes against children and the cultural and policy impacts of contemporary accounts of those but also the role and voice of criminologists in addressing these subjects. Certainly the high temperature of press and public opinion about paedophiles evokes the phrase ‘moral panic’ both in the news and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712459314"><italic>Guardian</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712459314">Marsh and Melville, 2009</xref>) but is it a useful criminological motif to employ in relation to the topic? Certainly its appropriateness is contestable and indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins (2009)</xref> argues that online child pornography is a <italic>potential</italic> moral panic that has failed to materialize. This, he argues, is partly because online child pornography is a real and significant problem as opposed to a largely exaggerated one, as characterized in the original concept of moral panic. But because law enforcement agencies have weak technological competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712459314">Jewkes and Andrews, 2007</xref>) and because journalists can neither access online child pornography (which is skilfully encrypted as well as illegal to download), nor reproduce it in newspapers if they did, there is little evidence to actually report. In the cyber context, perpetrators often remain unknown so there are no actors to vilify, whilst investigative efforts are long and dull and take place in a context – that of cyber-paed chatrooms – that is mysterious and unfamiliar to audiences. Consequently, the problem remains largely invisible to both public and police and has failed to generate enough attention to qualify for moral panic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While we are in broad agreement about the practical and legal obstacles hampering the search (by police, journalists and academic researchers alike) for evidence of online abuse, our hypothesis differs from that of Jenkins in several respects. First, Jenkins’ discussion is focused on the product (pornography) of the crime (child sexual abuse) rather than the <italic>criminals/deviants</italic> that are the usual focus of moral panic theory. The claim for internet-facilitated child sexual abuse as moral panic has more currency when the paedophile and the internet are the focus of the analysis not the representations; indeed focusing on the representations merely colludes with the obfuscating constructions of journalism. Second, we maintain that online child sexual abuse conforms to classic moral panic theory in several important respects that are underplayed in Jenkins’ analysis. In Cohen’s (1972) model, a moral panic will comprise a threat to societal values that can be readily stereotyped by the media and moralized over by ‘right-thinking people’ who demand action to contain or control it. It may be a new phenomenon, an established threat that is suddenly made visible, or a problem that is represented as much more pervasive than it actually is and in ways that are neither sober nor realistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712459314">Hall et al., 1978</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1363460712459314">Young (2009: 4)</xref> moral panics are rooted in ‘significant structural and value changes’ and are ‘trigger points in transformations’, grounded in fear and dislike. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712459314">Critcher considers ‘risk discourses within a process of moral regulation’ (2009: 17)</xref> as essential constituents of moral panic.</p>
<p>The mysterious, invisible, all-pervasive qualities of cyberspace enable all manner of mythologizing and obfuscation but also allow old behaviour to be represented as a new, more significant threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712459314">Hall et al., 1978</xref>). The internet also enables a major aggrandizement of the problem because of the pervasiveness of its reach, representational qualities and uncontrollable borders. In addition, the cyber-paed has been operationalized at a time of significant social change. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1363460712459314">Young’s (2009)</xref> account of moral panic, a climate of ‘fear and dislike’ has arisen as a result of massive demographic shifts for economic and security reasons: there has been an intensification of distrust of ‘others’; traditional family patterns have eroded in the West alongside an increasing gulf between rich and poor; gender roles and values are in flux; and new technologies are increasingly the foci of work, education, information and pleasure. Cyber-discourses dominate communication and our dependence on them, and general ignorance of the technology that supports them provoke anxiety about what might happen, legitimating the morally regulating discourses that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712459314">Critcher (2009)</xref> recognizes. These are perhaps particularly strong because the potential for legal regulation of the internet is so specious and speculative because of its transcendence of all nation states. In these senses, then, the ‘cyber-paed’ qualifies as a topic constitutive of moral panic construction. He is a threat to societal values particularly those of childhood innocence, family cohesion and sanctity, and home as a private and secure space. He can readily be stereotyped as the dangerous stranger beloved by the news, not only violating children but undermining parental control and authority. He also comes from an ‘alien and essentially hostile place rather than in our own backyards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712459314">Hall et al., 1978</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>However while it is interesting to debate the appropriate theoretical terminology to apply to inflammatory discourses linking the internet and the paedophile, such criminological reflection only continues to highlight aspects of human life presented by journalists and originating from the police, criminal justice system and politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712459314">Franklin, 1997</xref>). In other words, simply theorizing the risks represented continues the panic and is complicit with the discourses of moral regulation. In a riposte to such criminological naval gazing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712459314">Cohen (2002)</xref> suggests that the question we should ask ourselves is not why Topic A generates a moral panic but why Topic B does <italic>not</italic>. For the purposes of this article we might ask why has cyber-paedophilia become such a focus of attention while real-world sexual violation of children by those who know them, on whom they depend and whom they should be able to trust, has not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1363460712459314"><title>Summary and concluding thoughts</title>
<p>The argument underpinning this article is that our fears of crime and concerns for personal safety – especially the safety of our children from strangers – have been exaggerated and exacerbated by media hyperbole with consequences detrimental to the late-modern experience of childhood. The mediated construction of sexual abuse of children leaves intact the very institutions so often implicated in those crimes – the family, patriarchy and male heterosexuality – because journalists do not critically engage with the part these institutions play in sexual crimes against children. Paedophiles are characterized as sexually abnormal outsiders who seek out like-minded others via the internet, while the technology is frequently represented as if causal of the crime. The journalistic focus on dangerous strangers is diversion enough but in many ways the turn to ‘cyber’ is more insidious as it treats mediatized representations more seriously than offending realities, diverts attention and resources away from real crime, and legitimates significant attempts to control and monitor new communications technologies with implications for the personal freedoms, privacies and human rights of all of us.</p>
<p>Naturally, this leaves us with what might be termed the ‘zero sum’ problem. There is a danger that in order to highlight the reality of child abuse we appear to diminish or ignore the extent of internet paedophilia. That is not our intention; both are real crimes and authentic social problems. To reiterate, then, our aim is to highlight the current cultural tendency to represent child abuse as a problem of cyberspace rather than, and as if there was an absence of, occurrences in familial settings. In some instances, of course, it can be both, as with cases of paedophiles who target vulnerable women in order to abuse their children and post images of the abuse online. In these circumstances, the perpetrator is initially outside the family and then becomes part of it and the abuse is located both within the private sphere and in cyberspace. Nor are we suggesting that the deflection of interest and policy from ‘real-life’ abuse to cyber abuse is the result of a conspiracy. Intention and consequence are not necessarily the same and, as with any ‘official’ response to serious social problems, numerous groups and organizations feed their opinions and agendas into policy. It is not our intention, then, to suggest that the media are solely culpable in creating moral panic regarding cyber-paeds. Rather, we are proposing that, like any moral panic, this process has incorporated a range of moral entrepreneurs from children’s charities to media moralists, as well as politicians and specialist policing agencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins (2009)</xref> observes that the social issues of today are increasingly being constructed around areas that demand substantial background such as information technology and biotechnology. In an economic, cultural and political climate that has, for the last decade, prioritized responses to <italic>all</italic> perceived threats that are computer-assisted (among them, cyber terrorist attacks, identity theft, cyber stalking, cyber bullying and organized crime conducted via online auction sites) the rhetoric of all these claims-makers and moral crusaders has been judged according to their ability to appeal to public tastes and prejudices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2009</xref>). One might cynically argue, as Jenkins does, that internet child sexual abuse is promoted by all these agencies because they ‘face no real pressures, external or internal, to deliver a response more effective than what they are already offering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712459314">Jenkins, 2009</xref>: 41). Certainly, they all have a vested interest in influencing media agendas, and journalists have been especially receptive to stories about cyber-paeds because the combination of novelty (of cyber crime), simplification, drama/violence, sex and children makes these stories inherently newsworthy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these caveats, our point is that real crimes by real men against real children whom they know have been obscured by concern for mediatized representations, morphing, markets and cyber-macs to the extent that schools now forbid parents to photograph school nativity plays, concerts and sports days, while the criminalization of the act of photographing children reveals a culture that regards virtually every childhood experience from the standpoint of a paedophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712459314">Furedi, 2008</xref>). This normalization of paedophilia is perpetuated via constant warnings about the inherent risk in adult–child encounters. Teachers, care workers, in fact anyone who comes into contact with children is now treated as a potential pervert; anyone, that is, except family members.</p>
<p>Since family abuse was first reported by the media with the events in Cleveland in 1987 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712459314">Campbell, 1988</xref>), three culturo-criminal discursive shifts have oriented concern away from the real crime and context according to news values, patriarchal ideologies, commercial agendas and government priorities. The first has blamed abuse on the paedophile; the second has seen the target for law identified as ‘child pornography’ (a term that itself disguises the often incestuous sexual violence depicted) and the third has placed both the ‘paedophile’ and ‘pornography’ in virtual rather than real space to create media moral panic. The result is that, far from prioritizing the rights of the child, the focus has instead been on controlling the technology; as Eneman notes, ‘cyber-paeds’ have helped increase controls and surveillance across all aspects of the digital world (2005: 27). That the association of cyber with crimes against children is hyperbole is less material than that the hyperbole has underwritten surveillance tactics, legislative controls, data access, invasions of privacy and numerous injustices – perhaps the greatest of which is the failure to protect children. Capital is also served by discourses exaggerating the cyber-paed as a problem that leave no discursive space for a <italic>moral</italic> critique of a culture that fetishes young bodies to the extent that women will starve themselves in order to achieve the size and shape of a child whilst young girls are sold the accoutrements of adult female sexuality. Such false standards ‘serve powerful ideological and commercial interest groups which profit from encouraging the beauty aesthetic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1363460712459314">Wykes and Gunter, 2005</xref>: 220).</p>
<p>Cyber-paed discourses seem to comprise a classic moral panic serving many masters: state, capital and patriarchy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712459314">Cohen’s (2002)</xref> emphasis that the power of moral panic lies not in what it does address but in what it doesn’t is very evident in these discourses. Families and pseudo-families are the usual place for sexual violation of children: ‘Most child sex offenders are married men, who have sex with their wives and sometimes other adult women – they are children's fathers, uncles, teachers as well as family friends and neighbours’ (CWASU, n.d.). Yet media calls for parents to pay attention to the dangers of the internet negate consideration for matters closer to home, and also preserve the image of the ideal family and secure men’s power within it.</p>
<p>By failing to address the usual sites of violence against children and ignoring the cultural context of a society that fetishizes young girls, the moral panic about cyber-paeds serves power on many levels. It preserves hegemonic masculinity by demonizing other forms as sick, evil or cyber-bogeymen; it safeguards patriarchy within the literal and metaphoric walls of the home; it protects the markets’ use of sexually explicit imagery of youthful bodies to generate profit; it underwrites new markets in protective software and net-security and it shores up the legitimacy of state controls and interventions into new technologies and personal information and communication. The discursive focus on and content about cyber-paeds thus neatly serves to reconstruct the reality of child sexual abuse in ways that deflect any critical gaze from power. It is, in Cohen’s terms, a perfect moral panic.</p>

We acknowledge, however, that in clinical usage the terms are used differently. The American Psychological Association (APA) <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM-IV) defines paedophilia as an erotic preference for prepubescent children – that is, those under 11 years of age. In common currency ‘paedophile’ refers to adults who are sexually attracted to children of any age, including pubescents of 12 years or older.

Within this body of work challenges were made to the reconstruction of childhood as a-sexualized innocence until the age of consent; to the implicit homophobia in the paedophile myth and to the imposition of sexual identification categories, generally focusing on discourse to explore gender, identity and sexuality. As criminologists, however, we return to the feminist critique of the ‘family’ in this article to focus on the very real sexual violence caused to children, usually by heterosexual men they live with or near, and the way paedophile discourses continue to deflect from such harm, now increasingly by placing it in cyberspace.</p></fn>
