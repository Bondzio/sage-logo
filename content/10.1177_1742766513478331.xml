<p>As 2013 begins, there are images of pity in many Western newspapers and on television placed by humanitarian organizations seeking to help the people in Syria who are suffering in their ruined cities and towns in unexpected winter snows. In his article, ‘“The things that we have to do”: Ethics and instrumentality in humanitarian communication’, David Nolan and Akina Mikami of the University of Melbourne, examine how humanitarian agencies and the media are implicated in a process by which such suffering is commodified and ‘sold’ to audiences as a ‘product’. They argue that such ‘emergencies’ have been made ‘normal’, both on TV news and in the budgets and operations of international humanitarian organizations, while the political and material dimensions of the problem are often obscured. They further contend that the humanitarian relation is not a means to engagement with the other, but rather with the self: ‘Indeed, the suffering other is doubly objectified – as both the object of the gaze of the humanitarian agent and as a continuously produced commodity to address the demand of consumers to maintain a positive self-image’.</p>
<p>One increasingly effective and more selfish argument for humanitarian aid is to ensure the security of the more privileged West. This manipulation of the fear of the powerless in the powerful is one of the areas examined by Fiona Jeffries of Canada’s Simon Fraser University, in her article, ‘Mediating fear’. Jeffries seeks to open up new lines of inquiry into the political significance of fear by revisiting insights from the work of Martin Barbero. His theory of socio-cultural mediations, she argues, enables us to analyse and recognize the centrality of cultural and communicational resistances to fear in broader struggles for a democratic public sphere. Jeffries critiques the assertion of a top-down ‘fear-media nexus’, which, she argues, renders invisible ‘the experiences, perspectives and actions of the very subjects of the culture of fear’. Jeffries points out that the people that are most systematically branded as members of groups ‘to be feared’ – migrants, youth, the poor, those who are socially and spatially designated as ‘outside’ – are also ‘those who are made to experience fear and danger by this demonization’. The article goes on to look at three case studies of grassroots communication practices that demonstrate the potential for emancipatory communication practices and a democratic counter-politics.</p>
<p>In his article, ‘The air raids that never were and the war that nobody won: Government propaganda in conflict reporting and how journalists should respond to it’, James Rodgers of City University, London, describes two cases of wartime news spin, which, together with the increasing use of PR professionals by government, demonstrate that journalists should be on their guard. The article compares two news stories of events that were ‘constructed’: a British air raid that was ‘aborted’ to avoid killing civilians in Libya in 2011 and an incident in the war between Georgia and Russia in 2008. Rodgers, himself a former BBC journalist with experience of covering military conflict, argues that in an era of increasingly professional government media-management techniques during conflicts, the media war is ‘almost as important as the military battle’. He concludes that journalists may resist or resent such attempts, but they are a fact of a reporter’s life and they will have to be on their guard to an even greater extent. How far the globalization of media has led to a more common news agenda-setting across the world, is the subject of the article by Ying Roselyn Du, of Hong Kong Baptist University. Du explores whether the theory of agenda-setting based on intra-nation environments is relevant in an inter-national context of increased globalization. Her quantitative study matches public agendas with media agendas to investigate agenda-setting effects in 11 countries worldwide, then compares media agendas across countries to consider whether inter-nation inter-media influence exists.</p>
