<abstract>
<p>Living in poverty increases the likelihood that students with disabilities will experience poor postschool outcomes, including unemployment, underemployment, and limited postsecondary education. The effects of the intersection of poverty and disability persist into adulthood where the employment rate for adults with disabilities is only one fourth that of individuals without disabilities. For close to 50 years, federal legislation has attempted to address the educational and economic disparities faced by students with disabilities and those growing up in poverty. In keeping with the focus of the civil rights movement and the Occupy Wall Street protests on the social and economic inequalities prevalent in the United States, policy directly addressing educational inequities is recommended to improve the daily lives and postschool outcomes of students with disabilities and those who are living in poverty.</p>

<p>I am writing this article on the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. Tonight, at Vanderbilt University, Congressperson John Lewis will speak about the legacy of King and the civil rights movement in addition to his own involvement in the sit-ins here in Nashville and as a Freedom Rider throughout the South in the 1960s. Many participants of today’s Occupy Wall Street movement—with its focus on economic and income inequality and limited opportunity available to growing numbers of disenfranchised and marginalized people—also view their action as a continuation of the civil rights movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2165143413476735">Moyers, 2012</xref>). The target of the Occupy movement is ostensibly the growing disparity between the wealth of the upper 1% and the rest of the population. This disparity, however, represents only one symptom of the problem, which can be traced to many roots: political, social, economic, and educational.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2165143413476735">Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965</xref> and Education for All Handicapped Children Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2165143413476735">EHA, 1975</xref>; renamed Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]) were designed to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for students with and without disabilities who were underserved and growing up in poverty. This early legislation sought to address the gap between educational experiences and achievement of high-need students—many of whom were Black or Hispanic—by improving services to these populations. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2165143413476735">No Child Left Behind Act (2001)</xref>—the offspring of the ESEA—and related federal initiatives such as Race to the Top were intended to continue the focus on improving outcomes for <italic>all</italic> students (e.g., students who are Black, who are from low-income families, who receive special education) through education reform. The Race to the Top initiative specifically asked states to fund charter schools as an alternative to typical public schools and introduce teacher evaluations that incorporate students’ standardized tests scores. Although some observers view the charter school and teacher accountability movements as healthy education reform (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2165143413476735">Brill, 2011</xref>), critics argue that such reform movements fail to address the root of the problem: poverty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413476735">Darling-Hammond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2165143413476735">Ladd &amp; Fiske, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413476735">Ravitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2165143413476735">Rothstein, 2011</xref>). Rather than focus on ineffective teachers as the primary source of poor student outcomes, these critics argue that many out-of-school factors influence student performance, including the social and economic conditions experienced by increasing numbers of public school students, such as
<disp-quote>
<p>children with barely literate parents who rarely read aloud to them, or with unemployed parents too stressed themselves to offer real support, or with untreated asthma that kept them up the night before, or with no place to study because they are now homeless or doubled up with relatives. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2165143413476735">Rothstein, 2011</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413476735">Ravitch (2010)</xref> argued that disparities in students’ test scores on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) relate more to socioeconomic status than a student’s nationality. Analysis by the National Association of Secondary School Principals cited by Ravitch shows that U.S. schools with the lowest test scores are those that are underresourced with the highest number of students living below the poverty line—a trend corroborated by National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2165143413476735">Ladd &amp; Fiske, 2011</xref>). These are also the schools where districts tend to allocate the lowest state and local funds to pay teachers’ salaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2165143413476735">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of Poverty</title>
<p>Growing up in an impoverished home or blighted neighborhood can have profound influences on children and their families, contributing to unemployment, underemployment, and job instability; school dropout; substance abuse; and incarceration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413476735">Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2011</xref>). Stressors associated with living in poverty, such as increased crime, persistent joblessness, limited health care and transportation, and inadequate housing can affect children’s and family members’ overall mental and physical health, producing high levels of anxiety, hypertension, fear, or depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2165143413476735">Shipler, 2004</xref>). Schools situated in low-income neighborhoods—communities with low property tax revenues to finance education—are historically underfunded and understaffed and have the highest drop-out rates reported nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476735">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413476735">Orfield, 2009</xref>). The situation is particularly acute for older students. Almost 50% of Black and 40% of Hispanic students, as compared with only 11% of White students, attend low-income high schools, where drop-out rates average 50% or greater and 60% of students live below the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476735">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413476735">Orfield, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, increasing numbers of students are living in poverty and attending high-poverty schools. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2011 that 22% (16 million) of U.S. children live below the poverty line. Poverty rates differ across racial, ethnic, and geographic groups. For example, 27% of Blacks and Hispanics live in poverty compared with 10% of Whites and 12% of Asians; poverty rates are highest across the South followed by Western states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2165143413476735">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>). In addition, increasing numbers of public school students are being identified as low-income or living in poverty, as determined by their eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. In 2007, the South became the first region in the United States in which low-income students were the majority of the public school population, increasing from 37% in 1989 to 54% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2165143413476735">Suitts, 2007</xref>). Three Western states also serve a majority of low-income public school students: California, New Mexico, and Oregon, while the nation as a whole is approaching this threshold at 46% of the public school population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2165143413476735">Suitts, 2007</xref>). In addition, students from racially and ethnically diverse groups make up an increasing proportion of the school population. In the South and several Western states, White students are now in the minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2165143413476735">National Center for Education Statistics, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413476735">Orfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2165143413476735">Suitts, 2010</xref>). By 2019, the majority of U.S. public school students are expected to be of color—and low income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2165143413476735">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship of Poverty and Disability</title>
<p>Poverty is also more prevalent among individuals with disabilities. More than one fourth of children with disabilities are living in families with earnings below the poverty level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2165143413476735">Parish, Rose, &amp; Andrews, 2010</xref>). Children with disabilities are also more likely to be from single-parent families and families of racial minority backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2165143413476735">Parish, Rose, Grinstein-Weiss, Richman, &amp; Andrews, 2008</xref>). These children may face additional obstacles, such as racism or prejudice, along with the educational, employment, and social challenges associated with poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413476735">Hughes &amp; Avoke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2165143413476735">McDonald, Keys, &amp; Balcazar, 2007</xref>). Moreover, older students with disabilities and those from some racially and ethnically diverse groups are more likely to be identified for special education services and placed in restrictive educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2165143413476735">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>). More than half of students identified as having an intellectual disability—of which Black students are 3 times more likely than their White peers to be identified—spend the majority of their school day outside the general education classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2165143413476735">U.S. Department of Education, 2010</xref>). Compounded with the disproportionate representation in some special education programs of Blacks and other racially and ethnically diverse groups is the fact that these students overwhelmingly attend underresourced, high-poverty schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413476735">Balfanz &amp; Legters, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413476735">Orfield, 2009</xref>) and have parents who report insufficient access to special education services to meet their children’s needs due to unavailability or financial hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2165143413476735">Levine, Marder, &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2165143413476735">
<title>Relationship of Poverty to Postschool and Adult Outcomes</title>
<p>Living in poverty increases the likelihood that students with disabilities will experience poor postschool outcomes, such as low graduation and postsecondary enrollment rates and increased unengagement, unemployment, and underemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2165143413476735">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). For example, after leaving high school, only 31% of youth with intellectual disability are employed (primarily part-time), only 7% attend postsecondary school as a sole postschool activity, only 14% live independently or semi-independently, only 26% have a checking account, and only 11% participate in a community group, such as a sports team or church club (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2165143413476735">Newman et al., 2009</xref>). Students with disabilities from low-income households also fare more poorly across these same postschool indicators than do their counterparts from higher income homes. In addition, White youth are more likely to be employed than Blacks (63% vs. 35%) or Hispanics (54%), to hold a skilled labor job, or to have a checking account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2165143413476735">Newman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The intersection of poverty and disability persists into adulthood. In December 2011, 18% of individuals with disabilities age 16 years and above (excluding institutionalized populations) were reported to be employed versus 64% of individuals without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2165143413476735">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012</xref>). Adults with intellectual disability are even less likely to be employed, particularly full-time, or are restricted to working in segregated facility-based settings earning considerably less than minimum wage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2165143413476735">Metzel et al., 2007</xref>). These deplorable findings explain in part the prevalence of poverty among people with disabilities of working age, especially those with more substantial disabilities: Few are working and those who are working are underemployed and working for wages below the poverty level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413476735">Hughes &amp; Avoke, 2010</xref>). In fact, the percentage of adults with disabilities living in poverty is increasing despite increasing public expenditures for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413476735">Stapleton, O’Day, Livermore, &amp; Imparato, 2005</xref>). This seeming contradiction is partly due to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413476735">Stapleton and colleagues (2005)</xref> referred to as the “poverty trap” in which income supports (e.g., Supplemental Security Income [SSI]) and other benefits, such as health care, are reduced or lost if an employee earns over a federally determined threshold, which itself is set below a living wage.</p>
<p>At 54 million, Americans with disabilities represent one of the largest and fastest growing minority groups in the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413476735">Brault, 2008</xref>). Disability, like poverty rates, vary among adults across racial and ethnic groups—with the highest disability rates among Native Americans (23%) and Blacks (17%) and lower rates among Asians (6%), Hispanics (11%), and Whites (13%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413476735">Brault, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, adults with disabilities across all racial and ethnic groups are more likely than the general population to experience the effects of poverty and material hardship, including food insecurity, inadequate housing and medical care, and difficulty paying bills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2165143413476735">Fremstad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2165143413476735">Parish et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2165143413476735">
<title>Future Policy</title>
<p>Federal legislation to address transition outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2165143413476735">IDEA, 1990</xref>) has been mandated for more than 20 years, during which time the field has been accumulating knowledge on factors related to postschool success for students with disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2165143413476735">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, abysmal rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty persist. We are reminded today as we look back on the legacy of Martin Luther King, that the civil rights movement resulted in a national focus on social inequality. The Occupy movement is bringing economic and income inequality into the limelight. Improving student outcomes now requires that we address educational inequalities that limit opportunity for some and are associated with a life of poverty for many children and adults with disabilities. Doing so means directly addressing poverty at its roots using a variety of tactics.</p>
<p>First, on December 2, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education jointly issued new guidelines for considering race when assigning students to K–12 schools to increase diversity and reduce racial isolation. The guidelines provide clarification for how school districts may legally consider race to promote diversity in the wake of recent Supreme Court decisions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2165143413476735"><italic>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1</italic>, 2007</xref>).They also represent a revolutionary change by reversing the “race-neutral” guidelines governing student enrollment policy issued by the previous presidential administration following the Supreme Court cases. The current document argues that racially isolated schools fail to provide the full benefits that public schools can offer, hampering student achievement due to high teacher turnover, less rigorous curricula (e.g., few college preparatory courses), and inferior facilities and educational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2165143413476735">U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>). School districts now have guidance in drawing attendance boundaries and transferring students to legally achieve greater student diversity, taking into account students’ race as well as the socioeconomic status of families and neighborhoods and proximity of subsidized housing. Proactive adherence by school districts in implementing the new guidelines will be a powerful first step in achieving educational equality for students attending racially isolated, high-poverty schools—a major impetus toward improving student performance and postschool outcomes.</p>
<p>Second, the much-awaited reauthorization of the ESEA is currently being considered by Congress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413476735">Darling-Hammond (2012)</xref> argued that if low-performing schools (i.e., those that are underresourced and serve low-income, racially and ethnically isolated students) are expected to achieve adequate yearly progress on state exams, disparities in school funding must be addressed. She suggested establishing common resource standards across schools and incentives to achieve them, including well-qualified teachers, high-quality curricula, and equitable instructional resources. Furthermore, Darling-Hammond argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>The ESEA should tie standards for equal educational opportunity to standards for learning: indicators of learning opportunities—the availability of qualified teachers, appropriate courses, materials and equipment, and necessary services—should be published alongside test results, and states should be expected to show evidence of progress toward resource equalization along with evidence of learning. (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The bottom line is that ESEA and IDEA legislation should resurrect the early goals of the 1965 ESEA and 1975 IDEA to compensate for the effects of poverty and disability, particularly among racial, ethnic, and other minority and disenfranchised groups that experience the highest rates of unemployment, such as the near 50% unemployment rates of Black urban male high school dropouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2165143413476735">Mincy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, for transition-age students with disabilities, recommended standards should include, at the very least, transition services as mandated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413476735">2004</xref> IDEA Amendments, such as experiences in the community and instruction in employment and daily living skills. If we intend to improve postschool outcomes for students with disabilities as they enter their adult lives, including employment, postsecondary education, independent living, economic self-sufficiency, community participation, social engagement, and quality of life, compliance to existing federal transition mandates must increase and the responsibility of schools for the achievement of students’ postschool outcomes must be expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413476735">Rusch, Hughes, Agran, Martin, &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413476735">Rusch and colleagues (2009)</xref>, high schools should have primary responsibility and be held accountable for (a) ensuring students have identified a desired postschool placement—postsecondary education or employment—prior to school exit, (b) assisting students and their families in making the transition to this placement, and (c) coordinating postschool services and supports to ensure placement and outcome success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413476735">Hughes &amp; Avoke, 2010</xref>). In addition, while students are still in school, opportunities to participate in stimulating environments outside the special education classroom in which students can make choices, problem solve, and learn self-determination skills as well as develop career interests through job sampling, job training, or internship opportunities must be provided, particularly in low-income schools where these opportunities may be less likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2165143413476735">Washington, Hughes, &amp; Cosgriff, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, teachers must be educated about the effects of poverty on children and families. Teachers are confronted daily by the symptoms of poverty—a high school student receiving cell phone calls from her mother during class telling the student that she needs to get a second job because the family is not reporting enough income to qualify for a rental apartment, or a young man having difficulty staying awake in class because he takes three busses to and from his afterschool job and returns home at midnight to do his homework and wake up at 5:00 a.m. to catch the bus to school. Without awareness of the effects of poverty, teachers may interpret students’ behavior as disrespect or disinterest in learning. Teacher preparation programs need to educate preservice teachers about the effects of poverty and help them identify and respond in a caring and empathetic way to its symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413476735">Ravitch, 2010</xref>). Teachers can learn to engage and support in class students from high-poverty homes, as well as learn when to seek outside support, such as from a social worker or health service provider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2165143413476735">Rothstein, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Schools cannot address all the inequities of a society experiencing historic economic disparities. During the 1st year I taught a class titled “High-Poverty Youth: Improving Outcomes”—in which Vanderbilt students mentored youth in high-need, underresourced high schools—one of the students shared a graphic with the class. In it, a young man is trying to navigate the halls at school weighted down by three oversized, bulging pieces of luggage, each of which bears a nametag: Hunger, Sickness, and Homelessness. As the principal and another student look on in bewilderment, the young man calls out, “Could someone help me with these? I’m late for math class.” Many students come to school bearing similarly heavy loads. Although we cannot remove all the out-of-school factors facing students, we can begin to address the effects of poverty compounded with disability on both a systemswide and individual basis to provide equal opportunity and needed support for <italic>all</italic> students to promote their success in school and in their postschool and adult lives.</p>
