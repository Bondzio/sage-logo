<p>62.4559 ALBESCU, Oana — <bold>Accepţii antinomice ale teoriei dreptâţii în filozofia politicâ contemporanâ: Robert Nozick şi John Rawls (Rival concepts of the theory of fairness in contemporary political theory: Robert Nozick and John Rawls).</bold> <italic>Sfera Politicii</italic> 156, Feb. 2011: 73–78.</p>
<p>This study starts from the assumption that the theory of distributive justice as fairness, theorized by John Rawls and the theory of justice as entitlement outlined by Robert Nozick, are the main rivals in the arena of debate in contemporary political philosophy. After reiterating the arguments that describe R. Nozick's conceptual framework relating to the minimal state and the right of property, the author brings into discussion the contrasting elements of the two approaches about the social justice.

<p>62.4560 AMBLER, Wayne — <bold>Tyranny in Aristophanes's <italic>Birds.</italic></bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 74(2), Spring 2012: 185–206.</p>
<p>The protagonist of Aristophanes's <italic>Birds</italic> rises to become a <italic>tyrannos</italic>, but scholars disagree when assessing him. Do Peisetairos's impressive political gifts make him an apt example of competent rule, or does his treatment of his subjects mark him as guilty of <italic>hubris</italic> and perfidy? It is argued that Aristophanes does not condemn him. Nor, however, does he recommend Peisetairos's rule, as Henderson suggests. Between these extremes is a more complex <italic>via media</italic>: if a birdlike populace is to have an empire, they must also embrace a Peisetairos. But it would not be unwise to oppose an empire at such a price, even if the Alcibidean leader who would preside over it cannot be condemned for seeking to rule in the way he imagines to be most advantageous for himself.

<p>62.4561 ANKER, Elisabeth — <bold>Left melodrama.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(2), May 2012: 130–152.</p>
<p>Left melodrama is melodramatic insofar as it incorporates the specific melodramatic narrative, style and promise of the text that stands in for its disavowed attachments: the <italic>Manifesto of the Communist Party.</italic> Whereas the <italic>Manifesto's</italic> critical power promised radical political transformation, left melodrama incorporates the <italic>Manifesto's</italic> melodramatic style in an effort to revivify that promise. It thus inhibits the creation of new critical methods appropriate to our current historical moment and occludes Marx and Engels' warning that the possibility of radical transformation is diminished when the past furnishes the vision for the future. Left melodrama can be found in the texts of G. Agamben, M. Hardt and A. Negri. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Mill's theory of liberty is founded on a harm principle which is supposed to imply a radical criticism of political and legal paternalism. We suggest an interpretation of the harm principle and of its justification which is compatible with some forms of paternalism. We can thus derive from <italic>On Liberty</italic> a conception of autonomy which justifies perfectionist liberal paternalism. [R]</p>
<p>62.4563 BEHNKE, Andreas — <bold>Eternal peace, perpetual war? A critical investigation into Kant's conceptualisations of war.</bold> <italic>Journal of International Relations and Development</italic> 15(2), Apr. 2012: 250–271.</p>
<p>Most discussions of Immanuel Kant's political theory of international politics focus on his work on Eternal Peace and its normative and empirical relevance for contemporary international relations and international law. Yet for all his concern with peace, Kant's work is characterized by a fascinating preoccupation with the concept of war and its role in human history. This essay investigates critically Kant's different conceptualizations of war and evaluates his writing as a critique against contemporary versions of Liberal war and peace, as well as recent attempts to reduce war to an immanent logic of biopolitics.

<p>62.4564 BOEDELTJE, Freerk — <bold>The other spaces of Europe: seeing European geopolitics through the disturbing eye of Foucault's <italic>heterotopias.</italic></bold><italic>Geopolitics</italic> 17(1), 2012: 1–24.</p>
<p>This article takes M. Foucault's concept of heterotopias as inspiration for an alternative geopolitical view on Europe. Foucault's concept of hetero-topic spaces provides a critical framework that is capable of countering the geo-political imaginations of a universal Europe. Foucault has used the idea of a mirror as metaphor for the contradictions between the image and reality. In this context heterotopias are considered places that disturb the utopian image by means of complexity, contradiction and diversity. This article is in search of heterotopic spaces of resistance.

<p>62.4565 BOUDOU, Benjamin — <bold>La traversée du politique: Derrida et Ricoeur entre pureté de la philosophie et tragique de l'action (Crossing politics: Derrida and Ricoeur between the purity of philosophy and the tragic dimension of action).</bold> <italic>Raisons politiques</italic> 45, 2012: 211–233. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>I compare and examine critically the political thought of Paul Ricoeur and Jacques Derrida. I analyze their specific ways of combining philosophy, ethics, and political theory. despite the fact that they share specific concepts and criticize purely procedural and liberal definitions of the political, they profoundly disagree on the meaning of justice and sovereignty. Derrida's overflowing ethical and unconditional “event” must be radically opposed to Ricoeur's attention to the “institution” and social cohesion. The concept of hospitality developed lately by both authors illustrates this major opposition. I argue for a political theory use of Derrida while calling for a cautious use of his previously philosophical concepts. [R]</p>
<p>62.4566 BRUBAKER, Stanley C. — <bold>Coming into one's own: John Locke's theory of property, God, and politics.</bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 74(2), Spring 2012: 207–232.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the <italic>Two Treaties</italic>, a trail set down by Locke has gone unremarked—as has its final destination. If we miss this trail, we miss the work's coherence. If we follow this trail, we find a compelling, even shocking, case against Revelation as an independent source of authority. And we find a theory of property so powerful [that] it compels the reconstitution of the relation between children and parents, wives and husbands, servants and masters, persons and polities, and ultimately between man and God. Indeed, Locke's story of the right of property is also the story of man's coming into his own, his coming into his own mind, freed from the irrational claims of Revelation. Thus, Locke's theory of property is nothing less than a story of man's Enlightenment. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4567 BUTON, Philippe — <bold>L'impensé écologiste de l'extrême gauche française avant 1968 (The ecological indifference of the French Extreme Left before 1968).</bold> <italic>écologie et Politique</italic> 44, 2012: 93–102. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>During the decade preceding May 1968, three different kinds of attitudes towards environmentalism can be observed within the French Extreme Left. First, many revolutionary organizations were impervious to environmental issues. That was the case of all Neo-Leninist organizations: Trotskysts, Maoists, Bordiguists. A second attitude was that shown by Anarchists. Contrary to the Neo-Leninists, Anarchists become early aware of societal issues, such as feminism, sexuality and everyday life, except before 1968 for environmentalism. A third group, represented by a real pioneer, the <italic>Parti socialiste unifié</italic>, became aware, ahead of time, of environmental issues. This classification can be understood through two criteria: the relationship of these groups to the concept of modernity, and to Marxism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5023]</p>
<p>62.4568 CASTIGNANI, Hugo — <bold>L'impérialisme défensif existe-t-il? Sur la théorie romaine de la guerre juste et sa postérité (Is there defensive imperialism? On the Roman theory of just war and its posterity).</bold> <italic>Raisons politiques</italic> 45, 2012: 35–58. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Most modern historians have tended to explain the formation of the Roman Empire by the notion of “defensive imperialism”, a thesis that remained unchallenged until the last quarter of the 20th c., and was used by the Romans themselves to justify the formation of their empire. The concept of defensive imperialism returns periodically, in all the authors who have devoted themselves to the question of just war, most notably in the speeches of politicians and scholars justifying preemptive war. This article thus explores the ways in which this concept can cast a new light on the rules of formation of the discourse of just war—the central element in the mechanism of justification of war—in its double meaning of discourse structuration and of regulation of state practices, transcending its original function as an explanatory cause of the Roman Empire.

<p>62.4569 CORBETT, Ross J. — <bold>Locke's biblical critique.</bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 74(1), Winter 2012: 27–51.</p>
<p>The essay clarifies the relationship between Locke's political and his religious thought. To the extent that Locke's political thought is an outgrowth of a particular strand of Christianity, its claims to universality would be significantly diminished. Several plausible interpretations of his political thought rely on his religiosity. Others maintain that this religiosity was a façade. Close attention to Locke's analysis of the Hebrew text of <italic>Gen. 1:28</italic> unambiguously points to a critique of the Bible on semantic grounds. Locke subtly argues that the wording of the Bible makes the interpretation of scripture by scripture alone impossible. The fact that Locke goes out of his way to critique the Bible refutes interpretations of Locke's thought that rely on his religiosity and re-establishes the universalist claims of his political thought.

<p>62.4570 DARD, Olivier — <bold>Bertrand de Jouvenel et l'écologie (Bertrand de Jouvenel and ecology).</bold> <italic>écologie et Politique</italic> 44, 2012: 43–54. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Once a key figure of the “realist” project of the 1930s, a noted pen of the Doriot press until Munich [1938], and, in the aftermath of World War II, a liberal theorist of power and sovereignty, particularly hailed outside France, B. de Jouvenel expanded his range at the end of the 1950s by prevailing as one of the pioneers of environmentalism, after the publication in 1968 of his essay <italic>Arcadie</italic>. This article consists of three parts: after examining the roots of Jouvenel's environmentalism (the legacy of Colette, the <italic>relève</italic> of the 1930s, and Anglo-Saxon influences), and its content and specificities (emphasis on economics and on the role of experts), it seeks to interpret it in light of the itinerary of the author, who considered himself a “traveler in the century”.

<p>62.4571 Di MUZIO, Tim — <bold>The liberal renaissance and the end(s) of history.</bold> <italic>Journal of International Relations and Development</italic> 15(2), Apr. 2012: 158–176.</p>
<p>Addressing the historical turn in IR, this article critically appraises the liberal renaissance by interrogating liberal discourse and its renderings of history. Whether implicitly or explicitly, liberal perspectives in IR are heir to two overlapping and often contradictory narratives of history that masquerade as universals when they can be shown to be particular (and indeed peculiar). The first narrative is animated by a juridicophilosophical discourse while the second is informed by a stadial-historical discourse. I suggest that both of these narratives contribute to a triumphant, universal and relatively pacific reading of the liberal project, the aim of which is to encourage—through a variety of strategies, tactics and technologies—liberal democratic market societies so that the world will one day be united by capitalist commerce and the institutions of polyarchical democracy.

<p>62.4572 DIENSTAG, Joshua Foa — <bold>A storied shooting: [John Ford's] <italic>Liberty Valance</italic> and the paradox of sovereignty.</bold> <italic>Political Theory</italic> 40(3), June 2012: 290–318.</p>
<p>A variety of theorists have emphasized the paradox at the center of democratic legal authority, viz., that it cannot be self-derived but must ultimately rest on some extra-legal phenomenon, usually an act of exclusion. John Ford's <italic>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</italic> examines precisely this paradoxical situation and, I argue, actually suggests a novel response that has escaped theorists who have considered the problem in the past. The film's best-known line (“print the legend”) in fact represents the opposite of its perspective—which is to carefully deconstruct and reveal (without debunking) the complicated interrelation of law and power in the formation of any state. Rather than undermining democratic authority, we can be strengthened, if sobered, by the revelation that law is not self-sustaining. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4573 DIETZ, Mary G. — <bold>Between <italic>polis</italic> and empire: Aristotle's <italic>Politics</italic>.</bold> <italic>American Political Science Review</italic> 106(2), May 2012: 275–293.</p>
<p>For many, Aristotle's thought exhibits a parochial Hellenocentric “binary logic” that privileges Greeks over non-Greeks and betrays a xenophobic suspicion of aliens and foreigners. In response to these standard “<italic>polis</italic>-centric” views, I conjure a different perceptual field—“between <italic>polis</italic> and empire”—within which to interpret Aristotle's <italic>Politics</italic>. Both theorist and text appear deeply attentive to making present immediate things “coming to be and passing away” in the Hellenic world. Moreover, “between <italic>polis</italic> and empire”, we can see the <italic>Politics</italic> actually disturbing various hegemonic Greek binary oppositions (Greek/barbarian; citizen/alien; center/periphery), not reinforcing them. Understanding the <italic>Politics</italic> within the context of the transience of the <italic>polis</italic> invites a new way of reading Aristotle while at the same time providing new possibilities for theorizing problems of post-national citizenship, transnational politics, and empire.

<p>62.4574 DIONIGI, Filippo — <bold>Islamism as communitarianism: person, community and the problem of international norms in non-liberal theories.</bold> <italic>Journal of International Political Theory</italic> 8(1–2), 2012: 74–103.</p>
<p>This essay discusses how international political theory can become more receptive towards Islamism. It claims that Islamism can be interpreted as a form of communitarianism. To underpin this claim, the study relies on an analysis of how the concepts of community and person are conceived in communitarianism and Islamism. On the basis of the affinities of these conceptions between Islamism and communitarianism, the essay shows that Islamism can be interpreted as a form of communitarianism. It concludes that understanding Islamism as communitarianism produces a common space for public reasoning which would deserve more consideration from political theorists. Second, Islamism as communitarianism reassesses the possibility of a political theory engagement with Islamist theory that can benefit the recognition of human rights norms in circumstances in which Islamism is particularly influential.

<p>62.4575 DOLGERT, Stefan — <bold>Sacrificing justice: suffering animals, the [Aeschylus's] <italic>Oresteia</italic>, and the masks of consent</bold> <italic>Political Theory</italic> 40(3), June 2012: 263–289.</p>
<p>Democratic theorists have increasingly turned to Aeschylus's <italic>Oresteia</italic> as a resource for challenging the shortcomings of liberal theory, but I argue that this particular return to Greek tragedy should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. Defenders of Aeschylean justice have underplayed the sacrificial aspects of his solution to the problem of civil strife, mistaking the consent of the Furies for a resolution that escapes the cycle of violence. I contend that Aeschylus folds the consent of the Furies into a sacrificial framework which denies the violence it enacts by directing this violence toward nonhumans. As a consequence Aeschylean justice is complicit in continuing the sacrificial economy it seems to subvert, and Aeschylean politics relies on the suffering of nonhumans (and humans) to secure its conception of order.

<p>62.4576 DUUS-OTTERSTRÖM, Göran — <bold>Weak and strong luck egalitarianism.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(2), May 2012: 153–171.</p>
<p>Luck egalitarian theories of justice are frequently criticized for being unduly harsh on people who experience disadvantage as a result of their responsible choices. According to the “abandonment objection”, luck egalitarians are committed to abandoning even very severely disadvantaged persons as long as responsibility figures in the right way in the genesis of their disadvantage. This article makes a distinction between two views that are insufficiently distinguished in the literature. Weak luck egalitarianism is the view that justice requires us to cater to the claims of victims of bad brute luck before there is an obligation to assist responsible victims. Strong luck egalitarianism is the view that responsibility robustly determines the requirements of justice. The abandonment objection presumably targets the less plausible strong view. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4577 ELSTEIN, David — <bold>Mou Zongsan's new Confucian democracy.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 11(2), May 2012: 192–210.</p>
<p>Mou Zongsan's political philosophy presents significant challenges to liberal views on freedom and the basis for democracy. Mou rejects the liberal understanding of freedom as absence of interference, and instead argues for a limited conception of positive freedom in government that includes teaching basic moral values. He bases democracy on the Confucian idea of respect for humanity's universal moral potential. Mou also provides an alternative to many current conceptions of Confucian democracy, which favor pragmatist and communitarian interpretations. Mou's thought thus illustrates how Chinese conceptions of Confucian democracy frequently differ from those in English-language scholarship. This article examines how Mou creatively interpreted Confucian thought to develop a unique New Confucian theory of democracy that neither uncritically accepts liberalism nor discounts the importance of liberal features such as individual freedom and rights.

<p>62.4578 FADEL, Mohammad — <bold>Muslim reformists, female citizenship, and the public accommodation of Islam in liberal democracy.</bold> <italic>Politics and Religion</italic> 5(1), Apr. 2012: 2–35.</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has granted state parties to the European Convention on Human Rights a wide margin of appreciation with respect to the regulation of public manifestations of Islam, on the grounds that Islamic symbols are inconsistent with the democratic order of Europe. This article [asks] what kinds of commitments to gender equality and democratic decision-making are sufficient for a democratic order. The arguments of two modern Muslim reformist scholars—Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī and ‘Abd al-Halīm Abū Shuqqa—as evidence to argue that if the relevant degree of commitment to gender equality is understood from the perspective of political rather than comprehensive liberalism, doctrines such as those elaborated by these two religious scholars evidence sufficient commitment to the value of political equality between men and women.

<p>62.4579 FEMIA, Joseph V. — <bold>The antinomies of conservative thought.</bold> <italic>Political Studies Review</italic> 10(2), May 2012: 221–237.</p>
<p>Modern conservatism is the product of a gradual merger between traditional holism and liberal individualism. As a result, what we now call conservative thought embodies a number of contradictory values and principles. Even individual conservatives find it hard to be consistent, with some, for example, proclaiming their reverence both for national traditions and for universal moral truths. The books reviewed in this article illustrate the remarkable diversity of conservative ideology, though the article concludes by arguing that the familiar distinction between “left” and “right” remains valid.

<p>62.4580 FORCHTNER, Bernhard — <bold>Critique and argumentation: on the relation between the discourse-historical approach and pragma-dialectics.</bold> <italic>Journal of Language and Politics</italic> 11(1), 2012: 31–50.</p>
<p>At the core of critical discourse-analysis lies its emancipatory agenda: arguing for social equality and against discrimination. In the case of the discourse-historical approach (DHA), this stance has been theoretically justified mainly through references to J. Habermas's language-philosophy. At the same time, DHA has benefitted from drawing on F.H. van Eemeren and R. Grootendorst's Pragma-Dialectical argumentation theory. However, Pragma-Dialectics rests on K. Popper and H. Albert's critical rationalism, [creating] both epistemological and normative conflicts at the paradigm-core of DHA between critical rationalism and Habermas's critical theory. We review the different epistemological and normative underpinnings of DHA and Pragma-Dialectics and discuss the consequences of implementing the latter in the former. We argue for a coherent orientation towards Habermas's language-philosophy in order to maintain a high degree of consistency in DHA. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4581 GABOR, Alexandru — <bold>Multiculturalismul liberal (Liberal multiculturalism).</bold> <italic>Sfera Politicii</italic> 163, Sept. 2011: 58–66.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is the most recent member of the political theory family and also the most debated across Western Europe. Four prime ministers have publicly acknowledged the failure of “multikulti”. This contrasts with the initially broad consensus in political theory on multiculturalism is associated with communitarianism. There are three types of justification for multiculturalism: postcolonial, communitarian and liberal. The article deals only with the evolution of the liberal defense of multiculturalism in the political theory of William Kymlicka. Although his “liberal culturalism” became gradually more sophisticated, historic and specific circumstances of Eastern and Central Europe limit the scope of multicultural policies in that region.

<p>62.4582 GOLLAIN, Françoise — <bold>André Gorz était-il un écologiste? (Was André Gorz an ecologist?).</bold> <italic>écologie et Politique</italic> 44, 2012: 77–91. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>A leading thinker of the French school of thought characterized by a radical anti-capitalist critique of productivism and the domination of science, André Gorz's enduring commitment to existentialist philosophy leads nonetheless to tensions between his analyses and some fundamental Green premises, and places him in a unique position within Green Marxism. This paper explores the nature of Gorz's materialism and anti-determinism, with reference to his lesser known publications written prior to the 1970s. Attention is drawn to the influence of Husserl's and Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theses, as well as of the Sartrean concept of <italic>pratico-inerte</italic> on his theorization of ecological factors. The analysis leads to an appreciation of both the wealth and the limits of the radically anthropocentric stance in Green philosophy, which downplays the role of natural determinism.

Rediscovering the potential hermeneutic political philosophy of Charles Taylor).</bold> <italic>Revista española de Ciencia política</italic> 28, March 2012: 11–30.</p>
<p>In this paper we propose reconsidering from a hermeneutical approach the theme about identity, which has been reactivated in the Quebecois debate about the “reasonable accommodation”. For that aim, we deliberately adopt a hermeneutical view of Charles Taylor's politics. We start from his analysis about modernity where emerge the question of identity and complementarily of recognition as a “struggle”. We explore the relationship between authenticity and recognition. Then we go in depth in the link between individual and collective identity. How does hermeneutics help to a better understanding of individual and collective identities? From the hermeneutic approach, we focus on an account of complex and dynamic identities and the possibility of “thinking and living deep diversity”. Finally, we answer some of the procedural liberalism criticisms of Charles Taylor's politics. [R]</p>

<p>This paper, while acknowledging the import of popular geopolitics for understanding how foreign policies are interpreted in an everyday sense, argues that this literature has glossed over a set of key oppositional cultural formats, such as documentary films, satirical newspapers, and non-fiction comic books (referred to here as graphic narratives), which also influence the geopolitical imaginations of their consumers. Using G. ó Tuathail's concept of the anti-geopolitical eye, the paper considers how popular geopolitical understandings are constructed, arguing that these oppositional formats, and graphic narratives in particular, challenge hegemonic scriptings of geopolitics through a <italic>bricolage</italic> of narrative techniques.

<p>Returning to liberalism's Scottish Enlightenment precursors suggests that the liberal order might best be described by the tension between its assertions about the smoothing natural harmonies within the social order and its doubts about whether those harmonies can appear spontaneously and therefore require aggressive projects of reform and correction. Although committed to the inevitability and inexorability of progress, such doubts led Scottish Enlightenment figures to strategies that even today continue to mark liberalism's effort to purify modern progress of tragedy's taint. We continue to justify apparent social failings as necessary to the natural order, regarding them instead as advantages in a Providentialist manner (Smith and Hume).

<p>Political ecology in France has been spanned since its origins by very different conceptions of nature.

<p>The dominance of liberalism in world politics today is widely interpreted as attesting to its universal validity. This claim provides the basis for a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate criticism—the former operating within a broadly liberal framework and the latter questioning the universal validity of that framework. This special issue brings together critiques of liberalism in the second register. The introduction sets out the two competing notions of critical analysis and argues that, far from being “illegitimate”, it is this second concept of critique that ensures that liberalism does not betray its core promise of replacing might with right in a time of liberal world order.

<p>62.4588 JAMES, David — <bold>The role of evil in Kant's liberalism.</bold> <italic>Inquiry</italic> 55(3), June 2012: 238–261.</p>
<p>Carl Schmitt distinguishes between political theories in terms of whether they rest on the anthropological assumption that man is evil by nature or on the anthropological assumption that man is good by nature, and he claims that liberal political theory is based on the latter assumption. Contrary to this claim, I show how Kant's liberalism is shaped by his theory of the radical evil in human nature, and that his liberalism corresponds to the characterization of liberalism that Schmitt himself offers. My discussion has certain implications with respect to the view that for Kant evil is the product of society. I show that this view is mistaken insofar as it fails to recognize that Kant's political philosophy implies that human beings require the type of society that best suits their radically evil natures.

<p>I compare M. Oakeshott's and J. Habermas's respective accounts of morality, rationality and politics. I show that they both theorize the conditions of the modern political community as a “civil association”, and I argue that this comparison enables us to challenge predominant understandings of each thinker and to address criticisms leveled against them. I demonstrate that the contextualist and Hegelian aspects of Habermas's earlier work are carried over into his later work on discourse ethics and that he puts forward a more situated understanding of rationality and morality than is usually acknowledged. I also show that Oakeshott is not a straightforward conservative and in some respect he can be seen as a forerunner of deliberative politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines Engels's little-noticed communitarian sympathies, especially as expressed in his 1844 article “Kommunistischen Ansiedlungen”. These sympathies are in conflict with the considered and more critical view of communitarian socialism that he subsequently came to share with Karl Marx. The article first provides some characterization of this “communitarian moment” in Engels's early intellectual evolution; second, it raises a number of worries about [my] argument; third, it illuminates some of the interesting variety in 19th-c. communitarianism; and fourth, it insists on the complexity of questions about “feasibility”. I maintain that Engels underestimates the variety of contemporary communitarianism, and that his appeal to the existence of intentional communities in America and Britain as proof of the feasibility of communism is unsuccessful.

<p>Issues of war and foreign affairs predominate in Machiavelli's <italic>Florentine Histories</italic>, a work generally taken to be devoted to the internal politics of Florence. The well-known narrative of the rise and fall of Medici rule is driven by a counternarrative of the rise of mercenaries such as Francesco Sforza to the point of becoming the true arbiters of Italian affairs. The <italic>Florentine Histories</italic> lays out the progressive disarming of Italian powers, details the rise of a corrupt system of foreign affairs dominated by mercenary arms and their attendant papal meddling, and urgently counsels statesmen to arm their cities with arms of their own. Seeking to reframe interpretive approaches in this manner, the article sheds new light on Machiavelli's teaching on the desirability of well-managed domestic discords as they relate to military preparedness.

<p>Although Gandhi is often taken to be an exemplary moral idealist in politics, this article demonstrates that Gandhian nonviolence is premised on a form of political realism, specifically a contextual, consequentialist, and moral-psychological analysis of a political world understood to be marked by inherent tendencies toward conflict, domination, and violence. By treating nonviolence as the essential analog and correlative response to a realist theory of politics, one can better register the novelty of <italic>satyagraha</italic> (nonviolent action) as a practical orientation in politics as opposed to a moral proposition, ethical stance, or standard of judgment. The singularity of <italic>satyagraha</italic> lays in its self-limiting character as a form of political action that seeks to constrain the negative consequences of politics while working toward progressive social and political reform.

<p>Despite common portrayals of Ahab as beyond the pale of common humanity, H.

Two of Ahab's most definitive characteristics—his isolation and his desire for domination—do not differentiate him from the other characters in the book but rather underscore how much he is like them.

<p>The neo-Calvinist concept of (horizontal) “sphere sovereignty” differs from the Roman Catholic principle of (hierarchical) “subsidiarity”. Recent attention to civil society brings to the fore centuries of Christian social initiatives and societal ideas, already within the Roman Empire, and Biblical roots of this praxis and thought. In this article is described how neo-Calvinism strengthens the central motives of Christian democracy. The historical roots of these motives are traced to picture neo-Calvinism as only one source of Christian Democratic thinking, among a variety of other historical sources.

<p>The paper critically examines the one-time popular accusation that Strauss (1899–1973), a political philosopher aloof from real politics in his lifetime, was a mastermind of the Iraq War. It examines how much the public image of Strauss agrees with or differs from the essential elements of his political philosophy. Second, it derives the principles of Strauss's foreign policy from his political philosophy. In searching for a genuine version of Strauss's foreign policy, it concludes that he endorses “moderate realism” as an advocate of classical political philosophy and, at the same time, “moderate idealism” as a critique of modernity. Neither of them would have supported the Iraq War or the unlimited expansionism under the G.W. Bush administration. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In its affinity to Islam, nihilism defies the secular settlement through its appeals to transcendence. By seeking legitimacy in the sacred, nihilism disrupts established boundaries between the religious and the secular. Nihilism exposes the difficulty of forging worlds of transcendence on the modern register of immanence. Transcendence affords the possibility of escape, immanence closure. The two can be reversed in politics, as the experience in several Islamic Cultural Zones (ICZs) suggests. Appeals to transcendence seek to reorganize the social world in the name of escaping it. Immanence, on the other hand, can rework notions of redemption and salvation into secular stories of progress. This paper explores how the presumed nihilistic tendency appearing in the ICZs destabilizes the liberal settlement, in reworking religious themes into secularity.

<p>Recently, scholars have begun to explore the democratic valences of M. Oakeshott's political thought. Commentators generally present him either as a skeptical and reluctant democrat or as an advocate of deliberative democracy. This article contends that Oakeshott criticizes some epistemological and substantive commitments that are characteristic of deliberative theories, yet his vision of democracy is more robust than skeptical readers admit. Using the themes of consensus and epistemic politics as points for comparison with the ideas of Oakeshott and deliberative democrats, I consider how his theory of civil association, critique of rationalism, and characterization of conversation as “the gist and meaning of democracy” speak to contemporary democratic theory. I conclude that he offers a pluralistic ethos, rather than a self-contained model, for democratic politics that has affinities with agonistic theories of democracy.

<p>Recent scholarship has linked the rise of the Progressive movement in America to the creation of an “administrative state”—a form of government where legislative, executive, and judicial powers are delegated into the hands of administrative agencies which compose a “headless fourth branch of government”, largely constructed during the New Deal period. The influential legal theorist R. Pound provides the paradoxical example of a Progressive who balked at the New Deal. While many commentators have concluded that Pound's opposition to the New Deal was based on a departure from his earlier Progressive thought, his opposition was in fact based on a consistent Progressive philosophy. Pound therefore provided a vision of an alternative administrative state, which would achieve the ends of the Progressive vision but without the means of the administrative state. [R]</p>

<p>This article compares the democratic thought and practice of two influential Shi'i Muslim theologians in Iran and Iraq. It argues that a new conception of Shi'i traditional authority has been developed by senior clerics H. Ali Montazeri and A. Sistani offering a new model of clerical authority closely connected to the democratic values of popular sovereignty and accountability: “democratic Usulism”. Such a new paradigm envisions a form of religious legitimization that is led by elected rulers who are ultimately “guided” by the sacred law of Islamic legal norms, while being held accountable to the people. The paradigm operates either as a counter-discourse to theocratic authoritarianism, currently prevalent in Iran, or as a democratic theology of citizenship and electoral participation, as in the case of Iraq.

<p>This article shows how the just war issue evolved in the history of political thought, and assesses its present relevance. The first part is devoted to its Roman and Christian roots of just war, an issue which cannot be easily transposed from ancient times to the modern ones, because of the emergence of religious wars and the rise of sovereign states. Grotius's doctrine regarded as an attempt to reach a synthesis between the classical theory of just war and the modern theory of the stat is explained. The author shows how the doctrine of just war was, in the early modern times, superseded by the theory of the balance of power, which appeared in the wake of the philosophical reflection on the Westphalia treaties. This doctrine, the classic formulation of which is to be found in Hegel's philosophy of law, has not necessarily displayed the discourse on justice, but it has substituted the just war paradigm for that of mutual recognition between states as a means to limit the consequences of war.

<p>Both J. Rawls and K. Walzer argue for a supreme emergency exemption and are commonly thought to do so for the same reasons. However, far from “aping” Walzer, Rawls engages in a reconstruction of the exemption that changes its focus altogether, making clear its dependence on an account of universal human rights and the idea of a well-ordered society. This paper is therefore, in the first instance, textual, demonstrating that Rawls has been misinterpreted in the case of supreme emergency. In the second instance, the approach is reconstructive, providing a reinterpretation of Rawls that fits his treatment of supreme emergency with his broader commitments in just war and international relations. This reinterpretation enables us to draw out a pattern of argument that Rawls appears to share with a much more strident liberal cosmopolitanism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4272]</p>

<p>This article argues that R.K. Ashley and R.B.J. Walker's “dissident exile” and J.S. Mill's “genius” are virtual mirror images of one another due to the fact that both subject formulations rely on the concept of individual autonomy. Postmodern iterations of subjectivity such as those found in the work of Ashley and Walker place a great deal of emphasis on alterity and ethical engagement, striving to move beyond the ethical limitations of Enlightenment liberalism that valorizes the atomized, sovereign individual. But both Mill's genius, who can choose his or her own mode of existence or plan of life, and Ashley and Walker's dissident exile, who engages in self-making in a register of freedom, are inextricably bound up with and reliant upon one of liberalism's seminal concepts: autonomy.

<p>The article argues that Islamic Revival can be read as the Muslim thinkers' and activists' critique of, and engagement with modernity. It further makes a case for multiple modernities and multiple Islamic discourses which have marked the last six decades of Muslim activism. Islamic Revival has gone through three distinct periods during this time. In each of these periods, the Revivalists have engaged in conversation with modernity, which manifests the co-constitutive nature of both Islamic Revival and modernity. During these conversations, both of these phenomena have been re-constituted and re-shaped by each other. In the third period, which we are still witnessing, the focus of Islamic Revival's conversation with modernity is on civic engagement and citizenship rights. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While S. Weil thought that the young Marx's celebration of labor had “lyrical accents”, she ultimately believed that Marx had neglected his own insights, embracing a blind worship of mechanization and a theory of history and revolution that was insufficiently attentive to the material conditions of workers. Marx, in her view, was insufficiently materialist and excessively wedded to a hierarchical model of science that maintained the domination of management. Weil and Marx's attitudes toward the dignity of labor and the necessary conditions for socialism are analyzed. The most significant cleavage between them is ultimately due to the differing manner in which they conceive of the relationship between thought and action. Through this comparison, the philosophical underpinnings of the two radically different conceptions of labor and its dignity as a human activity are explained. [R]</p>

One of the central questions is why Descartes chose to minimize the impact of political practice on cognitive structures? He challenges the rather capricious claim to Descartes's “liberal” views, as well as their implications. If revolutionary commentators and political activists have misinterpreted his political thought, there is a strong possibility that this is due to a fuzzy relation between Cartesian philosophy and politics.

<p>Political theorists who are interested in the Western republican tradition often interpret A.

I argue that the republican interpretation fails to understand Ferguson's view of human action and thereby obscures his potential contribution to liberal theory. This article offers a comprehensive account of Ferguson's concept of action, and emphasizes the instrumental and scientific aspects of his thought. Ferguson views politics as an accumulative project involving both political participation and non-political forms of activity. His thoughts on action and politics, therefore, reveal much about his view of the potential of non-political action and the ways it contributes to civil and political society.

<p>I examine A.J.

These assumptions, when combined with the strong correlativity and strict distinction theses, undermine Simmons's claim, which is central to his philosophical anarchism, that a state may be justified in enforcing the law, even if illegitimate or unjustified in existing.

<p>This article positions Rousseau within contemporary political theory's current engagements with nonlinear, non-teleological accounts of time. Although these seek to widen the pluralistic possibilities of politics through an affirmation of an irreducible future, I contend that, insofar as it speaks to our existential desire for coherency and continuity, the present is equally crucial to politics. Beyond his elaborations on history, Rousseau offers an account of time as dynamic and contingent. Amid such conditions, a unified existence is fundamental to survival. Yet, given that life is marked by a passing time, such a unity can never be fully secured. Rousseau's writings thus highlight the tension between the desire for temporal unity on the one hand, and the differentiated nature of our temporal lives on the other. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article demonstrates historically and statistically that conversionary Protestants (CPs) heavily influenced the rise and spread of stable democracy around the world. It argues that CPs were a crucial catalyst initiating the development and spread of religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, and colonial reforms, thereby creating the conditions that made stable democracy more likely. Statistically, the historic prevalence of Protestant missionaries explains about half the variation in democracy in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania and removes the impact of most variables that dominate current statistical research about democracy. The association between Protestant missions and democracy is consistent in different continents and subsamples, and it is robust to more than 50 controls and to instrumental variable analyses.

<p>Marxism, through Sinicization termed by Mao Zedong, has been the official ideology in China since 1949. The Sinicized Marxism has two negative aspects: (1) is de-theorization of Marxism—Marx's theoretical attitude or scientific honesty were abandoned and his doctrine was used only as politically strategic propaganda; (2) de-liberalization—Marx's ideal of liberty was alienated to be a totalitarian system while liberalization is condemned as capitalist. Since the reform and opening in 1978, both Marx's theoretical attitude and idea of freedom have been recovered to some extent, that can be called re-theorization and re-liberalization of Marxism, though this transformation is incomplete. A good example at hand is this article itself being prohibited in China due to its critique of Sinicized Marxism. [A] [First of two articles on “Chinese Marxism today”.
