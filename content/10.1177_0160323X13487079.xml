<abstract>
<p>The Great Recession has placed fiscal pressure on the states’ ability to finance capital projects. This research focuses on state capital budgeting practices as an important set of practices especially after the Great Recession. This analysis is based on the author’s survey of forty states in 2011–2012. By focusing on a state government’s policies and capital budgeting practices, this analysis is an evaluation of tendencies in capital budgeting processes across all states during the recent period of economic decline. This study expands knowledge of capital budgeting for practicing planners, developers, budget analytics, debt managers, and policy makers in the areas of regional collaborations, capital planning, and capital budgeting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The purpose of this article is to discuss capital budgeting practices in the states especially as practiced after the so-called Great Recession. First, this article presents an overview of survey data from forty states and categorizes them based on capital budgeting processes. Second, it extends understanding of those categories by focusing on additional differences in the organization of the capital budgeting processes in the states: these include capital planning, budget preparation, maintenance, and expenditures among others. Third, findings are discussed to suggest policy and other implications of the research for understanding the various techniques, methods, and improvements in capital budget preparation that are currently implemented by forty states.</p>
<p>Though some research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X13487079">Perlman 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X13487079">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X13487079">Dougherty and Klase 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X13487079">Cox 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13487079">Scorscone and Plerhoples 2010</xref>) has looked at the effects of the economic downturn on operating budgets in the states, this study aims to fill a descriptive gap in the current literature by presenting current capital budgeting processes during economic decline. Fiscal crises and crumbling infrastructures are major problems facing state governments, and there is a lack of literature that examines how the states cope with these capital challenges and pressures during economic decline. This research examines the similarities and differences in capital budgeting practices among forty states during the economic decline. By focusing on a state government’s policies and capital budgeting practices, this analysis is not only an evaluation of the individual states’ capital budgeting processes, but it is also an analysis of tendencies in the capital budgeting processes across all states during the recent period of economic decline. The study covers a variety of topics in capital budgeting such as coordination, facilities preservation, capital process management, priority setting, and project financing. First, a brief overview of the survey is provided. The next section explores the capital budgeting processes that states adopted during the recent economic decline. In the final section, established and ongoing improvements in capital budgeting are evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0160323X13487079">
<title>Overview of the Research</title>
<p>The last systematic survey of states capital budgeting practices was in 1999 (National Association of State Budget Officers [NASBO] 1999). The research reported here sought to update this knowledge and to answer the following baseline questions about capital budgeting processes in the states during the economic downturn: (1) how did different states set capital priorities during the recent economic downturn? (2) how did different states estimate capital expenditures? (3) what methods of investment analysis did states use? (4) what evaluation mechanism for the accuracy of capital budgets did states use? and (5) what factors are most important for preparing a capital budget in different states?</p>
<p>Data were gathered from multiple sources for this research including primary, secondary, and survey sources. First, a survey on capital budgeting was sent to budget officers in all fifty states. It covered the content of the capital plan, capital project selection processes, the project management system, maintenance planning, and funding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X13487079">1</xref></sup> The survey was initially sent on October 29, 2011, and by July 1, 2012, forty states had responded, a response rate of 80 percent. The nine-month lag period between sending the survey and responses was due to the intensive follow-up necessary to get states to respond. Second, in-depth personal interviews were conducted with senior executives from the state Budget Departments of the forty states responding. The specific titles of the interviewees varied from state to state, although most of them held positions as budget directors or budget analysts. Responses were transcribed and then e-mailed back to the interviewees for comment to ensure accuracy. Third, other secondary sources of information were analyzed, including data from state web sites, Bureau of Economic Analysis data, and NASBO reports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160323X13487079">
<title>Results: The Variety of State Capital Budgeting</title>
<p>As a baseline for budgetary practice, the 1999 NASBO report “Capital budgeting in the states,” indicated that eight states did not use a capital budget: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. One immediate impact of economic recession might be a change in the extent to which capital budgets are used by the states as fiscal resources are more closely watched. Another impact might be changes in the duration of capital budgets as states try to get a handle on planning horizons.</p>
<p>For example, six of the eight states that did not use capital budgets in 1999 (Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming) now have long-term capital budgets. Even though Texas does not have a separate capital budget document used specifically in the budget process, its Bond Review Board (BRB) is required to publish a capital expenditure plan, which contains capital planning information for projects that fall within four specific project areas. States use different durations for capital budgets. The data collected here indicate that the most common durations of the capital budget are two-year, five-year, and six-year capital plans. Only the State of New Jersey uses a nine-year capital budget.</p>
<p>Also, five states responding indicate that they now produce two capital budget documents (Arizona, Maryland, New York, Washington, and Texas). For example, Maryland produces the five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), also known as the Capital Budget Volume of the State Budget documents and the Consolidated Transportation Program or CTP. Arizona produces a one-year plan, the Executive Recommendation and Capital Outlay Bill, and a three-year plan, the Capital Improvement Plan. Texas has a two-year capital budget for items in the General Appropriation Act <italic>Capital Budget Riders</italic>; five years for projects in the Community Education Partner.</p>
<sec id="section4-0160323X13487079">
<title>Categories of State Capital Budgeting Practices</title>
<p>However, it is not just the decision to use a capital budget or its duration that informs about state capital budgeting behavior in reaction to the economic downturn. Rather, it is the way that capital budgets are used as part of the state’s overall budgeting process. An analysis of the data from respondents indicates that they employ capital budgeting differently, but that there are similarities in approaches which yield three main categories described by practices in specific state governments: (1) capital budgeting as part of operations; (2) capital budgeting as multiyear capital planning; and (3) capital budgeting as strategic capital management. These categories are distinguished by whether multiyear capital planning and financial forecasting are used for the state; the extent different capital financing sources are available and used; whether special formal reporting systems to track capital projects are used within the annual budget to review and to present major capital asset needs; the degree that mechanisms for evaluation of accuracy are used for capital spending; and if a project prioritization section is used in the capital budget.</p>

<title>Capital Budgeting as Part of Operations</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13487079">Table 1</xref>, the first category of capital budgeting is found in several states throughout the United States. Because it does not require a separate budget process, it is used where recurring capital needs are modest, and major capital projects arise infrequently. This is an improvement over folding capital budgets into operating budgets because it allows for greater separation of short-term and long-term expenditures in execution; however, the capital budgeting process still takes place mainly or entirely within the annual budget process.</p>

<p>
<sup>a</sup>Some states in this category do have parts of these features, but they do not have them at the threshold level used by the author for classification.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In this type of budgeting, procedures and formats used for budgeting assets are the same as those used for capital outlays within the operating or annual budget process. Appropriations for capital spending are usually made in the annual or operating budget ordinance. For example, in Hawaii, all capital appropriations are authorized for the biennium plus one fiscal year (i.e., first-year appropriations are authorized for two years). Some states use multiyear capital planning and financial forecasting for the state.</p>
<p>Also, in operational capital budgets, capital financing comes mainly or entirely from annual revenues and operating fund balances. The occasional large project is financed from these sources and paid by cash. North Dakota operates this way. Some state governments that operate this way, for example, North Carolina, West Virginia, issue general obligation (GO) bonds or other basic debt to finance major projects. In addition in this category, there are no formal reporting systems to track, plan, evaluate, and prioritize capital projects. If there is a large project, planning for it is project-specific and done by a consulting engineer or architect. These states have no special mechanism for evaluation of the accuracy in capital spending and do not have a project prioritization section in the capital budget. Examples of states doing this are North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Hawaii.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160323X13487079">
<title>Capital Budgeting as Midterm Capital Planning</title>
<p>Capital budgeting in this category takes place mainly or entirely within the multiyear capital planning process and capital expenditure decisions are based on a medium-term budget perspective. States reporting this type of budgeting are attempting to get better control over the impact of capital expenditures and their associated costs on the operating budget. Capital budgeting practices are significantly more developed than those in the previous category. They use multiyear capital planning and financial forecasting for the state. In most cases, capital improvement plans are of at least four years duration. Also, in this category, capital financing comes from multiple sources such as operating revenues and balances, earmarked revenues or reserves, and basic debt instruments such as GO bonds for general government projects and revenue bonds for enterprise projects; also used are general and lease- or installment-purchase agreements for equipment. Of the states shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13487079">Table 1</xref>, Maine uses a pay-as-you-go system, some states use pay-as-you-use financing system (Connecticut, Minnesota), and other states use mixed systems.</p>
<p>In this category, there is much greater coordination of capital budgeting with the operating budget thus permitting greater control of outlays by tracking impact of the former on the latter. Special formal reporting systems, formats, and procedures for requesting and reviewing major capital projects and acquisitions are developed and funded within the context of the operating or annual budget process. Capital budgeting is coordinated with the operating budget in several ways. First, each capital project or capital program that is funded with cash from any source is budgeted in the operating budget and subject to the constraints of the revenues that support such projects and programs. Second, each capital project request is accompanied with an operating budget impact statement to estimate the additional cost of opening new facilities or of renovating and expanding existing facilities. These estimates are either included in the annual operating budget or are used to forecast the cost of these facilities and their recurring impact on future state operating expenses. In some states, such as California, Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Nebraska, the evaluation of the operational costs of new facilities is incorporated into the evaluation of capital project proposals. In others, for example, Arizona, the operating or annual budget document is likely to have a special section that presents major capital projects and acquisitions that are up for approval and funding that year.</p>
<p>There are two other important innovations in this category both of which allow states to ensure that they are spending capital outlays on the right things and control the expenditures. The states in this category use sophisticated methods of estimating project costs such as national estimating guides professional cost estimators or estimates provided by departments’ architects and engineers, use project management systems, and have some type of formal mechanism to evaluate the accuracy of capital project spending. In these states, projects are ranked for funding according to priority order. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13487079">Table 1</xref>, some examples are Arizona, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160323X13487079">
<title>Capital Budgeting as Strategic Capital Management</title>
<p>In this category, capital budgeting practices reflect an attempt by states to not only control the impact of capital expenditures on operations but to engage in strategic capital management and ensure the best use of and price for capital outlays through controlling associated capital costs and ensuring the vetting, planning, follow-up, and feedback of capital projects. States in this category improve the capital budget process through specialization: they use a separate capital budgeting process that usually includes a State Board or Advisory Committee that submits its capital development recommendations and priorities to the Legislature for separate budgetary approval and prioritization.</p>
<p>Capital budgeting in this category has not only multiyear but also jurisdiction-wide capital planning, and includes network, and financial forecasting of capital needs. The planning capacity needed in this category is much stronger than in the previous one. A jurisdiction-wide, multiyear CIP is usually employed with an accompanying multiyear financial forecast. In these plans, capital construction budgets are expected to include preconstruction planning budgets as appropriate. Information on maintenance needs and deferred maintenance is also a required element of the capital construction budget. In states such as Indiana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and West Virginia, this planning information is used for long-term analysis and improvement. In some states such as Indiana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin, the State Board or Advisory Committee uses such information to make recommendations on behalf of all state agencies, commissions, departments, and institutions. In these cases, a budget director or budget officer is responsible for capacity generation and the flow of information within the Central Budget Agency and between agencies.</p>
<p>In this category, the sources of capital financing are multiyear special bond issues or income from dedicated or permanent funds. Capital financing comes from a wide variety of pay-as-you-go sources and debt sources and a complex system of strategic capital management. Also, unlike the previous category, and more importantly, this information is used in special budgeting procedures and additional formats are used for capital projects in a separate capital authorization and budget process providing more control over expenditures. For example, Act 876 of 1973 established “uniformity in operating and capital budget preparation, presentation and execution” among state agencies and made the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration share the responsibility for putting together budget information forms containing comparative fiscal data from the previous and current year, as well as the next two-year period, to aid state agencies in planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X13487079">2</xref></sup> California uses the Capital Outlay Project Tracking System. Florida uses Facilities Accountability Tracking System. Indiana created BudSTARS program for formal reporting system in 2009.</p>
<p>Additionally, the states in this category have special mechanisms to evaluate the accuracy of capital spending. They all use a project prioritization section in their capital budget. A variety of categories are used, with common ones being resource use and development (i.e., economic development), emergency situations, legal reasons, and health and safety considerations. Alaska, Indiana, and Virginia use health and safety, critical maintenance, improvements, and new construction as ranking categories to select projects. New York uses a ranking system based on categories such as permanent job creation, revenue producing, and risk assessment (i.e., any risks to the project in terms of scope, cost, time, safety, and social and environmental impacts).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160323X13487079">
<title>Organization of the Capital Planning Process</title>
<p>From a budgetary and capital planning standpoint, there are a number of state agencies that must work well together in varying degrees to coordinate the budgetary and capital reporting and approval process of state agencies. What kind of capital process is used and the factors involved are not the only important element; the way the process is organized to coordinate the involved state agencies and the responsibilities assigned to them in carrying out the support functions for the administration of capital budgets is another key area. Depending on the locale, various state agencies are involved in the capital budget development and administration process including the Governor’s Office, Legislative Budget Boards, Higher Education Coordinating Boards, Facilities Commission, and other agencies.</p>
<p>Through the input of information of these agencies, a Central Budget Office (CBO) develops program guidelines, instructions, and a formal application process for submitting capital project requests based on legislative mandates. As a rule, the CBO coordinates the submission of capital projects, develops the report, and determines the effect of the additional capital requests on the state’s budget and debt capacity. The completed plan is then forwarded for use in their development of recommended appropriations to the Legislature. The Legislature makes the final decision on which projects will be funded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0160323X13487079">
<title>Capital Project Data</title>
<p>One of the primary functions of the CBO is to collect and analyze information for the capital process. The CBO develops the Capital Projects Database (CPD), which is a statewide database used to capture agency capital project information and to track and monitor them. Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia have special CPDs which are applications used to secure and track funding for projects.</p>
<p>For example, Georgia’s Capital Budgeting Unit performs specialized financial, technical, and policy reviews and analyses related to the state’s major capital outlay projects and programs. The unit provides technical support and assistance by assisting budget divisions with review and analysis of specific projects for which funding is being requested or considered. The unit interacts directly with other state agencies involved in statewide capital issues and ongoing capital project planning, programming, design, construction, repair, and renovation activities. Massachusetts’s Executive Office for Administration and Finance administers the full five-year capital investment plan by major investment categories and also undertake a formal reassessment of capital investment needs to develop an annual update to the five-year capital plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160323X13487079">3</xref></sup> New York’s Division of the Budget has developed the CPD, which is a statewide, web-based, secure application that will be used to capture agency capital project information. The Texas BRB developed a formal process for submission of capital projects from all state agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0160323X13487079">
<title>Capital Expenditures</title>
<p>Control of capital expenditures is of paramount importance at any time, but especially when resources are scarce as after the current economic downturn. From an economic standpoint, capital expenditures have future utility, whereas operating expenditures produce benefits of limited duration. Capital investments are commitments of resources made with the expectation of realizing future benefits over a reasonably long period of time. From an accounting standpoint, capital expenditures almost always involve physical objects and are typically viewed as nonroutine. According to the Government Finance Officers Association, capital expenditures include those made for land, buildings, and major equipment that have significant value and a useful life of several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13487079">Rosenberg and Stallings 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, how states actually define what a capital project is depends on how they define capital expenditures and this definition varies widely. States define the types of expenditures allowed in capital budgets to include such items as construction, improvements, land acquisition, site improvements, major renovations, and equipment. Definitions of what constitutes a capital outlay range from the fairly standard, for example, the useful design life of a building, to twenty years in Hawaii, to forty years in Oregon, or even fifty years in Delaware. Some states define capital expenditure by size of outlays: for example, greater than $50,000 in West Virginia or $1,000,000 in South Carolina for a project that provides benefits beyond the immediate year. Other states like Alabama include what are normally considered operating outlays: a capital outlay is any item with a life span of more than one year. States responding to the survey differed in their definitions with twenty-six states specifying the anticipated useful life of a project and a minimum level of expenditure to define capital expenditures and fourteen states not specifying the useful life of a projector or a minimum level of expenditure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0160323X13487079">
<title>Maintenance</title>
<p>By dedicating more funding to maintenance of what is built or will be built, states can defer capital investment needs for repair and replacement and avoid larger, more expensive capital project needs in the future. A maintenance plan includes actions and expenditures that extend the useful life of the capital asset, including upgrades and replacements of building systems, such as structures, enclosures, mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems.</p>
<p>State budget agency respondents reported using different maintenance planning and financing policies. The majority of states (twenty-seven of forty respondents) classify routine maintenance as an operating expenditure and deferred or major maintenance as a capital expenditure. In Montana and New Jersey, maintenance has been moved from the capital budget and into the departments’ budgets since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008. Other states such as Alabama, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, South Dakota, Utah, and New York have developed a system to rate maintenance projects as part of the effort to preserve facilities. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services (DAS) uses an atypical maintenance financing system. DAS recovers funds for facilities preservation through its “uniform rent” charges to agencies. To accomplish this, mechanisms exist in statute for agencies to include what would effectively be an internal rent charge in their budgets. Agencies then could set aside these rents in a separate fund used to address capital maintenance needs, such as replacing systems at end of life cycle or providing ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p>Responding states include maintenance in various types of budgets: sixteen states (40 percent) include maintenance in the operating budget; six states (15 percent) include it in the capital budget; eleven states (27.5 percent) include most routine maintenance funding in the operating budget, but maintenance for building renewal in the capital budget. In addition, seven states treated maintenance separately in a separate appropriation bills or create special maintenance and repair budget. For example, Missouri treats maintenance separately within a separate appropriations bill.</p>
<p>Respondents Arizona, Minnesota, Hawaii, and Rhode Island include all routine maintenance funding in lump sum agency operating budgets. Nevada includes large maintenance projects in the capital budget; smaller maintenance projects are included in agency budgets. Hawaii also includes maintenance in the operating budget; however, major maintenance projects that are generally expected to last approximately twenty years may be included in the capital budget. South Dakota has an efficient system to track routine maintenance needs, for example, creates maintenance and repair budget. Utah actually budgets for each year, to the tune of 1.1 percent of the total replacement value of state-owned buildings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0160323X13487079">
<title>Capital Financing</title>
<p>The sources of capital financing are of equal if not greater importance than other factors in the organization of the capital process. Capital financing sources fall into three broad categories: pay-as-you-go financing, debt financing, and mixed system financing. Pay-as-you-go sources are comparable to equity financing of capital needs in the private sector. Such financing is raised through stock offerings or other contributions of capital by owners, partners, or stockholders. Pay-as-you-go financing for state government comes from taxes and other revenues or capital that are directly contributed by the taxpayers or citizens. Pay-as-you-go or equity finance stands in contrast to debt financing, where the state government or private firm borrows capital and incurs debt to finance capital projects and acquisitions. Also state agencies use pay-as-you-use systems that are debt financing. Mixed system financing is the combination of pay-as-you-use systems and pay-as-you-go. The ways these sources are financed can be seen on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X13487079">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Only four responding states (10 percent) used a pure pay-as-you-use system of financing. Only four (10 percent) states used a pure pay-as-you-go system. Most states, twenty-seven (67.5 percent), reported using a mixed financing system that includes elements of both types of financing. Five states (12.5 percent) did not respond.</p>
<p>Respondents also provided information on how the factors that are important for their decisions on what type of capital project financing to use. The most important factor is funding availability with thirty-one states or about 77.5 percent of respondents highlighting this factor. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160323X13487079">Table 3</xref>, twenty-one states responded that the most important factor is important for their capital project financing decisions was the type and life of the capital project. Fourteen states emphasized the importance of the size of a capital project, eight states highlighted life safety issue, and seven states focused on the importance of tax law for their decisions. Six states highlighted the urgency of a capital project. Among other factors are the following: (1) the number of permanent jobs anticipated; (2) deferred maintenance; (3) federal programs that are available; (4) court order, and (5) benefit to taxpayer.</p>

<p>In addition, twenty-five of the forty responding states (62.5 percent) indicated that they have limits on the amount of debt service. The other states do not have limits on debt, but instead have special guidelines. However, individual projects and bond issuance must be authorized by law. There are also capital investment guidelines that are used to measure state debt.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine of the forty responding states use various sources including working capital, revenue bonds, GOs, general fund taxes, special fund taxes, general revenue service charges, and general improvement funds. Only in North Dakota are capital projects paid by cash. Capital financing comes mainly or entirely from annual revenues and operating fund balances in North Dakota. Other sources of funding for the capital budget include federal funds primarily intended to reimburse transportation infrastructure improvements, federal funds pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which are targeted to specific capital purposes, and other sources of funding available to finance certain capital investment projects.</p>

<title>Preparation of the Capital Budget</title>
<p>One factor in the organization of the capital budget that can influence its efficiency and effectiveness is the method of preparation. As a rule, a capital budget begins with the state budget office preparing guidelines, forms, and procedures that are provided to individual state agencies to complete. Elements of the capital plan at the state level usually include: (1) capital needs and projections are based on current and projected statistics of capital inventories and on state demographic and economic conditions; (2) capital inventories encompass all state-financed capital programs; (3) the capital needs and projections are for a five-year period, with longer term projections presented for programs with reasonably predictable longer term needs; (4) capital needs and projections are presented independently of financing requirements or opportunities; (5) comprehensive cost and financing assessment; (6) the financial burden and funding opportunities of programs and of individual projects are presented in full, including federal, state, and local government shares, and any private participation; and (7) alternative methods of financing capital programs and projects are described and assessed, including debt financing and use of current revenues.</p>
<p>Although the survey findings indicate that the states use similar approaches to prepare their capital budgets, there are differences in preparation of the capital budget among the forty states responding. Also, there are similarities in how the states use CIPs to select the method used to finance capital projects. States use certain procedures to evaluate the accuracy of capital budget estimates presented in the capital plan. There are formal reporting systems to track capital projects in thirty-two states.</p>
<p>Respondents reported using different systems to handle unexpected portions of appropriations for projects that are not complete at fiscal year end. In Connecticut, funds are automatically carried forward. In Indiana, unexpended funds are encumbered and carried over to subsequent years until the project is complete. In California, Iowa, Nebraska, and Washington, the appropriations for investment projects are valid for several years. A third approach used, for example, in Arizona, involves state agencies requesting reappropriations of unexpended funds.</p>

<sec id="section14-0160323X13487079">
<title>Diffusion of Innovations</title>
<p>One important factor in the post economic downturn climate is whether or not states are learning from each other in capital budgeting. In short, are new practices being diffused? Analysis of responses from the survey did not indicate that innovations were being well diffused. Of the forty respondents, none indicated that they have adopted procedures or practices from another state for capital project prioritization, capital financing, or investment analysis; instead, they reported that they use their own practices and the advice of consulting firms.</p>
<p>However, even if they have not adopted best practices directly from others, respondents did point out that they were influenced by changes in practices and systems elsewhere. During the interviews, respondents indicated that they were definitely influenced by the new decisional and informational technologies developed in California, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Virginia. These have had some influence on thinking about a planning orientation in capital budgeting. Additionally, there has been evolution and integration in the role of the budget analyst. In an environment of economic decline, multiple organizations, and diffuse political power, budget officers are called upon to exercise facilitative and interpretive skills; they must coordinate multiple streams of information and agendas that are often divergent. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0160323X13487079">Table 4</xref> summarizes what state respondents considered the main influences on their capital budgeting practices of various administrative trends and innovations in capital budgeting.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sets out to improve knowledge about best practice in capital planning and budgeting in CBOs at the state level. It expands knowledge of capital budgeting for practicing planners, developers, budget analytics, debt managers, and policy makers in the areas of regional collaborations, capital planning, and capital budgeting.</p>
<p>At least two policy implications can be derived from the results of this analysis. First, understanding the best practices for capital planning, budgeting, and financing can help state policy makers design expenditure policy. By making the best practices of other states available to Executive Budget Directors, the research will contribute to greater efficiency in capital spending at the state level, and eventually improve the collaborative process at the state level across the United States. Budget analysts should employ specific strategies to be successful in the budgeting process. In my opinion, there is a need for strategic capital management in the public sector that will include long-range objective setting (LROS), forecasting, capital budgeting, capital planning, implementation, audit, and control. LROS refers to organizations creating goals and objectives for state agencies to achieve in the future; in this case, the prioritization section of the capital plan is very important. Forecasting refers to predicting the fiscal condition, the political situation, and environmental changes and trends. The states’ CBOs should start to use strategic management in capital investment programs.</p>
<p>The second important implication of this research concerns the low level of diffusion of administrative innovations in capital budgeting at the state level. All forty states’ budget directors, budget analysts, and debt managers answered that they had not adopted another state’s procedural practices for capital project prioritization, capital financing, or investment analysis. They use their own practice, in-house expertise, and the advice of private consulting firms. Collaboration initiatives have the potential to increase effectiveness of capital budgeting processes through a more intensive use of states’ “best practices.” The states of categories 1 and 2 should improve medium-term capital expenditure planning; highlight the prioritization and selection process, place an emphasis on improved governance through greater fiscal transparency and an enhanced financial and program accountability framework, improve budget making through a special decision-support computer system, develop a comprehensive analysis of capital budget needs, improve coordination with the operating budget, emphasize planning and execution of preventive maintenance, and improve cash-monitoring controls.</p>
<p>Finally, this study analyzes the capital budgeting process at the state level. The research on states’ capital budgeting can be combined with the research at the county and city level. Many of the capital budget systems now in operation in American cities were established in the 1940s. Many cities have improved their financial planning and budgetary decision making. Research on capital budgeting at the city and county level, in combination with state capital budgeting, would be fruitful.</p>
