<p>As more and more students from diverse backgrounds populate 21st century classrooms, and efforts mount to identify effective methods to teach these students, the need for pedagogical approaches that are culturally responsive intensifies.</p>
<attrib>—National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We have all witnessed the change in the diversity of the American classroom. Last year, in hopes of better reaching the diverse population in the elementary school where I teach, the school transformed to an inquiry-based learning approach in multi-age classrooms. While being a believer in John Dewey’s pragmatic philosophy of education and applying a hands-on approach in my classroom, I found the inquiry-based learning led students to a more worldly level of understanding. With the catalyst ignited in music class, interdisciplinary projects can arise, providing students a collaborative learning environment that allows them to delve deeper into music concepts through questions relevant to their interest and inspired by the original topic. The musical topic is strengthened through the network of research venues and subject areas that connect along the way. Student and teacher questions guide the pathway that incorporates the physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Although the catalyst is the same for all students, their response of interest and questions will vary, in turn enriching the entire class with more knowledge and experiences brought together by the students’ background.</p>
<p>It is what each student brings to the group through inquiry-based learning that provides the perfect setting for culturally diverse students. Researcher, Luis Moll from the University of Arizona, “reports on his research showing that students bring with them to school ‘funds of knowledge’ from their homes and communities that are valuable resources for teaching and learning” (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tolerance.org/tdsi/asset/explanation-funds-knowledge">http://www.tolerance.org/tdsi/asset/explanation-funds-knowledge</ext-link>). Indeed, inquiry-based education validates the importance of each child’s cultural diversity and community, brought to the learning process.</p>
<p>Our music classrooms are ripe for defusing cultural biases, bullying, and increased anxiety among cultural groups because of profiling. Cultures are introduced and explored through the beauty in and value of their arts. Indeed, cultural music becomes meaningful to a diverse classroom of students, when the music reflects those diversities and the students of those cultures contribute their expertise to the classroom learning. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312475067">2006</xref> report of the National Center for Culturally Responsive Educational Systems provides 10 specific activities for culturally-responsive instruction that are symbiotic with inquiry-based learning. The list includes items such as acknowledging students’ differences as well as their commonalities; validating students’ cultural identity in classroom practices and instructional materials; and fostering a positive interrelationship among students, their families, the community, and school; motivating students to become active participants in their learning; and educating students about the diversity of the world around them.</p>
<p>This September, my second/third grade classes were inspired to create their own Chinese Moon Festival on the night of the brightest moon of the year, September 29. Their catalyst was a Chinese song about the moon and the culture’s Mid-Autumn Festival. In 8 days, six classrooms of students brainstormed what they wanted to learn, divided into research groups, and generated myriad components for their celebration. On the beautifully moonlit Saturday night with a very culturally-diverse school and community population, all experienced a festival created by the students. The festival featured international Chinese students sharing legends about the moon, a university scientist explaining facts about the moon, students performing Chinese songs in Mandarin and English, a dragon dance featuring a 40-foot dragon made by and danced by two to three students with instruments, and a spectacular finale that sent families’ wishes into the air in 50 lit lanterns. The students and parents later went to the university observatory. The festival—integrated with music, art, language arts, science, and social studies—was attended by 300 family members. It was an amazing collaboration of school, community, university, and culture! Understanding the culture resulted in respect for Asian cultures and seeing commonalities and differences in their arts and lives.</p>
<p>Yet again, the importance of general music in the lives of all children (and adults) is demonstrated. Sharing the core of a culture in an educationally sound and ethically respectful experience does make the world a better place. Our work may never show up on standardized test scores, but it will make for more tolerant citizens. That hope drives all of us. Thank you again for your great work through music.</p>
