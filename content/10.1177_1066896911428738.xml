<abstract>
<p>Eccrine porocarcinoma is a potentially fatal form of sweat gland carcinoma, due to its propensity to metastasize through lymph vessels. The authors report the case of a 69-year-old female who presented with swelling of the right leg and an ulcerated lesion of the right great toe. The initial histologic diagnosis was invasive squamous cell carcinoma. On follow-up, the patient developed lymphangitic tumor spread in the right leg, associated with right inguinal lymphadenopathy and lesions in vulva and flank. Reevaluation of the toe lesion led to a revised diagnosis of eccrine porocarcinoma. The patient also had 2 basal cell carcinomas of the multicentric/superficial type in the skin overlying the left breast. Past history included chronic ingestion of liquore arsenic (Fowler’s solution) in early adulthood as treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare, aggressive, and potentially fatal type of sweat gland carcinoma. Most cases present in the lower extremities of elderly patients as a solitary nodule. Microscopically, the architecture is similar to that of its benign counterpart, that is, eccrine poroma, from which it is distinguished by the atypical cytology, mitotic activity, infiltrative pattern of growth, and lymphovascular permeation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911428738">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911428738"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911428738">4</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis also includes squamous cell carcinoma in situ (Bowen’s disease), melanoma in situ, and seborrheic keratosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911428738">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911428738">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chronic arsenic ingestion can induce several skin neoplasms, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen disease, and basal cell carcinoma. A single case of eccrine porocarcinoma in a patient with chronic exposure to arsenic is also on record.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911428738">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 69-year-old female presented with sudden swelling of the right leg in 2008. Leg ultrasound Doppler and abdomen ultrasound revealed enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes. A biopsy of 1 of these nodes in 2009 was diagnosed as a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for pancytokeratin and cytokeratin 34βE12, whereas they were negative for CEA and HMB-45. A biopsy of the lesion of the right great toe was initially reported as squamous cell carcinoma. This was followed by an amputation of the right great toe and right inguinal lymphadenectomy. The pathologic diagnosis rendered was ulcerated, invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the right great toe, associated with Bowen disease and metastases to 13 lymph nodes, with extranodal extension. In 2010, a left inguinal lymphadenopathy was detected, which was biopsied and diagnosed as metastasis of poorly differentiated carcinoma. In addition, a vulvar lesion in the labius majus was removed and interpreted as invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the lymph node and vulvar tumors were focally positive for p63 but negative for PAX-8, p16, and high-risk HPV. The inguinal metastasis was negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor whereas focally positive for GCDFP-15. The toe lesion was negative for cytokeratin 7, ER, PR, and D2-40, whereas the vulvar tumor and the inguinal metastasis were strongly positive for cytokeratin 7.</p>
<p>In 2011, a biopsy of a lesion in the skin of the right flank was diagnosed as lymphatic permeation by carcinoma of possible skin adnexal origin. The tumor cells were inmunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER-2-new, and CDX-2. There was also a skin lesion overlying the left breast having the typical microscopic features of basal cell carcinoma of the so-called multicentric or superficial type.</p>
<p>Reevaluation of the right toe lesion led to a revised diagnosis of eccrine porocarcinoma with lymphatic permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911428738">Figure 1</xref>), associated with Bowen’s disease of the adjacent epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911428738">Figure 2</xref>). The tumors in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911428738">Figure 3</xref>), vulva, and skin of the right flank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911428738">Figure 4</xref>) were morphologically similar to the tumor of the right toe.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In 1963, Pinkus and Mehregan described a malignant skin tumor associated with epidermotropism and lymph node metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911428738">5</xref></sup> The authors commented on the extensive pagetoid spread and the atypical cytological features. They concluded that the neoplasm was likely to be eccrine in origin and proposed for it the term <italic>eccrine porocarcinoma</italic> (malignant eccrine poroma).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911428738">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Numerous examples of this tumor type were subsequently described, most of them associated with local aggressive disease and metastases. Some of the tumors were related to previous radiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the reported cases of eccrine porocarcinoma were located in the lower extremities of elderly patients, though the trunk and head were sometimes also affected. There are also occasional reports in children and adolescents. The tumor has an almost equal gender distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911428738">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Microscopically, the architecture is similar to that of eccrine poroma, but the tumor differs from it by the presence of atypia, high mitotic activity, infiltrative growth, tumor necrosis, and perineural and/or vascular invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911428738">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911428738">2</xref></sup> There is usually an intraepidermal component. Cases have been reported in the past as malignant hidroacantoma simplex and have been included into the generic category of Borst-Jadasson lesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911428738">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911428738">6</xref></sup> They are typically composed of nests of atypical epithelial cells with eccrine differentiation. The ductal differentiation may vary from intracytoplasmic lumina to mature ducts with an eosinophilic cuticle bordered by clearly malignant epithelial cells. The intracytoplasmic lumina are irregular in shape, small, and ill formed. It is difficult to distinguish between apocrine and eccrine tumors on the basis of the morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911428738">6</xref></sup> The invasive component consists of scattered islands of atypical epithelial cells within the dermis.</p>
<p>The main entities to be considered in the microscopic differential diagnosis are Bowen disease, seborrheic keratosis, and melanoma in situ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911428738">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911428738"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911428738">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911428738">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that this patient had been subjected to chronic arsenic administration for years is of interest. Epidemiologic work has demonstrated that the administration of large doses of arsenic over long periods leads to an increased risk of cancer of skin, liver, hematopoetic system, lung, and urinary tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911428738">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911428738">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911428738">8</xref></sup> Skin manifestations of arsenicism include transverse whitish fingernail bands (Mees’s lines), erythema, urticaria, hyperpigmented patches, hyperkeratosis of palm and soles, diffuse alopecia, acrodermatitis, and a variety of skin neoplasms, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen disease, and basal cell carcinoma. We have been able to find only a single previously reported case of eccrine porocarcinoma in a patient exposed to arsenic, and we wish to record here a second instance of this life-threatening phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911428738">4</xref></sup> The tumor, which was associated with multiple Bowen’s disease, developed in a 58-year-old male patient from Tainan County, Taiwan, a region known to have a high concentration of arsenic in the underground water. It appeared as a long-standing red nodule on the left chest wall. In addition, several cutaneous signs of arsenicism were noticed, including hyperkeratosis of palms and soles and alternating hyperpignmentation and depigmentation. The arsenic concentration in the whole blood was 49 ng/mL (normal value = &lt;20 ng/mL).</p>
<p>Carcinomatous lymphangitis (CL) refers to the diffuse infiltration and obstruction of lymphatic channels by tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911428738">9</xref></sup> Several types of neoplasms can cause CL, the most common being those from breast, stomach, lung, pancreas, skin, and female genital tract. Various terms have been used for this phenomenon, including malignant lymphedema, carcinomatous lymphangitis, metastasis cutis, and carcinomatous erysipelas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911428738">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911428738">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinically, CL can assume the appearance of dermatitis, erysipela, nodular lesions, or—more commonly— lymphedema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911428738">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911428738">10</xref></sup> Microscopically, CL is characterized by extensive dermal and subcutaneous invasion of lymph vessels by cords of tumor cells.</p>
<p>The temporal and topographic relationship between the eccrine porocarcinoma and the CL support the interpretation that the former was the source of the latter and that the tumors in both inguinal lymph node regions and vulva represent further expression of metastatic spread from the toe tumor. This is also supported by the close morphologic similarities among these various lesions. The negativity for cytokeratin 7 in the eccrine porocarcinoma and the positivity of this marker in the other sites can be explained on the basis of phenotypic heterogeneity.</p>
