<p>The crisis countdown clock is ticking: a super storm approaches a major metropolitan area, threatening death and widespread destruction. A defective automated control mechanism switches a high-speed commuter train onto the wrong track. A doctor completes the final stitches of a surgical procedure, accidently leaving a sponge inside the patient. A nonprofit organization for troubled youths decides to cover up the fact that an adult male volunteer for years took liberties with children he was entrusted to help.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Four Stages of Highly Effective Crisis Management: How to Manage the Media in the Digital Age</italic>, strategic and crisis communication consultant Jane Jordan-Meier examines how the changing dynamics of mainstream and social media are affecting crisis communication. In addition, she offers advice on what to do when the stuff hits the fan. The book is divided into five sections that examine a range of issues from the role of the news media in crisis to a discussion of when to use the CEO as a spokesperson.</p>
<p>Section I begins with the question, “What is a crisis?” For the answer, Jordan-Meier cites the Institute for Crisis Management, which defines a crisis as “a significant business disruption, which stimulates extensive news media coverage. The resulting public scrutiny will affect the organization’s normal business operations and could also have a political, legal, financial and government impact on business.”</p>
<p>The author notes that a crisis often smolders as an “issue hidden or unfixed” in organizations until activated by triggering events; in fact, she says three-fourths of all crises begin as such smoldering issues. Jordan-Meier references a fifteen-year study of best practices in communication management by longtime public relations scholar James E. Grunig of the University of Wisconsin. Conducted for the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) Research Foundation, a key finding of Grunig’s study was that crises frequently occur in the absence of effective issues management.</p>
<p>In section II, Jordan-Meier identifies and examines the four stages of crises. Stage 1, “Fact Finding,” is characterized by intense media focus. In this stage, basic facts are made known, confirmed and reported. Her stage 2, “The Unfolding Drama,” is where media attention turns to the key players at the center of the crisis. As organizations grapple to control events, experts and “unofficial spokespeople” on the periphery of the crisis begin to talk and speculate on what might have happened. The author notes that in this stage, crises often go viral, fueled by the speed and reach of social media such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>
<p>In stage 3, “Finger Pointing,” Jordan-Meier says the news media attempt to assign blame to anyone who could be perceived as responsible for the crisis. This is a particularly hazardous phase for organizations, she says, writing that in this stage, crisis responders must act appropriately and quickly:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone has an opinion about you, your product, your organization, your industry, even your country. . . . The lesson in stage three is to manage stage two well—very well! Never wait until you have the right information to speak or think that your brand can withstand the public scrutiny. Reality is that it can’t.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stage 4, “Resolution and Fallout,” signals the gradual end of a crisis. However, communicators should remain alert on the chance that another similar crisis ignites, refocusing unwanted attention on them and their organization.</p>
<p>One important takeaway from Jordan-Meier’s book is that crises happen every day and often dominate headlines of traditional and social media. Consequently, organizations should plan, prepare, and exercise crisis plans so that staff know how to respond as events unfold. In addition, communicators must anticipate the intensity of media and public attention and be prepared to address stakeholder concerns to prevent or lessen damage to organizational trust. This is hardly original advice, but it is an important reminder about being prepared and nimble.</p>
<p>With each new scandal, the literature of crisis communication grows—much of it restating what has been written before. <italic>The Four Stages of Highly Effective Crisis Management</italic> is refreshing in that it examines crisis communication from the perspective of a practitioner who has helped real-world clients successfully navigate the seas of uncertainty as events spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>Readers will find lots of helpful advice on how best to manage social media in the twenty-first century, when anyone with a blog can be a journalist. In addition, the book contains a trove of case studies that demonstrate how social media allow a global audience to not only consume the news, but also actively influence events as they are happening.</p>
<p><italic>The Four Stages of Highly Effective Crisis Management</italic> is a practical examination of crisis communication, the role of the news media, and what steps communicators should take to avoid disaster. It is well researched and well worth reading by students, academics, and professional communicators alike.</p>
