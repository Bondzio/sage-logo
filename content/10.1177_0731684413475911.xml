<abstract>
<p>Natural fibers are low-cost fibers with low density and high specific properties. These fibers are biodegradable and non-abrasive. The natural fiber composites offer unique properties comparable to those of conventional synthetic fiber composites. However, development of these composites is often hampered by weak compatibility between fibers and polymer matrix and poor thermal resistance, which often reduce their performance. This paper reports thermal properties and flammability of cotton/vinyl ester composites containing some flame retardant materials such as ammonium molybdate, aluminum trihydroxide, antimony trioxide and Chlorez tested by thermogravimetric analysis and flame retardancy. Addition of ﬂame retardants to cotton/vinyl ester composites reduced burning rate and produced a self-extinguishing flame in some flame-resistant systems. In addition, alkali treatment of cotton fibers using 15% NaOH solution was conducted to improve compatibility of cotton fibers and vinyl ester resin. Tensile test indicated that the treated cotton fibers improved the interfacial bonding and enhanced elongation-at-break of the composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684413475911" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glass fiber-reinforced polymer composites have been widely used in aerospace, marine and automotive structures due to their high strength and stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413475911">1</xref></sup> However, in the last few decades, natural fibers such as cotton, jute, flax and sisal have emerged as alternative reinforcing fibers in various applications of polymer composites due to their advantages over synthetic fibers e.g., low cost, less tool wear during processing, low density, environmental friendly, biodegradability and availability from renewable resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413475911">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, natural fibers have attracted the attention of engineers and technologists for application in consumer goods, low-cost housing and other civil structures. These composites, called bio-composites, possess high specific strength and stiffness, good thermal and acoustic insulating properties and high resistance to fracture. However, the main concern about natural fiber/polymer composite applications is low compatibility between hydrophilic natural fibers and the hydrophobic matrix that makes the use of compatibilizers or coupling agents or surface treatments such as alkali treatment in order to improve their mutual adhesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413475911">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413475911">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cotton fibers are the most important natural vegetable textile fibers used in spinning to produce apparel, home furnishings and industrial products. Cotton fibers are rich in cellulose and composed of approximately 82–92% cellulose and 2.6–5.7% hemicellulose, but they do not have lignin. These fibers have the most breaking elongation among natural cellulose fibers as well as density of 1.5–1.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<sup>5,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413475911">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vinyl ester is most commonly used in natural fiber/polymer composites, which combine the fast and good cross-linking tendency of unsaturated polyesters with the mechanical and thermal properties of epoxies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413475911">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413475911">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nowadays, extensive research works are reported on thermal and mechanical properties of vinyl ester resin composite reinforced with treated or untreated natural fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413475911">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413475911">10</xref></sup> The mechanical properties of vinyl ester resin matrix composites reinforced with 5% NaOH-treated jute fibers at room temperature for varying times were investigated by Ray et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413475911">11</xref></sup> They concluded that for 35 vol% composites with 4 h treated fibers, the flexural strength increased by 20%, modulus improved by 23% and laminar shear strength increased by 19%. Mohamed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413475911">12</xref></sup> have reported treatment of pineapple leaf fibers (PALF) by solution of sodium hypochlorite which resulted in enhanced mechanical properties, reduced water absorption and increased thermal stability of PALF-reinforced vinyl ester composites.</p>
<p>Flame retardancy of natural fiber/polymer composites is another important topic because of easy flammability of both natural fibers and plastics and demands of fire protection in their use. The ﬂame resistance of polymers or natural fiber/polymer composites can be improved by the addition of flame retardants (FRs). A number of FRs for polymers have been developed, and many of these are suitable for use in fibers. Halogen-containing FRs have been used in engineering thermoplastics and epoxy resins to improve their thermal stability and fire performance. Also, aluminum trihydroxide [Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>] and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>] are the most widely used as metal hydroxide ﬂame retardant additives for polymers which act by heat absorption through endothermic decomposition.</p>
<p>The most common method for adding FRs is blending ﬂame retardant filler compounds into a polymer or polymer composite during processing. There are other methods for improving ﬂame resistance of composites, including fire retardant coating of the composites at the finishing stage and impregnation or modification of lignocellulosic particles or fibers with FRs before the manufacturing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413475911">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413475911">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the utilizations of natural fiber/polymer composites is in aerospace technology, which we reported in our previous paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413475911">15</xref></sup> by using cotton/epoxy composite as inhibitor for solid propellants.</p>
<p>We introduced the cotton/vinyl ester composite as inhibitor application, too. Therefore, one of the objectives of this work was to evaluate the effects of different fire resistant materials added to matrix of cotton/vinyl ester composite by thermal analysis such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and burning test. The other aim of research was to study the effect of alkali treatment of cotton fibers on mechanical behavior of cotton/vinyl ester composite by tensile test (specimens were tested without addition of FRs to the matrix).</p>

<sec id="sec3-0731684413475911" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Cotton fiber yarn as reinforcement was obtained from Iranian Farnakh Company and vinyl ester resin (Derakane 470-300) with 33 wt% styrene as solvent used as matrix was supplied by Ashland Company from USA. Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) and cobalt naphthenate (Co Nap) were used as the catalyst and accelerator, respectively. Flame retardant materials consisting of antimony trioxide (Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum trihydroxide (ATH), ammonium molybdate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>) and zinc hydroxystannate (ZHS, chemical formula ZnSn(OH)<sub>6</sub>, particle size of 5 µm) were purchased from Merck. Chlorez 700 (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>19</sub>Cl<sub>7</sub>, chlorine content of 70%, white powder, particles smaller than 50 mesh) is a chlorinated paraffin and compatible with vinyl ester resin which was obtained from Dover Chemical Corporation, USA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684413475911"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>In order to proceed with alkali treatment of cotton fiber, the fibers were immersed in 15% NaOH solution at 30℃ for 5 min. Then, fibers were washed several times with fresh water to remove any NaOH adhered onto the fiber surface, neutralized with dilute acetic acid and finally washed again with distilled water. The fibers were dried by oven at 90℃ for 1 h.</p>
<p>Composite samples were prepared by filament winding technique as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413475911">Figure 1</xref>, schematically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413475911">16</xref></sup> The impregnation bath contained various composition materials for different flame retardant systems prepared as formulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413475911">Table 1</xref>. It is noteworthy that flame retardant powders consisted of mixed vinyl ester resins using a homogenizer at 1000 r/min for 20 min before adding the catalyst (1.5 wt% MEKP) and the accelerator (0.1 wt% Co Nap). The cotton fibers were passed through the impregnation bath and wound hoop (±89°) to the cylindrical mandrel. It is worthwhile to note that for preparation of flat samples such as tensile test samples the cotton fibers were wound hoop to the cubic mandrel at the same fiber volume fraction of 30%. For the curing process, the specimens were held in room temperature for 24 h and then, heated in oven at 80℃ for 4 h according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

<p>Effect of fiber treatment on bonding performance of the fibers and resin was evaluated by tensile test. Tensile properties of untreated and treated cotton fiber reinforced vinyl ester composites (without flame retardant materials) were performed by Universal testing machine, Instron 8502. The dimensions of specimens were 230 mm (length) × 25 mm (width) × 2.5 mm (thickness) and cross-head speed during the test was 1.5 mm/min. Five specimens for each untreated and treated cotton fiber composites were tested.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0731684413475911"><title>Thermal analysis</title>
<p>TGA was conducted by a Pyris Diamond-S2 at a heating rate of 10 Kmin<sup>−1</sup> under nitrogen atmosphere for determination of thermal decomposition temperatures. About 5–10 mg of sample was used in each test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0731684413475911"><title>Flame retardant test</title>
<p>Flammability of cotton/vinyl ester composites was tested for estimation of burning rate in accordance with ASTM D635. In the horizontal burning test, specimen with dimension of 125 × 13 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> in length, width and thickness was held horizontally. After igniting the sample for 30 s, the burner was eliminated and the time for the flame to reach from the first reference mark, i.e. 25 mm from the end, to the second reference mark, i.e. 100 mm from the end, was recorded and then burning rate of specimen was calculated. It was noted that, according to the standard method, when the flame did not reach the second reference mark, it was considered as a self-extinguishing flame and for this case the burning time and distance from the first reference mark were recorded. In case the flame did not reach or pass a reference mark of 25 mm, it was considered as a self-extinguishing flame, too.</p>

<p>The results showed that alkali-treated composites were more ductile, as the tensile strength and breaking strain improved by 5 and 25%, respectively, for treated composites. Improvement in strain-to-failure is possibly attributed to increased hydrogen bonding between the more accessible hydroxyl groups of the hemicelluloses in the non-crystalline region of the cotton fiber and resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413475911">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, alkali treatment was led to swollen and low-twisted cotton fibers which resulted in increasing of breaking strain. In addition, during alkali treatment hemicellulose, pectin, waxes and impurities present on fiber surface were removed. The removal of these compounds enhanced the surface roughness, which allowed mechanical interlocking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413475911">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413475911"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413475911">19</xref></sup> Although, mechanical properties were enhanced in case of treated fiber composites, where all specimens showed that, but this improvement predictably was not considerable for the fibers’ mechanical properties, because of the lack of lignin and low content of hemicellulose in cotton fiber composition.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0731684413475911"><title>Thermal analysis</title>
<p>An effective flame retardant action is indicated by the high thermal stability of the polymer and composite, i.e. high decomposition temperature and high char residue. The TGA and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves were used to determine the thermal behavior such as weight loss, residual char level and to identify the decomposition of material at a certain temperature, respectively. The degradation behavior of cotton fiber as reinforcement and vinyl ester resin as matrix were investigated by TGA graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413475911">Figure 3</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413475911">Figure 3</xref>, there is an initial weight loss of 8% in cotton fiber below 100℃ that may be attributed to elimination of moisture. Major weight loss took place during α-cellulose decomposition, as a principle component of cotton fibers, at 345℃. Finally, a residual char level of 19% was obtained. In the TGA curve of the neat vinyl ester resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413475911">Figure 3</xref>) the main weight loss started at 355℃ and reached maximum at 415℃. The residual char was determined to be 7% at 600℃.

As the resin content of the composite was higher (70 vol%) than the fiber content (30 vol%), the resin degradation peak was more prominent than the fiber peak, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413475911">Figure 4</xref>.

</p>
<p>The reaction absorbs heat produced by the burning material and creates a heat sink which causes a reduction in the temperature. Moreover, the water released during decomposition cools down the material and increases ignition time. It also restricts the access of oxygen to the composite surface and dilutes the concentration of flammable gases evolved.<sup>22</sup> In addition, produced Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can act as a protective layer by keeping heat away from the flame.</p>
<p>Thermal analysis of the 20AM composite is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413475911">Figure 7</xref>. The first peak at 100℃ is related to water elimination. In the following, a major weight loss was commenced at 294℃ and reached a maximum rate of 300 µg min<sup>−1</sup> at 350℃. This weight loss was due to degradation of ammonium molybdate as well as degradation of fiber which their degradation peaks being overlapped. The next major weight loss was detected by degradation of vinyl ester resin at 384℃. Finally, ammonium molybdate increased the residual char up to 29%.
<fig id="fig7-0731684413475911" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of 20AM cotton/vinyl ester composite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684413475911-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In thermal degradation process, ammonium molybdate restrains smoke and separates the original material from the flame by forming a stable char layer on the composite surface. Furthermore, it has thermal stability and can sustain higher temperatures. These lead to slower flame spread.</p>
<p>Finally, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413475911">Figure 8</xref>, thermal decomposition of the 15CL/5ATO/10AM/10ATH sample was investigated. The initial peak, which appeared at 100℃, was due to the removal of moisture. The next following peaks were attributed to decomposition of Chlorez at 295℃ and degradation of resin at 408℃. The rates of degradation were the same, approximately, 365 µg min<sup>−1</sup>. Residual char level was 25.8%.</p>
<p>ATH is often used at higher concentration, therefore, in this sample containing 10 wt% ATH, it is realized that ATH does has not have remarkable effect on flammability resistance. Besides, 10 wt% ammonium molybdate did not contribute much to charring.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413475911">Table 3</xref>, it is obvious that the 20AM composite specimen showed a high initial temperature of the thermal degradation. Furthermore, it is clear that the addition of FRs has lowered the weight losses of specimens and therefore increased the values of residual char, e.g., the presence of FRs enhanced charring up to 41% related to the 20AM sample compared with the UFR sample. This sample by a good ability of char formation resulted in the highest amount of residual char even more than sample containing 40 wt% of different FRs as well as a dense structure.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the amounts of residual char given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413475911">Table 3</xref> were estimated at 600℃ without the presence of inorganic materials, such as antimony trioxide and ferric oxide.</p>

<p>As it is evident, the UFR composite specimen has the highest burning rate. Although addition of 5 wt% ammonium molybdate, as flame retardant for cotton/vinyl ester composite, reduced the burning rate, it is clear that this value is not a sufficient amount. Hence, 20 wt% of ammonium molybdate was employed and resulted in further reduction in ignition rate, as flame was extinguished before reaching the second reference mark.</p>
<p>In the 30ATH composite specimen, endothermic decomposition of ATH absorbed heat and kept cooler the surrounding polymer. Therefore, flame was put out before arriving at the second reference mark. Of course, it is observed that 30 wt% of ATH is a minimum level to obtain flame retardancy for composite specimen, and it should be used in higher content. However, at high level of ATH it brings about increases in viscosity of vinyl ester resin which is not recommended for practical reasons. This problem was solved by replacement of 15 wt% of ATH by 5 wt% of an effective flame retardant, ZHS. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413475911">Table 4</xref>, this replacement lowered the burning rate extremely, so flame did not pass the first reference mark (25 mm) and it was extinguished.</p>
<p>In the 15CL/5ATO specimen, Chlorez, known as halogen-based flame retardant, operated in-the gas phase, replacing the high-energy free radicals responsible for flame propagation by more stable species, such as Cl<sup>−</sup>, thus quenching the flame. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413475911">Figure 9</xref> shows this specimen during the horizontal burning test. It can be observed that the flame after taking away of burner from the sample did not extend a lot and it was extinguished before reaching the first reference mark.

<p>As reported by Barbosa et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413475911">23</xref></sup> the burning rate of PE/CL (3 wt% of Chlorez) compared to PE matrix was reduced by diluting the volatile combustibles of the flame after decomposition of the used flame retardant and suggesting of a protective oxide char of the product surface, and reducing the oxygen diffusion for the reactive center. Jang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413475911">24</xref></sup> also reported that the inorganic flame retardant (ATH) had little flame-retardant effect on the paper-sludge/phenolic composite in comparison to halogenated flame retardant.</p>
<p>Antimony trioxide is a weak flame retardant when used alone, but when it is used with halogenated FRs its retarding efficiency is dramatically improved. This improvement is due to synergistic action mechanisms of flame retardancy of the halogen and antimony oxide. Antimony oxide reacts with the hydracids (HCl or HBr) generated by the halogenated ﬂame retardants to form antimony oxyhalides, which are much heavier than the native hydracids, thus prolonging their residence time in the ﬂame. All of these oxyhalides lead to the formation of SbCl<sub>3</sub> or SbBr<sub>3</sub>, which act as scavengers of “hot” radicals such as H<sup>•</sup> and OH<sup>•</sup> radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413475911">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413475911">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413475911">Table 4</xref>, the 15CL/5ATO/10AM/10ATH specimen demonstrated the same flammability behavior in comparison with the 15CL/5ATO sample and it showed self-extinguishing flame, too.</p>
<p>The selection of a flame retardant for a polymer composite is determined by several factors, including cost, chemical compatibility between the flame retardant compound and host polymer, decomposition temperature of the compound and weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413475911">20</xref></sup> Therefore, it was found that 15 wt% Chlorez and 5 wt% antimony trioxide were comparatively suitable for flame retarding of cotton fiber reinforced vinyl ester composite as inhibitor.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0731684413475911" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Thermal and mechanical behavior of cotton fibers-reinforced vinyl ester composite was documented with particular focus on the effects of type and content of flame retardant materials and alkali-treated fibers. The following conclusions are drawn from experimental results.</p>
<p>Treatment of natural fibers with NaOH plays a major role in improving the interfacial adhesion between fibers and matrix thus enhancing the mechanical properties. It is clear that the use of alkali-treated cotton fiber to reinforce vinyl ester resin improved tensile strength and elongation-at-break of composite by 5% and 25%, respectively, compared with untreated cotton fiber composite. It happened due to removal of wax and oils covering the external surface of the cotton fibers which led to an increase in surface roughness. In addition, the removal of hemicellulose increased the amount of cellulose exposed on the fiber surface resulting in enhanced possible reaction sites. Consequently, alkaline treatment caused to improve the wetting of fibers and adhesion characteristics.</p>
<p>Thermoanalytical methods demonstrate that additives alter the degradation profile of the polymer composites. For example, weight loss and residual char level and decomposition temperature of composite specimens changed by addition of different FRs. A 20 wt% of ammonium molybdate reduced the weight losses of specimen and therefore increased the value of residual char up to 41% at 600℃. This sample resulted in highest amounts of residual char even more than sample containing 40 wt% of different FRs. Therefore, ammonium molybdate acted as a char formation promoter.</p>
<p>Ammonium molybdate by favorable charring, ATH by producing water and slowing down the heat generation and Chlorez as a chlorinated flame retardant substance by producing non-flammable gasses retarded the combustion process. Finally, the 15CL/5ATO specimen led to a delay in burning time and a desirable flammability behavior, which was selected as fire retardant system of cotton/vinyl ester composite.</p>
