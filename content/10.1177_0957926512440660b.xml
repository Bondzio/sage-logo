<p><italic>Political Myth</italic> provides the missing link between biblical studies and political theory. Roland Boer develops a political myth for the Left: a powerful narrative to be controlled in support of progressive policy. He focuses on the Genesis–Joshua narratives as the foundational political myth in representations of Israel, the foreign policies of the USA and Australia, and their relations with Israel. He demonstrates how a serious look at the Bible is unavoidable today when religion and myth have returned as topics of serious debate. This book is made up of seven chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 develops a theory of political myth in dialogue with Ernst Bloch, Theodor Adorno, Alain Badiou, Jacques Lacan, and Slavoj Žižek. The author proposes that ‘myth is the labyrinth of language’ (p. 16). He maintains that ‘political myth involves the construction of labyrinthine eschatological worlds characterized by a dialectic of reaction and subversion’ (p. 34). Myth becomes the way a political economic system is shored up and justified, the way dissent and tensions are managed, the means by which revolution is curtailed, warnings issued about the consequences of such radical change, or even blatant propaganda for reaction. For these reasons, Chapters 5 and 6 explore the ways political myth operates in reactionary political agendas in a number of contemporary instances, especially in Australia and the USA.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 deals with feminism and argues that there is a legacy of primitive communism and the persistence of that legacy in the myths underlying Genesis–Joshua. Chapter 3 focuses on Freudian psychoanalysis and uses the central category of fantasy to describe political myth. Chapter 4 touches upon Marxism and uncovers the deeper logic of political myths, where</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>each system operates in terms of an ideal or utopian projection of what it might be. The key to realizing that ideal is overcoming some obstruction or other. The catch is that the obstruction or limit is precisely what makes the system work, its necessary limit. Should the ideal be realized, the system would in fact collapse. (p. 115)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, myth attempts an impossible resolution and represents the blockage in narrative form as something that prevents the ideal from being realized.</p>
<p>The final three chapters (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) move from an analysis of the political master myth of Genesis–Joshua to current politics, especially foreign policy. Chapter 5 seeks to show the way the deeper logic of the biblical political myth appeared in the fantasy of Israel. The author analyzes speeches by key politicians in the liberal–conservative government of Australia (1996–2007). He finds that, in their hands, the fantasy of Israel is a Christian fantasy of Australia in which Islam and Judaism itself are excluded. Chapter 6 follows a similar approach and focuses on speeches by US politicians which reconstruct the fantasy of Israel as a myth that embodies the values of freedom, democracy, the free market, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 elaborates the final stage in the development of political myth from the Hebrew master myth of the State-in-waiting to the Christian capitalist fantasy. It tells the underside of this political myth of a capitalist cornucopia by focusing on the crucial contradiction of this myth, namely, the contradiction between unlimited capitalism and a limited planet.</p>
<p>This book certainly gives readers more tools in the context of the secular and religious Left for thinking about biblical studies and political theory than previous works on political myth. The author deconstructs contemporary geopolitical discourse and argues for a new political myth of and for the Left. Through close readings of well-known biblical stories, the author examines the nature of political myth in light of feminism, psychoanalysis, and Marxism. At the same time, he studies the statements of prominent American and Australian politicians to show how the stories of Creation, conquest, Paradise, and the Promised Land have been distorted into a fantasy of Israel as a perpetual state-in-the-making and a land in need of protection. He argues that this fantasy of Israel shapes US and Australian foreign and domestic policies, and he highlights the links between it and unconstrained global capitalism. Political myths provide a source for the continued determination of the political movements in question, despite repeated setbacks and failures. In this sense, this is a much bolder claim than we have seen in this field and it is one that should raise wide-ranging questions for scholars concerned with the relationship between biblical studies and political research.</p>
