<p>Stephen Cushion of Cardiff University in Wales covers the U.S. and U.K. television news industries, primarily covering the history of broadcasting, and contributing to debates about twenty-four-hour news culture, the supposed (re-)emergence of partisan news, the status of television journalists, and journalism scholarship. A substantial chapter examines how television news has adjusted to political devolution in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Cushion finds that the reasons for declining audiences for television news are multifaceted, including channel proliferation and online competition, but he believes television news can sustain its position as the most consumed form of journalism. Chief among the industry’s responses to audience decline has been a shift from hard to soft news or infotainment: television as hybrid genre. That this is “dumbing down” may be an elitist view hailing back to a presumed “golden age.” The author identifies a new tripartite broadcasting system where channels have either no, some, or fully blown public service broadcasting responsibilities. In the United Kingdom, news and current affairs are seen as synonymous with public service, principally outside of a prime time ever more hungrily coveted for drama and entertainment. Facing a greater challenge to reach critical mass outside of prime, they also fight competitive scheduling battles. Television still remains largely within the “flow” (Raymond Williams) although negatively impacted by a convergence era where journalism is an ever more precarious occupation despite increasing demands on journalists.</p>
<p>Cushion’s history, a tad conventional, claims that the U.S. market has been more regionally driven than in Europe, where far smaller economies of scale yield more nationalized and centralized systems of governance. Elitist disdain for popular media in Europe helped sustain resistance to commercially self-sustaining systems. This helped preserve a degree of seriousness in U.K. news, for example, but perpetuated a deferential, establishment view of the world (I would argue this is always the end product, regardless of whether <italic>style</italic> is deferential or adversarial).</p>
<p>Competition for U.S. audiences led to a journalism that was packaged around commoditized pre-scheduled events. The author deftly summarizes the complex emergence of a commercial U.K. broadcasting model, with significant if diminishing public service obligations, and whose chief provider, ITN, is today a money-making enterprise answerable to shareholders, in turn impacting a BBC that is struggling to sustain audience share. Both the Great Britain and the United States have experienced deregulation and reregulation. Britain’s Ofcom is responsible for regulating both telecommunications and commercial broadcasting and has a mandate to monitor whether public service broadcasters are adversely encroaching on commercial territory. The author considers that in the Ofcom era, the regulation of television news has become more transparently policed, with the aid of impressive quantitative data sets, even as its ethos is predominantly neoliberal, committed more to public “value” than to public “service.” Britain’s public service television, he concludes, remains relatively secure.</p>
<p>Cushion’s review of twenty-four-hour and partisan news covers ground much trodden in recent years, not least by Cushion. The chapter on partisan news incorporates comedy news shows. Recent surveys show that political comedy shows encourage the previously inattentive viewer to engage with mainstream news media. Audiences continue to be drawn to programs that are ideologically similar to their own views, and the author supports the “polarization” thesis, noting that many factors account for ideological segmentation. The phenomenon is less pronounced in the United Kingdom, despite criticism of “regulated impartiality” in the Internet era. U.K. audiences expect television news to remain above party politics. Internationally audiences trust television news more than newspapers, and particularly trust news that has public service features.</p>
<p>Recent debates about U.K. television focus on market-driven regional and local news in the context both of cost pressures and devolution of powers from Westminster to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. U.K. television news remains a significant source of television news across the devolved nations. Cushion’s research with Justin Lewis found that in proportion to population, England and Westminster disproportionately dominate coverage both on BBC and commercial television news. Routinely misleading or confusing journalism was found, including inappropriate assumptions about policies that were not necessarily relevant to all four nations of devolved Britain. Whereas the BBC introduced structural changes in response to such problems and enhanced the news value of devolution, commercial news provision about devolution actually deteriorated. The author concludes that a more robust re-regulatory intervention can constructively encourage journalism to diversify its news agenda and sharpen up its accuracy.</p>
<p>Cushion’s review of empirical studies finds that most journalists are drawn from similar social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds—one recent U.K. report deemed journalism to be one of the most exclusive middle-class professions (dominated by white males, despite improvements in recruitment of women and ethnic minorities). Internationally there are different cultures of journalism. In the United States, says Cushion, objectivity is less championed by television journalists than in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Cushion addresses what he sees as a narrowing division between journalism as a profession and academic journalism studies. He laments a declining scholarly interest in television studies (in favor of online media, even if these are found to be problematic news providers) and would like to see it reinvigorated, not least because scholarly research has long demonstrated that television news has important implications for the possibility of democracy, and because its impacts are far greater than anything yet attributable to online media. Cushion advocates critical approaches to television news as characterized by the work of scholars such as McChesney, Philo and Miller, Curran, and others, much of which confirms the continuing superiority of news (and audience understanding of news) from public service providers.</p>
<p>The author approaches this well-trodden subject with fresh, critical eyes, if somewhat more insightfully about the United Kingdom than the United States. The principal sources of originality include U.S.-U.K. comparison; the case study of U.K. devolution; reconsideration of journalism scholarship; a comprehensive range of empirical research; and a compelling overall appreciation of the merits of public service television news.</p>
