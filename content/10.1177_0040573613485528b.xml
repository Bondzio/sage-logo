<p><italic>Serving God Globally: Finding Your Place in International Development</italic></p>
<p>Roland Hoksbergen</p>
<p>Grand Rapids, Baker Academic, 2012. 240 pp. $21.99</p>
<p>This book offers what Christians need to know in order to serve God, church, and the world in the field of not-for-profit international economic development. As the author, Roland Hoksbergen, an economist at Calvin College puts it, “If you have acknowledged God’s gifts to you for caring for others; if you have a love for the people of other countries; if you are wondering how we can really help, what your role might be, and how to get started, then this book is for you” (xviii).</p>
<p>The book shows that a good response to the challenges of poverty in developing countries can come from the Christian faith tradition, resources of believers, and the energy and passion of its youth. Hoksbergen provides ample materials for reflection, preparation, and practice to young adults looking for directions on how to engage in vocations in international development. Hoksbergen identifies the major challenge of today’s world as poverty and offers the solution of Christian service (11–13, 73). The book not only engages with Scripture to establish the connection between the perceived problem and the suggested solution, but also admirably lays out a pathway from problem to solution (44, 59–60, 62–63).</p>
<p>If this book merely laid the bridge of Christian service over the troubled waters of poverty, then it would only amount to an economist seeking to deploy the resourcefulness of Christian youth to address a recalcitrant economic problem. But Hoksbergen, who himself has decades of experience in Christian development work, offers his ideas as a way of spiritually forming young Christians. Indeed, the book reads as a form of soulcraft, an aspect of socio-economic ethics that concerns how to prepare for and do right in the pursuit and conduct of ordered economic development. Although the book comes across as a how-to-do manual, pressing potential volunteers on what to put in their moral and technical knapsacks, its discourse is part of the a wide-ranging theory of neighborly love and social good.</p>
<p>The author does not quite systematize this discourse, but we can easily lay out its parts in terms of four competencies and integrative catalysts that college-age Christians need in order to succeed in development missionary work. Let us name them according to a rubric that I am familiar with in my seminary. The first is the <italic>interpretation of call</italic>. Young adults need to learn to interpret their call to serve, and to discern whether the service is to be done locally or abroad. This competence also involves a theological reading of the problem of global poverty and its solution.</p>
<p>The second competence is <italic>communication</italic>. On a practical level, this is about acquiring the necessary language and intercultural skills that will enable volunteers to serve well in foreign countries. It also involves not only communicating the call and the vision of service to family members, churches, and potential sponsors, but also having a lifestyle that communicates the love of Christ in foreign countries. According to the third competence, young adults are called upon to <italic>embody</italic> radical hospitality, integrity, preferential option for the poor, and respect for foreign cultures in ways that are faithful to the best of Christianity.</p>
<p>The fourth competence is <italic>leading</italic>. In order to serve effectively and lead in the field young adults need practical and analytical abilities, relational skills, and team spirit. These competencies are integrated by Christian virtues. Hoksbergen argues that without the virtues, which act as some kind of <italic>integrative catalyst</italic> for the four competencies, it is difficult for young adults to hold them together, continuously translate, articulate, and deploy them for successful careers and transformation of societies (80–84, 99, 114–20).</p>
<p>I have no doubt that this book will help potential volunteers for development work abroad. But I doubt, given its obvious bend as a how-to-do manual and thin theological scholarship, that the readers of this journal will find it stimulating. The book does not present a rigorous constructive theology of development or associationism. Readers will, however, find it useful as a quick guide to consult when advising young Christians going into international development.</p>
