<abstract>
<p>In recent years, active biomolecules such as chitosan and its derivatives are undergoing a significant and very fast development in food application area. Due to recent outbreaks of contaminations associated with food products, there have been growing concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of packaging materials of antimicrobial biofilms, which have been studied. Chitosan has a great potential for a wide range of applications due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, nontoxicity and versatile chemical and physical properties. It can be formed into fibers, films, gels, sponges, beads or nanoparticles. Chitosan films have been used as a packaging material for the quality preservation of a variety of foods. Chitosan has high antimicrobial activities against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including fungi, and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A tremendous effort has been made over the past decade to develop and test films with antimicrobial properties to improve food safety and shelf-life. This review highlights the preparation, mechanism, antimicrobial activity, optimization of biocide properties of chitosan films and applications including biocatalysts for the improvement of quality and shelf-life of foods.</p>

<p>Once we talk about antimicrobial activity, it is always directed to its applicability. Very recently, the research is focused into development of materials with film-forming capacities and those having antimicrobial properties which help to improve food safety and shelf-life. Antimicrobial packaging is one of the most promising active packaging systems that have been found highly effective in killing or inhibiting spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms that contaminate foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1082013211399195">Salleh et al., 2007</xref>). In this context, chitosan films have shown great promise for their application in food preservation. It is well known that microbial alternation is responsible for the enormous losses of food and hence, over the years, various chemical and physical processes have been developed to extend the shelf-life of foods. The antimicrobial activity limits or prevents microbial growth by extending the lag period and reducing the growth rate or decreases live counts of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1082013211399195">Han, 2000</xref>). Currently, food application of an antimicrobial packaging system is limited due to the availability of suitable antimicrobials, new polymer materials, regulatory concerns and appropriate testing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1082013211399195">Jin and Zhang, 2008</xref>). In particular, polymeric bioactive films laced with an assortment of antimicrobial agents have been found to be very effective and practical in applications. Till date, a number of articles have been published describing the nature of different materials used in making films and their effectiveness in food preservation (Aider, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211399195">Alvarez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211399195">Appendini and Hotchkiss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211399195">Cha and Chinnan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211399195">Cooksey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211399195">Coma, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211399195">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211399195">Cutter, 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211399195">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211399195">Cutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1082013211399195">Dutta and Dutta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1082013211399195">Dutta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1082013211399195">Ozdemir and Floros, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1082013211399195">Quintavalla and Vicini, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-1082013211399195">Suppakul et al., 2003</xref>). Present review aims to summarize all the known methods of formation of chitosan-based films with antimicrobial properties and discuss their mode of action and applicability, particularly in the area of food preservation in one place. The structure of chitin and chitosan is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211399195">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>To control the great economic losses from the spoilage of foods each year, the attention of the people all over the world has been focused on preservation of the food as a protection from various microorganisms. In this direction, bioactive polymeric films have been found very effective as antimicrobial agents and thus their applications and research work on them are getting more importance today. This review is an attempt to create awareness about the progress in the antimicrobial activities of chitin and chitosan in the case of food applications and the literature survey made from the year 1957 to present. More specifically, the aim of this review was to highlight the potential of chitosan as an ingredient for the production of active bio-based films and to summarize the different methods used for the preparation of chitosan-based films and their perspectives in the modern food packaging technology. Theactive properties of edible films and coatings are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211399195">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Polysaccharide films are derived from various natural materials which impart gel-forming ability to a variety of films. The polysaccharide-derived films, due to excellent gas permeability properties, exhibit desirable modified atmospheres and thus enhance the shelf-life of the product without creating anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211399195">Baldwin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211399195">Ben and Kurth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1082013211399195">Cutter and Sumner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1082013211399195">Glicksman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1082013211399195">Nisperos-Carriedo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr187-1082013211399195">Whistler and Daniel, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, polysaccharide films and coatings can be used to extend the shelf-life of muscle foods by preventing dehydration, oxidative rancidity and surface browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1082013211399195">Nisperos-Carriedo, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Particularly, the use of biopolymer and bio-based polymer films as antimicrobial delivery systems to reduce undesirable bacteria in foodstuffs is not a novel concept. Various approaches have been proposed and demonstrated for the use of these films to deliver compounds to a variety of food surfaces, including muscle foods. For example, antimicrobial compounds such as organic acids (acetic propionic, benzoic, sorbic, lactic and lauric), potassium sorbate, bacteriocins (nisin and lacticin), grape seed extracts, spice extracts (thymol, <?tjl?>p-cymene and cinnamaldehyde), thiosulfinates (allicin), enzymes (peroxidase and lysozyme), proteins (conalbumin), isothiocyanates (allylisothiocyanate), antibiotics (imazalil), fungicides (benomyl), chelating agents (EDTA), metals (silver) or parabens (heptylparaben) could be added to edible films to reduce bacteria in solution, on culture media, or on a variety of muscle foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211399195">Cha and Chinnan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211399195">Cutter, 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211399195">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1082013211399195">Whistler and Daniel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1082013211399195">Han, 2000</xref>). Further studies on edible film made from starch, carrageenan or alginate and addition of antifungal compounds, organic acids, potassium sorbate or the bacteriocin nisin, were more effective for reducing levels of foodborne organisms when immobilized via solution method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211399195">Baron and Sumner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211399195">Cutter and Siragusa, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1082013211399195">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1082013211399195">Dawson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1082013211399195">Meyer et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1082013211399195">Padgett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1082013211399195">Siragusa and Dickson, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1082013211399195">1993</xref>).

<p>Due to their inherent properties, coupled with theability to form films, alone or in combination withother polymers, chitin, chitosan and oligosaccharides are desirable food packaging materials. Chitooligomers, a class of chitosans with degree of polymerization &lt;20, are known to have some special biological activities such as antibacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1082013211399195">Jeon et al., 2001</xref>), and antitumor and immune-enhancing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1082013211399195">Jeon and Kim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1082013211399195">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1082013211399195">Tokoro et al., 1988</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1082013211399195"><title>PREPARATION OF CHITOSAN-BASED ANTIMICROBIAL FILMS/COATINGS</title>
<p>Various methods are employed to prepare chitosan films and coatings for food packaging applications. Solution casting method is one of the popular methods. As a general practice, chitosan films are prepared with different kinds of oils like cinnamon oil, tea tree essential oil (TTEO); tetrahydrocurcuminoid derivatives; blends with ethyleneâvinyl alcohol copolymer, PVP or PEO, Gliadins. The methods of preparation of novel hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) edible films with chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles; nanoparticles/plasticized-starch composites; edible chitosan films enriched with galangal extract; sweet potato starch films incorporated with potassium sorbate on chitosan;and chitosan/methyl cellulose films have also been reported for antibacterial study. Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1082013211399195">Tripathi et al. (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-1082013211399195">2010</xref>) have synthesized chitosan-based antimicrobial films for food applications employing the supercritical carbon dioxide and microwave technique. The novelty of this method lies in achieving the film formation without the addition of any cross-linker or plasticizer.</p>
<p>Some typical preparative techniques are enumerated in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1082013211399195"><title>Preparation of chitosan-coating solution enriched with cinnamon oil</title>
<p>Chitosan solution was prepared with 2% (w/v) chitosan in 1% (v/v) acetic acid. To achieve complete dispersion of chitosan, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 3âh. The solution in beakers was placed on a hotplate/magnetic stirrer and glycerol added to chitosan at 0.75âmL/g concentration as a plasticizer and stirred for 10âmin. The resultant chitosan-coating solution was filtrated through a Whatman No. 3 filter paper to remove any undissolved particles. Then, the cinnamon oil, mixed with Tween 80, to help in distributing and completely incorporating the cinnamon oil, was added to the chitosan solution. The final coating forming solution consisted of 2% chitosan, 1% acetic acid, 0.75% glycerol, 0.2% Tween 80 and 1.5% cinnamon oil. The final coating forming solution was homogenized under aseptic conditions at 21 600ârpm for 1âmin. The control solution was prepared without the addition of cinnamon oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1082013211399195">Ojagh et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec>

<sec id="sec6-1082013211399195"><title>Homogeneous chitosan films</title>
<p>A 2% (w/v) film-forming solution was obtained by dispersing chitosan in a 1% (w/w) acetic acid aqueous solution (pH 3.5). The solution was filtered through a BÃ¼chner funnel and then degassed under reduced pressure for 1âh. Films were obtained by casting the solutions onto polystyrene plates which were dried for 12âh under a laminar-flow hood at room temperature. Thanks to degasification and drying under laminar-flow, even at room temperature, most of the volatile acetic acid could be removed from the thin films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1082013211399195">Portes et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211399195"><title>Chitosanâtetrahydrocurcuminoid films</title>
<p>Film-forming solutions (2%) were prepared by adding chitosan (2âg) and tetrahydrocurcuminoid (THC; 20âmg) to 100âmL of a 1% acetic acid aqueous solution (pH 3.5) under vigorous agitation. The solutions were filtered and cast as in the procedure used to make homogeneous chitosan films. Ten thickness values were taken randomly at different positions on each film. Film thicknesses were found to be 30 Â± 4âlâÂµm. A good repeatability of the absorbances directly measured on different portions of the films showed that the THCs were distributed homogeneously.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211399195"><title>Antibacterial chitosan-based blends with ethyleneâvinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer</title>
<p>Chitosan polysaccharide dispersions were prepared in2% (v/v) acetic acid to a final concentration of 3% (w/v) and stirred at 37âÂ°C for approximately 3âh. The chitosoniumâacetate solutions were filtered through polyester cloth to remove residues of insoluble particles and then autoclaved before their further use for blending. Pure chitosoniumâacetate films were obtained by casting at 37âÂ°C, 80âÂ°C and 120âÂ°C. In addition, pure EVOH films were obtained by the same method at 80âÂ°C. Composite films of EVOH29/LMWâchitosan with high ratios of polysaccharide (i.e., 50 and 80âwt%) were obtained under various temperature conditions (37âÂ°C, 80âÂ°C and 120âÂ°C). Blends of EVOH with lower contents of chitosan did not form good films but 80/20 (wt%) EVOH/chitosoniumâacetate blends could be finally obtained by adding an excess of glacial acetic acid tothe EVOH solution to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). Nevertheless, the higher chitosan concentration blends, i.e., 50 and 80âwt%, were also obtained using the same solution of EVOH and acetic acid for comparison purposes. Typical pure and composite films with a thickness of ca. 50âlm were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1082013211399195">Fernandez-Saiz et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec>

PVP and PEO were separately dissolved in d.i. water to form 1% (w/w) solutions. Aqueous solutions of the individual polymers were mixed to prepare a series of chitosan/PVP and chitosan/PEO blend solutions with weight ratios 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100.

<sec id="sec12-1082013211399195"><title>Preparation of solutions for film casting</title>
<p>The HPMC solution (control film) was obtained by dissolving 3.0âg of HPMC in 100âmL of distilled water under magnetic stirring for 12âh. The HPMC: water ratio in all film-forming solutions was 3:97 to study the effect of particle size and CSâTPP concentration in the HPMC film matrix. The HPMC films with CSâTPP nanoparticles were obtained by addition of 3.0âg of HPMC in 100âmL of nanoparticle solution (recently synthesized) under magnetic stirring for 12âh. After the solutions were prepared, the flasks were kept closed for 6âh to prevent microbubble formation in the films.

<p>Functional efficiency strongly depends on the nature of components and film composition and structure. The choice of film-forming substance and/or active additive is made based on the objective, the nature of the food product and/or the application method.</p>
<p>Chitosan has been studied in terms of bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity to control the growth of a wide variety of bacteria. Chitosan has several advantages over other types of disinfectants because, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1082013211399195">Kim and Choi (1998)</xref>, it possesses a higher antibacterial activity and a broader spectrum of activity.

These authors also showed that higher temperature (37âÂ°C) increased the impact against the target strains. Another parameter identified as significantly influential is the molecular weight. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1082013211399195">Jeon et al. (2001)</xref> showed that chitooligosaccharide effectively blocked the growth of the tested bacteria although their effects were lower than that of chitosan. These authors mentioned that for an effective inhibition, the molecular weight should be 10âkDa. The pH and the quaternization degree of the chitosan were the influential parameters. The majority of studies showed that an increase of deacetylation (DA) degree and a decrease in pH improved the bioactive properties of chitosan. The flocculation and adsorption behavior of chitosans to <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were not observed; however, such behaviors were noticed by applying fluorescence labeled to chitosans and monitoring changes in zeta potential values of the bacterial with chitosan coating. Without chitosan coating cells, it was increased approximately by 40% if pH increased from 5 to 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1082013211399195">Strand et al., 2003</xref>). Despite their low charge density, the chitosans with higher deacetylation degree adsorbed in higher amounts and reversed the cell surface chargemost effectively. Finally, the chitosans with low-molecular weight adsorbed the most. The same authors reported that ionic strength did not affect the adsorption of highly acetylated chitosan (DA 0.49), whereas for chitosan with a DA of 0.01, adsorption increased with ionic strength. The combination of flocculation and adsorption data clearly showed that charge neutralization was not the main flocculation mechanism. Several results pointed to bridging as one dominating mechanism for flocculation. Study demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial efficiency is not always proven in food, due to the highly reactive nature of the polycationic chitosan, which could interact with proteins, fats and other anionic substances in foods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1082013211399195">Darmadji and Izumimoto (1994)</xref>, however, observed that the growth of spoilage bacteria in meat was inhibited by 0.5â1.0% chitosan during incubation at 30âÂ°C for 48âh or storage at 4âÂ°C for 10âdays.</p>
<p>Studies based on UV absorption indicated that chitosan causes considerable losses of proteinic material to the Pythium oaroecandrum at pH 5.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1082013211399195">Helander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1082013211399195">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Chitosan also acts as a chelating agent that selectively binds trace metals and thereby inhibits the production of toxins and microbial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211399195">Cuero et al., 1991</xref>). It also activates several defense processes in the host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1082013211399195">El Ghaouth et al., 1992</xref>), acts as a water binding agent and inhibits various enzymes. Binding of chitosan with DNA and inhibition of mRNA synthesis occurs through chitosan penetration toward the nuclei of the microorganisms and interference with the synthesis of mRNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1082013211399195">Sudarshan et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been proposed that when chitosan is liberated from the cell wall of fungal pathogens by plant host hydrolytic enzymes, it then penetrates to the nuclei of fungi and interferes with RNA and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1082013211399195">Hadwiger et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>A microscopic examination of Saccharomyces unisporus after treatment with chitosan-salt with a polymerization degree of 25 showed agglutination of a refractive substance on the entire cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1082013211399195">Savard et al., 2002</xref>). When chitosanase was added to the culture media containing chitosan-salt, they could not observe refractive substances. In this study, an interaction between chitosan and the cell wall was observed.</p>

<p>The agar plate method was used to determine the MICs of CM, Q and CMQ as follows: the samples were prepared at a concentration of 1% (w/v) and then autoclaved at 121âÂ°C for 25âmin. Duplicate twofold serial dilutions of each sample were added to nutrient broth (beef extract 5âg, peptone10âg to 1000âmL distilled water, pH 7.0) for final concentrations 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.0125%, 0.00625%, and 0.00313%. Some samples were prepared and diluted by the same way except for final concentrations 0.00065% and 0.00033%. The culture of each bacterium was diluted by sterile distilled water to 105â106âCFU/mL. A loop of each suspension was inoculated on the nutrient medium with sample or control added. After inoculation, the plates were incubated at 37âÂ°C for 72âh, the colonies counted and the MIC values obtained. The MIC was considered to be the lowest concentration that completely inhibited against agar plates on comparison, disregarding a single colony or a faint haze caused by the inoculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1082013211399195">Speciale et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec>

<p>Compared with CM, Q and CMQ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1082013211399195">Table 7</xref>, CMQ had much better antimicrobial activities, whose MIC values were 4â8âtimes lower than those of CM and 2â4âtimes lower than those of Q. It was noticed that the introduction of carboxymethyl and quarternized groups to the chitosan chain greatly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the CMQ. We can deduce that carboxymethyl and quaternary ammonium groups are in synergistic effect.</p>
<p>As given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1082013211399195">Table 6</xref>, compared with CM<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>, CM<sub>2</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>, CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub> and CM<sub>4</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>, which have the same degree of substitution of quaternized group, the authors found no clear effect of DS value of carboxymethyl group on antimicrobial activity. Compared with CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>1</sub>, CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub> and CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>, with similar degree of carboxymethyl group substitution, it can be observed that their antimicrobial activities were enhanced with increase of the DS. Compared with CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>-1, CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>-2, CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>-3 and CM<sub>3</sub>Q<sub>2</sub>-4, which have same degrees of substitution for both carboxymethyl and quaternized groups, the results demonstrated that their antimicrobial activities were affected by their molecular weights remarkably. Lower molecular weight resulted in better antimicrobial ability, and when the molecular weight was below 1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup>, the antimicrobial activity of CMQ was strong and the MIC values reached 0.00313%.</p>
<p>The development of complementary methods to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as packaging material-associated antimicrobial agents is an active area of research. A number of studies on the antimicrobial characteristics of films made from chitosan have been carried out earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211399195">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211399195">Coma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1082013211399195">Ouattara et al., 2000a</xref>). Among other polymers, chitosan has received a significant attention as an antimicrobial film-forming agent for food preservation to the researchers due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity. Chitosan films are easily prepared by the evaporation of its dilute acid solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1082013211399195">Park et al., 2002</xref>). Chitosan has been studied in terms of bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity to control the growth of a wide variety of bacteria. Inthe Gram-positive bacteria, the major constituent of their cell wall is peptidoglycan and a little amount of protein. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria on the other hand is thinner but more complex and contains various polysaccharides, proteins and lipids beside the peptidoglycan. Also, the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria has an outer membrane which constitutes the outer surface of the wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211399195">Black, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The antimicrobial effect of konjac glucomannan edible film was improved by incorporating chitosan and nisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1082013211399195">Li et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, antimicrobial efficacy was assessed against four food pathogenic bacteria namely <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic>. Antimicrobial activity tests of edible films were carried out using the agar diffusion method.</p>
<p>In this method, the film cuts are placed on Mueller Hinton agar plates, which were previously seeded with 0.1âmL of inoculums containing indicator microorganisms in the range 10<sup>5</sup>â10<sup>6</sup>âCFU/mL. The antimicrobial effect of chitosan or incorporating nisin was found to be much better than that of konjac glucomannan incorporating nisin at each corresponding concentration and there existed significant difference (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the antimicrobial effect between chitosan and chitosan incorporating nisin. Incorporating chitosan into konjac glucomannan film therefore improved not only physical properties but also antimicrobial activity.</p>
<p>The characteristics of chitosan film was evaluated by cross-linking with naturally occurring aglycone geniposidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1082013211399195">Mi et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, a comparative study was performed between chitosan film without cross-linking (fresh), the glutaraldehyde-cross-linked chitosan film and aglycone geniposidic acid-cross-linked chitosan film. A 50âÂµL bacterial broth (<italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic>) was seeded onto film and cultured. The fresh and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked chitosan films were used as control. It has been proposed that the interaction between the polycationic chitosan and the negatively charged surface of bacteria may alter the permeability of the bacterial wall and lead to the leakage of intracellular electrolytes and proteins. The results suggested that cross-linking of chitosan films did not alter their antibacterial capability. This may be due to the fact that the cross-linking degrees of glutaraldehyde and aglycone geniposidic acid (aGSA) cross-linked chitosan films used in this part of the study were relatively low (&lt;18%, with a concentration of cross-linking agent 0.8âmM). The aGSA-cross-linked chitosan film displayed a relatively lower water vapor permeability, a lower cytotoxicity, and a slower degradation rate than the glutaraldehyde-cross-linked film. It was finally concluded that the aGSA-cross-linked chitosan film may be a promising material as an edible film for food packaging.</p>
<p>The shelf-life of food was extended by ferulic acid-incorporated starch-chitosan blend films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1082013211399195">Mathew and Abraham, 2008</xref>). Incorporation of ferulic acid has been found to improve the barrier properties and tensile strength of starch-chitosan blend films and significantlyenhance the lipid peroxide inhibition capacity. This study has helped to improve the performance of polysaccharide-based films for the storage of high lipid-containing ingredients.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial activity of chitosan films enhanced by incorporation of garlic oil, potassium sorbate and nisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1082013211399195">Pranoto et al., 2005</xref>). The antimicrobial activity was tested against food pathogenic bacteria namely <italic>E.coli, S. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic>. Antimicrobial tests have been carried out using agar diffusion method. The agar diffusion test is a method commonly used to examine antimicrobial activity regarding the diffusion of the compound tested through water-containing agar plate.Incorporating antimicrobial agents into chitosan edible films thus improves the antimicrobial efficacy of chitosan, as diffused antimicrobial activity would add to the nonmigrated antimicrobial potency of chitosan. It was concluded that garlic oil incorporated into chitosan film led to an increase in its antimicrobial efficacy, and has little effect on the mechanical and physical properties of chitosan films. Overall, the incorporation of garlic oil into chitosan film had the desirable characteristics of acting as a physical and antimicrobial barrier to food contamination.</p>
<p>Two types of <italic>O-</italic>carboxymethylated chitosan (<italic>O</italic>-CMCh)/cellulose polyblends were prepared using LiCl/N, <italic>N</italic>-dimethylacetamide solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1082013211399195">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Antimicrobial activity of the blend films against <italic>E. coli</italic> was evaluated by using the optical density (OD) method. The smaller the OD of the medium, the higher was the antimicrobial activity of the film. It was observed that the antimicrobial activity of the blend films enhances if the <italic>O</italic>-CMCh contamination was raised. Both blend films exhibited satisfactory antibacterial activities against <italic>E. coli</italic>, even with <italic>O</italic>-CMCh concentration 2âwt%.</p></sec>

<p>In terms of surrounding clearing zone, chitosanâpotato starch film did not show inhibitory effects against all the tested microorganisms. The chitosan-starch film-forming solution showed a clear inhibitory zones of 1.5, 1.2 and 1.4âcm against <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, respectively. However, increasing level of starch at higher concentration did not reveal a significant increased inhibitory effect. It was generally caused by the maximum capability of chitosan polymer to carry active agents beside the occurrence of interaction phenomenon between the functional groups. The antimicrobial effect of chitosan occurred without migration of active agents. As chitosan is in solid form, only organisms in direct contact with the active sites of chitosan are inhibited. Chitosan is incapable of diffusing through the adjacent agar media. The agar diffusion test is a method commonly used to examine the antimicrobial activity regarding the diffusion of the compound tested through water-containing agar plate. The diffusion itself is dependent on the size, shape and polarity of the diffusion material. The chemical structure and the cross-linking level of the films also affect this phenomenon. The chitosanâstarch solution shows stronger inhibitory effect against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> than <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Furthermore, it was found that the bioactive chitosanâpotato starch film can be used to extend the food shelf-life.</p>
<p>Incorporating chitosan and lauric acid into starch-based film showed more effective antimicrobial ability against <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1082013211399195">Salleh et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, the authors studied the incorporation of chitosan and lauric acid into starch-based films; obvious effects toward inhibition of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> have been observed while the film had synergistic antimicrobial effect when chitosan and lauric acid were combined. Antimicrobial starch-based film incorporated with lauric acid and chitosan showed good flexibility than when purely starch-based film was formulated and formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211399195">Figure 4</xref>). Inhibition of bacterial growth was examined using two methods, i.e., zone of inhibition test on solid media and liquid culture test (OD measurements). The inhibitory activity was measured based on the diameter of the clear inhibition zone. In the solutions of starch and chitosan with different mixing ratios (w/w), 8:2 and 9:1 were the most effective mixing ratios which had greater inhibition on both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> than other solutions in agar plate and liquid culture test. The control (pure wheat starch) and antimicrobial (AM) film (incorporated with chitosan and lauric acid) were produced by casting method.

<sec id="sec30-1082013211399195"><title>Antimicrobial Activity of chitosanâpolyvinyl alcohol film</title>
<p>Inhibitory effects of chitosanâpolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution and chitosanâPVA film against <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1082013211399195">Tripathi et al. (2009)</xref>. The inhibitory effect was measured based on clear zone surrounding circular film strips/solution. Measurement of clear zone diameter included measuring the diameter of film strips/solutions; therefore, the values were always higher than the diameters of film strips/solutions whenever clearing zone was present. If there is no clear zone surrounding, the authors assumed that there is no inhibitory zone, and furthermore, the diameter was valued as zero. In terms of surrounding clearing zone, chitosanâPVA film did not show inhibitory effects against all tested microorganisms. The chitosanâPVA film-forming solution showed a clear inhibitory zone against <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, respectively. The chitosanâPVA solution shows stronger inhibitory effects against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> than <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Furthermore, it was found that the bioactive chitosanâPVA film can be used to extend food shelf-life. Chitosan-based antimicrobial films consisting of chitosan and PVA were prepared by solution casting method. These results pointed out that there is a molecular miscibility between PVA and chitosan. Chitosan-based antimicrobial film may be a promising material as a packaging film.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec31-1082013211399195"><title>Preservation of vacuum-packaged processed meats</title>
<p>The feasibility of improving the preservation of vacuum-packaged processed meats during refrigerated storage achieved by the use of an antimicrobial film designed to gradually release antimicrobial agents at the product surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1082013211399195">Ouattara et al., 2000b</xref>). The antimicrobial films were applied onto bologna, regular cooked ham or pastrami. The activity of the various films for inhibiting bacterial growth was tested against indigenous lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae and against <italic>Lactobacillus sakei</italic> or <italic>Serratia liquefaciens</italic>, surface-inoculated onto the meat products. The growth of Enterobacteriaceae and <italic>S. liquefaciens</italic> was delayed by the application of the antimicrobial film. It was found that the inhibition of indigenous Enterobacteriaceae was more extensive at the surface of bologna than at the surface of pastrami, irrespective of film type. It is due to the fact that bologna contains efficient water-binding agents, and so exudes little water during storage.</p>
<p>The moisture and high lipid contents of bologna helped the diffusion of the oregano essential oil (EO) from the chitosan film matrix into the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211399195">Chi et al., 2006</xref>). Sensory evaluation suggested that addition of 45âppm or less of oregano oil to bologna would be acceptable to consumers. In conclusion, the gas chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis showed that 757.7Â± 99.7 ppm carvacrol was extracted from the film-forming solution prepared without TweenÂ® 20 and only 364.7 Â± 39.9 ppm from the film-forming solution with the emulsifier. Different levels of carvacrol were detected in the presence of TweenÂ® 20 due to the interaction of the amphiphilic emulsifierâs molecule with both chitosan and oregano EO compounds. It is concluded that incorporation of an emulsifier in chitosanâoregano EO films may slow the losses of volatile compounds of the oil and help to control the release of active compounds into the product.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec32-1082013211399195"><title>The antimicrobial properties of crawfish chitosan</title>
<p>Antimicrobial activities of crawfish chitosan film formulations against seven pathogenic bacteria, <italic>L. monocytogenes, B. cereus, Shigella sonnei, E. coli</italic> (O157:H7), <italic>S. aureus, S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>, were expressed in terms of zone inhibition. The zone inhibition assay revealed primarily three types of observations, namely, (1) defaced films without any clear or inhibition zones which could be attributed to the absence of any inhibitory activity, (2) clear zones without inhibitory zones which could be attributed to bacteriostatic activity and (3) clear inhibition zone representing bactericidal inhibition by films. Some of the tests are enumerated as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1082013211399195">Nadarajah, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec33-1082013211399195"><title>Minimum inhibitory activity</title>
<p>All chitosan acetate films were defaced with <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and this was well in agreement with the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211399195">Coma et al. (2002)</xref>. However, it was reported that 8% film-forming solution(chitosan in acetic acid) incorporated in agar medium (v/v) completely inhibited <italic>L. monocytogenes.</italic> Chitosan acetate films were also defaced with <italic>B. cereus,</italic> and <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> lawns, indicating that they were ineffective in controlling these bacteria. However, all chitosan acetate films showed bacteriostatic effects against <italic>S. aureus, S. sonnei, S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, as indicated by their clear zones i lawns.</p>
<p>The chitosan formate films were also ineffective in controlling <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>V. vulnificus</italic>, as indicated by defaced films by these bacterial lawns. Nevertheless, the chitosan formate films showed inhibitory effects against <italic>S. aureus, S. sonnei, S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>O157:H7 and bacteriostatic activity against <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.</p>
<p>However, compared to the chitosan citrate films, the inhibitory effects of chitosan formate films were lower and the thickness of the inhibitory zone was in the range 0.49â1.64âmm compared to 0.78â6.0âmm of chitosan citrate films. All chitosan citrate films exhibited prominent inhibitory effects on all seven pathogenic bacteria. All chitosan citrate films showed distinctive inhibition zones against all tested pathogenic bacteria and the inhibition zones were considerably thicker than those produced by chitosan formate films. Also, the inhibitory effects of chitosan citrate films were remarkably higher for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>V. vulnificus,</italic> as indicated by thicker inhibition zones accounting for more than 4mm. The chitosan citrate films were the only films with antimicrobial effects against <italic>B. cereus</italic> and <italic>V. vulnificus</italic>. The higher inhibitory activity shown by all chitosan citrate films can be attributable to complete solubility of chitosan which could make them more reactive against bacterial cells.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec34-1082013211399195"><title>Antimicrobial activity</title>
<p>The quantitative analysis of antimicrobial activity for selected chitosan films were carried out as follows.</p>
<p>Acetate films with demineralized + decolorized + deacetylated (DMCA) chitosan, formate films with deproteinized + demineralized + decolorized + deacetylated (DPMCA) chitosan and citrate films with demineralized + deacetylated (DMA) chitosan.</p>
<p>The above-selected films were also tested with further inhibition zone assays with more controls. The nisin spots used as the positive control produced more prominent clear zones with <italic>L. monocytogenes,</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> lawns representing the Gram-positive bacteria and vague spots with <italic>S. sonnei and S. typhimurium</italic> lawns representing the Gram-negative bacteria. Regardless of the type of bacteria, controls such as chitosan solutions, acid solutions and the polyvinyl chloride plastic failed to produce any clear or inhibition zones indicating that they were ineffective in inhibiting the above-mentioned food pathogenic bacteria. This substantiates the claim that the direct application of antimicrobial agents, such as chitosan and acid solutions used in our studies, onto food surfaces is less effective due to loss of antimicrobial activity caused by leaching onto the food, enzymatic activity and reaction with other food components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1082013211399195">Jung et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1082013211399195">Ouattara et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1082013211399195">Ray, 1992</xref>). Hence, the use of packaging films or coating as a matrix to deliver antimicrobial agents becomes important. Such packaging or coating can maintain a high concentration of antimicrobial agents on a food surface and it allows low migration into food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1082013211399195">Ouattara et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1082013211399195">Siragusa and Dickson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1082013211399195">Torres et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of the direct inoculation study were in agreement with the inhibition zone assays (the survivor log number CFU/mL of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>  inoculated onto the surface of the selected chitosan films).</p>
<p>Chitosan citrate film: <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was more susceptible to chitosan formate or chitosan acetate films. It reduced the bacterial count by 5.34âlog CFU/mL within 4âh of incubation and accounted for more than 4.47âlog CFU/mL reduction of inoculum in 24âh. It caused only marginal reduction of the inoculum, accounting for less than 1âlog CFU/mL reduction over the entire 24âh period incubation.</p>
<p>Further, the chitosan formate films caused about 1âlog CFU/mL reduction of inoculum at 2âh of incubation and maintained a 1âlog CFU/mL reduction over 24âh of incubation. The rate of reduction of microbial count was poor with both chitosan acetate and formate films as there was no significant difference in microbial count between 2 and 4âh of incubation and between 4 and 8âh of incubation. Organic acids with smaller molecular weights have higher antimicrobial activities and undissociated smaller molecules of formic (46.03âDa) and acetic (60.05âDa) acids may enter the bacterial cells easily to change the internal pH of the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1082013211399195">Eswaranandam et al., 2004</xref>). Undissociated larger molecules of citric acid (192.13âDa) may not enter into the cells effectively. Such a trend was not observed in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1082013211399195">Nadarajah, 2005</xref>) and the result was in contrary.</p>
<p>It indicates that chitosan films made of organic acids may behave as one entity rather than separate entities, i.e., as a career matrix containing an antimicrobial agent. Several studies have demonstrated that antimicrobial edible films can reduce bacterial levels on meat products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1082013211399195">Table 9</xref>).

However, this method has some disadvantages such as high cost and the low yield of chitosan oligosaccharides with degree of depolymerization (DP) from DP2 to DP5 because of random cleavage resulting in mostly monosaccharides. The irradiation effects on chitosan in acetic acid solution with various dose rates and the yield of chitosan oligomers were investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211399195">Choi et al., 2002</xref>). Low molecular weight chitosans were prepared at different reaction temperatures and times using 85% phosphoric acid that resulted in the decrease of viscosity average molecular weight from 21.4âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> to 7.1âÃâ10<sup>4</sup>. Depolymerization of chitosan by the use of HNO<sub>2</sub> is a homogeneous reaction where the number of glycosidic bonds broken is stochiomeric to the amount of HNO<sub>2</sub> used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1082013211399195">Jia and Shen, 2002</xref>). The hydrolysis of chitosan with strong HCl was studied over a range of acid concentrations and temperatures. There have been very few reports on the degradation of chitosan by free redicals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1082013211399195">Nordveidt et al. (1994)</xref> demonstrated that the viscosity of chitosan solution decreased rapidly in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> probably due to random depolymerization of chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211399195">Chen et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Several biological activities of chitosan depend on the degree of polymerization. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1082013211399195">Liu et al.(2006)</xref>, the main factors affecting the antibacterial activity of chitosan are molecular weight and concentration. Recent studies on chitosan have attracted interest for converting it into oligosaccharides because they are not only water-soluble but also they are believed to have greater antimicrobial activity. Chitosan has a mean molecular mass of up to 1âMDa, which corresponds to a chain length of approximately 5000âunits, but there is considerable variation between commercial batches. The molecular mass of native chitin is usually higher than 10<sup>6</sup> Da, whereas the molecular mass of the commercial chitosan is often observed between 10<sup>5</sup> and 12âÃâ10<sup>5</sup> Da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1082013211399195">Muzzarelli, 1973</xref>). During the process of deacetylation, the hard conditions tend to degrade and depolymerize chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1082013211399195">No et al., 2002</xref>). Medium- and low-Mw chitosan can be obtained by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of the high-Mw polymer. The chemical hydrolysis is usually achieved using strong acids, which is an unexpensive and rapid method. Its drawback is the necessity to purify extensively the low-Mw chitosan products for biological applications due to the toxicity of the reagents used for the reaction. Hydrogen peroxide treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1082013211399195">No et al., 2002</xref>) and ultrasonication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1082013211399195">Czechowska-Biskup et al., 2005</xref>) could be also used. The extent of hydrolysis is, however, rather difficult to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1082013211399195">Plouffe et al, 1997</xref>).</p></sec>

<p>Enzymatic depolymerization seems to be a better method to prepare chito oligosaccharides. Microorganisms have been found to possess chitosanase activity.

<p>The growing consumer demand for foods without chemical preservatives has led people to indulge in effortstoward the discovery of new natural antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1082013211399195">No et al., 2002</xref>). In this context, the antimicrobial activities of chitosan and their derivatives against different groups of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast and fungi have received considerable attention in recent years. Antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights were examined against four Gram-negative (<italic>E. coli, P. fluorescens, S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>) and seven Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>L. monocytogenes, Bacillus mageterium, B. cereus, S. aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</italic>). Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with M<sub>w</sub>s of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative one in the presence of 0.1% chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr186-1082013211399195">Wang, 1992</xref>).

<p>A solution can be obtained by the use of enzymes to produce bioconversions. The chitooligosaccharides produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan are widely used in the food, agricultural and pharmaceutical fieldsbecause of their various physiological activities. Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) is an important chitin-degrading enzyme which is involved in bioconversion processes of wastes from crustaceans and in plant protection by preserving them from chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1082013211399195">Decleire et al., 1997</xref>). Chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132) is defined as an enzyme that catalyses random hydrolysisof Ã-1, 4 linkages between GlchitosanAc and Glchitosan residues in a partially <italic>N</italic>-acetylated chitosan. Chitosanase was distinguished from chitinase on the basis of its ability to hydrolyze GlchitosanâGlchitosan. As specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1082013211399195">Seki et al.

Chitosanase can be defined asthe enzyme which requires at least one Glchitosan residue at either side of hydrolyzing linkages in partially <italic>N</italic>-acetylated chitosan but not GlchitosanAcâGlchitosanAc bonds.

<p>At first, various investigators reported molecular weight relationships of antibacterial activity by chitosan and there are some reports that chitosan is more effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria than chitosan oligomers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1082013211399195">Hirano and Nagao (1989)</xref> studied the relationship between the degree of polymerization of chitosan and the inhibition grade against 18 phytopathogens. The test materials were the lactate salt of high-molecular weight chitosan (Mw 400âkDa, with 95% of deacetylation) and chitosan oligosaccharides, with a degree of polymerization (DP) in the range 2â8. The growth of 13 fungi was inhibited more than 10% by the high-<?tjl?>molecular weight chitosan and 6% by chitosan oligosaccharides. These authors observed that a decrease in the degree of polymerization of chitosan resulted in decreases in the number of inhibited fungal species. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1082013211399195">Kendra and Hadwiger (1984)</xref> demonstrated that the maximal antifungal activity of chitosan was exhibited by chitosan oligomers of seven or more residues.

<sec id="sec39-1082013211399195"><title>Chemical modifications</title>
<p>Even though chitosan is quite attractive as a biopolymer with distinctive physicochemical properties and biological activities, it is currently utilized to only the limited extent. The delay in application study is partly ascribable to the difficulty in controlled modifications because of the insoluble nature in organic solvent and multifunctionality of chitosan. However, many kinds of modification reactions have been exploited to increase the antimicrobial properties of chitosan. The growing demand for a more accurate control of polysaccharide properties has prompted the development of numerous techniques for selective modifications. The amino and two hydroxyl groups present in the repeating unit of chitosan are the targets of different chemical modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1082013211399195">Hirano et al., 1987</xref>). As a result, the functionality of linear polysaccharides is significantly affected by the presence, level and distribution of substituents along the main chain. As specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1082013211399195">Rabea et al. (2003)</xref>, chitosan and chitin are commercially interesting compounds because of their high nitrogen contents (6.89%) compared to synthetically substituted cellulose (1.25%). This makes chitosan a useful chelating agent. However, these naturally abundant materials are also limited in their reactivity and processability.</p>
<p>Several alkylated chitosans are reported to be synthesized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1082013211399195">Kim et al.

<p>Long alkyl chains (until C12) can be introduced on the chitosan.

<p>Their antibacterial activities against <italic>S. aureus</italic> were explored by the viable cell count method in acetate buffer at pH 6. The antibacterial activities of the quaternary ammonium salt increased with increase in the chain length of the alkyl substituent, and this increased activity could be ascribed to the contribution of the increased hydrophobic properties of the derivatives. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211399195">Avadi et al. (2004)</xref> prepared a quaternized chitosan (i.e., <italic>N-</italic>diethylmethyl chitosan, DEMC) based on a modified two-step process. With a degree of quaternization of 79%, the DEMC exhibited a higher antibacterial activity than chitosan against <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, the antimicrobial effects of both compounds were pH dependent and an increase in concentration of acetic acid resulted in a significant decrease in MIC, determined by turbidimetric method. As a result, the antibacterial activities of chitosan and DEMC are higher in 1% acetic acid in comparison with the lower levels of acetic acid concentration, 0.25%, for example. The MIC of DEMC is decreased from 500 to 62.5 Âµg/mL when the medium is changed from water to 1% acetic acid solution. The authors mentioned that this is due to the target site of the polycation, i.e., the negatively charged surface of the bacteria cell. Therefore, the polycation DEMC with a high charge density interacts with the bacteria more than what chitosan itself does. Other chitosan derivatives such as <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N-</italic>trimethyl chitosan, <italic>N-</italic>propyl-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N-</italic>dimethyl chitosan and <italic>N-</italic>furfuryl-<italic>N,N-</italic>dimethyl chitosan were prepared and tested for their activities against <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1082013211399195">Jia et al., 2001</xref>).

Nevertheless, derivatives with molecular weights from 90 to 1.7âkDa did not exhibit any biocidal effect against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> even at concentrations up to 10âmg/mL. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1082013211399195">Kim et al.

The deacetylation was conducted by heating in aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide containing sodium borohydride.

<sec id="sec40-1082013211399195"><title>MECHANISM OF ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION</title>
<p>The different mechanisms have been proposed whereas the exact mechanism of the antimicrobial action of chitin, chitosan and their derivatives is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1082013211399195">Rabea et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanisms of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan were different for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1082013211399195">Zheng and Zhu, 2003</xref>). In this study, they differentiated the effect of chitosan on <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Gram-positive) and on <italic>E. coli</italic> (Gram-negative). For Gram-positive <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the antimicrobial activity increased with increase the molecular weight of chitosan. Besides, for Gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic>, the antimicrobial activity increased with decrease in molecular weight. The authors suggested the following two different mechanisms for the antimicrobial activity: (1) in the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the chitosan on the surface of the cell can form a polymer membrane, which inhibits nutrients from entering the cell and, (2) for <italic>E. coli</italic>, where chitosan of lower molecular weight entered the cell through pervasion.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial mechanisms of CM, Q and CMQ are suggested as: on one hand, the positive charge of the group at C-2 resulted in a polycationic structure which can be expected to interact with the predominantly anionic components (lipopolysaccharides and proteins) of the microorganismsâ surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1082013211399195">Helander et al., 2001</xref>). The interaction resulted in great alteration of the structure of outer membrane which caused release of a major proportion of proteinaceous material from the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1082013211399195">Helander et al., 1998</xref>); when the quarternized group was introduced onto the molecular chain, the positive charge was strengthened. On the other hand, when carboxymethyl group was introduced along the molecular chain, the presence of a molecular structure with hydrophilic ends and weak interaction forming between hydrophilic ends and chitosan enhances the antimicrobial activity.</p>
<p>Because of the positive charge on the C-2 of the glucosamine monomer below pH 6, chitosan is more soluble and has a better antimicrobial activity than chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211399195">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). The exact mechanism of the antimicrobial action of chitin, chitosan and their derivatives is still imperfectly known, but different mechanisms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1082013211399195">Rabea et al., 2003</xref>). One of the reasons for the antimicrobial character of chitosan is its positively charged amino group which interacts with negatively charged microbial cell membranes, leading to the leakage of proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents of the microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-1082013211399195">Shahidi et al., 1999</xref>). Chitosan acted mainly on the outer surface of bacteria. At a lower concentration (0.2âmg/mL), the polycationic chitosan does probably bind to the negatively charged bacterial surface to cause agglutination, while at higher concentrations, the larger number of positive charges may have imparted a net positive charge to the bacterial surfaces to keep them in suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1082013211399195">Papineau et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1082013211399195">Sudarshan et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A strong attachment of heterologous bacteria to the walls in tobacco leaves is essential to elicit the HR. Therefore, from mechanistic point of views, it is possible that chitin derivatives prevent the attachment of bacterial cells into the plant cell walls or affect their survival in the intercellular spaces.</p>
<p>Chitosan acted mainly on the outer surface of the bacteria. The obvious antibacterial effects can be attributed to the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes between the polycationic agent and the bacterial cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1082013211399195">Muzzarelli et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, interaction between positively charged chitosan molecules and negatively charged microbial cell membranes leads to the leakage of proteinaceous and other intracellular constituents. Studies based on UV absorption indicated that the chitosan causes considerable losses of proteinic material to <italic>Pythium oaroecandrum</italic>, at a pH 5.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1082013211399195">Helander et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1082013211399195">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Different behaviors were reported, dependent on the chitosan concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1082013211399195">Rabea et al., 2003</xref>). At a lower concentration (&lt;0.2âmg/mL), the polycationic chitosan does probably bind to the negatively charged bacterial surface to cause agglutination, while at higher concentrations, the larger number of positive charges may have imparted a net positive charge to the bacterial surfaces to keep them in suspension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1082013211399195">Savard et al. (2002)</xref>, by a microscopic examination of <italic>Saccharomyces unisporus</italic> after treatment with chitosan-salt with a polymerization degree of 25,showed agglutination of a refractive substance on the entire cell wall. When chitosanase was added to the culture media containing chitosan-salt, they could not observe refractive substances. This result suggested an interaction between chitosan and the cell wall. In another study, chitosan caused leakage of glucose and lactate deshydrogenase from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1082013211399195">Tsai and Su, 1999</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of chitosan antibacterial action involves cross-linkage between the polycations of chitosan and the anions on the bacterial surface that change the membrane permeability. As already mentioned, chitosan coatings adjusted to pH 5.0 totally inhibited Gram-<?tjl?>positive bacterial surface growth such as <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, Gram-negative microbial strains such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> overcame the active chitosan protection, and the development was not completely excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211399195">Coma et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the microbiological target of protonated chitosan's action would be the cytoplasmic membrane of sensitive cells. Cellular damage can lead to the disruption of the cellular integrity of the membrane. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria could act as a barrier and be responsible for preventing chitosan from reaching the cytoplasmic membrane. Although the cytoplasmic membrane should be sensitive to chitosan, the outer membrane protects the cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1082013211399195">Zheng and Zhu (2003)</xref> also indicated that the mechanisms of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan were different between Gram-<?tjl?>positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They showed, in a comparative study, that the effect of chitosan was different on <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Gram-positive) and on <italic>E. coli</italic> (Gram-negative). To <italic>E. coli</italic>, the antimicrobial activity was enhanced as the molecular weight decreased. It was obvious that 0.25% chitosan solution (Mwâ&lt;â5âkDa) could inhibit the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. In contrast, for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the antimicrobial activity increased with increasing molecular weight of chitosan. The inhibiting effect was fairly obvious for higher ones, such as 305âkDa, even if the concentration was quite small. The authors suggested two possible mechanisms for antimicrobial activity: (1) the chitosan on the surface of the cell can form a polymer membrane, which prevents nutrients from entering the cell and (2) chitosan of lower molecular weight entered the cell through pervasion. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the dominant mechanism is the former, while for <italic>E. coli</italic>, the latter mechanism seems more likely. In addition, the chitosan has also the faculty to bind specifically with some macromolecules. It can thus inhibit various enzymes, bind to the DNA and inhibit the synthesis of the mRNA after penetration of the chitosan in the core of the microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1082013211399195">Hadwiger et al., 1985</xref>). Epifluorescence microscopy results showed a possible action of chitosan during a short duration of time on the synthesis of nucleic acids and especially on the relative proportion of RNA compared with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211399195">Coma et al., 2003</xref>). This impact was followed by an adaptative mechanism of the cells. Binding of chitosan with DNA and inhibition of mRNA synthesis occur through chitosan penetration toward the nuclei of the microorganisms and interference with the synthesis of mRNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1082013211399195">Rabea et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been postulated that the antimicrobial action of chitosan occurs as a result of several mechanisms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211399195">Chung and Chen (2008)</xref> studied the antibacterial activity of chitosan with respect to the extent of damaged or missing cell walls and the degree of leakage of enzymes and nucleotides from different cellular locations. First, the addition of chitosan to the bacterial suspension seemed to have a stronger impact on the Gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic> than on the Gram-positive <italic>S. aureus</italic> in terms of the leakage of enzymes. In addition, the experimental result revealed that the antimicrobial action of chitosan not only involves a reaction with the cell wall of the bacteria but also may affect the structure of the phospholipid bilayer in the cell membrane, thereby changing the permeability of the cell membrane, resulting in the release of some of the cellular components. This action was further enhanced when chitosan with a high degree of deacetylation was used. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which chitosan functions as a bactericide, the cells were also subjected to a known antibiotic which reacts with the anionic phosphate group of phospholipids in the cell membrane, destroying the cell membrane structure and affecting its permeability. In parallel, the cells were subjected to EDTA, a chemical chelating agent that destroys the structure of the cell wall by chelating with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> present in the cell wall. As a result, chitosan was found to react with both the cell wall and the cell membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic>, but not simultaneously, indicating that the inactivation by chitosan occurs via a two-step sequential mechanism: an initial separation of the cell wall from its cell membrane, followed by cell membrane destruction. Concerning the bioactivity of the chitosan against phytopathogenic fungi, it could be related with its potential elicitor of many plant defense responses, including for example the accumulation of chitinases or by producing phytoalexins, defined as âsubstances with antibiotic activity that function as growth inhibitors of phytopathogenic organisms, chiefly fungiâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211399195">Bade and Wick, 1987</xref>). In a study on <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Rhizopus stolonifer</italic>, chitosan-induced morphological changes were characterized by excessive hyphal branching and abnormal aerial surface hyphal growth compared to the control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1082013211399195">El Ghaouth et al., 1992</xref>). As a result, chitosan appears to play a dual function, by interfering directly with fungal growth and also by activating several biological processes in plant tissues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211399195">Benhamou et al. (1994)</xref> applied chitosan to decrease the infection with <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. Biopolymer coating was applied on seed prior to fungal inoculation. Chitosan at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1âmg/mL was used for the ultrastructural and cytochemical investigations. The authors observed that after a pretreatment with chitosan, the root tissues at sites of fungal penetration were always associated with the expression of plant defense reactions. In the epidermis, cells showed typical signs of necrosis characterized by marked disorganization of the cytoplasm. The pathogen was detected in the outer cortex where its development was halted. Fungal cells suffered from serious damage and were frequently encircled by an electron-dense material. In the noncolonized inner cortex, strong host reactions were detected that were mainly associated with the deposition of two types of materials that differed in their electron densities. Gold cytochemistry with a Ã-1,3-glucanase and a laccase showed that the more electron-dense material was phenolic in nature, whereas the other material, occurring either as deposits inserted between the phenolic aggregates or as globular structures lining the host cell walls, was made of Ã-1,3-glucans. These observations bring further evidence that chitosan is an active inducer of plant defense reactions and, thus, has the potential to become a powerful alternative means of disease control.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec41-1082013211399195"><title>FACTORS AFFECTING THE ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY</title>
<p>There are various factors, such as the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of chitosan: molecular weight, degree of polymerization, deacetylation, solubility and higher charge density that affect the antimicrobial activity of chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1082013211399195">Ralston et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-1082013211399195">Sekiguchi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr182-1082013211399195">Uchida, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The antimicrobial activities of chitosan and chitosan-based films increases by decreasing pH. This effect can be considered as synergetic for the reasons of the hurdle effect of the acid stress on the bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1082013211399195">Rhoades and Roller, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan and its derivatives is well studied. As theory, it has been suggested that the positive charge of the amine group (NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) at pH values lower than the pKa (pH &lt;6.3) at which this functional group carries 50% of its total electric charge allows the interactions with negatively charged microbial cell membranes, a phenomenon which is susceptible to cause a leakage of intracellular constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1082013211399195">Helander et al., 2001</xref>). However, even if this is a well-recognized explanation of chitosan antimicrobial effect, there is no direct evidence demonstrating this behavior against bacteria.</p>
<p>Lower pH increases the antimicrobial activity of chitosan for much the same reasons, in addition to the âhurdle effectâ of inflicting acid stress on the target organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1082013211399195">Rhoades and Rastall, 2000</xref>). Surrounding matrix is the greatest single influence on antimicrobial activity. Being cationic, chitosan has the potential to bind to many food components such as alginates, pectins, proteins and inorganic polyelectrolytes such as polyphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1082013211399195">Kubota and Kikuchi, 1998</xref>). Solubility can be decreased using high concentrations of low-molecular weight electrolytes such as sodium halides, sodium phosphate and organic anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1082013211399195">Roberts, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Sorption capacity of chitosan films was significantly affected by the moisture content of the chitosan-based films. Authors reported that a decrease of water content decreased the total amount of the active sites that can participate in the sorption phenomenon. Antibacterial activities of the produced chitosan-based films have been evaluated against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S aureus</italic> and it has been shown that diameters of the inhibition zones were 5 and 3âtimes higher than those of control for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S aureus</italic>, respectively. Authors showed that moisture content of chitosan films had significant effect on their bactericide effect which decreased on decreasing film moisture content. Decrease of film moisture content from 22% (w/w) down to 12% (w/w) decreased the bactericide activity by 2.5âtimes. This was demonstrated by the decreased diameter of the inhibition zone. This finding can be exploited in the cheese-making industry for cheese coating with chitosan films in the maturation chambers in order to avoid mold and pathogenic bacteria growth on cheese surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211399195">Buzinova and Shipovskaya, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of the molecular weight on some antibacterial and antifungal activities has been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211399195">Chen, 1998</xref>). Chitosans with molecular weights ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 have been found to be helpful in restraining the growth of bacteria. In addition, chitosan with an average molecular weight of 9300 was effective in restraining <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas that with a molecular weight of 2200 helped in accelerating the growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1082013211399195">Tokura et al., 1994</xref>). Moreover, the antibacterial activity of chitosan is influenced by its degree of deacetylation, its concentration in solution and the pH of the medium. Antibacterial activities were also found to be increasing in the order <italic>N</italic>,<italic>O</italic>-carboxymethylated chitosan, chitosan and <italic>O</italic>-carboxymethylated chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1082013211399195">Liu et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the formation of gas-permeable films, chitosan has a dual function: (1) to direct the interference of fungal growth and (2) to activate several defense processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211399195">Bai et al., 1988</xref>). These defense mechanisms include accumulation of chitinases, synthesis of proteinase inhibitors and lignification and induction of callous synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1082013211399195">El Ghaouth et al., 2000</xref>). When applied on wounded wheat leaves, chitosan-induced lignifications and consequently restricted the growth of nonpathogenic fungi in wheat. Chitosan inhibited the growth of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and aflatoxin production in liquid culture, preharvest maize and groundnut, and it also enhanced phytoalexin production in germinating peanut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211399195">Cuero et al., 1991a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211399195">b</xref>). Chitosan has also been found to inhibit growth and toxin production by <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> fungal species lycopersici in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211399195">Bhaskara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1082013211399195">Dornenburg and Knorr, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Chitosan solution at 0.10âmg/mL markedly inhibited the growth of <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> pathogenic bacteria (isolated from <italic>Euphorbia pulcherrima</italic>) from different geographical origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1082013211399195">Li et al., 2008</xref>). The antibacterial activity of chitosan solution against <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>poinsettiicola</italic> (strain R22580) increased with the increase of chitosan concentration up to 0.10âmg/mL. The antibacterial activity of chitosan solution at 0.05âmg/mL was enhanced by NaCl.</p>
<p>The antibacterial activity of chitosan was investigated by assessing the mortality rates of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> based on the extent of damaged or missing cell walls and the degree of leakage of enzymes and nucleotides from different cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211399195">Chung and Chen, 2008</xref>). The inactivation of <italic>E. coli</italic> by chitosan occurred via a two-step sequential mechanism: an initial separation of the cell wall from its cell membrane, followed by destruction of the cell membrane.</p>
<p>The antibacterial activities of chitosan nanoparticles and copper-loaded nanoparticles against <italic>E. coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> were evaluated by the calculation of MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1082013211399195">Qi et al., 2004</xref>). The obtained results showed that chitosan nanoparticles and copper-loaded nanoparticles could inhibit the growth of various bacteria tested. Their MIC values were less than 0.25âmg/mL and the MBC values of nanoparticles reached 1âmg/mL. They reported that the exposure of <italic>S. choleraesuis</italic> to the chitosan nanoparticles led to the disruption of cell membranes and the leakage of cytoplasm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec42-1082013211399195"><title>OPTIMIZATION OF THE BIOCIDE PROPERTIES</title>
<p>The bactericidal activities of chitosan (Mw 685âkDa) against various bacteria were more than 99% againstGram-negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> O-157, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>(except for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 68%) and more than 98% against Gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans, M. luteus, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Chitooligosaccharides showed a less bactericidal effect,with 71%, 56% and 60% against <italic>E. coli</italic> <?tjl?>O-157.for the high-, medium- and low-molecular weight samples, respectively. Another test was done against the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain, with bactericidal effects of about 47%, 35% and 22% for the high-, medium- and low-molecular weight chitosans, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1082013211399195">Tokura et al. (1997)</xref> prepared chitosan oligomers of average molecular weights 9.3 and 2.2âkDa by nitrous acid degradation followed by the reduction of 2,5-anhydromannose terminal by sodium borohydrate. Although the 9.3âkDa provided the growth inhibition of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the chitosan 2.2âkDa was not a growth inhibitor but a growth accelerator. It has been suggested that the smaller oligomers serve as nutrients for bacteria, whereas the higher oligomers are toxic by virtue of their charge-mediated adhesion to the cell membrane, which in turn prevents the uptake of nutrients through the cell wall. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1082013211399195">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> specified that the molecular weight of chitooligosaccharides is critical for microorganism inhibition and must be higher than 10âkDa. Several studies showed that the impact of the Mw on the bioactivity is dependent on the concentration of the biocide. They investigated the bioactivities of chitosans of different molecular weights, from 55 to 155âkDa, against <italic>E. coli</italic> with the same degree of deacetylation (80%). The mechanism of antibacterial activity was the flocculation of the strains. These authors observed that at high concentration (over 200âppm), the antibacterial activities of each chitosan sample were almost the same and all the bacteria could be killed. At low concentration (20âppm), there was no antibacterial activity and chitosan could promote the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. But at the middle range concentrations (50â100âppm), there were some differences between chitosans of different molecular weights in the antibacterial activation. Indeed, the authors concluded that at high concentrations (200, 500âand 1000âppm) and a low concentration (20âppm), the antibacterial activity of chitosan had no relationship to the molecular weight. But at concentrations ranging from 50 to 100âppm, the antibacterial activity of low-molecular weight chitosan is higher than that of the high-molecular weight samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1082013211399195">Qin et al. (2006)</xref> also showed that the molecular weight dependence of the antimicrobial activity of chitosan was more pronounced at a low concentration. The action of chitosans with molecular weights Mw from 1.4 to 400âkDa on the growth of <italic>S. aureus, E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> was explored by microcalorimetry. The chitosans with middle range values of Mw, 78 and 48âkDa, had higher inhibitory effect than others. Chitooligomer 1.4âkDa promoted the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but slightly inhibited growth of the bacteria. The 400âkDa, with the highest Mw, exhibited a much weaker inhibitory effect in comparison with the chitosan at 78âkDa. It seems that the water-insoluble chitosans with Mw around 50âkDa were the optimum ones for antimicrobial action in their tested samples. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1082013211399195">Zheng and Zhu (2003)</xref> observed that for chitosan with molecular weight below 300âkDa, the antimicrobial effect on <italic>S. aureus</italic> was strengthened as the molecular weight increased. In contrast, the effect on <italic>E. coli</italic> was weakened. In parallel to depolymerization, chemical modifications of chitosan have been attempted to improve its antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>The influence on biocide performance of some unprecedented physicochemical features of chitosan cast films such as film thickness, pH of the nutrient broth, film neutralization, film autoclave sterilization and temperature exposure was analyzed against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and in some experiments also against <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. The work demonstrates, for the first time, the influence of the release or positive migration of protonated glucosamine fractions from the biopolymer into the microbial culture as the responsible event for the antimicrobial performance of the biopolymer under the studied conditions. From the results, a reliable and reproducible method for the determination of the bactericidal activity of chitosan-based films was developed in an attempt to standardize the testing conditions for the optimum design of active antimicrobial food packaging films and coating applications. The optimization of biocide properties of chitosan will be useful for its application in the design of active films of interest in the food area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1082013211399195">Fernandez-Saiz et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec>
