<abstract>
<p>The difficulty of measuring the prevalence of doping in elite sport is a recurring topic in the scientific literature on doping. The Randomized Response Technique is a method for asking such embarrassing or even threatening questions while allowing the respondents to answer honestly. It was used to measure the prevalence of doping among German squad athletes by Pitsch et al. (2005, 2007). In a replication study with better sampling control, it was possible to replicate the general trend of the data from the 2005 study. Nevertheless, there are differences in the details between the two sets of findings. An additional explorative analysis reveals that gender has an important impact on doping decisions. Most theories of doping, especially those derived from systems theory or economic game theory address neither the central findings nor the influence of gender. Based on these findings, we will discuss questions of theory development in relation to empirical evidence.</p>

<p>One of the recurring topics in the literature on doping issues is the difficulty in measuring the prevalence of doping, especially in elite sport. Nevertheless, this measurement is sometimes considered important – if not crucial – for theory development as well as for the planning and evaluation of anti-doping policies:
<disp-quote>
<p>The development of an epidemiology of performance enhancing drug (PED) use in sport has been restricted by the absence of a reliable and valid indicator of drug use. [. . .] The absence of a reliable indicator has significant implications for assessing the value of interventions to ameliorate or eliminate drug use in sport.

<title>1. Estimations of the prevalence of doping in elite sport</title>
<p>The estimations of the prevalence of doping in the literature are based mostly on the number of positive doping test results, on questionnaires about self-reported drug use with direct questioning, as well as on questionnaires about drug use by other athletes. An overview of the different methods and techniques, the measured prevalences, as well as the known sources for biased results is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211413969">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The annually published WADA laboratory statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1012690211413969">WADA, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1012690211413969">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1012690211413969">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1012690211413969">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1012690211413969">2008</xref>) give insight into the maximum number of dopers identified per year. The rate of adverse analytical findings per year has remained more or less constant at a level of approximately 2 percent over the last few years although the tests have developed in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, and the number of tests conducted annually has increased enormously. This figure is likely to exceed the true score of detected dopers as it may contain results that underwent Therapeutic Use Exemption approval as well as multiple measurements on individual athletes in longitudinal studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1012690211413969">WADA, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, as these statistics do not account for the results of B-sample analyses, the figure might represent a slight overestimation of the rate of detected dopers.</p>
<p>These figures cannot reflect the rate of dopers in the population of elite athletes for several reasons. The low number of tests compared to the number of athletes competing internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211413969">Mottram, 2005</xref>), the availability of efficient tests for new substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1012690211413969">Yesalis et al., 2001</xref>), and the ability of drug-using athletes ‘to beat the system by virtue of their access to expert advice from team doctors or other sports physicians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1012690211413969">Waddington and Smith, 2009</xref>: 120) are only a few reasons mentioned in the literature for assuming a massive underestimation. The same problems hold for articles discussing the doping prevalence based on the results of international or national doping test regimes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211413969">Bahr and Tjornhom, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211413969">Benzi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211413969">Delbeke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1012690211413969">Van Eenoo and Delbeke, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In comparison to these figures, attempts at measuring the doping prevalence with the help of questionnaires about self-reported drug use with direct questioning led to somewhat higher results (see also the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211413969">Backhouse et al., 2007</xref>). Due to the different scopes of the studies (focus on special disciplines or on special substances) and the different instruments used (questions on lifetime use or on certain periods), the results of these studies differ largely and are often inconsistent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211413969">Blouin and Goldfield (1995)</xref> ascertained a steroid usage prevalence of 77.8 percent among competitive bodybuilders. Among bodybuilders who did not take part in competitions, they reported a prevalence of 20 percent, which was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211413969">Houlihan (2002)</xref> in this population. Among the members of 15 Danish gyms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211413969">Pedersen (2005)</xref> measured a doping prevalence of 4.7 percent. Among elite athletes from 14 national sports federations, this figure was 1.6 percent, whereas among licensed cyclists the prevalence was once again apparently higher (9.4%).</p>
<p>Such instruments have been proven reliable in inoffensive settings like anonymous high school surveys with self-administered questionnaires (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211413969">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, there is severe doubt as to whether these work equally well in a more threatening setting, such as a survey on the use of prohibited substances or methods by elite athletes. The methodological problems reported when investigating in the context of elite sport included poor stability of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1012690211413969">Yesalis et al., 1988</xref>) and hints at a high but unknown degree of underestimation of the use of doping substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211413969">Pedersen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Estimations of the prevalence of doping have also been conducted by asking athletes about their perception of the rate of sportsmen and -women using banned drugs. As with the aforementioned surveys, there were different interests in the different studies, which make the results hard to compare. The overall prevalence estimates from such attempts range up to 30 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211413969">Alaranta et al., 2008</xref>) but differ largely due to the substance group and the discipline(s) investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211413969">Mottram, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1012690211413969">Scarpino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1012690211413969">Waddington and Smith, 2009</xref>). As these studies often focused on special substances (e.g. steroids), the figures can only be seen as the lowest limit of drug use in sport. Furthermore, these instruments only reflect the perceived rate of drug users among athletes and cannot, on the face of it, be taken as an estimation of the prevalence of doping.</p>
<p>Besides these attempts to estimate the prevalence of doping using ‘classical’ methods, there has been intensive development in the measurement of hidden deviant behaviour, first and foremost in the literature on (socio-) psychological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211413969">Ahart and Sackett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211413969">Coutts and Jann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211413969">Lensvelt-Mulders et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1012690211413969">Wimbush and Dalton, 1997</xref>). From these techniques, only the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) has been used to estimate the rate of dopers in elite sport more reliably than with the aforementioned techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1012690211413969">Striegel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1012690211413969">Striegel et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1012690211413969">2010</xref>). This method guarantees that there is no possibility to make inferences about behaviour from respondents’ answers to an embarrassing question, thus further enhancing the security of conventional techniques in ensuring anonymity in structured questionnaires. In many cases, this technique was shown to lead to more reliable results where the rate of deviant behaviour was measured (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211413969">Lensvelt-Mulders et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1012690211413969">Tracy and Fox, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>For German elite sport (A-, B-, and C-squad athletes in Olympic sports), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">2007</xref>) reported the rate of athletes who had used doping techniques at least once during their sporting career to be between 25.8 percent and 48.1 percent. In the 2005 season, the prevalence rate of doping was between 20.4 percent and 38.7 percent. Correspondingly, at least 51.9 percent of athletes must be assumed to have never used doping techniques. In the 2005 season, 61.3 percent of athletes competed without using illicit drugs or methods to enhance their sporting performance. In 2008, there was an attempt to replicate the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">2007</xref>), which revealed interesting results from the point of view of empirical social research in the field of doping. Since the scientific implications of the results cannot be valued without referring to the method, we shall first briefly outline the Randomized Response Technique (RRT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1012690211413969" sec-type="methods">
<title>2. Method and hypotheses</title>
<p>As the Randomized Response survey method has been described in detail several times (see the review of 35 years of methodological research in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211413969">Lensvelt-Mulders et al., 2005</xref>), the following description is designed solely to help readers who might not be familiar with this method to understand why these surveys often lead to more reliable results than direct questioning. The method used in the current research was comparable to that used previously (forced-answer technique with cheater detection) and has been described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Embarrassing or even threatening questions in any field of social research often lead to biased results due to suppositions of social desirability by the interviewees. The RRT deals with this bias by inhibiting inference about the behaviour of the respondent from his or her answers, and provides insight into the proportion of people in the collective who display the sensitive attribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211413969">Lensvelt-Mulders et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In our case, one of the embarrassing questions the athletes were asked was: ‘Have you ever used illicit drugs or methods in order to enhance your sporting performance?’</p>
<p>Before the interviewee answered this question, he or she received an additional instruction: ‘If your mother was born in the months of January, February, March or April, please answer ‘‘Yes’’, irrespective of whether you have ever behaved in that way. If your mother was born in any other month, please answer honestly.’</p>
<p>The proportion of ‘Yes’ answers derived from this instruction can be calculated by using the distribution of births over the months, which is well known from population censuses. This makes it possible to (maximum likelihood) estimate the proportion of dopers in the collective without threatening honestly answering deviant athletes. It remains unknown for each individual ‘Yes’ answer whether it refers to the athletes’ behaviour or to the month of birth of his or her mother. The structure of the ‘forced answer’ technique is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211413969">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1012690211413969" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1012690211413969-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Although this technique allows deviators to answer honestly, RRT surveys have been shown to suffer from a bias produced by ‘cheaters’ in a special sense of the word: interviewees who do not behave according to the instruction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211413969">Locander et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1012690211413969">Shimizu and Bonham, 1978</xref>). This kind of cheating can arise from deviators who do not understand or trust this technique and answer ‘No’ even if they were instructed to answer honestly. It can also derive from conformists who do not trust the technique and who fear they would incriminate themselves if they were to answer ‘Yes.’ This problem can be resolved by using two different samples of athletes with different probabilities for answering ‘Yes’ in the additional instruction (e.g. by using different numbers of birth months). This technique enables the researcher to estimate the proportion of ‘cheaters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211413969">Clark and Desharnais, 1998</xref>). The results of this research reveal the proportion of honestly answering deviators (here, dopers), the proportion of honestly answering conformists, and the proportion of ‘cheaters’ whose behaviour the researchers know nothing about. The interval containing the true score of dopers is then delimited by the rate of ‘honest dopers’ and the sum of the proportions of ‘honest dopers’ and ‘cheaters’.</p>
<p>Besides the attempt at estimating the overall prevalence of doping, the results of the exploration in 2005 produced three hypotheses concerning the rate of dopers in different disciplines and at different levels of athletic success:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H1</italic>: The proportion of dopers is higher in cgs disciplines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211413969">1</xref></sup> (see below) than in games.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This effect was highly predictable and corresponds at least in part to the vulnerability hypothesis formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211413969">Loland (2004)</xref>. Furthermore, there was one effect in the 2005 study that seemed counterintuitive. The rate of doping throughout their career was not very different among athletes who had never reached a higher-than-national level of competition (24.2% ‘honest dopers’) than among athletes who had reached higher levels (23.8% ‘honest dopers’). In the 2005 season, however, doping among athletes competing at the international level was less frequent (12.1% ‘honest dopers’) than among athletes competing at lower levels (26.7% ‘honest dopers’). This result, as well as the differences between the discipline categories, was highly consistent with an attempt at explaining doping decisions as rational choices based on cost–benefit analyses (briefly sketched out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>3. Population and samples</title>
<p>The survey started in spring 2008. The population of German squad athletes was drawn from the list of national squad athletes the German Olympic Sports Federation had provided in autumn 2006, as this was the last complete list covering all Olympic disciplines that had been provided. The proportion of athletes who ended their career in the time between the compilation of the list and the conduct of the survey caused a certain proportion of error variance in the data, but this effect was unavoidable if we wanted to measure doping behaviour across all Olympic sporting disciplines in Germany.</p>
<p>The list contained 5409 current addresses of athletes and was divided randomly into two samples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211413969">2</xref></sup> The athletes in Sample 1 were contacted by mail and asked to participate in an online survey, while those in sample 2 were requested to fill out a classic paper-based questionnaire. A thorough methodological analysis comparing the results of these two different conditions revealed that the online survey failed when it came to producing reliable results (see Pitsch and Emrich, in preparation). The sample for the postal survey was subdivided randomly into two samples. Different questionnaires were sent to these two subsamples using different birth months in the additional instruction (see above), in accordance with the cheater-detection model. The athletes were asked to answer the paper-based questionnaire and to send it back in a prepared envelope prepaid by the researchers.</p>
<p>In the paper-based survey (sample size: 2704), 863 athletes participated, corresponding to a respondent rate of 31.9 percent. Bearing in mind that elite sport, especially in Germany, is a field that seems to be over-investigated, this response rate was satisfactory as it comes close to the typical response rates in classical empirical social research, even with less sensitive questions. There was a significant difference in participation by gender (women participated more often than men; χ<sup>2</sup> = 32.71; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but the contingency coefficient C = 0.06 revealed that this effect was rather weak and was significant only because of the high number of records.</p>
<p>Due to the low number of respondents in the different kinds of sports, the data cannot be evaluated at that level. For this reason, the disciplines were categorized according to the schema developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211413969">Emrich et al. (2001)</xref>. The distribution of respondents over the five categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1012690211413969">Table 2</xref>) did not differ significantly between the two survey forms (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.69; d.f. = 3; n.s.) but did differ significantly, although with only a weak effect size, between the total sample and the population (χ<sup>2</sup> = 25.58; d.f. = 3; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; C’ = 0.04). In artistic-compositional sports (sum: 109 records) and in combat sports (sum: 107 records), the cell frequencies were too low to evaluate specific effects. Nevertheless, categorizing led to sufficient cell frequencies in the games and the cgs disciplines.</p>

<p>Of the respondents, 93.3 percent had participated in competitions at least at the European level during their career (63.2% international level, worldwide; 30.1% international level, European).

<title>4. The rate of dopers in elite sport</title>
<p>The paper-based survey resulted in a rate of 10.2 percent ‘honest dopers’, irrespective of the disciplines, obtained with the question: ‘Have you ever knowingly used illicit drugs or methods in order to enhance your performance?’ By adding the rate of cheaters (24.7%), whose behaviour the researchers know nothing about, one can calculate the interval (10.2%, 34.9%), which should include the true rate of dopers throughout their career among German elite athletes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1012690211413969">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, this means that the larger proportion of athletes, namely, 65.2 percent, represents ‘honest non-dopers’. In the 2008 season, this figure was 65.0 percent.</p>

<p>Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1012690211413969">Figure 2</xref> shows that the intervals in the 2005 and 2008 surveys overlap considerably on both questions, there was a significant difference in the estimated proportion of dopers. For the athletes’ whole career, the lower (<italic>t</italic> = 41.95; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05) and the upper limits of the interval (<italic>t</italic> = 18.55; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05) differed significantly. The differences for the 2008 season were also significant for the lower (<italic>t</italic> = 28.47; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) limit of the interval, whereas this did not hold for the upper limits (<italic>t</italic> = 5.11; d.f. = 1; n.s.). These unexpected differences between the 2005 and the 2008 survey might have resulted from the methodological differences between these two studies. All the same, the hypothesized effects concerning differences between disciplines and between levels of success should not be affected by this result.</p>
<p>The rates of dopers competing in cgs sports and in games show that the differences are consistent with the hypothesized trend (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1012690211413969">Figure 3</xref>). For the question concerning the athletes’ career, the differences were significant for the upper limit of the interval (<italic>t</italic> = 25.33; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05). As the rate of ‘honest dopers’ throughout their career among players was estimated to be zero, H3 had to be tested indirectly for the lower limit of the interval by testing whether the lower limit of the interval estimated for cgs athletes differed substantially from zero. The rate of 16.16 percent ‘honest dopers’ among cgs athletes was found to be significantly larger than zero (χ<sup>2</sup> = 52.20; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). As the figures for the 2008 season did not differ very much from the estimations concerning the career, the results of the statistical tests for this question were similar to the findings already presented. The difference was significant for the upper limit (<italic>t</italic> = 17.08; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05) as well as for the lower limit (χ<sup>2</sup> = 38.32; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>The estimations by level of competition participation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1012690211413969">Figure 4</xref>. Interestingly enough, the differences between the levels in the current season were consistent with H2, while the effect concerning the course of the career (H3) showed the opposite trend of what was hypothesized. As these differences were significant (lower limit: <italic>t</italic> = 15.75; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05; upper limit: <italic>t</italic> = 11.20; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05), H3, which had been formulated based on the 2005 results, had to be rejected. Further attempts at replication are necessary to disclose which effect holds true.</p>

<p>The differences in the prevalence of doping between athletes currently competing at the international level and those currently competing at the national level were significant for the current season (lower limit: <italic>t</italic> = 18.84; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05; upper limit: <italic>t</italic> = 18.84; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(1-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05). A confounding explanation of the effect based on an underrepresentation of cgs athletes at higher levels of competition could be excluded. Although the representation of athletes differed significantly from an equal distribution (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.49; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), in fact, cgs athletes were not under- but overrepresented at higher levels of competition.</p>
<p>In addition to the hypothesized effects, an explorative data analysis revealed an astonishing and interesting effect that ought to be taken into consideration in the work on social scientific theories on the determinants of individual doping decisions. This effect was disclosed in calculating the estimations by gender (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1012690211413969">Figure 5</xref>). The differences were not only substantial; they were furthermore statistically reliable for the course of the career (lower limit: <italic>t</italic> = 28.61; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05; upper limit: <italic>t</italic> = 26.63; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05) as well as for the 2008 season (lower limit: <italic>t</italic> = 30.0; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05; upper limit: <italic>t</italic> = 28.42; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic><sub>(2-tailed)</sub> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, a χ<sup>2</sup> test revealed that the rate of female ‘honest dopers’ did not differ significantly from zero either for the total career (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.95; d.f. = 1; n.s.) or for the 2008 season (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.49; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), whereas the corresponding rates among male athletes were significantly larger than zero (career: χ<sup>2</sup> = 53.25; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; 2008 season: χ<sup>2</sup> = 48.89; d.f. = 1; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). It is highly remarkable that this effect is not subject to confounded data as the distribution of discipline categories (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.43; d.f. = 5; n.s.), as well as the distribution of the levels of competition participation, is far from differing significantly by gender (highest level ever reached: χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.02; d.f. = 3; n.s.; level in 2008 season: χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.39; d.f. = 3; n.s.).</p>

<title>5. Discussion of the results</title>
<p>In surveys on unobservable deviant behaviour, there is always the possibility that the results will be heavily biased. The degree of bias is assumed to be influenced by the degree to which the sensitive behaviour is observable to the researcher, by the relevance of the behaviour to the interviewee, and by the degree to which the answer to a sensitive question is publicly observable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211413969">Esser, 1986</xref>). In the current study, we attempted to control this bias with the help of the randomized response technique, thus trying to replicate the results of the 2005 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211413969">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Concerning the methodological issues of our research, the study revealed that the results of the online survey in the 2008 season were heavily biased, although in 2005 this technique worked quite well. The reasons for the differences between the surveys were assumed in the individual bonding costs necessary for participation. Due to this bias, the data concerning the scientific issues were based solely on the records of the paper-based survey.</p>
<p>The data analysis showed that the upper limit of the rate of dopers among squad athletes in Germany is 35 percent, thus corroborating one central result of the 2005 study, namely, that more than half of athletes do not resort to illicit drugs. Apart from this, it was shown that the valuation of the rate of about 2 percent ‘adverse analytical findings’ in the WADA statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1012690211413969">WADA, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1012690211413969">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1012690211413969">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1012690211413969">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1012690211413969">2008</xref>) was too low to represent the true doping prevalence rate in elite sport.</p>
<p>Beyond these consistent interpretations, there was a significant difference in the estimated rate of dopers. In the 2005 season, the lower limit was estimated to be 20.4 percent, whereas in the 2008 season, this figure was 9.6 percent. This difference cannot simply be interpreted as a decrease in doping behaviour. One of the main criticisms of the 2005 study was that the distribution of interviewees by disciplines did not match the distribution in the population and that the sample was dominated by cyclists and weightlifters. This led to the speculation that the estimations were too high. The results of our current research prove that this argument may be true but that the prevalence of doping in German elite sport is nevertheless far in excess of the rates of positive cases disclosed by the WADA. Furthermore, the discussion of the methodological issues above leads to the argument that these lower figures may be subject to bias as a result of uneven self-recruitment of dopers and non-dopers. Although this research is far from being a completed programme, there is some plausibility in assuming that the rate of dopers per season in Germany lies between 10 percent and 35 percent.</p>
<p>As the analysis concerning H1 to H3 showed, these figures are to a large extent influenced by different parameters. First and foremost, the discipline in which the athletes compete influences doping behaviour. The expected differences between cgs athletes and players are consistent with different structures of performance in these disciplines, where performance in cgs sports is often dominated by few parameters that can be influenced rather well, while performance in games is far more complex. Additionally, cgs disciplines are more often individual sports, while games players mostly perform in teams. This leads to a higher expectancy of being labelled a valuable athlete after performing well in cgs sports than in games. Accordingly, players can be characterized as having a lower probability of influencing their overall performance through doping due to a similar risk of being detected, a higher risk of being played out by free riders within their team, and a lower probability of being labelled as personally valuable than cgs athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the influence of the discipline, the level of competition participation is important for doping decisions. Our results concerning the 2008 season proved the assumption, formulated after the 2005 study, that doping is to a large extent a problem within the ‘second tier’ of athletes: among athletes competing up to the national level, the rate of ‘honest dopers’ is significantly higher than among athletes competing at higher levels. This effect can also be explained within a rational choice paradigm, which explains doping as a result of a cost–benefit analysis. For athletes competing at international levels, both the monetary as well as the prestige costs in the case of detection exceed the costs at lower levels, while the risk of detection is comparably higher. Furthermore, the utility of achieving high performance is lowered as many of these athletes have already peaked in their career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211413969">Pitsch et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A rational choice explanation of doping behaviour, however, will be delimited by the need to empirically reveal individual determinants of doping decisions. The different results of the estimations by gender show that beyond the logic of the situation, there are important influences on doping decisions beyond the scope of this theory that must be taken into consideration in order to model doping behaviour adequately. This limitation is not only crucial to individualistic theories but also to collectivistic systems-theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211413969">Bette, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211413969">Bette and Schimank, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211413969">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211413969">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211413969">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211413969">Bette et al., 2002</xref>) and economic game-theoretical explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211413969">Bird and Wagner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211413969">Breivik, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211413969">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211413969">Daumann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211413969">Eber and Thépot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211413969">Haugen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211413969">Keck and Wagner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1012690211413969">Tangen and Breivik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1012690211413969">Wagner and Keck, 1990</xref>). Neither of these theoretical approaches has yet drawn different conclusions for male and female athletes. Attention to the logic of the situation, which in principle does not differ according to gender, was much too dominant in developing these theories.</p>

<sec id="section6-1012690211413969">
<title>6. Implications for social scientific theories on doping decisions</title>
<p>In order to discuss the implications of the results of empirical social research on the prevalence of doping within a population for the development of social scientific theories, two different analytical categorizations shall be conducted: one concerning the subject of the theoretical explanation and one concerning the quality of the hypotheses that can be derived from these theories, especially the question of whether the theories allow the derivation of hypotheses that can fail when tested empirically. In Popperian terms, this relates to the empirical content of the theories.</p>
<p>In the field of doping, there are manifold theories provided in the literature. The following outline of theoretical approaches can only cover those that are directly linked to the doping behaviour of individuals and/or to the effect of these doping decisions in terms of prevalence rates. There are a large number of specific theories that must be omitted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690211413969">3</xref></sup> Among these are theories dealing with the (historical) development of institutions in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211413969">Dimeo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211413969">Houlihan, 2004</xref>), with the legitimacy of anti-doping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211413969">Beamish and Ritchie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1012690211413969">Senkel, 2009</xref>), or with aspects of special forms of doping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211413969">McNamee, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, there are a large number of small-range theories dealing with the influence and role of physicians and coaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211413969">Dawson and McNamee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211413969">Laure et al., 2003</xref>), or of special (psychological) determinants (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211413969">Mazanov et al., 2008</xref>) or the sociocultural and ideological context of doping decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1012690211413969">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1012690211413969">Stewart and Smith, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1012690211413969">2010b</xref>). As the scope of these theories is too narrow to enable estimations of prevalence rates, these theories also cannot be developed further on the basis of data about effects at a collective level.</p>
<p>With respect to the phenomenon explained by the remaining theories of doping behaviour, we find subjects at three different levels. The first level refers to the athletes’ individual decisions for or against doping. At this level, where the subject of explanation is well defined, we find economic theories based on game-theoretical models to explain the outcome of individual decisions, which primarily emphasize the structure of the decisive situation (mostly the prisoners’ dilemma; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211413969">Berentsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211413969">Berentsen and Lengwiler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211413969">Breivik, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211413969">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211413969">Eber and Thépot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211413969">Haugen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211413969">Keck and Wagner, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211413969">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1012690211413969">Wagner and Keck, 1990</xref>). Interestingly enough, economic theories based on the ‘subjectively expected utility’ paradigm often come to similar results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211413969">Maennig, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211413969">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690211413969">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1012690211413969">Tietzel and Müller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1012690211413969">Wagner, 2000</xref>). A common quality of these models is that they work with very highly abstracted assumptions concerning the costs and utilities connected to the different actions (doping versus non-doping) as well as the structure of the situation. In accordance with this, the results of the modelling, as well as recommendations for a more efficient anti-doping strategy, can neither be linked to empirical observations nor can they be used for planning activities due to their low level of specification. Only in the case of oversimplifying, two-person, one-shot games, where these analyses lead to a doping-doping Nash equilibrium, can this implication be subject to empirical testing as they predict a doping prevalence of 100 percent.</p>
<p>Similar to the focus on the subjectively expected utility, but with a lower level of specificity concerning the question of the relative valuation of different sources of utility, we can also find lists of (assumed) determinants that drive individual decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211413969">Alaranta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211413969">Bette, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211413969">Bette et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211413969">Bette and Schimank, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1012690211413969">Verroken, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1012690211413969">2005</xref>). A more sophisticated explanation is provided if these determinants are integrated into a nomological network, as is the case in a number of sociological explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211413969">Moeller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211413969">Pedersen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1012690211413969">Tangen and Breivik, 2001</xref>). As these approaches list a variety of determinants and partly reflect on their interactions, they do not lack empirical embeddedness. Nevertheless, due to the lack of quantification of the relative weights of determinants in social scientific analyses, this approach cannot lead to empirically falsifiable hypotheses with respect to the prevalence of doping. Furthermore, as long as social scientific approaches mention not only determinants of doping decisions but also factors that lead to decisions against doping, these theories must remain without empirical content (in a strict sense) as long as there are no reasonable assumptions concerning the distribution of the relative values of the different determinants and the distribution of benefits and costs in the population under study. These specifications would allow the prevalence to be predicted within a population. Without these specifications, any prevalence that is measured empirically is consistent with the theory.</p>
<p>A second level of theories describes and explains the phenomenon of doping at a macro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211413969">Coakley and Hughes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211413969">Moeller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1012690211413969">Waddington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1012690211413969">Waddington and Smith, 2009</xref>), sometimes with special focus on the historical development of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211413969">Hoberman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211413969">2007</xref>). At this conceptual level, the phenomenon of doping must not be solely understood as a quantitative phenomenon referring to the probability of individual decisions or to the relative number of dopers in a population but one that encompasses media coverage, the expectations of stakeholders and public discussions about the phenomenon. For these theories, which emphasize the outcome of interactions between the decisions of different individual and collective actors, direct empirical testing is impossible as there are no links to quantifying the results of the very complex constellations of interconnected decisions.</p>
<p>Between these two levels, there are a small number of theories at an intermediate level that explain the (relative) rate of dopers in a (sub)population based on the special structure of the population and on the interaction of nearly equally performing athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211413969">Loland, 2004</xref>). Among these, the position of Loland has the potential to be tested empirically after further specification of the concept of ‘vulnerability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211413969">2004</xref>: 198) and without qualification of the relative influences of the vulnerability effect and other (concurrent) effects.</p>
<p>Apart from this categorization, very few theories in this field can be seen as multilevel theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211413969">Bette, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211413969">Bette and Schimank, 1995</xref>, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211413969">Houlihan, 2002</xref>) covering macro structures as well as individual decisions. The theories also obviously lack empirical content, as they do neither quantify the relative values of individual determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211413969">Bette and Schimank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211413969">Houlihan, 2002</xref>), nor do they allow for the quantification of the effects of high-level explanations, such as the medicalization of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211413969">Houlihan, 2002</xref>) or the interdependence of altogether 12 subsystems of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211413969">Bette and Schimank, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it could be shown in the literature that measuring the prevalence of doping among elite athletes is considered important, the question of whether this measurement can support the development of social scientific theories on doping is far from trivial. Only a few of the theories mentioned can fail directly as they predict an extremely high or an extremely low prevalence. These predictions stem first and foremost from some oversimplified game-theoretical models. If we take theories literally, any theory that mentions only the reasons for doping but not the reasons against it or vice versa (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211413969">Bette, 2002</xref>) would fail. Nevertheless, these cases of failure are trivial since it is unlikely that any social scientist would agree with a predicted 100 percent or 0 percent prevalence. As none of the theories cited above allows us to derive quantitative hypotheses directly, none of them can fail simply from measuring the prevalence or from measuring the differences between the prevalence rates in different populations apart from these trivial cases. Nevertheless, the relative rate of dopers seems important in many respects as it describes the equilibrium that has evolved under the given distribution of determinants at an individual level, which arise partially from education and socialization in sport and from the anti-doping strategy currently in effect. From that point of view, a measured prevalence of doping is somewhat like a goal for a quantifying theory of doping behaviour.</p>
<p>Apart from the strong Popperian point of view on theory development via falsifying hypotheses that we have taken so far, measuring the prevalence of doping can nevertheless be useful in several respects. There are three possible issues where the ability to reliably estimate the rate of dopers can support sociological theory development, but this benefit does not come easy.</p>
<p>The first of these has been mentioned earlier in the discussion of individualistic theories of doping behaviour. It relies on well-conducted research into the relative values of different determinants for doping behaviour. This could lead to more elaborated models of individual doping behaviour (e.g. in a rational choice paradigm). Developing formal (mathematical) models of doping decisions based on these theories could lead to quantitative predictions of the prevalence of doping under predefined conditions. Even if it were not possible to measure every possible determinant mentioned in sociological theories, the comparison between the predicted and the measured rates of dopers could be used to enhance the fit of the models to (indirectly) observed behaviour, thus further making it possible to derive falsifiable hypotheses and estimate the outcome of preventive programmes.</p>
<p>The replicated results of our studies concerning variations in prevalence due to the level of competition participation and to the different sport categories support various theories and challenge other scientists who had predicted different results. As an example: the vulnerability thesis provided by Loland is far from being immediately testable, but the concept of ‘specialization’, which means that ‘performances are based primarily on one or a few motor abilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211413969">Loland, 2004</xref>: 192), is connected, at least to some extent, to measuring performance in physical units in cgs sports. Thus, the differences between cgs sports and games were not directly predicted by the theory, but the vulnerability thesis is supported to some extent by the result.</p>
<p>The third issue comes with the unexpected or even counterintuitive results of explorative analyses. None of the theories referred to had predicted different doping behaviours depending on gender. The stable differences in the prevalence of doping, however, reveal important implications for individualistic theories as well as for theories at a collective level as there are either different patterns of determinants by gender or known differences in socialization that lead to these results. In addition, this phenomenon should also be reflected when planning preventive educational programmes.</p>
<p>In addition to aspects of the quality of social scientific theories, there are also shortcomings regarding the methodology of empirical social research. Even if theories on doping behaviour were sufficiently developed to allow for quantifying derivations, the social scientific methodology might not be sophisticated enough to provide tests for these hypotheses. The Randomized Response Technique presented here is a good example of this problem: although it can be seen as a solution to the problem of biased results when measuring sensitive behaviour, it in turn produces new methodological problems. The main problem is the high number of respondents necessary to reliably estimate the results. Due to the additional instruction in order to secure the privacy of respondents, a substantial proportion of the answers provide no information about the behaviour under study. In the study presented here, about 16 percent of the population answered the questionnaire. It was therefore impossible to evaluate the results for effects in single events (e.g. cycling); instead, the athletes had to be grouped into sports categories (here, cgs sports, including cycling as well as sailing, for example). As a result, small-range theories developed on the basis of observations in single events (such as, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211413969">Brissonneau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211413969">Moeller, 2008</xref>) might contain quantifying hypotheses that cannot be tested at present: using classical methods for estimating the prevalence would lead to inaccurate results due to measurement bias, while using the Randomized Response Technique would lead to inaccurate results due to the limited population and the limitations of the method.</p>
<p>At present, sociological theories explaining doping behaviour do not seem to be qualified for thorough empirical testing, nor does empirical social research methodology provide tools sophisticated enough to conduct such testing. Nevertheless, a weak relationship between these areas might drive a promising coevolution that could lead to a better understanding of (non-)doping decisions. It is, of course, difficult to find an appropriate way to measure the prevalence of doping, especially in elite sport, but it is by no means impossible to approximate the true rate of dopers. Although this empirical research can never be more than an approximation, it serves to show the limitations of the theoretical work on the phenomenon of doping. The perception that ‘the prevalence of doping [. . .] is difficult to estimate among elite athletes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1012690211413969">Sottas et al., 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1012690211413969">Yesalis et al., 2001</xref>) cannot exonerate researchers from the obligation to describe the subject of their work thoroughly before or in parallel to developing theories about how the subject evolves. Only social scientific empirical work can protect us from the temptation to develop theories that explain phenomena that do not exist at all.</p>
