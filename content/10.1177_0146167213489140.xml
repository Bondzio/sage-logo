<abstract>
<p>The communication of group-based anger in intergroup conflict is often associated with destructive conflict behavior. However, we show that communicating group-based anger toward the out-group can evoke <italic>empathy</italic> and thus <italic>reduce</italic> intergroup conflict. This is because it stresses the value of maintaining a positive long-term intergroup relationship, thereby increasing understanding for the situation (in contrast to the communication of the closely related emotion of contempt). Three experiments demonstrate that the communication of group-based anger indeed reduces destructive conflict intentions compared with (a) a control condition (Experiments 1-2), (b) the communication of group-based contempt (Experiment 2), and (c) the communication of a combination of group-based anger and contempt (Experiments 2-3). Moreover, results from all three experiments reveal that empathy mediated the positive effect of communicating “pure” group-based anger. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of communicating emotions in intergroup conflicts.</p>

<body>
<p>Extensive literature on anger management suggests that anger is a potentially destructive emotion that when expressed actively harms relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213489140">DiGuiseppe &amp; Tafrate, 2003</xref>). The entrenched view is thus that conflicts are best resolved when anger is kept under wraps. Indeed, the advice you would <italic>least</italic> likely get in a conflict situation is to communicate anger toward the other party. Several recent studies, however, seem to suggest that it can actually have positive effects to do just that (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213489140">Van Kleef &amp; Côté, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213489140">Halperin, Russel, Dweck, &amp; Gross, 2011</xref>). An important distinction here is between experienced anger that motivates behavior and the communication of anger as an act in itself. Whereas the former may likely motivate destructive behavior in the angered person (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213489140">Halperin et al., 2011</xref>), we argue that the latter can potentially <italic>de-escalate</italic> conflicts by motivating constructive conflict behavior in the recipient of the communicated anger.</p>
<p>We take a novel approach by focusing on the <italic>relational</italic> function of communicating anger and by applying this notion to the context of intergroup conflict. We argue that the communication of group-based anger (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213489140">Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213489140">Smith, Seger, &amp; Mackie, 2007</xref>) reduces tendencies toward intergroup conflict because it stresses the value of maintaining a positive long-term relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). It is this positive relational signal that increases empathy in the recipients of the communicated anger for those who communicated it. This can be contrasted to the communication of an emotion such as contempt (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213489140">Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &amp; Haidt, 1999</xref>) that, although it is closely related to anger, should not have this positive effect because it signals a strong devaluation of the relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). The communication of group-based contempt should therefore undermine any positive effect of group-based anger on intergroup conflict reduction through reducing empathy with the other group. In fact, we believe that negative effects of communicating group-based anger in intergroup conflict are likely to stem from communicating group-based contempt or a mixture of these emotions. In three experiments, we therefore examined the idea that only communicating “pure” group-based anger has positive effects in terms of reducing tendencies toward intergroup conflict because of its relational function. For this reason, we also predicted that this positive effect of communicating “pure” group-based anger is mediated by increased empathy for the out-group.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167213489140">
<title>Discovering the Relational Function of Communicating Anger</title>
<p>Emotions have an important social function because they communicate how individuals feel about others and how they are likely to behave toward them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213489140">Averill, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). Group-based emotions are emotions felt and expressed or communicated on behalf of one’s group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213489140">Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213489140">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). The most prototypical emotion in intergroup conflict is group-based anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213489140">Allred, 1999</xref>), which stems from a group-based appraisal of out-group members’ intergroup behavior as unjust (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213489140">Frijda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213489140">Lazarus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213489140">Roseman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213489140">Scherer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213489140">Scherer, Schorr, &amp; Johnstone, 2001</xref>). An important social function of anger is to ameliorate one’s own situation by causing a change in the behavioral pattern of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). Indeed, anger is a unique emotion in the sense that it has both a negative valence, necessary to signal injustice, while being approach-oriented, vital to engage in dialogue about or confrontation of the perceived injustice. This sets anger apart from other negatively valenced emotions such as fear, sadness, and contempt, all of which communicate more avoidance-oriented motivation (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213489140">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009</xref>). Whereas anger is typically associated with destructive responses toward the other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213489140">Berkowitz, 1989</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213489140">Averill, 1982</xref>), its expression might in fact be beneficial for maintaining and improving relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We therefore propose a positive relational function of <italic>group-based</italic> anger in <italic>intergroup</italic> conflict. This means that communicating group-based anger stresses the injustice of the situation while asking the other group to take steps toward reconciliation. Communication of group-based anger will therefore be perceived by the other group as a signal that one <italic>cares</italic> about maintaining a positive intergroup relationship. We argue that this in turn should encourage the recipient to take the other party’s perspective and feel empathy for them. Past research has extensively documented positive effects of empathy in reducing intergroup conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213489140">Batson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213489140">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213489140">Stephan &amp; Finlay, 1999</xref>), yet empathy has not been linked to communication of group-based anger. Because of its relational function, the communication of anger should reduce conflict through increasing empathy.</p>
<p>Prior research has neither considered this relational function, nor has it studied empathy as a mediator of anger’s positive effects. Instead, prior research has focused on the equally important but different <italic>strategic</italic> function of anger expressions (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213489140">Van Kleef, 2009</xref>). Focusing mostly on interpersonal negotiations, this research showed that communication of anger about the other’s behavior increases this other’s approach behavior, enforcing cooperation within a competitive setting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213489140">Van Kleef, De Dreu, &amp; Manstead, 2004</xref>). In these cases, the communication of anger serves the <italic>strategic</italic> function of informing the recipient of the sender’s intentions with a focus on the personal gain of the communicator (e.g., your last offer makes me angry). By contrast, the relational function of communicating anger focuses more on <italic>shared</italic> gains, which fits with our emphasis on empathy. Thus, like prior research, we expect positive effects of communication of anger, but we explain them through a <italic>relational</italic> function. Moreover, we apply this idea to intergroup rather than interpersonal settings through the notion of group-based emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213489140">Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213489140">Smith et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0146167213489140">
<title>Communicating “Pure” Anger Versus Contempt and Mixed Anger/Contempt</title>
<p>If it is indeed the relational function of communicating anger that results in a reduction of conflict, then a comparable negative emotion with an <italic>opposite</italic> relational function should result in quite adverse effects. An excellent candidate for this is contempt because anger and contempt represent responses to violations of particular norms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213489140">Rozin et al., 1999</xref>). At the same time, however, research shows that contempt communicates the desired exclusion of the other person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>), which should, if anything, <italic>undermine</italic> empathy. Indeed, people perceive communication of contempt as a signal that the other desires to end the relationship. Communicating anger should therefore have more positive consequences than communicating contempt.</p>
<p>In the context of communicating anger or contempt, it is important to note that these two emotions do not necessarily exclude one another. In conflict situations, communication of anger is often combined with contempt (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213489140">Cottrell &amp; Neuberg, 2005</xref>). In fact, it has been argued that when anger persists over a longer period of time, it might start to coexist or completely develop into contempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). If communication of contempt is mixed with anger, this should, we believe, transform the interpretation of the communication: Because contempt signals the desired exclusion of the other, communication of anger in conjunction with it should resemble the adverse effects of contempt. Thus, a perhaps even more interesting test of the relational function of communicating anger would be to pit communication of “pure” anger against communication of “mixed” anger and contempt. The relational function of communicating anger should only function effectively when it is communicated free of contempt (given its function to strongly devalue the relationship). Applied to intergroup conflict, this means that the communication of “pure” group-based anger should have more positive effects than the communication of group-based contempt, or the combination of both group-based emotions.</p>
<p>We thus predict that only the communication of “pure” group-based anger decreases destructive intergroup conflict intentions because it increases empathy for the out-group. We sought support for our novel line of thought in three experiments. Each of these experiments used an intergroup conflict situation within which we assessed the positive effects of the communication of “pure” group-based anger in terms of reduced destructive conflict intentions. Experiment 1 manipulated the communication of group-based anger versus the absence of it to show the positive effect of using anger’s relational function. Experiment 2 manipulated the communication of “pure” group-based anger versus its absence, the communication of “pure” group-based contempt, and versus the communication of “mixed” group-based anger/contempt. Experiment 3 specifically focused on the contrast between communicating “pure” group-based anger and “mixed” group-based anger/contempt, while crossing it with a manipulation of the proposed mediator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146167213489140">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>The main aim of Study 1 was to find support for the relational function of the communication of group-based anger in intergroup conflict. According to this function, the communication of group-based anger should reaffirm the value of the relationship while also signaling that harm is done and as such reconciliation is needed. Consequently, we investigated whether the communication of group-based anger would reduce destructive conflict intentions compared with a condition in which the communication of group-based anger was absent, and whether this effect would be explained by increased empathy for the out-group. Furthermore, to link this positive effect and the role of empathy in it specifically to the relational function of the communication of group-based anger, we investigated whether a similar pattern of results would be obtained on measures of recipients’ perception of whether the communicator values their relationship.</p>
<sec id="section4-0146167213489140">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants were 44 Dutch psychology students (37 women; <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 21.80; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.91) who participated for course credit. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (out-group communicating anger vs. a control condition).</p>
<p>In the experiment, participants read a fictitious newspaper article and subsequently answered questions about it. The article outlined a realistic situation in which German students were discriminated against by Dutch students: A majority (78%) indicated having negative attitudes toward German students, arguing German students should remain in Germany. Dutch students justified their opinion, by referring to common stereotypes of Germans as being “badly integrated,” “loners,” “humorless strivers.”</p>
<p>In the article, the German students reacted to what they considered to be unjust discrimination. In this reaction, we manipulated whether they communicated anger or not. The communicated emotion was manipulated in the title of the article, the introductory paragraph, and in the final paragraph in which a German student (Lena) responded on behalf of her group (“We are viewed negatively based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices!” [control] / “I am very angry that we are viewed negatively based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices!” [anger]). We thus manipulated only the presence or absence of the anger label in the communication by the out-group.</p>
<p>Every variable in each of the three experiments, unless otherwise specified, was measured on 7-point Likert-type scales (1 = <italic>absolutely not</italic>, 7 <italic>= very much</italic>). An anger manipulation check measured to what extent they perceived the German students to be angry. Destructive conflict intentions were measured with 12 items (α = .86). Originally, three subscales consisting of four items each were devised, two of which measured tendencies to move against and move away (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213489140">Horney, 1945</xref>; for example, “To what extent would you, as a Dutch student, want to seek a direct confrontation with German students such as Lena to release some frustration?” and “To what extent would you, as a Dutch student, exclude German students such as Lena from your social network?”), and one measured inaction (“To what extent would you, as a Dutch student, do nothing to accommodate German students such as Lena?”). As results on all separate subscales revealed a highly consistent pattern across all experiments, we decided to collapse all items into one scale measuring destructive conflict intentions for all subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>In addition, we measured the proposed mediator, empathy, with two items (“To what extent do you empathize with German students such as Lena?” and “To what extent do you feel indifferent toward German students such as Lena?” latter item recoded; <italic>r</italic> = .48, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Finally, communicated relationship importance was measured with five items (α = .94; for example, “To what extent do you think German students such as Lena value a good relationship with Dutch students?” and “To what extent do you think German students such as Lena want to increase positive contact with Dutch students?”).</p>

<title>Mediation Analyses</title>
<p>To test the idea that the positive effect of the communication of group-based anger is explained by increased empathy, we performed a series of regression analyses. Results showed, first, that the communication of anger (compared with the control condition) reduced destructive conflict intentions (β = −.33, <italic>p</italic> = .028) and increased empathy (β = .37, <italic>p</italic> = .014). Second, empathy significantly predicted destructive conflict intentions (β = −.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) above and beyond the effect of the manipulation (which turned nonsignificant: β = −.13, <italic>p</italic> = .331). A Sobel <italic>z</italic> test confirmed that the indirect effect was significant, <italic>Z</italic> = −2.21, <italic>p</italic> = .027. In line with our ideas, empathy fully mediated the positive effect of “pure” group-based anger on destructive conflict intentions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we reasoned that the communication of anger (compared with the control condition) signals that the out-group assigns a higher value to the relationship, and thus links the communication of anger to empathy and decreased destructive conflict intentions. We therefore ran two sets of regression analyses. In line with our ideas, whereas the communication of anger (compared with the control condition) decreased destructive conflict intentions (β = –.33, <italic>p</italic> = .028) and increased communicated relationship importance (β = .41, <italic>p</italic> = .006), the latter indeed significantly predicted the former (β = −.46, <italic>p</italic> = .003) above and beyond the effect of the manipulation (which turned nonsignificant: β = −.14, <italic>p</italic> = .324). A Sobel <italic>z</italic> test confirmed that the indirect effect was significant, <italic>Z</italic> = 2.14, <italic>p</italic> = .032. Thus, in line with anger’s relational function, communicated relationship importance fully mediated the positive effect of “pure” group-based anger on destructive conflict intentions.</p>
<p>In the second set of analyses, we wanted to test which of the two variables was more closely related to decreased destructive action tendencies. According to our reasoning, increased empathy should follow from the perception of communicated anger because it communicated relational importance. Indeed, at the bivariate level, the variables were positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> = .001). Moreover, entering both constructs in the mediation analyses at the same time results in a stronger predictive value for empathy (β = −.44, <italic>p</italic> = .003) than for relationship importance (β = −.29, <italic>p</italic> = .048) with respect to destructive conflict intentions (above and beyond the effect of the manipulation, which turned nonsignificant: β = −.05, <italic>p</italic> = .70). A bootstrapping macro for multiple mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213489140">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>) was used to provide a more powerful test of the significance of both indirect paths. Confirming the above results, bootstrapping 5,000 samples at a 95% confidence interval (CI) showed that the indirect effect of empathy, 95% CI = [−0.472, −0.037], was more clear than the indirect effect of relationship importance, 95% CI = [−0.374, −0.0001]. These results suggest, in line with our reasoning, that empathy for the out-group is the more proximal predictor of decreased destructive action tendencies as a function of the presence or absence of the communication of group-based anger. At the same time, these results corroborate the workings of anger’s relational function by linking its communication directly to increased communicated relationship importance, increased empathy for the out-group, and decreased destructive action tendencies toward them.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Experiment 1 provide first support for our hypothesis that the communication of group-based anger (versus its absence) results in less destructive intergroup conflict intentions and that this decrease is explained by an increase in empathy for the out-group. Further substantiating the relational function of the communication of group-based anger in intergroup conflict, Experiment 1 showed that communicated anger increased the importance recipients perceive the out-group to assign to their relationship. In line with our argument, communicated relationship importance was positively related to empathy, but the latter explained more variance in destructive action tendencies.</p>
<p>Experiment 2 was designed to replicate the positive effect of communicating group-based anger (versus its absence), but moved beyond Experiment 1 by testing whether its predicted positive effects would still hold when compared with the communication of group-based contempt or of a mixture of group-based anger/contempt. Indeed, because the proposed relational function of communicating group-based anger is distinct and different from the function of communicating group-based contempt (which is to devaluate the intergroup relationship and terminate it), it follows that only the communication of “pure” anger should reduce destructive conflict intentions.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<sec id="section13-0146167213489140">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants were 51 Dutch psychology students (41 women; <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 20.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.59) who participated for course credit and were randomly assigned to one of four conditions within a 2 (Group-Based Anger: Absent/Present) × 2 (Group-Based Contempt: Absent/Present) between-subjects design. As in Experiment 1, in the experiment, participants read a (fictitious) newspaper article and subsequently answered questions about it. The article described the current shortage on the Groningen student dorm market. A majority (74%) of Dutch students indicated rather having a Dutch than a German roommate, which was justified by referring to typical stereotypes of Germans as being “badly integrated,” “loners,” and “humorless strivers.”</p>
<p>The article continued by noting how the German students reacted to what they considered to be unjust discrimination. In this reaction, we manipulated whether they communicated “pure” anger, “pure” contempt, “mixed” anger and contempt (in which participants expressed both emotions), or no emotion. The communicated emotion was manipulated in the title of the article (“Discrimination of German Students” / “Anger Among German students” / “Contempt Among German students” / “Anger and Contempt Among German students”), the introductory paragraph (e.g., “Dutch Discrimination of Germans Makes German Students Very Angry”), and in the final paragraph in which a German student (Kati) responded on behalf of her group (“I am very angry that we are discriminated against based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices!” [anger] / “I really look down on Dutch students for discriminating us based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices!” [contempt] / “I am very angry that we are discriminated against based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices and I really look down on Dutch students for doing that!” [anger &amp; contempt] / “We are discriminated based on unjust stereotypes and prejudices.” [no emotion]).</p>
<p>Two manipulation checks verified whether participants had perceived the correct emotion. Participants indicated to what extent they perceived German students to be angry and contemptuous. We measured the proposed mediator, empathy, with the same two items as in Experiment 1 (<italic>r</italic> = .34, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Similarly, destructive conflict intentions were measured with 16 items, 12 of which were identical to the ones used in Experiment 1, while the last 4 items were specifically related to the conflict situation at hand (e.g., “To what extent would you, as a Dutch student, choose Dutch students over German students such as Kati as a future roommate?”; α = .87).</p>

<p>We hypothesized that the positive effect of “pure” group-based anger (versus all other conditions) on destructive conflict intentions would be explained by increased empathy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Experiment 2 replicate those of Experiment 1 by showing that the communication of “pure” group-based anger results in less destructive conflict intentions than its absence. Moreover, Experiment 2 replicated the mediational role of empathy in this effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 showed no such positive effects for the communication of group-based contempt, and of “mixed” anger/contempt. This increases confidence in the proposed relational function of communicating group-based anger in the context of intergroup conflict. However, because empathy was measured in Experiments 1 and 2, we are not yet in the position to make claims about causality with respect to its mediational role. Experiment 3 thus manipulated empathy (through an often-used perspective taking [PT] manipulation; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213489140">Batson et al., 1997</xref>). For reasons of efficiency, we wanted to restrict Experiment 3 to a focused examination of empathy’s effects as a function of the main contrast between “pure” and “mixed” group-based anger. Because we already replicated support for the prediction that the communication of group-based anger by and of itself already has positive effects, we reasoned that the inclusion of such a control condition was less relevant in Experiment 3. Furthermore, our choice between contrasting a “pure” group-based anger condition with a “mixed” anger condition rather than a “pure” contempt condition was based on the idea that the former presents a more conservative test of our ideas regarding the relational function of communicating group-based anger.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, in Experiment 3 participants were instructed to take the perspective of an in-group or an out-group member, or participants received no PT instructions. We hypothesized that in the absence of PT instructions, the pattern should resemble that of Experiment 1, constituting a direct replication of the positive effect of “pure” compared with “mixed” anger. Furthermore, when instructed to take the perspective of the out-group, we expected a similar pattern because taking the out-group’s perspective matches the relational function of anger but not of contempt. Indeed, in line with the social function of contempt (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213489140">Rozin et al., 1999</xref>), we reasoned that its communication would effectively undermine empathizing with the out-group because it signals a devaluation of the relationship. Finally, we hypothesized that being instructed to take the perspective of one’s own in-group would clash with any tendencies toward taking the perspective of the out-group member, effectively canceling out “pure” anger’s positive effects.</p>

As in the first experiment, participants read a fictitious newspaper article about Dutch students discriminating German students. The context was that of a future increase in college tuition fees. We chose this particular context because we wanted to show that the communication of “pure” anger can be beneficial even in intergroup conflicts with a clear instrumental basis (which was not the case in Experiments 1 and 2).

As such, the results of Experiment 3 support the proposed relational function of group-based anger in the context of intergroup conflict and its communicative potential toward improving conflictuous intergroup relations.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Three experiments provide convergent evidence for the novel hypothesis that the communication of “pure” group-based anger in intergroup conflicts has positive consequences. Across the board, our results showed that communicating “pure” group-based anger reduced destructive conflict intentions among recipients of the communication by increased empathy for the communicator (in comparison with communicating no group-based anger, “pure” group-based contempt, and “mixed” group-based anger/contempt). These findings map onto our argument that the communication of group-based anger can have such positive effects in intergroup conflicts because it stresses not only the perceived injustice of the intergroup situation (i.e., the undesirable treatment by the other) but at the same time the desire to maintain a positive long-term intergroup relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>). Indeed, Experiment 1 results directly support this claim by showing that the communication of “pure” group-based anger increased the perception that the out-group valued the intergroup relationship, and connected this to increased empathy for the out-group. Furthermore, Experiments 1 to 3 all showed evidence for the mediational role of empathy in explaining the positive effects of communicating “pure” group-based anger, with Experiment 3 even showing evidence for its causal role in the mediation sequence.</p>
<p>Our studies extend prior theorizing and research in several ways. First, we move beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer and Roseman (2007)</xref> by extending their interpersonal analysis of anger and contempt to group-based anger and contempt in the <italic>intergroup</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213489140">Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213489140">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, we move beyond previous work on group-based emotions by showing that group-based emotions have the potential to be used as communicative devices that stress the value of maintaining an intergroup relationship. By contrast, Fischer and Roseman showed that the perception of the level of intimacy of a relationship with another person predicts whether anger or contempt will be expressed. Thus, our data show that emotions are not merely expressions that follow from a certain relationship (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>), but that individuals can communicate emotions that signal how they view the importance of that relationship. This can lead the other to either want to improve (in the case of anger) or discontinue (for contempt) the relationship.</p>
<p>Our results further help explain the paradox that the communication of anger can have positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213489140">Halperin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213489140">Van Kleef et al., 2004</xref>) and negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213489140">Berkowitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213489140">Lickel, Miller, Stenstrom, Denson, &amp; Schmader, 2006</xref>) in conflict situations. By differentiating between “pure” and “mixed” anger communications, it becomes clear that only communication of “pure” anger accentuates the value of maintaining a positive relationship, whereas the “mixing” of anger with contempt (and communication of “pure” contempt) transforms the relational intent that is communicated—signaling instead a desire to terminate the relationship. Our results offer evidence for the distinct social and communicative functions of anger and contempt (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213489140">Fischer &amp; Roseman, 2007</xref>), and also for the validity of the distinction between these emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213489140">Rozin et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, if one wants to reduce the potential negative effects of emotional communication in intergroup conflict, our analysis suggests that the communicator should take care to communicate “pure” anger and that the recipient should also perceive it as such.</p>
<p>Our analysis shares an emphasis on potentially positive consequences of communicating anger with the Emotions As Social Information (EASI) model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213489140">Van Kleef, 2009</xref>), and in fact we believe that our findings can make a valuable contribution to the EASI model by focusing attention to the <italic>relational</italic> function of the communication of anger (i.e., anger as a signal of, as it were, the personal pain that flows from bad treatment of the other, which contains within it a tacit expression of the desire to improve that relationship). Indeed, the EASI model focuses on the equally important but different <italic>strategic</italic> function of the communication of anger (i.e., anger as a signal of thwarted personal gain). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213489140">Van Kleef (2009)</xref> argues that in competitive settings, such as conflicts, the expression of anger would affect the other person’s <italic>strategic</italic> inferences of the cause of this emotion, leading one to perceive the other as, for instance, having high negotiation limits. This would then result in giving in to the angry person’s demands (i.e., cooperation). Future research should focus on the role of empathy in this process to explore how the relational and strategic functions of the communication of anger relate to each other.</p>
<p>Of course, the positive effects of communicating “pure” group-based anger should have boundary conditions. For instance, the current studies point toward the importance of the “purity” of the anger communicated as well as the possibility to take the out-group’s perspective. We believe that other boundary conditions include the perception of fair treatment or legitimacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213489140">Frijda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213489140">Lazarus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213489140">Roseman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213489140">Scherer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213489140">Scherer et al., 2001</xref>), and the extent to which the anger is expressed by all group members (and thus on behalf of the group; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213489140">De Vos, Van Zomeren, Gordijn, &amp; Postmes, 2013</xref>). Indeed, when confronted with an out-group member’s anger, individuals tend to assess the extent to which the anger is just given the fairness of the treatment they received. If treatment is fair, anger is likely to be perceived as inappropriate and perhaps even as a sign of aggression, which might lead to conflict escalation rather than de-escalation. Furthermore, recipients should view the out-group communicator as a representative for the entire out-group if anger is to have positive effects. Otherwise, the anger might be perceived as inauthentic or “just a lone voice” and could be disregarded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the EASI model it can be derived that power differentials between the out-group communicating the anger and the target in-group may be important (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213489140">Van Kleef &amp; Côté, 2007</xref>) in the sense that groups with low power are less effective in bringing about change when expressing anger. In the current experiments, the communicator was part of a minority, but there existed no measurable power differences between the groups so this needs to be explored further. Moreover, also contextual differences between competitive and cooperative situations in which anger is expressed might influence its success: Anger is seen as more appropriate in situations where a competition or conflict of interests is present, whereas anger in more cooperative settings (like a reconciliation process) would be quite detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213489140">Van Kleef, 2009</xref>). Indeed, whereas the current studies investigated <italic>how</italic> group-based anger might de-escalate intergroup conflict, the next step for future research is to uncover <italic>when</italic> it does and does not occur.</p>
<p>In sum, even though anger is often perceived to be an unpleasant and negative subjective state, the current experiments show that its communication has remarkably positive consequences in the context of intergroup conflict. Communicating “pure” group-based anger explicitly stresses the injustice of another party’s actions, while underlining the value of maintaining a positive intergroup relationship. The expression of group-based anger may thus have positive consequences for intergroup relations. Clearly, when the communication of “pure” group-based anger leads to conflict de-escalation, this expression might be an important first step toward reducing intergroup conflict. Anger, in this sense, should not always be kept under wraps.</p>

<p>In this study, we managed to rule out a possible alternative explanation of our findings, namely that “pure anger” might have beneficial effects on destructive conflict intentions <italic>solely</italic> because of the perceived injustice of intergroup discrimination. A 2 × 2 ANOVA on perceived treatment justice (measured by 3 items, α = .87; For example, “To what extent did you think the situation in the article was just for German students?”) revealed a significant main effect of group-based anger only, <italic>F</italic>(1, 47) = 5.05, <italic>p</italic> = .029. The communication of group-based anger (<italic>M</italic> = 2.69, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.94) decreased participants’ justice perceptions compared with when group-based anger was not communicated (<italic>M</italic> = 3.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.63). The crucial interaction effect proved nonsignificant, however, <italic>F</italic>(1, 47) = 2.62, <italic>p</italic> = .112. Thus, the perceived injustice of the situation did not explain the positive effects of the communication of “pure” group-based anger.</p>

<p>Participants were less able to take the perspective and experienced less empathy when taking the perspective of the Dutch student (perspective taking [PT]: <italic>M</italic> = 4.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.74; empathy: <italic>M</italic> = 3.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.84), rather than the German student (PT: <italic>M</italic> = 5.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.52; empathy: <italic>M</italic> = 4.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.57), and when they had received no PT instructions (PT: <italic>M</italic> = 5.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.53; empathy: <italic>M</italic> = 4.02, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.80; PT: <italic>t</italic>(45) = 4.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; empathy: <italic>t</italic>(45) = 3.46, <italic>p</italic> = .001).</p>
