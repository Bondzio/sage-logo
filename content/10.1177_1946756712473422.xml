<p>Defining the future differs from analyzing the past, because it has not yet happened. In this article, methodologies have been used to help identify useful alternatives to traditional Neighborhood Watch programs that can enhance the success of planners and leaders in their response to a range of possible future environments.</p>
<p>One concept central to this practice is often referred to as <italic>Neighborhood Watch</italic>. Rather than thinking of Neighborhood Watch in its traditional form, it is now time to consider ways to enhance the role of this concept in the community by adding such beneficial capabilities as crime mapping, analytics, technology, and increased volunteerism. Our future elite crime fighting force could very well consist of entire neighborhoods that are able to effectively employ a combination of public safety resources under the banner of the Neighborhood Watch.</p>
<p>Suppose that communities and law enforcement agencies could combine crime mapping, technology, and Neighborhood Watch to create a volunteer-assisted crime analysis and response effort. Imagine a community with this capacity as described in the following scenario becoming a reality in the near future in a city near you.</p>
<p>When the state of California declared bankruptcy in 2013, the immediate result was widespread panic among the citizens of the state. News media and so-called “experts” in many fields predicted that, due to the drastic reduction in police and simultaneous release of many prisoners from detention facilities made necessary by the state’s fiscal woes, lawlessness would quickly become rampant everywhere. Yet in fact this did not happen.</p>
<p>Instead, in response to these events, local police agencies in the Central Valley region established a Total Neighborhood Security Initiative. This multipronged approach, integrating successful strategies, partnerships, and technology to provide comprehensive neighborhood security, soon convinced Central Valley residents that it was a sound alternative to their former total reliance on government resources for community safety; and thanks to its proven effectiveness, this approach was quickly imitated by communities and regions statewide.</p>
<p>Empty buildings and foreclosed homes were converted into Neighborhood Watch centers. These facilities were staffed by members of the community. The volunteers were able to use the latest technologies available, and through their Neighborhood Watch organization, they monitored crime mapping, global positioning system (GPS) tracking, and helped conduct crime analysis activities. This includes the tracking of the newly released parolee population, ensuring the police were notified whenever a parolee was in the vicinity of any reported serious crime.</p>
<p>Electronic billboards stationed at the main thoroughfares within the neighborhood are also a part of the system. A picture of the individual felon is shown on the billboard as well as his or her current, real-time, location within the neighborhood. These billboards are complemented by a network of pan, tilt, zoom cameras that can be operated by volunteers, police dispatchers, or police officers.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that image of the future, imagine every resident in a neighborhood having real-time data sent to his or her cell phones so they could act as added eyes and ears to the police. Imagine also a community where the norm is to go on the offensive against criminals before the actual crime occurs, suspicious people in vehicles or on foot are tracked and recorded as they travel through this networked neighborhood. Networks such as these include police officers and dispatchers tapping into the same information and extracting intelligence for a coordinated response. This can be how neighborhoods of the future will protect themselves, in effect, becoming their own elite crime fighting force.</p>
<p>Formed in 1972 by the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA) in response to the rise in crime during the previous decade, Neighborhood Watch’s central theme is resident-based crime prevention. Neighbors or individual members of a community are the mechanism by which Neighborhood Watch undertakes to reduce crime by looking out for and reporting suspicious activities to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1946756712473422">Bennett 1990</xref>). Today, one would be challenged to find a community that does not use some form of this concept, and police agencies across the United States tout their programs as one of the ways in which their citizenry helps them to fight crime.</p>
<p>The premise of Neighborhood Watch is to use the collective senses of the people living, working, or recreating in a particular area to deter crime through focused awareness. Law enforcement has bought in to this appealing concept as a means to achieve several ends, including crime reduction, force enhancement, and improved communication and cooperation with the public they serve. One question remains, though—Is it effective?</p>
<p>Actually making your neighborhood a safer place has been reported in many studies as viable, attributing the increased levels of safety to the presence of Neighborhood Watch programs. For example, in Fairfax County, Virginia, crime statistics showed that Neighborhood Watch programs aided the police department in reducing residential burglary by almost 60 percent between 1980 and 1993 (Fairfax County Police Department).</p>
<p>Although the bulk of data related to the efficacy of Neighborhood Watch was gathered in the 1980s and 1990s, there have been a few more recent studies addressing the question of whether Neighborhood Watch efforts to reduce crime have actually been effective. A systematic review of literature related to the topic was conducted and described by the U.S. Department of Justice in their 2008 report, “Does Neighborhood Watch Reduce Crime?” The primary conclusion of the report was that “across all eligible studies combined, Neighborhood Watch was associated with a reduction in crime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1946756712473422">Holloway et al. 2008</xref>, 28). This research was based on preexisting Neighborhood Watch surveys, and the results are understood to be rigorous and transparent replicas of existing data. Promising accounts of Neighborhood Watch from a less scientific standpoint can be readily accessed in a variety of sources.</p>
<p>A 2010 study of Neighborhood Watch effectiveness in reducing crime showed that in 79 percent of the cases researched, crime reductions occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1946756712473422">Lincolnshire Police Authority Burglary Dwelling Scrutiny 2010</xref>). The objective of this project was to look at the available literature providing evidence of the impact of Neighborhood Watch on crime reduction around the world. As recently as January 2012, the citizenry of Moses Lake, Oregon, mobilized to help stop crime. There, a local man moved into a neighborhood that he felt was isolated from the rest of the city and was experiencing property crimes. This new resident organized others in the neighborhood to stop these crimes by creating a local Neighborhood Watch. Since then, with support and direct interaction from the Moses Lake Police Department, the community has experienced reduced crime rates in “block watch” areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1946756712473422">Columbia Basin Herald, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent analysis in the city of Bakersfield, California, regarding their Neighborhood Watch program revealed that a large sample of Neighborhood Watch participants have a great desire to work together to reduce crime in their community. More importantly, they also desired the state of feeling safe. While some citizens would enjoy a safer community from a statistical standpoint, others noted they were not concerned about crime data per se, but did wish to “feel safe” through every legal means possible. Although the survey respondents were individuals who had already volunteered to protect their neighborhood, they nonetheless reflect the sentiments of municipal residents generally who are willing to volunteer more of their time so they can feel and potentially live in a safer environment.</p>
<p>A common sentiment expressed by Bakersfield residents was they were willing to do something above and beyond the police protection they count on for their safety. These neighborhood, business, and park watch participants all showed tremendous interest in a system that increased security, even if that required them to volunteer more time toward that end. Their commitment is an indicator that community involvement can be counted on as an honest consideration for police forces in tasking the public with increased responsibility for making their neighborhoods safer.</p>
<p>An expert panel was convened in April 2011 to study the issue of Neighborhood Watch’s ability to expand and enhance perspectives about public safety. The panel’s view of the future for California law enforcement was troubling. They were reasonably certain California would declare some state of bankruptcy unless current economic trends were reversed. Part of their concern involved how to fund law enforcement in general and local police forces in particular if the state were to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>One panel member, a crime analysis practitioner, described the aforementioned bankruptcy, the mass release of prisoners that would necessarily occur, and poor economic times in general as “doomsday” events that she was sure California would experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1946756712473422">1</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this is not an isolated viewpoint. In fact, such possibilities have already been noted by the federal government.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1946756712473422">COPS Office 2011</xref>) in a 2008 report titled, “The Impact of the Economic Downturn on American Police Agencies” states that twenty-five years of gains in the number of civilian and police personnel serving at various local, state, and federal levels has come to an end. The Washington-based National League of Cities (NLC) identifies in its “City Fiscal Conditions Survey,” released in October <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1946756712473422">2011</xref>, that municipal finance officers from throughout the United States expect general city revenues will continue to fall, identifying a five-year decline in that category. Subsequently, these same finance officers have reported a 72-percent cut in personnel. “For the first time, because of the economy, police departments . . . may have to change how they do business,” says Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement think tank. “People will see a change in the basic delivery of services,” from longer police response times to a dramatically reduced police presence in some communities.</p>
<p>Some of California’s Central Valley police agencies have already reduced their presence. The Bakersfield Police Department has reduced its police staffing level by twenty-nine positions in the past two years, a 9-percent decline in sworn staffing. In that community, the police redeployed resources from specialized units during this period simply to try and maintain basic service levels. Stockton and Sacramento, California, saw significant force reductions as well. Add in to the equation the fact that the Central Valley’s population has grown substantially in recent decades, with growth between 1980 and 1995 accelerating more rapidly than for the remainder of the state as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1946756712473422">Umbach 1997</xref>) and the confluence of problems seems daunting from the broad perspective as well as a local one.</p>
<p>The key issues can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1946756712473422" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Police budgets and their complement of police officers are shrinking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>California’s Central Valley population continues to increase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Citizens are willing to volunteer more time in making neighborhoods safe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neighborhood Watch programs are in place and operational.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With a clear understanding that nothing absolves law enforcement agencies of the responsibility to protect and serve, new ideas must be explored in the pursuit of delivering core police services. In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice report called specifically for police agencies to identify successful programs and develop ways to maintain those endeavors while dealing with the financial problems besieging most governmental agencies. Merging programs or concepts to test the synergy of such a pairing is not just a need but a responsible endeavor for police to explore. In fact, this is not necessarily a new thought.</p>
<p>In 1997 and 1998, the city of Hartford, Connecticut, provided community-based organizations with a crime mapping and analysis system. As reported in a National Institute on Justice (NIJ) research brief in 2001, the system enabled users to map crime locations as well as crime report and arrest locations with the basic premise of enabling analysis by the community beyond what was provided by law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1946756712473422">U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs 2001</xref>). NIJ concluded the majority of residents who used the system frequently gained a better understanding of crime conditions in their neighborhood. The participants also believed that access to data allowed them to better participate in problem-solving contributions to their neighborhood. The interaction between police and community in projects such as this creates an interdependence in the work of both the police and community in the reduction of crime.</p>
<p>The program continues to this day, according to Sergeant Patrick Farrell, Supervisor of Crime Analysis and Statistics Unit at the Hartford, Connecticut Police Department. He advised that one of the more important aspects of the program is neighborhood-based problem solving in specific geographical areas or zones. Farrell related that Part 1 crimes are down 6 percent currently in Hartford. Although there is no way to attribute this reduction solely to the combination of crime mapping and community groups, he stated “it helps.”</p>
<p>Community policing is a philosophy that promotes the use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address public safety issues such as crime and the fear of crime. It requires the active participation of the community and police in concert, as in Hartford, Connecticut. When local police there took crime map data, specific to an area, and shared the information with the community that was being affected by the crime, community members were empowered to affect both their own safety and future criminal acts in their neighborhood. Police reliance on the community, in the protection of themselves, is only going to grow. Command-level police personnel should embrace this growth and steer it toward increased productivity in problem solving. The synthesis of Crime Mapping and Neighborhood Watch has value and tremendous growth opportunity. But, we must begin to plan and implement changes in those systems now, such as</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Managing the future means influencing it—creating, constraining, and adapting to emerging trends and events in ways that optimize opportunities and minimize relevant threats.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods fighting crime: Does this mean deploying tactical officers in a residential environment? Are Special Forces headed to the cities and counties of California? No. In fact, California’s preferred future choice force for fighting crime might well consist of everyday residents or homeowners who realize that taking a bigger role in the protection of their own neighborhood is their responsibility as individuals who reside there.</p>
<p>Although crises such as a state’s declared bankruptcy, budget cuts, police force reductions, and mass prisoner release will be the impetus for change in innumerable government functions and processes, this research shows that proactive steps toward the end of combining Neighborhood Watch and Crime Mapping, at the very least, have the potential to address many of these issues’ effects on our communities in a positive way.</p>

<p>California recently mandated global positioning system (GPS) tracking for all parolees, in part as a means to save money in state prisoner management. If the state were to declare bankruptcy, California’s Central Valley cities, which would be the hardest hit by the ongoing fiscal duress, could receive more than forty-thousand convicted felons released to relieve overcrowding and to save money.</p>
