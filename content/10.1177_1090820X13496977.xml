<p>Earlier this year, I wrote to you about <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal</italic>’s position on Open Access (OA) publishing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496977">1</xref></sup> a movement that sidesteps the traditional subscription-based model for journal publishing, placing the onus for publication costs on authors or federal agencies that fund research through grants. In that Editorial, I stated that “we want to remain on the cutting edge and we certainly will not be the last to adopt any proven model of successful publishing, but we want to be absolutely certain that any changes we make are in the best interest of the subspecialty, our authors, and our readership.” This same philosophy applies to our approach to online publishing, which is certainly another topic that’s had a lot of “buzz” in the media. I would bet that nearly all of your favorite periodicals, from newspapers to surgical textbooks, now have some web-based or digital component. One of the most frequent questions I’m asked at conferences and Board meetings is, “When will <italic>ASJ</italic> be published online only? I’ve heard that print is dead.” My answer is always: print isn’t dead; it just has a double-life!</p>
<p>As you might imagine, the landscape in scholarly publishing is different from the one in which popular newspapers and magazines exist; particularly when journals are owned and operated by a professional society, as “The Gold Journal” is, we have less pressure to move directly into a digital-only format. Our most important role is to serve the needs of our subscribers—including those who are members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), those who belong to one of our valued affiliate societies, our individual subscribers, and those who read <italic>ASJ</italic> via their university or hospital library. To that end, we survey our subscribers frequently about their preferences. In those survey results, we’ve found that you still prefer a mix of formats for reading “The Gold Journal”: some of you prefer to read solely in print and some read entirely online, but most of you read some of the articles in print when the journal arrives on your desk and then use our website as a resource when you need to search articles or watch operative videos.</p>
<p>In an effort to ensure that each of our readers is able to access <italic>ASJ</italic>’s articles in his or her preferred format, we’ve added many digital features to <italic>ASJ</italic> over the past few years. Our goal is to offer you a robust experience that integrates both print and digital features, where each format enhances the other. This journey toward a fuller “dual presence” began with the redesign of <italic>ASJ</italic>’s website 3 years ago. If you visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.AestheticSurgeryJournal.com">www.AestheticSurgeryJournal.com</ext-link> now, you’ll see a beautifully customized site that reflects the “look and feel” of the print journal, while offering features that simply can’t be included on a printed page: embedded videos, supplemental figures showing additional clinical results, Editor’s Announcements, Continuing Medical Education credits, and a search option that allows you to find articles all the way back to 1995. We have also made small improvements to the print edition of <italic>ASJ</italic> that link it more seamlessly to the online version. These features include a QR code on the first page of any article with an accompanying video, so you can scan the code with your smartphone and go straight to the video online, as well as icons that prompt you to look online for supplemental material when it’s available.</p>
<p>While we believe all of these “print plus digital” features can improve each subscriber’s experience of <italic>ASJ</italic>, they are also somewhat basic. After all, you probably expect that your magazines, newspapers, and books have a website! Our new iPad app is a different story. If each of the main website’s upgrades were small steps forward into the digital age, the RADAR app is a giant leap. If you’ve visited the <italic>ASJ</italic> booth at a conference over the past year or if you receive any e-mail alerts from us, you’ve probably heard us mention the app. You might have even seen an advertisement in a previous issue! However, I have a feeling that many of you don’t yet realize what it can offer you. That’s the purpose of this Editorial: to make you friends—not just an acquaintance—of RADAR.</p>
<p>In the OA Editorial in February,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496977">1</xref></sup> I mentioned RADAR, saying “<italic>ASJ</italic>’s fantastic iPad app, the RADAR Resource, is an example of how reading the Journal in a technology-based format can offer you features that a print copy never could.” What does that really mean, though? RADAR was created by AnzuMedical, a company founded by Dr Barry Fernando, who is a plastic surgeon and member of ASAPS. He envisioned it as more than just a “reader,” which is what many apps in the industry are. He—and we at <italic>ASJ</italic> and ASAPS—wanted to offer you a true digital hub that replicates many of the activities that surround traditional journal reading. (That’s why we’ve named it the Readily Available Digital Aesthetic Resource.) Do you want to save certain articles, the way you used to when you’d rip the pages from the latest edition of the journal, hole-punch them, and put them in a binder on one of your office shelves? There’s an app for that. (It’s RADAR.) If you want to highlight certain passages and make your own “handwritten” notes in the margins, you can do that in RADAR. If you read about a technique and want to attach pictures of a patient you’ll be treating next week for whom the technique might be appropriate—or if you want to dictate audio notes and/or attach an intraoperative video to that virtual case file—RADAR is the way to read <italic>ASJ</italic>. If you want to replicate the feeling of a live Journal Club, where you discuss an article with your colleagues, RADAR has a discussion board. It also, of course, has the same searchability as our main website, so you can find exactly the article you need. Best of all, RADAR isn’t static; the designers and programmers are constantly making improvements and releasing new versions that will add to both the functionality and enjoyment of the app.</p>
<p>This mere list of features cannot possibly reflect the true experience of reading <italic>ASJ</italic> on RADAR. In the same way watching a video of a new rhinoplasty technique deepens and enhances the step-by-step description in one of our Featured Operative Technique articles, RADAR enhances your subscription to <italic>ASJ</italic>. Of course, the best testimonials don’t come from the Editorial Office. They come from your colleagues who are already using the app regularly. Dr Mike Edwards, President-Elect of ASAPS, said that “aside from the ability to carry anything and everything you consider important in your aesthetic surgery library on a small device, I really enjoy the ability to add PDF files from other sources [outside <italic>ASJ</italic>] into My Library. [Because I can add new material to the existing articles], it is simple to start a discussion among colleagues to get their take on a controversial or new topic.” Dr Clyde Ishii, ASAPS Secretary, says that he thinks of RADAR as his “plastic surgery assistant.” He considers it “a very powerful tool that helps set [<italic>ASJ</italic>’s subscribers] apart from others who do aesthetic surgery,” and he has “made it a goal to learn one new feature of RADAR every week.” Dr Tracy Pfeifer, Chair of the ASAPS RADAR Champions Committee, says that she primarily uses RADAR “to download all the issues of <italic>ASJ</italic>, both current and past, which takes just a few seconds per issue.” She previously preferred to read in print. “[The physical copy of the Journal] was portable,” she said, “but it took up a lot of space. Now, I have thrown away all my print copies of the Journal, which is a huge space saver.” She also used to “cut out articles about topics of interest and place them in a vertical file,” but now she “files articles on [her] virtual RADAR bookshelf binders.” Like Mike Edwards, she also bookmarks videos through RADAR and saves PDF files from other articles to RADAR and attaches them to <italic>ASJ</italic> articles. Perhaps most important, she feels confident that “as the user community grows, it will be very easy to reach out to other members for their input on clinical problems” and believes that RADAR “is and will be a great way of staying connected to our colleagues and community.”</p>
<p>You can find RADAR in the App Store under “AnzuMedical” or “ASJ.” If you are an ASAPS member, candidate, or resident, your username and password will grant you access; if you are a regular subscriber, enter your subscriber number—which appears on the mailing label of your physical journal—to log in to RADAR. If you need help with either of these numbers or experience any difficulty with login, please write to me at <email>melissa@surgery.org</email>. We would also welcome your feedback once you’ve had a chance to download and explore the RADAR app. I feel confident that you will find it as useful and fun as many of your colleagues do! Even if you don’t read entirely online, the RADAR app offers you features that will truly augment your reading experience.</p>
