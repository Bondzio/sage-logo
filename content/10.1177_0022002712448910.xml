<abstract>
<p>Mediation is a popular process to prevent conflicts over common resources, but there is little clean insight into its effectiveness and mechanisms. Our experimental approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of third-party intervention into potential conflicts and circumvents key problems linked to the analysis of field data. A mediator who credibly threatens punishment in the case of uncooperative behavior achieves the efficient solution in most cases. Similar results are obtained even if the mediator is biased toward one party or has no incentive to intervene. When cooperation fails, communication without credible punishment threats leads to particularly low payouts for the “losing” party.</p>

<p>The administration of common resources often leads to conflicts in international relations and firms—and it even does so in the context of marriage. Countries that are rich in oil and other natural resources often experience civil wars and get poorer over time (van der <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712448910">Ploeg 2010</xref>). Mediation by a third party is one of the most widespread techniques for preventing conflicts over common resources and promoting cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448910">Kydd 2006</xref>). While some mediators tend to be successful in managing conflicts, others fail miserably. To date, it is not clear which mediator activities and characteristics lead to success and which lead to failure. To a large extent, this deficiency is caused by the lack of appropriate, and in particular “clean,” data (see, e.g., Wall et al. 2001). For example, it is very difficult to evaluate conflict prevention because it is hard to identify potential conflicts in the first place. Hence, we use a laboratory experiment to address this crucial topic. </p>
<p>Our article focuses on key characteristics of mediation processes—<italic>communication</italic>, <italic>punishment</italic>, and <italic>mediator interest</italic>—the interaction between these characteristics, and their net and combined effects on conflict prevention. Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712448910">Wilkenfeld et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712448910">Schrodt and Gerner 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002712448910">Beardsley et al. 2006</xref>) have shown that mediation efforts are indeed a factor for successful crisis management and agreement between conflict parties. However, which characteristics of the mediation process are exactly conducive to conflict prevention (and which lead to failure) is still part of an ongoing controversy. </p>
<p>With regard to communication, there is a debate about its effectiveness in producing cooperative outcomes. In the mediation literature, some scholars have argued that information provision is an effective mediation tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712448910">Fisher 1995</xref>; Dixon 1996). The prime role of information is reducing uncertainty. Moreover, by providing the disputants with information about each other’s reservation points, mediators may also help the disputants locate the bargaining set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712448910">Savun 2008</xref>). Other scholars have argued that information provided by mediators may not be sufficient to achieve cooperative outcomes (Morgan 1994; Bercovitch 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448910">Smith and Stam 2003</xref>). This view is consistent with an understanding of communication as cheap talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712448910">Farrell and Rabin 1996</xref>). In a social dilemma, self-interested players are expected to use communication to try to convince others to cooperate, but then choose the Nash equilibrium strategy when they make their private decisions. Thus, communication should not make a difference in the outcomes achieved in social dilemmas (at least not for the final result<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712448910">1</xref>
</sup>). Understanding mediation as a form of cheap talk means that disputants will have an incentive to misrepresent their true reservation points and to “bluff” to the other side. This has also consequences for the information provided by the mediator. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712448910">Kydd (2003</xref>, 599) “if there is an incentive to bluff to the other side, there will be an incentive to bluff to the mediator.” A conflict party will not reveal its true reservation points to the mediator since the latter will make this information public. Hence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448910">Smith and Stam (2003</xref>), note, there is no way for the mediator to reach an outcome that the disputants could not have reached on their own. Only if mediators have access to outside information, information provision by the mediator can be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712448910">Savun 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002712448910">Fey and Ramsay 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As attractive as cheap talk theory might look from the outset, results in experimental economics tell a different story. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712448910">Ostrom (1998</xref>) has argued, “consistent, strong, and replicable findings are that substantial increases in the levels of cooperation are achieved when individuals are allowed to communicate face to face” (p. 6). Inequality aversion or a preference for reciprocity<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002712448910">2</xref>
</sup> can explain this increase in cooperation. Various studies confirm the effectiveness of communication for different types of games and different means of communication (see, e.g., Isaac and Walker 1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712448910">Brosig et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-0022002712448910">2004</xref>; Harbring 2006).While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712448910">Ostrom (1998</xref>) emphasizes the importance of face-to-face communication for cooperative outcomes, several studies show that online communication has similar effects on voluntary cooperation (see, e.g., Bochet et al. 2006 for repeated online communication). </p>
<p>Moreover, there is a controversy in the literature about mediator power, in particular about <italic>punishment</italic> capabilities. The question is whether mediators should only use soft mediation tools (such as information provision) or whether they should be able to carry a “hard stick” (in the form of punishment for uncooperative behavior) as well. On one hand, some authors have argued that punishment strategies may damage the atmosphere of good will, trust, and joint problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712448910">Princen 1992</xref>). Indeed, punishment and the threat of force can lead to an escalation of the conflict. Experimental evidence on punishment with retaliation suggests that emotions play an important role in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712448910">Hopfensitz and Reuben 2009</xref>). On the other hand, there is a significant body of work in the mediation literature, which argues that information mediation is the least effective type of mediation for settling disputes (see, e.g., Bercovitch et al. 1991). By contrast, mediators “with muscles” are supposed to be more successful in obtaining cooperative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38b-0022002712448910">Svensson 2007</xref>), which particularly holds for military conflicts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022002712448910">Favretto 2009</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712448910">Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712448910">Falk, Fehr, and Fischbacher (2001</xref>), punishment and communication may also be <italic>complementary tools</italic> and work hand in hand to achieve efficient outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002712448910">Gardner, Elinor, and Walker 1992</xref>). Mere communication might not always be effective, since <italic>some</italic> players may indeed behave according to the standard economic approach and use communication only to pretend cooperation while acting selfishly afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712448910">Brandts and Cooper 2007</xref>). Hence, people may actually be worse off if they believe these false promises and do not view them as cheap talk. To overcome this problem, mediators must have “muscles” and the possibility of punishing such defectors. </p>
<p>Last but not least, there is also a controversy about <italic>mediator interests</italic>. Mediators are often thought to be more effective if they are unbiased (or, impartial) or have no preferences over the issue in dispute (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712448910">Fisher 1995</xref>), a point affirmed by veteran practitioners of mediation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002712448910">Haig 1984</xref>). However, some scholars have questioned the role of mediator impartiality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712448910">Touval (1982)</xref> argues that a mediator biased toward one party can put pressure on its ally. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712448910">Carnevale and Arad (1996)</xref> have suggested that bias might add to the mediator’s ability to extract concessions from the favored party. Drawing from cheap talk models, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712448910">Kydd (2003</xref>) argues that a mediator needs to be biased in order to convey information in a credible way. In his view, only a mediator who shares policy preferences with one party can induce this party to make a concession. It is nevertheless clear that only a moderate degree of bias is optimal. Kydd shows in a subsequent article that excessive bias is also harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448910">Kydd 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our experimental approach attempts to shed new light on these longstanding and controversial questions. In our experiment, two players faced a common-pool problem. We focus on this type of problem since it can ignite conflicts. In common-pool games, people have an incentive to undermine the efficient management of the resource in order to increase their own material benefits. The unilateral exploitation of common resources is a particular problem in this context. Here, the unequal distribution will aggravate the problem of inefficient management since many people do not like income inequality (Fehr and Schmidt 2006) and may consider unilateral exploitation as a breach of trust. Common-pool problems also have the advantage that they are well researched in laboratory as well as in field studies. The experimental design builds on established studies on bilateral interaction in public good and common-pool games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712448910">Gächter and Herrmann [2009]</xref> for a summary).</p>
<p>In the context of the common-pool problem, we investigate how a third party can act as a mediator in order to prevent the inefficient use of the common resource; that is, how she can deter the players from exploiting the resource jointly or unilaterally. The empirical relevance of this research focus is obvious as many states want to establish institutions that help them avoiding the resource curse. Iraq’s problems in designing laws that administer the oil production and the resulting revenues provide a topical example about the importance of common resource management and the scope for the intervention of a mediator. Notice that preventive mediator efforts also occur in other contexts, such as divorce proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-0022002712448910">Subourne 2003</xref>) or business disputes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002712448910">Fitzgerald 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The two players in our experiment could take out resources out of the pool over three rounds. The efficient solution was to leave the pool untouched all the time, but in the Nash equilibrium a rational selfish player empties the pool as early as possible. Therefore, participants have an incentive to deviate from the socially optimal allocation. Effective conflict prevention simultaneously ensures an efficient management of the common pool and its egalitarian distribution. We assigned subjects randomly to their specific role and we never revealed the identity of the other participants with whom they were interacting. Therefore, ideological, political, or personal rivalries between the players do not provide alternative explanations for conflict behavior in this setting.</p>
<p>In the first part of our analysis we compare the results of five experimental treatments. The most basic treatment just documents the inefficient use of common resources without a mediator. In a second treatment, the two players were able to communicate between each other via an online chat. The other three treatments investigate whether it is beneficial if the third party communicates with the conflict parties and/or sanctions uncooperative behavior. The third party received the average payout of the other two parties. She did not prefer one party over the other but she had a clear interest in realizing the efficient outcome. Sanctioning (or punishment) implied a payout reduction for one player. As the mediator’s own earnings depended on the payouts of the other two parties, any sanctioning was costly for the mediator. If communication was possible, the third player was able to chat online with each of the two other parties (who were not able to communicate between them). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-0022002712448910">Carnevale and Choi (2000)</xref>, this <italic>caucus </italic> approach of indirect communication is probably the most common mediation procedure. It is common in almost every context of mediation, for example in community mediation, labor-management mediation or international mediation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712448910">Goltsman et al. (2009</xref>) show theoretically that this mediation approach can dominate direct negotiations because mediators can filter and manipulate transmitted information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002712448910">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the second part of our analysis, we focus on the economic interests of the third party in the conflict. As a benchmark, we use the results from the treatment in which the mediator can both communicate and sanction behavior. We call such a mediator <italic>impartial</italic> because she does not prefer one party over the other and has a clear interest in a cooperative outcome. We compare these results with evidence from two other treatments. In one treatment, the mediator’s income was not affected by the outcome of the conflict; thus we call her a mediator with <italic>no stakes</italic>. In the other treatment, the mediator’s economic interests were aligned more strongly with one party than with the other; thus we call her a mediator with <italic>bias</italic>. In both of these treatments, the mediator was able to communicate and punish. </p>
<p>Our experiment is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712448910">Brandts and Cooper (2007</xref>). In Brandts and Cooper’s experiment, a party coordinates the two other parties that make the actual decisions regarding the common pool. These two parties cannot communicate directly. We deviate from Brandts and Cooper as the social optimum differs from the selfish interests of the two players. The pursuit of selfish strategies induces a conflict between these two players. Unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712448910">Brandts and Cooper (2007</xref>), the coordinating player cannot induce cooperative behavior by committing herself ex ante to a binding incentive scheme. All punishment decisions are made ex post. The third party is therefore a mediator who intervenes because direct coordination between the two other parties is restricted. Our experiment has also some similarities with Fehr and Fischbacher’s (2004) experiment on third-party punishment in dictator and prisoners’ dilemma games. They show that unaffected third parties punish violations of social norms quite frequently, but the punishment is less strong than the punishment by an affected second party. However, Fehr and Fischbacher only focus on the behavior of the punishing party. They do not consider communication and do not vary the economic interest of the third party in the conflict.</p>
<p>At this point, a remark on the experimental approach is in order. We think that an experimental approach is well suited to overcome well-known problems of observational research on mediation using “real” conflict data. Almost all empirical investigations of mediation suffer from selection bias, as conflict parties do not decide randomly if they will accept a mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712448910">Greig 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002712448910">4</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, severe empirical problems arise when researchers attempt to compare different conflicts, since most mediation processes are complex and key variables are unobservable. Hence, there is little systematic knowledge about the success of mediation and its underlying mechanisms. Finally, observational research rarely allows for disentangling different mediation instruments and analyzing their net (as well as combined) effects in a clean way. Our experiment circumvents these crucial problems since we randomly assign people into different treatment groups with or without mediators. In fact, laboratory experiments allow for an observation of potential conflicts which do not necessarily become actual ones even without mediation efforts. </p>
<p>To be sure, the conclusions we can draw from our experiment are limited since our subject pool is not representative, the laboratory setting is abstract, and the monetary stakes are low. However, a more “realistic,” that is a more complex research design is also much more demanding, not only because monetary incentives are higher. Such a setting also entails more factors that influence conflict mechanisms. Hence, the experimental treatments might differ in more than one aspect and the <italic>cause</italic> of any treatment difference would remain unclear. Moreover, a more realistic conflict scenario with higher stakes also violates the ethical standards of experimental research. Therefore, we opted for a relatively simple laboratory experiment that is easy to replicate and offers plenty of scope for future design variations as well as application in a more natural context.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. In the following section, we present and discuss the experimental design; in section three, we provide behavioral predictions for the different treatments. Section four presents the results for communication and punishment, section five for mediator interest. This is followed by concluding remarks.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022002712448910">
<title>The Experimental Design</title>
<p>All treatments in this experiment included a common-pool game with two players, A and B. Over three rounds, these players could take (virtual) balls out of a (virtual) pool. Initially there were twenty balls in the pool. Every ball in the pool had a value which increased over time. In round 1, every ball taken out of the pool brought 1 point to the player who took the ball. In round 2, this benefit increased to 2 points; in round 3, it increased to 3 points. After round 3, every remaining ball had a value of 4 points. These remaining points were shared equally between the two players. One point in this experiment exchanged into 0.40 Euros. The efficient solution is to leave the pool untouched. The most successful conflict prevention procedure therefore ensures that no player takes a ball from the urn.</p>
<p>In each round each player could take out all the remaining balls. The pool was never refilled. As both player made their choice simultaneously it was possible that the sum of their choices exceeded the number of balls in the pool. In this case the following sharing rule was implemented (with <italic>X</italic> denoting the number of balls in the pool, <italic>c<sub>A</sub>
</italic> denoting the choice of player <italic>A</italic> and<italic> c<sub>B</sub>
</italic> denoting the choice of player B). Player A receives <italic>X*c<sub>A</sub>/</italic>(<italic>c<sub>A</sub>
</italic> <italic>+ c<sub>B</sub>
</italic>) balls and player B receives <italic>X*c<sub>B</sub>/</italic>(<italic>c<sub>A</sub>
</italic> <italic>+</italic> <italic>c<sub>B</sub>
</italic>) balls. If the resulting number of balls was not an integer it was rounded down. </p>
<p>In the most simple treatment, players A and B played the common-pool game without external interference. In a second treatment, A and B could communicate directly. Three other treatments involved a third player C (the <italic>mediator</italic>) into the common-pool problem. This player C (the third party) received the average payoff of players A and B at the end of the game. The three additional treatments varied the power of the mediator. In one treatment, the mediator could only communicate with players A and B; in the other treatment could withdraw points from A and B. In the third treatment, the mediator could communicate and withdraw points. </p>
<p>Communication took place before each round via free form chat boxes only. Each communication interval lasted for five minutes. In the treatment without mediator, players A and B wrote messages to each other before round 1. After five minutes, these messages were transmitted to the other player. The players had ninety seconds time to read the messages but had no chance to reply to each other. Before rounds 2 and 3, players A and B could chat freely with each other. In the treatments with mediator, player C sent identical messages to players A and B before round 1. Players A and B were not able to send message to C at that stage. These opening statements provide clean evidence about heterogeneity in the communication behavior among the subjects in the role of player C. Before rounds 2 and 3, player C could chat with players A and B in separate boxes. In the treatments with a mediator, players A and B were not able to communicate directly. This limitation provides a clean identification of the impact of the mediator.</p>
<p>In the treatments with withdrawals (or sanctions or punishment), Player C could reduce the points of player A and/or player B after each round. The maximum possible reduction was the number of points the respective player had acquired up to that point. The reduction of the payoff of one player reduced the average number of points of both players. The impartial mediator received this average payoff at the end of the game. Therefore, a reduction of 1 point implied effective costs of 0.5 points for player C. Compared with other experiments this is costly.</p>
<p>In the second part of our analysis, we varied the mediator’s stakes in the conflict. More specifically, we looked at a player C who could communicate with players A and B and withdraw points from each of them at the end of a round (<italic>punishment</italic>). In previous treatments, Player C (the third party) received the average payoff of players A and B at the end of the game. In this context, we call player C an impartial mediator because she does not prefer one party over the other and has a clear interest in a cooperative outcome. We introduced two different changes in the interests of the third party. In one case the mediator was <italic>biased</italic> as she received 2/3 of player A’s payoff but only 1/3 of player B’s. In the other treatment, player C had <italic>no stakes</italic> in the conflict. She received a fixed payment of 40 points irrespective of the conflict’s outcome. </p>
<p>For the biased mediator, a reduction of one point of player A’s (B’s) payoff implied a cost of 0.667 (0.333) points. The player C with no stakes did not receive the average of players A and B. To ensure comparability between the treatments, she had to pay 0.5 points for each point withdrawn. After each round, all players received full information about takeouts, the current income, and the punishment of each player.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002712448910">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the structure of the experiment. The experiment had three rounds. In each round, the conflict parties could take balls from the urn. In some treatments, each round started with communication. At the end of each round some mediators were able to punish each conflict party. All subjects received immediate information about the decisions of the other players in their group.</p>

<p>The most basic treatment (direct communication without mediator [<italic>noM</italic>]) reveals to what extent the common-pool problem actually produces conflict. This benchmark makes it possible to compare the outcomes of the various treatments. Treatment <italic>C/noM</italic> provides another benchmark because it shows how communication between the parties affects the common-pool problem. Treatment <italic>C/P</italic> reveals the interaction between the two sources of mediator power, Punishment and Communication. We do not investigate the impact of rewards on mediation success since participants in experiments typically reward less often than they punish. Treatments that include a successful reward policy would require either some sort of efficiency gain from rewarding (i.e., the rewarded person gets more points than the mediator has spent on the rewards) or an ex ante income distribution strongly in favor of the mediator. Both aspects would make a comparison across treatments difficult.</p>

<title>Procedural Details</title>
<p>The experiment was computerized with the software “z-Tree” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712448910">Fischbacher 2007</xref>). The recruitment was conducted with the software “ORSEE” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712448910">Greiner 2004</xref>). Subjects were students from the University of Konstanz, whereby psychology students were not eligible to participate. All sessions took place at the University of Konstanz. No subject took part in more than one session.</p>
<p>Subjects were randomly assigned a role as player A, B, or C upon arrival at the lab. They received written instructions including comprehension questions that had to be answered correctly. A summary of the instructions was read aloud to ensure common knowledge of the game. All treatments were framed in a neutral manner.</p>
<p>Sessions without communication lasted for about sixty minutes; sessions with communication for about eighty minutes. Each experimental point was converted into €0.4 (about $0.5 at that time) at the end of the experiment. Additionally, each subject received a show up fee of €4. The subjects earned about €16.23 on average. The minimum income was the show up fee of €4 and the maximum income was €28.</p>

<title>Behavioral Predictions</title>
<p>In this section, we make a number of behavioral predictions regarding mediation outcomes. Our behavioral predictions draw, in part, from a large body of empirical evidence and subsequent theories on reciprocity and inequality aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712448910">Fehr and Schmidt 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712448910">Bolton and Ockenfels 2000</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002712448910">5</xref>
</sup> These theories argue that people are reciprocal and are simultaneously ready to decrease overall welfare in order to achieve more egalitarian outcomes. Results from the ultimatum game (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712448910">Güth, Schmittberger, and Schwarze 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712448910">Güth, Huck, and Müller 2001</xref>) provide a prominent example for such a decrease. Notice that these predictions are in stark contrast from the now dominant economic approach to mediation in political science and international relations. This approach starts from the assumption that disputants are selfish utility maximizers and view communication as cheap talk (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712448910">Beardsley 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712448910">Smith and Stam 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712448910">Savun 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, we do not claim that <italic>all</italic> people are reciprocal or have inequality aversion. There will always be people whose behavior closely conforms to the predictions of conventional economic theory. Therefore, we focus on an extended range of mediation characteristics (communication, punishment, and mediator interest) and outcomes (efficiency, inequality of outcomes) that take both types of behavior into account.</p>
<p>We use two criteria to evaluate the mediator’s effectiveness in conflict prevention. The most obvious criterion is the inefficient/efficient use of the common resources. Efficiency in this context refers to the aggregate outcomes of players A and B. If one or both players pick balls from the urn at an early stage the mediator is not very effective. The second criterion in this context is inequality in outcomes, an aspect that has not really been considered in the existing mediation literature. Inequality of outcomes is important since many people care about inequality (Fehr and Schmidt 2006) and may consider unilateral exploitation as a breach of trust. Inequality-averse players will consider a mediator as particularly ineffective if the common resource is exploited unilaterally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022002712448910">
<title>Predictions Regarding Efficiency</title>
<p>Conventional economic theory predicts a complete failure of conflict prevention in all our treatments. In the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium selfish rational players will take all balls in round 1, regardless of the treatment. Player C (the mediator) will never punish because it only decreases payoffs. Communication also has no impact on the outcome. Results from previous studies, however, suggest that this worst-case scenario will not occur. Behavioral predictions change if people have inequality aversion or if they have a preference for reciprocity. In both cases, communication and punishment can induce participants to cooperate. Substantial evidence from experimental economics suggests that this will in fact occur (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712448910">Falk, Fehr, and Fischbacher 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712448910">Ostrom, Gardner, and Walker 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Strong preferences for equality or reciprocity lead to multiple equilibria in our common-pool game. The actual withdrawals of player A depend on her expectations about the withdrawals of player B (and vice versa). If one player expects the other to leave the pool untouched, this player will not withdraw points as well. If she expects a withdrawal, she will withdraw as well. In this context, communication facilitates a coordination process. Each player has an incentive to state her willingness to cooperate. In some cases, this statement is credible because the player honestly wants to induce high level of cooperation. Furthermore, the mediator has an incentive to tell each player that the other player does not plan to withdraw points. Some players consider such a statement credible and reciprocity or inequality aversion induces them to withdraw fewer points. <list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Prediction 1:</italic> Communication increases the combined payoff of A and B.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Note that the first prediction focuses on communication in general and does not differentiate between direct and indirect communication. Intuition suggests that direct communication is more effective but some evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6a-0022002712448910">Carnevale and Choi 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712448910">Goltsman et al. 2009</xref>) indicates the opposite. The trustworthiness of the mediator is probably a crucial factor for the effectiveness of indirect communication.</p>
<p>Punishment occurs if the mediator considers inequality as a violation of a social norm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002712448910">Fehr and Fischbacher (2004</xref>) provide evidence that third parties punish for exactly this reason. In this case, the mediator withdraws points from the richer player. The economic damage for the richer player is twice as large as the loss for the mediator. Hence punishment decreases inequality between all players. Other motives may also induce punishment. Theories of reciprocity suggest that punishment also occurs because the mediator suspects that malign intentions induce players to reduce the common pool. If players A and B expect punishment, then their incentives to empty the common pool decrease.<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Prediction 2:</italic> If a mediator can punish uncooperative behavior, the combined payoff of A and B increases.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Several authors have suggested that punishment and communication may go hand in hand (Ostrom, Walker, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002712448910">Gardner, Elinor, and Walker 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38b-0022002712448910">Svensson 2007</xref>; Velez, Stranlund, and Murphy 2009). The mediator can use communication in order to clarify her punishment strategy. Communication can also provide clearer punishment motives, for example when one player has promised cooperation but exploits the common resource.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002712448910">6</xref>
</sup> </p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Prediction 3:</italic> A combination of communication and punishment provides the highest combined payoff for A and B.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section6-0022002712448910">
<title>Predictions Regarding Inequality</title>
<p>Prediction 1 on the effectiveness of communication was based on overwhelming empirical evidence in experimental economics for the importance of inequality aversion and reciprocity. However, not all people exhibit these preferences. Some players will make honest statements but others will lie. Some players will also believe in promises of cooperation, while others will consider them as cheap talk. Thus, communication will improve cooperation only if the mediator reports that both players in the common-pool game made honest and credible promises of cooperation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712448910">Brandts and Cooper (2007</xref>) observe that some subjects promise cooperation but do not honor their promise. This occurs, for example, once a selfish person expects the other player to be cooperative. Such a selfish player will delay the exploitation to round 3, in particular if the mediator cannot punish. A person who believes in these empty promises would benefit from considering it as cheap talk.<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Prediction 4: </italic>In treatments <italic>Com </italic>(communication via mediator without punishment) and <italic>C/noM</italic> (direct communication without mediator), the inequality in outcome between the conflict parties is higher than that in the treatments <italic>Pun </italic>(without communication but with punishment) and <italic>C/P </italic>(with communication and punishment).</p>
</list-item>
</list>It is noteworthy that prediction 4 does not contradict prediction 1. Communication can increase aggregate outcomes and the inequality of outcomes at the same time, in particular if a selfish player waits until round 3 to empty the common pool. If we can confirm both predictions and some people dislike inequality, then communication increases aggregate payoffs but not necessarily aggregate utility.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022002712448910">
<title>Predictions Regarding a Change in the Interests of the Mediator</title>
<p>Finally, we look at the behavior in the treatments in which the mediator is biased, impartial, or has no stakes in the conflict. While classic mediation studies emphasize the importance of mediator impartiality, some authors have argued that biased mediators can more easily extract concessions from their preferred conflict party and are better able to communicate in a credible fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712448910">Touval 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712448910">Carnevale and Arad 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712448910">Kydd 2003</xref>). In our setup, the mediator has to get the same concessions from both parties. Thus, the benefit of mediator bias may not be so clear since bias facilitates concession from one player but restricts concessions from the other player. Moreover, if the mediator is biased, then a threat of punishment in direction of her preferred player is less credible. Nonetheless, mediator bias may induce a positive tit-for-tat dynamic if impartial mediation does not work. If bias helps the mediator to gain concessions from at least one party, the other party might respond in kind and reduce exploitation of the common resource. Finally, a mediator without any stake in the conflict has difficulties in making credible punishment threats since she does not economically benefit from producing cooperation via punishment. Hence, punishment occurs less often. Reducing the mediator’s economic interests therefore turns mediation into a process that has to rely to a greater extent on communication alone.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Prediction 5:</italic> Both a biased mediator and a mediator without stakes will achieve a lower overall payoff than an impartial one. The resulting inequality is larger than with an impartial mediator.</p>

<p>Prediction 1 is confirmed. The treatments without communication provide the lowest welfare and induce conflict most frequently. The difference between treatments<italic> Pun </italic>and <italic>Com </italic>is significant (<italic>p</italic> = .016), as is the difference between <italic>Com</italic> and <italic>noM</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = .014).

The participants perceive the mediator as an honest broker. </p>
<p>However, Prediction 2 is not confirmed. A mediator who can punish only does not reduce the amount of conflicts. This kind of third party also does not enhance the level of cooperation (the p value for the difference in outcomes between noM and Pun is .564). The major reason is probably the high cost of punishment. Few mediators punish and they do not punish severely. Players A and B expect this and act accordingly. Punishment is only welfare increasing if it is linked with communication. Indeed, mediators avoid conflict and achieve the efficient outcome in 12 out of 14 cases in treatment <italic>C/P</italic>. The performance difference between this treatment and the other three is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .000 in comparison with <italic>noM</italic> and <italic>Pun</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = .015 in comparison with <italic>C/noM</italic>, and <italic>p</italic> = .024 in comparison with <italic>Com</italic>), confirming Prediction 3.</p>

<title>Inequality of Outcomes</title>
<p>So far, the analysis has focused on the efficiency of the final allocation. Let us now focus on the distributional aspects, in particular the outcome for a “loser” in a conflict. The experiment shows that communication has a detrimental effect for some conflict parties. This result confirms Prediction 4. As mentioned before, conflict occurs more frequently in treatments without communication (<italic>NoM</italic>, <italic>Pun</italic>). However, increased cooperation in the communication treatments without punishment (<italic>Com C/noM</italic>) induces some subjects to exploit the other conflict party in round 3. Therefore, conflicts turn asymmetric. Once a conflict occurs, the payoff difference between the two conflict parties is larger in these treatments than in the benchmark treatment without mediation (<italic>p</italic> = .0817 for treatment <italic>Com</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = .0664 for treatment <italic>C/noM</italic>). Likewise, the losing party in a conflict, that is the party with a lower payoff, is worse off in a conflict with communication without punishment (<italic>p</italic> = .0637 for treatment <italic>Com</italic>, <italic>p</italic> = .0787 for treatment <italic>C/noM</italic>). Furthermore, cooperating players are more likely to get nothing out of the pool if they are in the communication treatments. The Gini coefficients also show that communication without punishment leads to uneven payments if a conflict occurs. If punishment is possible, communication does not have this detrimental effect, suggesting that communication and punishment are complementary mechanisms for a mediator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002712448910">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Communication Patterns</title>
<p>The previous analysis has shown that some subjects exploited the cooperation induced by the mediator and took all balls out of the pool in round 3. In most cases, these participants made misleading promises about cooperative behavior. This is fully in line with the predictions of cheap talk theory. In treatments with a punishment possibility, a threat of punishment by the mediator deterred these exploiters. In all treatments with communication and punishment, the subjects did not empty the pool when the mediator threatened punishment in the opening statement. Such threats occurred in 11 out of 14 cases in treatment <italic>C/P</italic>, in 7 out of 14 cases in treatment <italic>C/P bias</italic>, but only in 4 out of 15 cases in treatment <italic>C/P no stakes</italic>. The results support our previous claim that communication and punishment are indeed complementary tools.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a powerful mediator can also use communication to restrict retaliation. In four treatments (<italic>noM</italic>, <italic>Pun</italic>, <italic>C/P bias</italic>, and <italic>C/P no stakes</italic>), some subjects took balls in round 1 without emptying the pool. In the treatments without communication (<italic>noM</italic>, <italic>Pun</italic>), cooperation in round 2 was significantly lower if at least one subject had been uncooperative in round 1 (the <italic>p</italic> values are .0102 for <italic>noM</italic>, and .0114 for <italic>Pun</italic>). In each of the other two treatments, three groups experienced uncooperative behavior in round 1. However, all mediators were able to persuade the conflict parties to behave cooperatively in round 2.<sup>7</sup>
</p>
<p>The persuasive power of the mediator becomes visible in one group where the mediator made a behavioral recommendation that was not welfare maximizing. This incident occurred in treatment <italic>C/P bias.</italic> Player B had taken one ball in round 1, such that nineteen balls remained in the pool. Before round 2, the mediator recommended that each player leaves the pool untouched in round 2 and that each player takes nine balls in round 3, with one ball remaining in the pool. The other players reminded the mediator that the recommended strategy is not welfare maximizing, but they did not insist on their opinion. In consequence, the mediator successfully persuaded each player to behave in her proposed way by reassuring them that the respective other player will also follow the recommendation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article investigated the intervention of third parties in order to prevent conflicts in common-pool games with two players. The treatments groups varied in the powers and interests of the third party. The results show that third-party intervention is effective. In particular, the combination of indirect communication and punishment by the mediator is conducive to efficient solutions in most cases. Punishment and communication are thus complementary mediation tools. This result holds even if the mediator is biased toward one party or her payoff does not depend on the conflict’s outcome. Powerful mediators can also restrict retaliation in case of previous uncooperative behavior. The existence of a punishment device alone is not welfare improving. Communication contains some ambiguity. On an aggregate level, it helps to prevent conflicts; so it is more than just cheap talk. However, once players deviate then they empty the entire pool leaving cooperative players worse off than in treatments without communication. However, such behavior only occurs in situations when the mediator cannot or does not threaten punishment. In sum, the main result of our experimental study is that successful conflict prevention requires both communication and punishment. Punishment supports the coordination effect of communication since the anticipation of punishment reduces people’s incentives to promise cooperative behavior and then act otherwise.</p>
<p>Our experimental results yield mixed results for the various claims surrounding successful and unsuccessful mediation. While communication was not pure cheap talk in our experiment (as suggested by many mediation theorists), the results still provide a number of hints that cheap talk indeed occur and that communication alone is not a reliable tool in producing cooperative outcomes. The fact that some people make false promises and exploit the cooperative behavior of others much more than in a setting without communication imposes a strong qualification on the observation that communication enhances cooperative behavior (as documented, e.g., in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712448910">Ostrom [1998]</xref>). As to mediator bias, our study does not confirm the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712448910">Carnevale and Arad 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712448910">Kydd 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712448910">2006</xref>). The experiment does not provide evidence that mediator bias toward one player enhances or diminishes success. In both cases, the mediator is very effective in conflict prevention, so it is perhaps more interesting that bias does no harm. Kydd’s (2003) argument in favor of mediator bias may actually hold in a context in which an impartial mediator has difficulties in pushing any party toward cooperation. Testing this suggestion requires an entirely different experimental setup.</p>
<p>To be sure, punishment will remain a controversial factor in a mediation process. In this experiment, punishment was an expensive but well-targeted economic sanction against an uncooperative agent. In many conflicts, mediators may use tools that are blunter. In this case, punishment may harm innocent bystanders rather than the defecting person. The use of military force is an obvious example. Even economic sanctions may harm ordinary citizens but not a ruthless dictator. In divorce cases, children may suffer because the mediator acts against one parent. Potential “collateral damages” are likely to affect both the effectiveness and the ethics of punishment. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712448910">Beardsley (2008</xref>) argues, leveraging costs (in the form of punishment) may have the effect of making more potential agreements preferable to the immediate costs of conflict, but it may also make long-term peace less stable.</p>
<p>Finally, it may surprise readers that the mediator is fairly successful in many situations. Apart from punishment, the mediator in this experiment provided valuable coordination services at no expense for the conflict parties. Not only did she inform each party about the messages of the other one. The effects of the opening statements show that the mediator can become a sort of moral authority. This role can compensate some drawbacks of indirect communication, bias or low incentives.</p>
<p>Let us conclude with the famous phrase of President Theodore Roosevelt, summarizing his foreign policy strategy as “speak softly and carry a big stick.” After all, Roosevelt was a successful mediator himself. In 1906, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the peace in the Russo-Japanese War. The results of our experiment suggest that this may be a good recommendation for mediators. However, it is popular to label Roosevelt’s foreign policy just as big-stick ideology,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002712448910">8</xref>
</sup> which seemingly ignores the aspect of communication. We found that is a shortsighted abbreviation. Punishment alone is not effective. It is indeed the combination of communication and punishment which is conducive to cooperative outcomes.</p>

<p>General Instructions for Participants</p>
<p>Welcome to our economic experiment</p>
<p>Please read the following instructions carefully. You receive 4 Euros for your participation in this experiment. Depending on the decisions of you and the other participants in this experiment, you may receive additional payments. Therefore we recommend to study these instructions in detail. If you have any question, please contact us before the experiment starts.</p>
<p>You must not talk with other participants during the experiment. Otherwise you are excluded from the experiment and receive no payments at all.</p>
<p>During the experiment we talk about points instead of Euros. At first, all your revenues are calculated in points. We exchange the final score into Euros at the end of the experiment. The exchange rate is</p>
<p>1 Point = 40 Eurocents.</p>
<p>At the end of this experiment, you receive payments for all your received points and the 4 Euros for participation in cash.</p>
<p>Now we explain the procedure of the experiment on the following pages in detail.</p>

<title>The Experiment</title>
<sec id="section16-0022002712448910">
<title>Setup</title>
<p>There are three types of participants in this experiment: A, B, and C. The participants will be matched in groups of three, such that each group contains one participant of each type. All participants remain anonymous. Group matching occurs randomly at the beginning of the experiment. We will never reveal the identities of any member of any group.</p>
<p>The experiment is set up as follows. At first, a lottery assigns you to a group of three members who remain anonymous. In this group, you are participant C. The experiment includes three stages. You are always a participant C and you remain in this group during the entire experiment.</p>
<p>Now we explain the different stages of the experiment. Please read carefully as these instructions inform you about your decision possibilities and their impact on your payout. If you have any question, please ask before the experiment starts!</p>

<title>The Stages of the Experiment</title>
<sec id="section18-0022002712448910">
<title>Communication</title>
<p>The experiment has three stages or rounds. In each stage, participants A and B make a decision. (For communication treatments only:) Ahead of each decision communication via an online chat is possible.Please do not reveal your identity during communication. Your identifier in communication is “Participant C”. We put some restrictions on communication as you can see below:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Communication before round 1:</italic>

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>You can send messages to participants A and B which may contain your considerations about the game. These messages are identical for both participants for A and B. Both cannot answer you. If you want to send a message, please type in your text and press the ‘Enter’-key.</italic>

<sec id="section19-0022002712448910">
<title>Your Decisions</title>
<p>In this experiment, participants A and B can withdraw balls fromanpool. Balls and pools are, of course, virtual. The pool contains 20 balls at the beginning ofthe experiment. In each of the three rounds, participants A and B can decide how many balls they want to take out of the pool. The pool will not be refilled after a round. Each withdrawn ball remains outside with the participant who took it.</p>
<p>In each round, each participant can take as many balls as the pool contains in this round. Both participants decide simultaneously without any information about the decision of the respective other person.</p>
<p>Of course, the sum of the withdrawn balls cannot exceed the number of balls in the pool. If the sum of the intended withdrawals exceeds the number of balls in the pool, the following division rule applies. The share for participant A is her intended withdrawal divided by the sum of both intended withdrawals. Likewise the share for participant B is her intended withdrawal divided by the sum of both intended withdrawals. </p>
<p>Only entire balls can be withdrawn. If the allotted share is not an integer, it is always round down. Therefore, excessive intended withdrawal can imply that the sum of actual withdrawals is smaller than the number of balls previously in the pool. In this case one ball is lost.</p>
<p>The following example may clarify the withdrawing procedure:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Suppose the experiment is in round three. In the previous rounds 16 balls hwere withdrawn altogether.4 balls remain in the pool. Participant A wants to withdraw 3 balls, participant B 2 balls. Altogether they want to withdraw 5 balls which exceeds the number of balls in the pool. The balls are divided as follows: </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Participant A wanted to take 3 balls which is equivalent to 60% of the sum of intended withdrawals (3 + 2 = 5). Therefore she gets 60% of the remaining 4 balls, i.e. 2.4 balls. Since 2.4.is not an integer, she will get only 2 balls.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Participant B wanted to take 2 balls which is equivalent to 40% of the sum of intended withdrawals. Therefore he gets 40% of the remaining 4 balls, i.e. 1.6 balls. Since 1.6 is not an integer, he will get only 1 balls. Overall, one ball is lost.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022002712448910">
<title>The Value of the Balls</title>
<p>Every withdrawn ball transfers points to the withdrawing person. The value per ball changes every round. Every ball withdrawn in round 1 transfers 1 point. Every ball withdrawn in round 2 transfers 2 points and every ball withdrawn in round 3 transfers 3 points. After round 3, all remaining balls in the pool have a value of 4 points. These points are equally divided between players A and B. </p>

<sec id="section23-0022002712448910">
<title>Example 1</title>
<p>Round 1: There are 20 balls in the pool. Participant A wants to take 1 ball. Participant B wants to take 2 balls. 17 balls remain in the pool. Participant A has 1 point, participant B 2 points.</p>
<p>(<italic>For punishment treatments only:) Participant C takes 1 point away from participant A, such that participant A has 0 points. Participant B can keep his 2 points.</italic>
</p>
<p>Round 2: Now, there are 17 balls in the pool. Participant A wants to take 4 balls. Participant B also wants to take 4 balls. 9 balls remain in the pool. Participant A receives8 point, participant B also receives 8 points and has now 10 points. (<italic>The scores are adjusted accordingly in the non-punishment treatments</italic>) </p>
<p>(<italic>For punishment treatments only:)Participant C takes no points away</italic>.</p>
<p>Round 3: Now, there are 9 balls in the pool. Participant A wants to take 3 balls. Participant B wants to take 2 balls. 4 balls remain in the pool. Participant A receives 9 points (3*3) and has now 17 points (8+9), participant B receives 6 points (2*3) and has now 16 points (10+6). 4 balls remain in the pool. Their value (4*4 points) is divided equally between A and B, each of them receiving 8 points. Altogether, participant A has 25 points (8 + 9 + 8). Participant B has 24 points (2 + 8 + 6 + 8; <italic>The scores are adjusted accordingly in the non-punishment treatments</italic>) </p>
<p>(<italic>For punishment treatments only:) Participant C takes 1 point away from participant A, such that participant A has 24 points. Participant C takes 4 points away from participant B, such that participant B has 20 points. </italic>
</p>
<p>The average payout is 22 points. Participant C will receive 22 points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0022002712448910">
<title>Example 2</title>
<p>Round 1: There are 20 balls in the pool. Participant A wants to take 7 balls. Participant B wants to take 6 balls. 7 balls remain in the pool. Participant A has 7 points, participant B 6 points.</p>
<p>(<italic>For punishment treatments only:</italic>)Participant C takes no points away.</p>
<p>Round 2: Now, there are 7 balls in the pool. Participant A wants to take 5 balls. Participant B wants to take 7 balls. The participants want to take out more balls than the pool contains. The remaining balls have to be shared.</p>
<p>Overall, the participants wanted to take out 12 balls. Participant A wanted 5 balls which implies a share 41.67 balls (5/12). Participant B wanted 7 balls which implies a share 58.33 balls (7/12). With 7 balls remaining in the pool, A receives 2 balls (0.4167 * 7 = 2.917, this result will be round down to 2). B receives 4 balls (0.5833 * 7 = 4.083, this result will be round down to 2). 1 ball is lost. Hence, A gets 4 points (2*2) and 11 points in total. B gets 8 points and has 14 points in total.</p>
<p>(<italic>For punishment treatments only:)Again, participant C takes no points away.</italic>
</p>
<p>Round 3: Now, there are 0 balls in the pool. No player can withdraw any ball. Participant A has 11 points, participant B 14 points.</p>
<p>(For punishment treatments only:) Participant C takes 4 point away from participant A, such that participant A has 7 points. Participant C takes no points away from participant B, such that participant A has 14 points. </p>
<p>The average payout is 10.5 points. Participant C will receive 10.5 points. (<italic>The scores are adjusted accordingly in the non-punishment treatments) </italic>
