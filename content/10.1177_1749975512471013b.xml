<p>In British social science meta-theory is associated with the critical realist argument that research needs to be grounded in the precepts of structure and agency. The debate about meta-theory is more wide-ranging in US sociology with, for example, Alexander arguing that research needs to be based on the precepts of action and order. Although Reed does not state that this is a work of meta-theory, its ambitions are meta-theoretic. Whereas critical realists were influenced by Marx and Alexander developed a neo-functionalist approach, Reed develops Weber’s argument that causal explanation and the understanding of agents’ meanings are not antithetical endeavours, in order to rethink the approach to causality in social science. In doing this he draws widely – and successfully – on a number of classical and contemporary theoretical and empirical sources to develop a cultural sociology that is designed to furnish a new approach to social knowledge across the social sciences. The key claim to originality in the book is that the arguments between positivists and interpretivists, realists and postmodernists, etc., do produce some critiques which hit home but which all ultimately miss the key point, namely that causality is to be neither eschewed nor constructed in a naturalist (positivist or realist) fashion. Cultural sociology is thus to be a meta-theory that supplies some long overdue terms of reference for social scientists properly to explain causality.</p>
<p>Meta-theoretical arguments are motivated by a concern with solving a problem of incoherence. For critical realists and Alexander, theories can only be coherent if they give an adequate account of the interplay between structure and agency or action and order, respectively. Reed rejects the usual meta-theoretical reliance on internal coherence, to argue that ‘coherence is <italic>in the case</italic>, not in the theorist’s head’ (p. 103, emphasis in original). What he means by this is that adequate explanations may well require the use of different and even conflicting theories because they may be able to illuminate different aspects of the data. This is not to countenance relativism, obviously, because the task is to develop causal explanations and not become a ‘metatheoretical ironist’ (p. 124). This overcomes a key problem with realist approaches to meta-theory which beg the question by reading theoretical coherence ‘in the head’ into the data and then take the data as a verification of the theory’s veracity.</p>
<p>In making his case, Reed argues that there are three ‘epistemic modes’ that underpin social scientific research. Epistemic modes are defined by Reed as the ‘conceptual method’ for linking theory and data, which structure expectations about what theory can accomplish and which supply criteria for validity to judge explanations (p. 7). The three epistemic modes are held to be the realist, normative and interpretive epistemic modes, and each of these modes (<italic>qua</italic> meta-theory) is irreducible to a particular thinker or school of thought (p. 7). Realism and normativism go beyond ‘minimal interpretations’, which have a very limited scope for theoretical interpretation, to ‘maximal interpretations’, where the ‘signs’ of evidence become intertwined with the ‘signs’ of theory (p. 23). The problem for realism (as espoused, for example, by Bhaskar), though, is that in seeking to decode the hidden mechanisms behind observable events it fails to take account of how ‘intransitive’ mechanisms are actually ‘transitive’ because they are mediated by agents’ meanings. Similarly, the normative ‘resignification’ of social life in terms of its immanent utopian potential, as espoused by thinkers such as Habermas, ‘squares the hermeneutic circle’ because it detaches norms from the actual lives of agents (p. 88). As regards the interpretive epistemic mode, this has been limited so far by the misconception of social knowledge as pertaining to the understanding of agents’ meanings with no reference to causality. However, the interpretive epistemic mode can go on to give explanations that also draw on meanings. This means thinking in terms of motivations being causes, with motivations being irrational as well as rational, and unconscious as well as conscious (p. 136); and motivations being the <italic>form</italic> for the causal <italic>forces</italic> or mechanisms that agents engage with, in the sense that mechanisms only exist in ‘landscapes of meanings’. ‘Forcing causes’ are moulded by ‘forming causes’ because processes that affect us are created by our motivations.</p>
<p>Given the importance of Weber, the argument would benefit from more being said about his work and the debates generated by it. Further, in arguing that social knowledge claims are ‘heuristically abstract fictions to get at historically located truths’ (p. 160), Reed rejects realism for nominalism, which in turn requires a discussion of how a non-arbitrary revision of concepts in a ‘community of inquirers’ may be arrived at. Nonetheless, this is an excellent contribution to cultural sociology and social theory.</p>
