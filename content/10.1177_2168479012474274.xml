<abstract>
<p>Japanese pharmaceutical companies invest resources in their internal research and development (R&amp;D) activities and in-licensing activities especially from Western companies, for the local market. The objective of this research is to investigate the fate of late-stage compounds developed by them and to identify company profiles and compound characteristics that could relate to regulatory approvability. Using publicly available information for late-stage compounds that were developed by Japanese companies in 1995-2007, logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the company characteristics and regulatory approval ratio, as well as compound characteristics and probability of approval, for late-stage development compounds. Compound approvability was correlated to the time when the compound was developed (ie, the approval ratio of compounds in phase 3 or later in 1995-1998 was lower than that in 2001 or later); also, in-licensed compounds from large pharmaceutical companies received a higher approval ratio. Company size and R&amp;D expenses were not correlated to their approval ratio.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pharmaceutical industries have faced continuous challenges of higher drug development costs,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479012474274">1</xref>
</sup> more complex clinical trial protocols,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012474274">2</xref>
</sup> increasing regulatory hurdles for new drug development,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479012474274">3</xref>
</sup> and keeping productivities high.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479012474274">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479012474274"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479012474274">6</xref>
</sup> Under these circumstances, many large pharmaceutical companies are looking for opportunities to collaborate with external organizations, such as academia, venture companies, or nonpharmaceutical industries, in order to keep their pipelines full. Using external resources is crucial to sustaining the companies’ activities and revenue, not only from the operational point of view but also from the strategic point of view.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479012474274">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Japanese pharmaceutical companies have traditionally deployed strategies to collaborate with non-Japanese companies (ie, in-licensing products from non-Japanese companies for the Japanese market and out-licensing their own products to non-Japanese companies for the non-Japanese market). It was indicated that Japanese pharmaceutical companies take advantage of the benefit of alliances as compared with American or European companies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479012474274">8</xref>
</sup> There are at least a couple of attractive reasons for Western companies to work with Japanese companies for the Japanese market. First, the Japanese pharmaceutical market has been relatively closed to Western companies due to its own business practices—that is, it is relationship oriented. Second, the regulatory authorization process in Japan has relatively closed visibility; for example, review reports by the regulatory authority for new drugs were not disclosed before 1999, and even now review reports are officially only available in the local language (Japanese). Under these circumstances, Japanese pharmaceutical companies have spent their resources on in-licensing opportunities, in addition to their own research, in a balanced way, in order to maximize their performance. Although the companies found and launched globally known innovative drugs, such as pravastatin, tacrolimus, and donepezil, with or without Western partners, they also tried to in-license foreign compounds and to develop and sell them in the Japanese market with their local expertise, especially when their research and development (R&amp;D) activities with their internal compounds did not bring expected successes.</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to identify company profiles and compound characteristics that could relate to regulatory approvability with a newly created database based on the public information of late-stage compounds developed by Japanese companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2168479012474274" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The databases used in this research were uniquely generated from publicly available information obtained through proper investor relations documents, such as company annual reports and financial disclosure documents. The target companies were selected considering the headquarters location (Japan based), main business (pharmaceutical company), public disclosures (sufficient data disclosure throughout the target period), and size (average annual sales in the target research years of more than 30 billion yen). With these criteria, the following 25 companies were selected to create the database: Astellas, Banyu, Chugai, Daiichi, Daiichi Sankyo, Dainippon, Dainippon Sumitomo, Eisai, Fujisawa, Kaken, Kissei, Kyorin, Mochida, Nihon Shinyaku, Ono Pharm, Sankyo, Santen, Shionogi, Taisho, Takeda, Tanabe, Tanabe-Mitsubishi, Toyama, Yamanouchi, and Zeria. For these 25 companies, a total of 205 compounds first developed by the companies were picked from their public documents for 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007 (“target years”), and their information was stored in the database. In order to evaluate company and compound characteristics, we focused on the first indication developed by the company (ie, the information of the second indication developed by the same company was not included in the database). On the other hand, for the compounds whose second or later indication was developed by a company different from that for the first indication, the second indication information is included in the database. We did not include vaccines, diagnostics, and nontreatment purpose items in the database. We applied α = 0.1 as the statistically meaningful threshold of the analysis.</p>
<sec id="section3-2168479012474274">
<title>Company-Based Analysis</title>
<p>The first analysis was conducted to investigate factors contributing to the company-based ratio of approval (“approval ratio”) for 21 companies. The approval ratio is the proportion of the number of compounds approved to the total number of compounds for each company. We excluded 4 companies (Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo, Dainippon Sumitomo, and Tanabe-Mitsubishi) from the original database for this company analysis since they are recently amalgamated companies, and their late-stage product characteristics may not have been reflected in the new company data (ie, carryover effect from the former companies). The variables of each company were as follows: average sales in the target years (“sales”), average ratio of R&amp;D expense to net sales in the target years (“RD ratio”), average profit per employee in the target years (“profit per person”), whether the management families hold the company share as one of the top 10 shareholders of the company (“family-owned company”) in any of the target years, whether more than 50% of the company stock was owned by a non-Japanese pharmaceutical company (“foreign”) in any of the target years, the ratio of the number of in-licensed late-stage compounds to the total number of late-stage compounds (“Lic”), and the degree of divergence of therapeutic area represented by the ratio of the number of therapeutic areas for late-stage compounds to that of the total number of compounds (“Div”). We conducted simple and multiple logistic regression analysis using “approval ratio” as an outcome variable and the above company variables as explanatory variables. In the logistic regression analysis, we consider “approval ratio” as the original number of approved compounds to total compounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2168479012474274">
<title>Compound-Based Analysis</title>
<p>The second analysis was conducted using the compound database to investigate the factors that contribute to the final fate of the compound (approval or nonapproval). Out of 205 compounds, 8 had not yet come to regulatory or company conclusion (ie, approval or nonapproval/discontinuation as of June 20, 2012), and we excluded these 8 compounds for this analysis. We employed simple and multiple logistic regression analysis using the compound’s final fate as an outcome variable. The explanatory variables were the following: whether the development was relatively old, defined as the compound being in phase 3 or after as of 1995 or 1998 (“development period”); development region; origin of the compound; length of development in late stage; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATCC)–based therapeutic category; biopharmaceutical product; and the company’s characteristics.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Development region</italic> (“region”) was defined as follows: the compound was developed (i) only in one of the 3 regions of Japan, the United States, or the European Union (“single region”) or (ii) 2 or 3 regions (“multiple regions”).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Origin of the compound</italic> (“origin”) was categorized as follows: the compound was (i) found and developed by the target company (“own”), (ii) in-licensed from a top 20 sales company in any of the research periods (“in-license from large pharmaceutical company”), or (iii) in-licensed from other types of companies (“in-license from others”).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Length of development in late stage</italic> (“length”) represents the number of times the compound appeared in the target years. For example, if a compound was under development in 1995 and 1998, the length variable was 2.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Therapeutic category</italic> was based on the ATCC category guidance, and the categorization was conducted by the authors based on the target indication of the late-stage development and validated by public ATCC information for the approved compounds. A category that had only 5 or fewer compounds was categorized under “others” because it may not represent their original therapeutic category characteristics due to the small sample size.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Company characteristics</italic> were categorized as follows: sales (more than 300[billion yen), ratio of RD expense to total sales (&gt;15%), and the ratio of the number of therapeutic areas to the total number of compounds (Div) (&lt;0.6).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to evaluate whether there is time period effect, we additionally conducted a subgroup analysis with the compound database between the subgroups of earlier compounds (n = 111), defined as those under late-stage development in 1995 and/or 1998, and recent compounds (n = 86), that is, under late-stage development in 2001 or after in our database.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The transition of the total number of late-stage compounds, the total number of compounds developed in multiple regions, total sales, and R&amp;D expenditure of the target companies in each target year are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2168479012474274">Figure 1</xref>. As expected, the total sales and R&amp;D expenditure increased from 1995 to 2007, whereas the total number of late-stage compounds decreased from 82 in 1995 to 57 in 2007. The total number of compounds developed in multiple regions was only 3 in 1995 (3.7% of the total) and increased to 16 in 2007 (28.1% of the total).</p>

<p>Summary statistics of the variables selected for the company-based analysis and the results of the simple logistic regression analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2168479012474274">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2168479012474274">2</xref>, respectively. The ratio of the number of in-licensed compounds to the total number of compounds (Lic) showed a statistically significant correlation to the approval ratio (odds ratio: 3.92, <italic>P</italic> = .077). The ratio of the number of therapeutic areas to total number of compounds (Div) showed a tendency to positively correlate to the approval ratio (odds ratio: 4.68, <italic>P</italic> = .135). Non-Japanese pharmaceutical ownership also showed a weak tendency to increase the approval ratio (odds ratio: 2.03, <italic>P</italic> = .185). The ratio of RD expenditure to net sales and profit per person were not related to the approval ratio (<italic>P</italic> = .653 and <italic>P</italic> = .953, respectively). The result showing Lic as a statistically meaningful variable was also supported by multiple logistic regression analysis using the stepwise approach to select variables (<italic>P</italic> = .077).</p>

<p>Regarding the compound-based analysis, the overall approval ratio was 65.4%. In addition, the approval ratios by the categories described in the Method section are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2168479012474274">Figure 2</xref>. The statistical summary and the results of simple logistic regression analysis for the compound-based analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2168479012474274">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2168479012474274">4</xref>, respectively. The development period showed a statistically significant relationship to the probability of approval (odds ratio: 2.51, <italic>P</italic> = .004), suggesting that more recent compounds have higher approvability. The other strong factor was “in-license from a large pharmaceutical company” (odds ratio: 2.52, <italic>P</italic> = .019). There was no significant difference in probability of approval among therapeutic categories. As suggested in the company-based analysis, lower Div showed a lower probability of approval (odds ratio: 0.609, <italic>P</italic> = .106). The multiple logistic regression analysis using the stepwise approach supported a statistically significant correlation with the development period and in-license from a large pharmaceutical company (<italic>P</italic> = .005 and <italic>P</italic> = .029, respectively). In the time effect subgroup analysis, the total sales of the company had a statistically significant negative relationship with the probability of approval (odds ratio = 0.314, <italic>P</italic> = .043) in the recent subgroup (ie, 2001 or later), whereas there was no relationship in the earlier compound subgroup (odds ratio = 0.969, <italic>P</italic> = .934). This means that the compounds developed by the smaller companies have had a higher probability of approval in recent years.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our research showed that the more recent compounds, defined as entering phase 3 after 1998 in our database, had a higher probability of approval. There are several considerations for this observation. First, the regulatory hurdles have been increased, and companies try to address potential concerns, especially safety, before the compounds enter late-stage development. Thus, compounds in the late stage have already cleared potential issues, even in an experimental or preliminary way, so the probability of success, as defined by the regulatory approval ratio, might have increased recently. Second, interaction between regulatory authorities and companies generally has been improved. The consultation meeting process was clarified and streamlined in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it helped companies to learn the Japanese authority’s point of views in the earlier development stage. Last, the operational clinical cost has significantly increased during the period. For example, the International Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) was implemented in 1997 in Japan, and written informed consent, source document verification, and archiving of trial-related documents at the investigational sites were fully mandated. This can mean that the companies had to make some decisions before phase 3, which subsequently led to more focused use of resources. Recently, many companies have conducted proof-of-concept (POC) studies using biomarkers or clinical measurements, with new technologies, in order to try to avoid late-stage failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479012474274">9</xref>
</sup> Stopping drug development activities as early as possible would result in saving a lot of money and resources,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479012474274">10</xref>
</sup> but there may be an opportunity loss. If the results of the POC studies can fairly precisely predict the results of further clinical studies (ie, phase 3 studies), the approval ratio of late-stage compounds should improve based on the improved go/no go decision before phase 3. This POC study hypothesis can potentially be evaluated if we further examine what types of POC studies were conducted with the compounds in this research before phase 3 entry.</p>
<p>In the company-based analysis, we found a tendency of a higher probability of approval for companies with a higher proportion of in-licensed compounds, and the compound-based analysis suggested that the compounds from large pharmaceutical companies have a higher probability of approval. These results make sense considering the Japanese companies’ traditional business practice—that is, in-licensing overseas compounds, especially those developments that are advanced in the West, to the Japanese market from Western-based companies. By the time of in-licensing them to the Japanese market, the compounds might have already entered phase 3 or even have been launched in the West; they are typically developed by large pharmaceutical companies with plenty of resources. A company developing those compounds in a new region can use the sufficient efficacy and safety data from the original countries, and they are in a better position to manage the uncertainty of drug development. The delay of approval in one of the other countries should be avoided from the viewpoint of new drug accessibility, but there should be mechanistic attractions for companies to develop a compound in a staged manner (ie, first evaluate it in one region and then expand/out license it to the rest of the world). Hirai et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479012474274">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479012474274">12</xref>
</sup> evaluated the timing of Japan entry and probability of success, and they concluded that there is a trade-off between earlier launch in Japan and improved probability of success.</p>
<p>In our company research, neither total sales nor RD ratio to total sales showed any significant trend for the company’s ratio for approval. Similarly, no trend was found with other factors related to company size, such as total number of employees and total expense of R&amp;D (data not shown). To secure a “critical mass” in R&amp;D involves the concept of having minimum resources to competitively research and develop a new product,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479012474274">13</xref>
</sup> but there is very little information about the rationale of the concept, as well as the threshold, meaning a minimal amount of both financial and human resources, in pharmaceutical R&amp;D. One of the potential reasons is that more large companies recently have tried to conduct difficult developments, such as a new molecular target, complex diseases, or global scale development, which could result in a lower ratio of approval. Kola and Landis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2168479012474274">14</xref>
</sup> found in their research that companies with smaller R&amp;D budgets (less than US$400 million) have higher success rates, which is consistent with our subgroup analysis for the recent compounds. Sengoku et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2168479012474274">15</xref>
</sup> also reported that the company scale and productivity of R&amp;D are inversely proportional. It is interesting that the correlation was only observed in recent years in our research. At least, this study suggests that the concept of “critical mass” (ie, the bigger, the better) needs to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was that a company’s strategy of “therapeutic area concentration” had a positive impact on the approval ratio, but it was not supported in this study. To test the hypothesis, we used the ratio of the number of therapeutic categories in which a company engages to the total number of compounds handled by the company (Div). The value would be lower if a company has more late-stage compounds compared with the number of therapeutic areas, suggesting the company has a “concentrated therapeutic area strategy,” but the results were the opposite. There are several potential reasons. First, the sample size (ie, number of compounds) is relatively small in each company (18, as the denominator for Takeda, was the largest size), and the simple division does not reflect the “true” therapeutic area concentration. Second, both denominator and numerator are related to the company size; a company that develops only one compound automatically has a Div value of 1.00, suggesting it is “nonconcentrated,” which would not be accurate. Ideally, we would categorize companies as “focused therapeutic area companies” and a “wide range of therapeutic area companies” based on their strategy for comparison, but it is difficult to do so in a consistent manner, and it could be a subjective judgment if we do it from only publicly available information.</p>
<p>The other characteristic of this research is that the study was conducted using only public information disclosed by the target companies (ie, primary information from the companies). There are commercial databases that accumulate related information, but we decided not to use them, since the majority of them tend to be restricted to their customers or their internal users, and the primary information may not be available or traceable. A typical potential issue to the use of public information is the possibility of a disclosure bias; for example, some companies do not disclose the information for their phase 1 compounds. In this research, we used only late-stage information (ie, phase 3 or under new drug application [NDA] review) for publicly traded companies, which usually well disclose their information, in order to minimize the potential disclosure bias. An additional benefit in focusing on only late-stage compounds is that companies tend to make the compound development updates public, even in the cases of discontinuation or termination, since it would affect the financial evaluation and social responsibility of companies.</p>
<p>There are some study limitations in this research. First, we counted the number of compounds, but neither the scale of development nor the novelty of each compound was taken into consideration. In reality, the difficulties of obtaining approval depend on various factors such as the novelty of the mechanism of action, the therapeutic area, and the required clinical trial sample size. Second, we collected information of the target company in each of the target years, which was a 3-year interval, so there may have been compounds that were missed if they showed up and were dismissed within 2 years, although this is not a common occurrence. Third, we eliminated 8 compounds (3.9% of the original total compounds) that were not yet approved or discontinued at the time of the cutoff date from the compound-based analysis, so a censoring effect may need to be considered.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our research shows that the more recent compounds, defined as entering phase 3 after 1998 in our database, had a higher probability of regulatory approval. In-licensed compounds from large pharmaceutical companies have a higher probability of approval compared with original compounds of the Japanese companies or in-licensed compounds from nonlarge companies. Neither size of the company nor R&amp;D expenditure ratio was correlated to the ratio of approval.</p>
