<abstract>
<p>Volunteering motivations and patterns change over the course of a person’s life cycle. This paper tests hypotheses about the relationship between volunteering and four specific life events—the birth of a child, divorce, widowhood, and the death of another household member. I find that having a child decreases a person’s likelihood of volunteering and hours spent in volunteer work. Divorced males were more likely to volunteer and to increase the number of hours volunteered when compared to divorced females. Divorcees with children are also more likely to volunteer and increase the number of hours spent volunteering. Thus, gender and the presence of children in the home are important pathways to volunteering for divorced individuals. Overall, being widowed decreases the likelihood of volunteering and volunteering hours, but older widows tend to increase their volunteering activities. Having another (non-spouse) member of the family pass away is not related to volunteering.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A person’s volunteering behaviors and activities are not constant throughout life. As an individual progresses through the life cycle—from being young and single to getting married, to having and raising children, becoming an empty nester, and progressing through retirement—the likelihood of volunteering and time spent volunteering will change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011429181">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). For instance, when a young couple first gets married, they might decrease their volunteering activities during the initial adjustment period (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011429181">Stoker &amp; Jennings, 1995</xref>). However, as the couple begins to have children and start becoming more established, they participate and volunteer more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764011429181">Rotolo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764011429181">Rotolo &amp; Wilson, 2006</xref>). As the children grow older and become more involved themselves, parents tend to shift their volunteering behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764011429181">Sundeen, 1990</xref>). However, later in life, people might decrease their organizational associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764011429181">Knoke &amp; Thompson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764011429181">Rotolo, 2000</xref>) and further alter volunteering behaviors. As people progress through the life cycle, they adapt their volunteering behaviors to fit their life situation and current motivations to volunteer.</p>
<p>However, what happens when the household structure and family roles are disrupted? How do life cycle events influence the decision to volunteer? Not all people proceed through the traditional life cycle in a straightforward, uncomplicated way. Many people have their life cycle interrupted by certain events, such as being divorced or widowed at an early age. Major life events, such as having a child born or having a family member die, can place a great deal of stress on family members that cause an immediate change in volunteering behaviors. Some of these events can produce negative effects that reduce volunteering; however, volunteering can also be a tool for coping with difficult life events. This article looks at the influence of various life events on an individual’s volunteering. Specifically, the events considered in this article are the birth of a child, getting divorced, having a (nonspouse) death in the household, or being widowed. These types of events all significantly change the composition of a household and can inflict serious stress on household members and disrupt previous routines and behaviors.</p>

<title>The Life Cycle of Volunteering</title>
<p>An individual’s volunteering behaviors naturally change over the course of the person’s life. As new stages in the life cycle bring new associations and changing roles and responsibilities, people adjust their preferences for different types of activities. Adolescents in the United States volunteer at fairly high rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764011429181">Toppe, 2005</xref>). This is likely due to the supporting influence of churches, youth-oriented organizations and schools. Many schools, for instance, require volunteering as part of the curriculum or provide students with opportunities for service learning. Youth are likely to volunteer to enhance the personal experience they can list on a resume or a college application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764011429181">Friedland &amp; Morimoto, 2005</xref>). These forces have served to strengthen volunteering among individuals in the adolescent phase of life.</p>
<p>Young adults (people in their early 1920s) are often busy working on an education or starting a new marriage and might not make time for volunteering. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011429181">Stoker and Jennings (1995)</xref> found that although marriage in general increases political participation, new marriages decreased participation initially as the young couple adjusted to married life. This is likely to be true for volunteering as well. As young couples begin to have children, they will alter their behaviors and begin to volunteer more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011429181">Brown, 1999</xref>). However, the relationship between volunteering status and children is complicated: It depends on a variety of factors, such as the gender of the parent, the parent’s employment, and the ages of the children and the number of children in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011429181">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). As an example, parents with very young children volunteer fewer hours than parents whose children are older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011429181">Menchik &amp; Weisbrod, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764011429181">Schlozman, Burns, &amp; Verba, 1994</xref>). This is because, young children require more caregiving time from their parents, because there are many things that they cannot do for themselves. However, as the children grow older and become more independent and as they become involved in more activities, parents are often drawn into volunteering opportunities, especially those related to their children’s activities. Family members often volunteer for organizations that other family members are involved in or benefit from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764011429181">Becker &amp; Dhingra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764011429181">Nichols &amp; King, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764011429181">Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0899764011429181">Wymer, 1997</xref>). As the number of children in the family increases, the likelihood of volunteering also increases, but the number of hours volunteered decrease because of increased time constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011429181">Carlin, 2001</xref>). So, even though having children draws people into volunteering experiences, their time for such activities is still limited. At the peak of family life we can expect more volunteering, especially volunteering that is focused on the benefit of family members.</p>
<p>Then as a couple’s children leave the home and as they face retirement, volunteering shifts once again. Although younger people might volunteer to further their own careers and to seek a greater understanding of the world, older people report that they volunteer to feel useful or to make social connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764011429181">Okun &amp; Schultz, 2003</xref>). Volunteering in later life can depend on many factors, such as volunteering done before retirement, employment status during retirement years, the age when a person retires, the overall health of the person, and the presence of a spouse who volunteers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764011429181">Mutchler, Burr, &amp; Caro (2003)</xref> found that for those who were already volunteering before retirement, working during retirement had no effect on their volunteering hours. However, those who did not volunteer before they retired and who were not working during retirement are more likely to begin volunteering during retirement. There is also some evidence that people increase the number of hours that they volunteer as they enter retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764011429181">Caro &amp; Bass, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764011429181">Moen, Field, Quick, &amp; Hofmeister, 2000</xref>). In fact, many national volunteering programs are specifically aimed at increasing volunteering among these groups, such as the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program or Foster Grandparents. Older Americans are becoming an increasingly important segment of the volunteer pool.</p>
<p>Beyond the impact of the natural progress through the life cycle on volunteering, specific life events can also alter volunteering behaviors. These events might alter family routines by creating time pressures that prevent volunteering or they might change a person’s motivations to volunteer by providing a social or coping outlet. The following section discusses four of these life events and presents hypotheses about the impact these events might have on volunteering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0899764011429181">
<title>Life Cycle Event Hypotheses</title>
<p>As already discussed, the presence of children in the home can influence volunteering decisions in many ways. Even though married people with children are more likely to volunteer than married people without children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764011429181">Hayghe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764011429181">Boraas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764011429181">Brown, 1999</xref>), the effect of having children on volunteering varies with the ages of the children. The presence of young preschool children in the home can discourage volunteering or at least cause parents to decrease the amount of time they spend volunteering to care for their young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764011429181">Menchik &amp; Weisbrod, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764011429181">Schlozman, Burns, &amp; Verba, 1994</xref>). Young children place time constraints on parents and restrict the number and kinds of activities that parents can do outside the home. Parents of young preschool children do not have as much discretionary time as parents of older children or people without children did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764011429181">Robinson &amp; Godbey, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Having a child born into the family will likely have an immediate dampening effect on both the likelihood of volunteering and the number of hours given to volunteer work. Having a new baby requires great adjustments from parents: A newborn baby disrupts the parents’ normal schedules and sleeping routines and requires a great deal of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764011429181">Feeney, Hohaus, Noller, &amp; Alexander, 2001</xref>). In addition, the adjustment period after having a baby can be a difficult time for many women, as evidenced by the prevalence of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression not only just affect the woman but also the spouses of women experiencing postpartum depression who are more likely to experience symptoms of depression or other psychological problems themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764011429181">Roberts, Bushnell, Collings, &amp; Purdie, 2006</xref>). These stresses and disruptions can have a negative impact on volunteering. The new baby takes time and resources away from potential volunteer opportunities. This leads to the first set of hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0899764011429181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Parents who have had a child born recently will be less likely to volunteer than people who have not had a child born recently, even above and beyond the negative effect of having preschool children in the home.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: Parents who have had a child born recently will decrease the number of hours they spend volunteering.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Divorce also interrupts and changes family routines. Divorced individuals experience a huge psychological shift as they transition from being married to being single again. Other shifts could include changes in the person’s employment situation, changes in financial assets and security, a move to a new home or city, or changes in social patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0899764011429181">Wallerstein &amp; Blakeslee, 1996</xref>). These changes and adjustments can be a source of stress and worry. For instance, divorce can cause great financial stress among women, especially women who have been married for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764011429181">Galloway, 1994</xref>). This is a reasonable fear, because divorce has been shown to lead to a decrease in wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0899764011429181">Zagorsky, 2005</xref>). In addition to lowing financial outcomes, divorce can also lead to poorer health, because those who have been divorced, widowed, or separated report lower health outcomes than those who are married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011429181">Liu &amp; Umberson, 2008</xref>). Divorce can bring many new pressures into a person’s life and these pressures force an individual to find ways to cope with these changes.</p>
<p>A divorce can also have a negative influence on the children of the couple getting divorced, which can create more obstacles to parental volunteering. Children of a divorced couple can manifest psychological distress, behavior problems, and academic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764011429181">Portnoy, 2008</xref>). These problems will place further stress and worry on the couple who have gotten divorced and will take time and other resources away from volunteering. The parent with primary custody of the children will also have less available time and energy to devote to volunteering, especially for organizations that are not directly related to the children’s benefit, because the parent must now spend more time on caregiving and maintaining a household on his or her own. Being a single parent can be very difficult, and the time that a person spends running a family and household may restrict participation in other activities. Divorce has been shown to decrease several measures of political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011429181">Stoker &amp; Jennings, 1995</xref>). Empirical evidence has also demonstrated that single parents, especially single parents with preschool children, are less likely to volunteer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764011429181">Sundeen, 1990</xref>). Thus, it is likely that in the aftermath of a divorce, a person will have to decrease volunteering activities to deal with the more immediate pressures that the divorce has created in their families.</p>
<p>The presence of children in the home can be a determining factor in how divorce influences volunteering behaviors. For instance, a divorced individual with no children or who is a non-custodial parent might actually have more available time for volunteering. Indeed, that person may perceive volunteering as an important new social outlet or any opportunity to meet people. Custodial parents might actually be drawn into more volunteering activities on behalf of their children, although they might decrease the amount of time they spend volunteering overall (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011429181">Carlin, 2001</xref>). Taking all of these potential effects into consideration, it is difficult to predict the overall effect of divorce on volunteering and on the number of hours volunteered. It is an empirical question as to whether the positive or negative effects will be stronger overall. It is also likely that the effect of divorce on volunteering will vary with a person’s gender and with the presence of children in the home. Thus, the second set of hypotheses is,</p>
<list id="list2-0899764011429181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Recently divorced individuals will have a different likelihood of volunteering than individuals who have not had a recent divorce.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: Recently divorced individuals will alter the number of hours they spend volunteering.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>: There will be a gendered difference in the effect of a recent divorce on volunteering and hours volunteered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2c</italic>: The effect of a recent divorce on volunteering and hours volunteered will be different for those individuals with children in the home than for those without children in the home.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Having a death in the family (a nonspouse family member) can be traumatic. These events can include losing a child or losing a grandparent or other adult that lives with the family. One of the ways that people can potentially cope with a death in the family is through reaching out and doing work in the community. A study of women after the death of their only child revealed that 63% of these women volunteer their time through some type of organization, and 39% of those women started their volunteer work after the death of their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764011429181">Infeld &amp; Penner, 1996</xref>). Thus, volunteering can serve as a means for people to reinvest themselves in life after a traumatic event like losing a family member.</p>
<p>Having an ill or disabled elderly family member living in the household can be a difficult thing for a family. In those instances, adult family members might be spending a considerable amount of time in caregiving to the elderly family member. The bulk of this work often falls on the women of the family. Caregiving activities can be very time-consuming. One conservative estimate from the National Family Caregiving Survey indicates that an average amount of time spent in caregiving per week is 17.9 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011429181">Arno, Levine, &amp; Memmott, 1999</xref>). One survey of seriously ill patients who had been discharged for home care found that in 20% of the families of these critically ill patients a family member had to quit a job or make another serious life change to care for the ill family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011429181">Covinsky et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, when an elderly family member is in the home, adult family members who are doing the caregiving might need to decrease their volunteering activities. Empirical evidence has shown this to be true. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764011429181">Taniguchi (2006)</xref> found that, for women, giving care to an elderly relative was negatively related to volunteering. However, after the elderly family member has passed away, adult members of the household can return to their previous volunteering habits. Having a death in the family might also provide more opportunities for volunteering. In many instances women’s caregiving responsibilities have served as a springboard for political activity, especially advocacy on behalf of causes that would benefit a disabled family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764011429181">Gordon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764011429181">Lister, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764011429181">Mink, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764011429181">Skocpol, 1992</xref>). In addition, after an ill family member dies, the time previously spent on caregiving can easily be transferred to more formal helping behavior through volunteering.</p>
<p>As with the other life events, there are also reasons to expect that a recent death of a household member might constrain volunteering. For instance, the primary caregiver might seek full-time employment or increase the number of hours spent working which would limit the available time for volunteering. As many caregivers decrease work hours to have time for caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011429181">Covinsky et al., 1994</xref>), it is likely that they will return to these work activities after the family member receiving care has passed away. It is likely that a recent death in the family can alter not just the likelihood of volunteering, but also the number of hours spent volunteering. Thus, the final set of hypotheses is,</p>
<list id="list3-0899764011429181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Persons who have had a recent death in the household (other than the death of a spouse) will alter their volunteering and number of hours volunteered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3a</italic>: The effect of a recent death in the household on volunteering will vary by gender.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Coping with widowhood can be similar in many ways to coping with divorce. However, widowhood has the potential for even stronger negative effects in a person’s life. Widowhood is one of the life’s most stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764011429181">Dohrenwend, Krasnoff, Askenasy, &amp; Dohrenwend, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764011429181">Holmes &amp; Rahe, 1967</xref>). Many studies have found the negative effects of widowhood to be even greater than the negative effects of getting divorced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764011429181">Farnsworth, Pett, &amp; Lund, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764011429181">Gove &amp; Shin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764011429181">Kitson, 2000</xref>). These negative effects can include a decrease in physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764011429181">Liu &amp; Umberson, 2008</xref>), increased morbidity and mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764011429181">Prigerson et al., 1997</xref>), and other negative psychological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0899764011429181">Turvey, Carney, Arndt, Wallace, &amp; Herzog, 1999</xref>). Being widowed completely alters a person’s life and daily routines, and the shock and sadness that accompany the death of a spouse can take a huge toll on a person.</p>
<p>After being widowed, a person has to readjust all of his or her daily routines and decisions and must compensate for the work being done by the departed spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764011429181">Carey, 1979-1980</xref>). This process of reconstructing a person’s life in the wake of losing a spouse can lead to many changes in a person’s behavior, especially social patterns and volunteering. Empirical research in this area has been rare and the results have been mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0899764011429181">Utz, Carr, Nesse, and Wortman (2002)</xref> compared people who lost a spouse with people who were married continuously over the same time period. They found that widowed persons increased their informal social activity following the loss of the spouse, but their formal activity level (including participation in volunteering) remained unchanged after the spouse passed away. Another study of widowed persons found that the death of spouse tends to decrease political participation and voting, but that this effect depends on the political participation of the spouse when he or she was still alive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764011429181">Stoker &amp; Jennings, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011429181">Musick and Wilson (2008)</xref> found that widows have a lower volunteering rate than people in other marital status brackets, including divorcees, those who have never been married, and married people. As widowhood is such a difficult and traumatic life experience, there is a reason to believe that widows will decrease their volunteering to have more mental and emotional space to grieve.</p>
<p>Conversely, being widowed can also increase time and opportunities for volunteering. A widow who spent several months or years caring for a dying spouse might now have much more available time for volunteering. Also, caregiving can be a springboard into later volunteering. In a study of effective hospice volunteers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764011429181">Caldwell and Scott (1994)</xref> found that one characteristic of effective volunteers was their personal motivation to serve because of the death of a loved one. Similar to divorce, volunteering for those who have been widowed can be an important social outlet and an opportunity to help a person to seek meaning and companionship after being left alone. The social opportunities that volunteering presents might be particularly important for older widowed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764011429181">Okun &amp; Schultz, 2003</xref>). Volunteering can also help prevent depression and other negative psychological effects of a traumatic event (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764011429181">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2003</xref>). Therefore, being widowed can also potentially have positive effects on volunteering and the number of hours volunteered. Again, it is difficult to determine which will be the stronger effect overall, so fourth set of hypotheses does not posit a specific negative or positive effect of widowhood on volunteering and hours volunteered.</p>

<title>Data, Variables, and Method</title>
<p>I use two data sets to test these hypotheses. The first data set comes from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Philanthropy Module (Center on Philanthropy Panel Study [COPPS]), commissioned by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. The COPPS data are collected every other year by the Survey Research Center at the Institute for Social Research, located at the University of Michigan. In 1968, the study commenced with a survey of 4,800 households and all the individual s in those households, and the PSID has continued to track these individuals, their spouses, children and cohabitors through the years, even as they split off to form new families. Beginning in 2001, the PSID included a philanthropy module that asks questions about giving, volunteering, and religious behavior. The analysis in this article uses data from the 2005 wave of the COPPS data with a few variables pulled in from the 2003 wave. The 2003 COPPS data cover volunteering done from January 2002 to December 2002, and the 2005 COPPS data report on volunteering done between January 2004 and December 2004. The volunteering information in the COPPS data only pertains to household heads and their spouses, which represents a little more than 11,000 people.</p>
<p>The second data set is the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) September Volunteering Supplement. The CPS is collected monthly by the Census Bureau and is primarily designed to gather information about employment in the United States. In many months, the CPS questionnaire includes questions on a variety of other topics. Since 2002, the September supplement of the CPS has included questions on the incidence and intensity of volunteering. For the analysis in this article, I use the 2005 September CPS data to more closely correspond with the 2005 COPPS data. The 2005 CPS covers volunteering done from September 2004 to September 2005. The CPS collects volunteering information from all adult household members ages 15 and above. Approximately 90,000 people are asked the volunteering questions each year.</p>
<p>The rationale for using two data sets for the analysis in this article is that neither data set will allow me to test all of the hypotheses simultaneously. I use the COPPS data to test the first set of hypotheses (recently having a child born), second set (recent divorce), and the third set of hypotheses (recent death in the family). As the COPPS data are longitudinal data, I can create variables representing whether any of these life events has happened since the previous wave of the study (between 2003 and 2005). This allows me to directly test the immediate, short-term effect of these life events on volunteering. (The nature of the COPPS data does mean that some recent events might not be captured in the data. If an important life event occurred shortly before the individual was surveyed in 2003, it will not be captured as a recent event in the 2005 data, even though the event was still fairly recent. This is not likely to apply to many individuals in the data set, however, so it should not have a strong effect on the results.)</p>
<p>I cannot use the COPPS data to adequately explore the influence of being widowed on volunteering, because there were so few widows in the COPPS data. Therefore, I use the CPS data to test the hypotheses about being widowed. Although the CPS data do not allow me to sort out those who have been recently widowed or to compare their volunteering from one wave with another, the CPS data do allow for closer subgroup analysis of older and younger widows because of its much larger, overall sample size. As the CPS are not longitudinal data, I can only test the whether the status of widowhood is related to volunteering, but I cannot test for the short-term effect of widowhood on volunteering.</p>
<sec id="section5-0899764011429181">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>There are two primary dependent variables used in this analysis. The first dependent variable is a binary measure of whether the person volunteered during the previous year. Both the COPPS and the CPS questionnaires include a question asking about volunteering done during the previous year. Volunteers are coded as 1 on this binary variable. The second dependent variable is the log of hours volunteered during the previous year. The COPPS and the CPS studies collect this information in slightly different ways, but in each data set the number of hours volunteered across all organizations during the previous year can easily be computed. The COPPS survey asks people about volunteering done for seven specific types of organizations—religious, youth, senior, health, organizations for people in need of basic necessities, social organizations and other. Then respondents are asked to indicate how often they volunteered for each type of organization and how many hours they spent volunteering for each type of organization. The hours volunteered were summed across the seven different types of organizations to create the hours volunteered variable. In the CPS data, respondents are asked to list all of the organizations that they volunteered for and then to classify the organization into one of 17 categories—religious, youth, health, animals, and the like. Respondents then indicate how often they volunteered for each organization and the number of hours spent volunteering for each type of organization. The hours spent volunteering for each organization were summed to create the total hours volunteered variable in the CPS data set.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0899764011429181">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The first set of independent variables used in the COPPS data are the life event dummy variables. The first variable is a dummy variable representing whether a child was born to both the head and the head’s spouse since the 2003 wave (<italic>child born</italic> = 1, <italic>no child born</italic> = 0). The second is another dummy variable indicating whether the person has gone through a divorce since the 2003 wave (<italic>divorced since 2003</italic> = 1, <italic>not divorced since 2003</italic> = 0). This variable was based on a question in the COPPS data that asks about changes in the household head’s marital status since the previous wave of data collection. The regression models also include an interaction term for divorced men, an interaction term for divorced and the number of children living in the home, and a three-way interaction between being divorced, male, and the number of children in the home. The final life event variable is another dummy variable capturing whether there has been a death in the family since 2003 (<italic>death in the family since 2003</italic> = 1, <italic>no death in the family since 2003</italic> = 0), not including the death of either the household head or the head’s spouse. This variable represents the death of another family member—either a child or another adult living in the household. The models also include an interaction term of a recent death in the family and the male dummy variable.</p>
<p>The life event variables in the regression models involving the CPS data (which is used to test the widowhood hypotheses) include a dummy variable for being widowed. The CPS contains a variable about the respondent’s marital status, and all those who indicated that they were widowed were coded as 1 on this dummy variable. (It is important to note that there is no information in the CPS about the length of time since being widowed, so this is a status rather than an event variable.) To more fully test the widowhood hypotheses, the regression models also include four interaction terms. The first is the interaction between age and widowed status, and the second is the interaction between age squared and widowed status. The third interaction is the male dummy variable and widowed status, and the fourth is the widowed dummy variable multiplied by the number of children in the household.</p>
<p>The control variables include a variable capturing whether the person volunteered in the 2003 wave (coded as 1 for volunteers, and 0 otherwise; only in the COPPS data). The other independent control variables in this analysis capture both individual and household demographic information. The first variable is a dummy variable indicating whether the person is male (<italic>male</italic> = 1, <italic>female</italic> = 0). The second variable is the respondent’s age at the time of the survey. I also include a variable that is the age variable squared to allow for possible nonlinearities in the relationship between age and volunteering. Next, the analysis also includes a dummy variable indicating whether the person is White (<italic>White</italic> = 1, <italic>other races</italic> = 0). Another dummy variable captures whether the person is employed full-time (<italic>employed</italic> = 1, <italic>not employed</italic> = 0). The model also includes the number of years of school that the person has completed.</p>
<p>The first household characteristic variable is the log of household income during the previous year. Next, I include a dummy variable for whether the person is married and living with his or her spouse (<italic>married</italic> = 1, <italic>not married</italic> = 0). The number of children under the age of 18 in the household is also included along with a dummy variable indicating whether there are preschool children (below the age of 5) in the home (<italic>presence of preschoolers</italic> = 1, <italic>no preschoolers</italic> = 0). Finally, the last household variable is a dummy variable indicating whether the family owns their home (<italic>owns home</italic> = 1, <italic>rents or other</italic> = 0).</p>
<p>There are a few differences between the variables used in the analysis with the CPS data compared with the analysis with the COPPS data because of data constraints. The CPS analysis does not include the child born and death in the family life event dummy variables, because they are not included in the CPS questionnaire. Pertaining to life events, the CPS models also include a dummy variable indicating whether the person is divorced (coded as 1), and another dummy variable indicating whether the person is separated (coded as 1). With the inclusion of the married dummy variable, the excluded marital status category in this case is people who are single and have never married. This will allow me to make comparisons between persons who are divorced and persons who are widowed relative to other single people. The only other difference between the variables used in the CPS and the COPPS analysis is that the CPS has no measure of volunteering in a previous wave, because the CPS are not longitudinal data.</p>

<sec id="section7-0899764011429181">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To look at the impact of life events on a person’s choice to volunteer during the previous year (a binary variable), I use logit regression and report the percentage change in the odds. For the second dependent variable—the hours volunteered during the previous year—I use Tobit regression, because the data are censored at 0 hr volunteered. (I also endeavored to use a Heckman selection model in parallel with the Tobit model. However, there was no plausible identification for the model, because theoretically all of the variables were necessary in both stages of the model. Thus, the Tobit results are to be preferred.)</p>
<p>Tobit coefficients are not readily interpretable (except for the sign) like OLS coefficients are: They do not represent the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The underlying structure of the Tobit model contains two separate equations—one for nonzero values of the dependent variable and one for the censored (or zero) values of the dependent variable. Thus, the Tobit coefficients combine these two effects—the effect of independent variable on the probability of having a nonzero value of the dependent variable, and the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable for those nonzero cases. For this reason, in the following analysis, I present three marginal effects for the Tobit models: (a) the change in the unconditional expected value of the latent dependent variable, (b) the change in the expected value of the dependent variable, conditional on the observation being uncensored (i.e., the change in the hours volunteered for those that volunteer), and (c) the change in the probability that an observation is uncensored (i.e., the probability that a person volunteers). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764011429181">McDonald and Moffitt (1980)</xref> have shown that these three marginal effects are related in a systematic way: the change in the unconditional expected value (a) is equal to the sum of the expected value conditional on being uncensored, (b) weighted by the probability of being uncensored and the uncensored probability, and (c) weighted by the conditional expected value (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764011429181">Roncek, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764011429181">Cong, 2000</xref> shows the decomposition for dummy variables.) The analysis is repeated separately for volunteering done for religious organizations and volunteering done for secular organizations.</p>

<p>The demographic profiles in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0899764011429181">Table 1</xref> follow the patterns that we would expect based on the volunteering literature. Volunteers in both of these samples are more likely to be women than men. In the COPPS data, volunteers are 42% men compared with 46% of nonvolunteers who are men. In the CPS data, 41% of volunteers are men compared with 50% of nonvolunteers. The mean age for both volunteers and nonvolunteers are approximately the same in both data sets. Volunteers are also more likely to be White—73% of COPPS volunteers and 88% of CPS volunteers. A higher percentage of volunteers is employed than nonvolunteers—78% versus 71% in COPPS and 68% versus 60% in CPS. Volunteers also come from households with higher incomes—the average income for volunteers in the COPPS data are approximately US$26,000 higher than the average income for nonvolunteers, and the income difference in the CPS data between these two groups is US$17,000. A higher percentage of volunteers is married (75% in COPPS and 63% in CPS) than their counterpart nonvolunteers (65% married in COPPS and 50% married in CPS). Volunteers and nonvolunteers in the COPPS data are not significantly different in terms of the number of children they have, but in the CPS data, volunteer households have more children on average (.7 in volunteer households vs. .4 in nonvolunteer households). In the COPPS data, a lower percentage of volunteers came from households with preschool children (20%) than nonvolunteers (24%), but there is very little difference in the CPS data in terms of the percentage of volunteers and nonvolunteers living in households with preschoolers. Volunteers also generally own their own homes. Also, 57% of volunteers in 2005 also reported volunteering in the 2003 wave compared with 14% of nonvolunteers in the 2005 wave who said they volunteered in 2003.</p>
<p>The results from the logit and Tobit regressions for the COPPS data are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011429181">Table 2</xref>. The first two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011429181">Table 2</xref> show the percentage change in the odds for the logit regressions run using the binary dependent variable of whether the person volunteered during the previous year. The first column shows the results for religious organizations and the second column shows the regression results for secular volunteering. The last six columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011429181">Table 2</xref> show the three marginal effects for the Tobit regressions using the hours volunteered during the previous year as the dependent variable. The first marginal effect is the change in the expected value of volunteering. The second two marginal effects are the change in hours volunteered and the change in the probability of volunteering, and they are directly interpretable as such. For instance, the last two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011429181">Table 2</xref> show that having a child born decreases the hours volunteered for secular organizations by 18.45 hr and decreases the probability of volunteering for a secular organization by .05. Again, the results are broken down into volunteer hours for religious organizations and secular organizations.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis is that having a child born into the family will decrease volunteering. This hypothesis is supported by the data. Having a child born into the family decreased the odds of a person volunteering for both secular (−46.4%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and religious organizations (−31.9%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In the Tobit models, having a child born decreased the probability of volunteering for both religious and secular organizations. Hypothesis 1a is also supported in the Tobit regression. Having a child born into the family also decreased the number of hours volunteered for both religious (−9.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and secular organizations (−18.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Thus, the first hypothesis that having a child born will decrease the probability of volunteering is robust across all of our models for both religious and secular volunteering. There is also evidence that having a child born decreases the number of hours volunteered.</p>
<p>The second set of hypotheses pertains to the impact of divorce on volunteering. Hypotheses 2 and 2a receive no support from the data. The divorced dummy variable was not statistically significant in any of the regressions. However, Hypothesis 2b is partially supported—being a divorced man was positively related to the probability of volunteering in the logit model for secular organizations (131.4%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and in the Tobit secular volunteering regression (ΔProb = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and ΔHours = 35.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Therefore, there is some evidence that divorced men increase their volunteering. The divorced/number of children interaction term was a statistically significant predictor of volunteering in the Tobit regression for secular organizations; the divorced person’s probability of volunteering and volunteering hours increased with the number of children in the home. Thus, there is partial support for Hypothesis 2c. Interestingly, in the Tobit models, being a divorced man with children was negatively related to the probability of volunteering (−.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and hours volunteered (−31.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>
<p>The third set of hypotheses is that having a death in the family (other than the household head or spouse) will influence volunteering and that this effect will be gendered. These hypotheses are not supported by the data. Neither was the death in the family dummy variable statistically significant in any of the regressions, nor was the interaction term.</p>
<p>The CPS data are used to test the fourth set of hypotheses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0899764011429181">Table 3</xref> shows the regression results using the CPS data. These tables mirror the information presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0899764011429181">Table 2</xref> with the addition of the widowed dummy variable and the widowed × age interaction term and the exclusion of the variable about volunteering done in 2003.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4 states that being widowed will influence the volunteering decision. In the logit regressions, widowed persons were more likely to volunteer for both religious (−97%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and secular organizations (−97.3%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In the Tobit regressions, the widowed dummy variable was not statistically significant in relationship to religious organizations, but being widowed decreased the number of hours volunteered (−86.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Overall, the data provide mixed support for a negative effect of widowhood on volunteering and hours volunteered.</p>

<p>The data provide mixed evidence, but, generally, support Hypothesis 4a that the influence of widowhood on volunteering will vary by age. In general, the results show that older widows are more likely to volunteer for both religious and secular organizations and volunteer more hours overall for secular organizations. However, the results were still mixed with none of the age interaction terms being statistically significant in the religious volunteering Tobit models. The oldest widows (modeled by the age squared × widowed interaction term) were slightly less likely to volunteer and they decreased their volunteering hours by a small amount. Hypotheses 4b and 4c were not supported in the data. The gender interaction term and number of children interaction terms were not statistically significant in any of the regressions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article contributes to our understanding of volunteering behavior by helping us to understand how changes, especially major changes, in the structure and composition of families and households affect volunteering done by family members. Major life events such as having a child born into the family, going through a divorce or being widowed, or having another family member die, can have a major impact on a person’s daily activities. These events might also alter a person’s motivations to volunteer. This article builds on previous research looking at the influence of major life events on volunteering. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011429181">Bandy and Wilhelm (2007)</xref> found that certain major events in childhood, specifically growing up in a low-income household and growing up in a household with a birth mother only (as opposed to two parents), were negatively associated with volunteering done by the children in young adulthood.</p>
<p>In this article, I find that having a child born recently into the family has a negative impact on volunteering and hours volunteered. This effect is above and beyond the normal negative impact of having preschool children at home. Really young children require a great deal of time and attention, and these time constraints make it difficult for parents to volunteer. A newborn baby is even more dependent on the parents and disrupts the normal family routines and sleeping patterns and forces families into an adjustment period after the birth of an infant. It appears that this adjustment period corresponds with a decrease in volunteering and the hours volunteered.</p>
<p>The results about the relationship between divorce and volunteering were mixed. The recent event of divorce by itself was not related to volunteering or hours volunteered. However, there is some evidence that divorced men are more likely to volunteer and increase their volunteering hours. Previous research has discussed how men need “specific hooks” to induce them to volunteer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764011429181">Einolf, 2010</xref>), and it appears that the major life change of divorce can serve that purpose. Divorcees with children in the household are also more likely to volunteer and increase their volunteering hours. Thus, gender and the presence of children in the home are important pathways to volunteering for divorced individuals. The effect of children in the home on the volunteering of divorced individuals makes sense, because research has shown that children are an important pathway to volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764011429181">Carlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011429181">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). The effect of gender on the volunteering of divorced individuals is more difficult to puzzle out. It could indicate different pathways that a person can take after a divorce, depending on a person’s emotional and mental health, employment situation, family situation, and social networks. For instance, social networks are related to adjustment patterns after a divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764011429181">Duffy &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>). Having a strong social network not only helps divorcees to adjustment positively to divorce, but these relationships can also serve to prevent symptoms of maladjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764011429181">Krumrel, Colt, Martin, Fogo, &amp; Mahoney, 2007</xref>). Social networks are also strongly linked with volunteering. Previous research has shown that a person’s social networks matter a great deal in the decision to volunteer because people will volunteer to help or please a friend or acquaintance or to benefit a family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764011429181">Nichols &amp; King, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764011429181">Sundeen &amp; Raskoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0899764011429181">Wymer, 1997</xref>). As social networks shift after a divorce, volunteering can shift too. More research will be needed to fully explore these results and to determine why divorced men are more likely to volunteer than divorced women.</p>
<p>The findings related to widowhood and volunteering were also mixed. Overall, it appears that being widowed decreases the likelihood of volunteering and volunteering hours, although older widows tend to increase the volunteering activities. Volunteering can potentially help the grieving and adjustment process after being widowed, and it appears to be particularly important for older widows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764011429181">Musick and Wilson (2003)</xref> found that volunteering helped to lower the depression rates of people above the age of 65, because their volunteering helped them to feel more socially integrated. Volunteers have been shown to be happier, more satisfied with their lives, to have increased self-esteems, and to generally score higher on measures of well-being than nonvolunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764011429181">Thoits &amp; Hewitt, 2001</xref>). In addition to these mental and emotional health benefits, volunteers also experience positive physical health benefits from their volunteer work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764011429181">Sherraden &amp; Eberly, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0899764011429181">Wilson &amp; Musick, 1999</xref>). It is possible that widows are seeking many of these positive benefits of volunteering after the death of their spouse. The effect of widowhood on volunteering also needs to be explored more in future research, especially because the CPS data only allow for testing the status of widowhood rather than the effect. Other factors that might affect the relationship between widowhood and volunteering are the age when the person loses his or her spouse, the number of years since being widowed, the volunteering and activity level of the spouse who has passed away, the nature of the relationship between the two individuals, and the kinds of volunteer work being done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764011429181">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The death of a nonspousal family member had no effect on volunteering in any of the models run using the COPPS data (and cannot be replicated with the CPS data). It appears that the potential positive and negative effects cancel each other out. Persons who have experienced a nonspousal death in the family might be returning to work or increasing the number of hours that they spend working because of previous major life adjustments to provide care for an ill family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764011429181">Covinsky et al., 1994</xref>). One possible explanation for the lack of effects in these models is that they only test for the immediate effects of recently losing a family member. As more time passes, the person might seek out more volunteering behaviors. Hospice volunteers frequently come from a background of having lost a family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764011429181">Caldwell &amp; Scott, 1994</xref>), but perhaps the effect occurs later in life. Further research is needed to discover under what circumstances, if any, a death in the family might increase later volunteering.</p>
<p>Past research has begun to shed light on other important life events that influence volunteering behaviors. For instance, retirement or a major change in health status has been shown to affect volunteering patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764011429181">Komp, van Tilburg, &amp; van Groenou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764011429181">Smith, 2004</xref>). Further exploration of this topic is critical because of the aging of the Baby Boomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764011429181">Einolf, 2009</xref>). Changes in employment mark another important life change that affects volunteering. The participation of women in the workforce has decreased their volunteer work, especially because fewer women devote themselves full-time to being a homemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764011429181">Rotolo &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764011429181">Tiehen, 2000</xref>). Changes in employment, such as entering or leaving the workforce, changing employers, or getting a promotion to a high-level managerial position, are also important life events that need to be explored further.</p>
<p>Overall, the main message of this article is that some life events change volunteering behaviors more than other life events do. The birth of a child decreases volunteering. Divorced men and divorcees with children increase their volunteering. Older widows tend to increase their volunteering, and death of a nonspousal family member does not affect volunteering. This article helps to further our knowledge about how life events influence volunteering. Future research can continue this line of inquiry by determining how the length of time after a life event is related to volunteering. Other inquiries can be made into the varied ways that people respond to a divorce or death in the family, and which of those pathways might lead toward more volunteering or might decrease a person’s volunteering.</p>
