<abstract>
<p>Because of the successful construction and operation of the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line, the longitudinally coupled prefabricated slab track (LCPBT) system has shown its outstanding advantages in both mechanical and structural aspects. With a design speed of 350 km/h, the LCPBT system was also used on the 595.62-m-long, double-track LeiDa Bridge on the Wuhan–Guangzhou passenger dedicated line (PDL) in China.</p>
<p>To equably transfer longitudinal force from the coupled concrete base to the subbase by friction, a reinforced concrete rub-plate was placed in transition zones from bridges to the subgrade. A 100-m-long, 0.4-m-thick rub-plate was built at the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line, whereas a 50-m-long rub-plate was used at the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL. This article established an integral finite element model of jointless turnout (crossover)-track slab-bridge-pier taking the LCPBT system on LeiDa Bridge as an example, and researched the proper setting length of the rub-plate in this structure. Calculation conclusions and suggestions were given: the 100-m-long rub-plate used on the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line can be shortened; a length of 50–75 m will be appropriate as the case may be; in specific circumstances, it can be designed within the range 25–50 m.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711420776"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Railway plays a significant role in the development of a country and is a crucial transportation instrument. In recent years, many countries have widely built or planed many high-speed railway lines in order to strengthen their foundation for future economic upswing, such as Germany, Holland, France, Korea, Japan, China, USA, etc. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420776">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711420776">2</xref></bold>]. Slab track is characterized by its high stability, availability, reliability, and low maintenance-associated costs, which reveals that it is a future developing trend for high-speed railways [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711420776">3</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711420776">5</xref></bold>]. Although slab track has been used for several decades, new issues faced in practice are still unsolved. A typical example is the design method and the construction technology of turnout in slab-track-structure on bridge, which is currently lacking thorough studies, while limited practical experiences is on hand today around the world.</p>
<p>By the end of 2010, China will expect to complete the construction of 9200 km high-speed passenger dedicated lines (PDLs) on which the slab track technology will be applied. Most of them are about to be put into operation. Due to the railway line plane andprofile high requirements, bridges and tunnels will account for a great proportion of railway lines. Bridges’ length amounts to appreciably 54 per cent of the total length on the planned PDLs. For instance, more than 30 large-span bridges will be built under slab track turnouts on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway line. This results in an inevitable application of slab track in jointless turnout zones on bridges.</p>
<p>The design of slab track for bridges turnout zones adds to the technical difficulties of bridge slab track the complicated interaction between turnout and its supporting base (due to the displacement limitation) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711420776">6</xref></bold>]. Since many projects of bridge jointless turnouts using slab track technology will be laid on Chinese PDLs, there is a need for more research on this specific topic [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711420776">7</xref></bold>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409711420776"><title>2 ENGINEERING CASE</title>
<p>Because of the successful construction and operation of the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line, the longitudinally coupled prefabricated slab track (LCPBT) system has shown outstanding advantages in both mechanical and structural aspects, such as preferable continuity or integrity; relatively isolated longitudinal displacements and high construction efficiency. With a design speed of 350 km/h, the LCPBT system was also used on the 595.62-m-long, double-track LeiDa Bridge on Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL in China. This line was opened at the end of 2009 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711420776">8</xref></bold>]. Consequently, it is more and more widely applied on high-speed railways and PDLs in China. This article introduces the use of a longitudinally coupled slab track system for bridge transition zones by building a theoretical model. This study also explores the proper setting length of rub-plate in this structure. The rub-plate is a reinforced concrete plate and is designed to be placed beyond the bridge range in the transition zones from bridges to the subgrade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>). The objective of setting the rub-plate is to equably transfer longitudinal force from the coupled concrete base to the subbase by friction.
<fig id="fig1-0954409711420776" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Longitudinal cross-section of model for LCPBT on LeiDa bridge on Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL (with arrangements of bridge spans and turnout location)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420776-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The main components of the LCPBT system include: prefabricated slabs (also known as turnout slabs), the concrete base, cement asphalt mortar (CA mortar), a sliding layer; the rub-plate, anchor points, and terminal spines [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711420776">9</xref></bold>]. The terminal spine is a reinforced concrete mass embedded in the subgrade at the end of the rub-plate. The objective of setting the terminal spines balances residual longitudinal force induced from the concrete base.</p>
<p>In this system, the concrete base is completely coupled in the longitudinal direction, and it extends to the rub-plate on subgrade to connect to the terminal spine. It is, however, separated from the track superstructure on the bridge by a sliding layer comprised of one geo-textile layer and a film. The sliding layer instead of rail expansion joints minimizes the interaction between bridge’s beams and track superstructure and the amount of friction that arises from their relative movement, and ensures likewise that these two layers of the structure are able to expand and contract independently. In addition, an anchor point in the bridge superstructure above every fixed support is expected to bear the loads caused during the event of trains braking on the bridge superstructure. A hard foam board above every bridge structure joints is placed between bridge protection layer and the continuous concrete base, to weaken detrimental fastening pulling force in case of great rotation angle or displacement.</p>
<p>A 100-m-long, 0.4-m-thick rub-plate was built on the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line, whereas a 50-m-long rub-plate was used on the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL. Considering the force interaction rule, a longer rub-plate is preferable, as the longitudinal force of the subgrade slab is less with more friction working on the rub-plate. However, setting a too long rub-plate is unfavourable for the structural design, the construction progress, and the engineering cost. Therefore, it is necessary to research the proper setting length of the rub-plate for guiding the engineering design and construction.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409711420776"><title>3 STRUCTURAL INTEGRAL MODEL</title>
<p>Displacements will occur in bridge decks, track slabs (i.e. prefabricated slabs and concrete bases), and rails (or turnouts) as temperature changes, which leads to longitudinal interactions among the three parts. Besides, stock rails, switch rail, prefabricated concrete slabs (or turnout slab), concrete bases, bridge decks, and piers are coupled with restriction components, such as fastener systems, CA mortar, position-limited devices, spacer blocks, anchor points in the bridge superstructure, fixed bridge supports, etc. To determine the forces and displacements of each part, turnouts, track slab, bridge deck, and piers were taken into account as a coupled system [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711420776">10</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Two no. 18 jointless turnouts with movable frog in crossover form were laid on the Leida Bridge, on the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL. Based on the mechanical characteristics of the coupled system, we developed a finite element model (FEM) for the turnout-track slab-bridge deck-pier integrated system, to figure out the longitudinal forces exerted on the components in the system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>. Due to the space limitation of the page layout, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref> is divided as two parts from left to right.</p>
<p>The model is comprised of 600-m-long bridges, two rub-plates with variable length, and two 50-m-long subgrade segments on both sides of the bridges. The design of the LeiDa Bridge spans consists of one 24-m simple supported beam (SSB), two 32-m SSBs, one continuous beam (CB) of 40+64+40 m, and five 32-m SSB plus one CB of 6 × 32 m. The signs of no. 0–no. 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref> represent the fixed piers of bridge. There is an anchor point above every fixed bridge pier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>) numbered from no. 0 to no. 9 in this article, too. According to the design principle of jointless turnout on bridge, we laid this crossover on the CB of 6 × 32 m and put its centre above the fixed support in the middle of bridge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420776">Figure 2</xref> represents the schematic top view of the turnout–turnout plates-bridge system, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711420776">Fig. 3</xref> shows the cross-section graph of a double track railway (a) on the main tangent track and (b) in the turnout zone, respectively.

<p>Some assumptions were made for the model [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711420776">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711420776">8</xref></bold>]. First of all, CA mortar has a regular bond behaviour, so that the prefabricated slabs and the concrete base can deform in synchrony. The two layers can therefore be simplified into one layer, namely a combined track slab. Thus, the combination of prefabricated slab, CA mortar, and the concrete base in the FEM can be simplified as track slab, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711420776">Fig. 4</xref>. Second, the rails, track slab and bridge are all simulated as beam elements with different parameters; both the fastener system and the sliding layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>) are simulated as non-linear springs. Besides, both the position-limited devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420776">Fig. 2</xref>) at switch heels, as well as the spacer blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420776">Fig. 2</xref>) between wing rails and short (or long) point rails are simulated as non-linear springs. Last but not least, the anchor points, piers, and terminal spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>) are all assumed to be linear springs; and the longitudinal stiffness of both the anchor points and the terminal spines are presumed to be infinite.
<fig id="fig4-0954409711420776" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The simplification of combination of track layers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420776-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The model uses rail of ‘CHN 60kg/m’ (Chinese rail type) and rail fastener of ‘Vossloh loarv 300’ (German fastener type) with clip type SKL 15. The fasteners have a slip resistance of 30 kN/m (unloaded) or 60 kN/m (loaded) after a displacement of 0.5 mm, which is determined according to DS 804 (German code). The 20-cm-thick, 2.55-m-wide prefabricated slabs are made of Concrete C50, whereas the 18-cm-thick concrete base is from concrete grade C40. The 24-cm-thick single turnout slabs from concrete grade C50 have variable lengths which do not exceed 6.5 m with widths between 2.55 and 3.90 m. The track dead weight per unit length multiplied by friction coefficient of rub-plate makes the slip resistance of rub-plate. The friction coefficient of rub-plate is designed as 0.2–0.3, and we use 0.3 as the friction coefficient in the FEM.</p>
<p>With the objective of evaluating the impact of temperature change on the model outputs, the temperatures of rails, track slabs, and bridges are reduced by 50, 30, and 20°C, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954409711420776"><title>4.1 Stock rail longitudinal forces and displacements</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711420776">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420776">6</xref> show the longitudinal force and displacement of straight stock rail under temperature change in the system for different rub-plate lengths.
<fig id="fig5-0954409711420776" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Longitudinal forces of stock rails</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420776-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig6-0954409711420776" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Longitudinal displacements of straight stock rails</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420776-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Calculation results of the longitudinal forces of stock rail showed that with different rub-plate lengths, the distribution rule of longitudinal forces of straight stock rail remains practically unchanged, and the place where the peak value of the longitudinal forces appears same. We can also see that the peak value of the longitudinal forces for stock rail appears at position-limited devices at switch heels while the rub-plate length ranged from 25 to 150 m; and the value keeps between 1004.0 and 1005.5 kN, where we can also find that the variation value stayed within the range of 0.15 per cent. Moreover, all the minimum values appeared at the front of the crossing nose, the value ranging from 910.8 to 911.9 kN.</p>
<p>Calculation results of the longitudinal displacements of stock rail showed that the variation trend of longitudinal displacements for stock rail did not change despite different rub-plate lengths. With the rub-plate length increased from 25 to 150 m, the right-shift peak value of stock rail appears entirely at switch heels above the CB of the bridge; the value ranged from 1.6 to 1.7 mm. Consequently, we can conclude that changes of the rub-plate length over 25 m almost had little influence on the longitudinal forces and displacements of the straight stock rail because of temperature action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954409711420776"><title>4.2 Longitudinal forces of turnout’s force-transferring components</title>
<p>This article studied the influence of rub-plate length on the longitudinal forces of position-limited devices at switch heels and of the spacer block at the rear end of wing rails. Given that other parameters remained unchanged and the rub-plates are designed at lengths of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 m, respectively, calculationresults of forces for position-limited devices andspacer blocks were compiled, and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409711420776">Table 1</xref>. This table shows that longitudinal forces of the position-limited devices at switch heels and the spacer blocks at rear end of wing rail remained practically unchanged under different rub-plate lengths. Longitudinal forces of position-limited devices are varied over a range on the order of 72.9 to 73.7 kN, with those of spacer blocks from 209.0 to 209.4 kN. Therefore, it can be seen that the rub-plate length has little influence on force of turnout’s components.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711420776">Table 2</xref> lists the influence of rub-plate length on rail displacements at switch point and crossing nose. For an increase of rub-plate length from 25 to 150 m, rail displacements at switch point and crossing nose ranged from 20.9 to 21.0 mm. Relative displacements between the track slab and the rail at switch points varied from 19.6 to 19.7 mm. With rail displacements at crossing nose varying from 9.0 to 9.1 mm, the relative displacements between the track slab and the rail remained 8 mm within the changing scope of 0.1 mm. At the same time, the direction of their displacements was the same as the extension direction of the stock rail as a result of temperature decreases. Consequently, we can conclude that the influence of rub-plate length on the rail displacements at switch point and crossing nose as well as the slab–rail relative displacements is negligible.

<p>Based on the above analysis, we can see that the length of the rub-plate has no great effect on the longitudinal forces and displacements of the track slab. Consequently, the influence of rub-plate length on the track slab can be neglected.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954409711420776"><title>4.5 Longitudinal forces of bridge piers</title>
<p>The influence of rub-plate length on the longitudinal forces of bridge piers was studied. The resulting rule of longitudinal forces of bridge piers is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420776">Fig. 9</xref>. With other parameters staying the same, and with rub-plate lengths varying over 50 m, the rub-plate length has little effect on longitudinal forces of fixed bridge piers. Particularly, the variations of longitudinal forces of no. 0–no. 8 fixed bridge piers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420776">Fig. 2</xref>) did not exceed 8 per cent. Longitudinal forces of the fixed bridge pier of CB bridge (no. 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420776">Fig. 2</xref>) change significantly where the turnout was placed. The 25 m rub-plate had greater effect on longitudinal force of bridge piers in comparison with the other lengths. A visible example is that the longitudinal force of no. 9 bridge pier with the 25 m rub-plate increased particularly from −87.8 to −126.2 kN, which was 1.5 times larger than that the 50 m rub-plate. We can also see that the longitudinal force of no. 9 bridge pier with the25 m rub-plate is almost 2.3 times larger than the forcewith the 150 m rub-plate with −54.6 kN. Consequently, considering the forces of bridge piers, it is favourable to increase the rub-plate lengths. The recommended rub-plate length is 50 m and above.

<sec id="sec10-0954409711420776"><title>4.6 Longitudinal forces of anchor points</title>
<p>Other parameters kept the same, the influence of rub-plate length on anchor points between longitudinally coupled subbase and bridges is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420776">Fig. 10</xref>, showing that the rub-plate length has little effect on anchor points’ forces. The changing rule of the shear force for anchor points maintained consistency, with its peak value above no. 9 bridge, namely in the midspan of this CB bridge. With the rub-plate length increasing from 25 to 150 m, the forces of no. 9 anchor point were,respectively, −905.7, −920.2, −928.2, −932.3, and −934.8 kN. Consequently, the shearing force of anchor points changed, but the value of this change stayed very small, not exceeding 4 per cent.

<sec id="sec11-0954409711420776"><title>4.7 Longitudinal forces of terminal spines</title>
<p>We also investigated the longitudinal forces of terminal spines at both sides of transition areas between the bridge and the subgrade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420776">Fig. 1</xref>). Given different rub-plate lengths, the calculation results of forces are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954409711420776">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that for longer rub-plates, there are less longitudinal forces in the terminal spines. The changing value was somewhat large. Force of terminal spines with the 25 m rub-plate was 684.7 kN, while the 150 m was 101.9 kN. The main reason for this change is that the rub-plate playing a part in supporting partial longitudinal force instead of terminal spines equably transfers longitudinal force from the coupled concrete base to the subbase by friction. A longer rub-plate can support more longitudinal forces, which is beneficial to the force of terminal spines. Consequently, a longer rub-plate is better as far as the force of terminal spines is concerned.

<p>Based on the above analysis, we can therefore conclude that the rub-plate length had a little effect on the longitudinal force and displacement of the stock rail, the displacements of switch rail and switch point, the force and displacement of the track slab as well as forces of turnout’s force-transferring components and anchor points, but the effect on forces of bridge piers and terminal spines was relatively great. The longer the rub-plate was, the more beneficial it was to forces of bridge piers and terminal spines. The reason for the little effect results from the limited amount of transferred longitudinal force due to the friction between bridge’s beams and track superstructure (as a result of the little friction coefficient: 0.2–0.3). Most of the longitudinal force of the track superstructure is actually borne by the terminal spines on both ends of the subgrade. Therefore, in this respect, the objective of transferring longitudinal force from the track superstructure to the subbase by setting a rub-plate does not seem very effective.</p>
<p>Besides, from the point of view of construction costs, it is not suitable for paving too long rub-plates, therefore factors of various aspects should be taken into consideration to determine rub-plate length. From the design and the force calculation of terminal spine [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711420776">11</xref></bold>], we come to a conclusion that the terminal spine can bear a longitudinal force of <italic>ca</italic>. 5000 kN. All the forces of terminal spines with different rub-plate lengths do not exceed 1000 kN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954409711420776">Table 3</xref>). Consequently, this article holds the view that the rub-plate over the length of 25 m can meet the requirements from both aspects of forces and construction costs of bridge piers and terminal spines. Thus, the length of the rub-plate can be shortened appropriately on basis of the 100-m-long rub-plate arranged on the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line under different engineering considerations explained earlier. For example, rub-plate can be designed within the scope of 50–75 m. In specific circumstances, it can be designed within the range 25–50 m. Calculation results from the LCPBT system on the LeiDa bridge on the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420776">Fig. 11</xref>) also showed that a 50-m-long rub-plate can completely meet the requirements of force and deformation of the system.

<sec id="sec12-0954409711420776"><title>5 VALIDATION OF THE FEM</title>
<p>In order to validate the correctness of the analysis method and the FEM, we carried out a field test inMOE Key Laboratory of High-speed Railway Engineering of Southwest Jiaotong University (Chengdu, China), which is an economical solution by simplifying the practical engineering work. The field test is planned to use an optimal scale model of 1:3 based on the similarity theory and the actual site size for this test. A no. 18 jointless turnout on the longitudinally prefabricated slab track was laid on a three-span bridge in the test. The 42.1-m-long test site consists of a CB bridge with the length of 10.7 × 3 m and two 5-m-long rub-plates as well as two terminals on both sides of the rub-plates, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420776">Fig. 12</xref> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711420776">12</xref></bold>].

<p>According to similarity proportion, the scale of rail model to proto-rail was calculated with result of 1/9, which implies a cross-section of 8.606 cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the 8 kg/m light rail was chosen and then was processed somewhat. Track slabs are produced as steel slabs with a thickness of 20 mm and a wideness from 1 to 2 m. Since the steel girder is accessible to be heated and its small section simplifies the weld of different steel girders together, we choose steel girder to build the test model of bridge.</p>
<p>In accordance with the test conditions, the temperatures of rails was increased to 50°C, and that of track slabs and bridge girders were both increased to 30°C,to assess the impact of temperature change on the model outputs. The comparison results of longitudinal force for stock and switch rails between the test measurement and the FEM result are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954409711420776">Figs 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954409711420776">14</xref>, in which positive results imply anextension force and <italic>vice versa</italic>.

<p>By comparing the results of model test and theoretical compute above, a remarkable conclusion can be drawn that the two results have similar change rules despite some certain diversities of their values, which primarily shows correctness of the FEM of turnout -track slab-bridge-pier. We can therefore perceive that the calculating model and method forLCPBT on the Leida Bridge, on the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL was considered to be reasonable.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0954409711420776"><title>6 CONCLUDING REMARKS</title>
<p>From the analysis of the whole LCPBT system on the LeiDa bridge on the Wuhan–Guangzhou PDL, the following conclusions are drawn:
<list id="list3-0954409711420776" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Different lengths of the rub-plate led to slight changes in longitudinal forces and displacements of the stock rail, turnout’s components, the track slab, rail displacements at switch point and crossing nose, as well as the longitudinal forces of anchor points.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whereas, forces of piers and terminal spines were obviously affected, a longer rub-plate meant a favourable force state.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The forces of bridge piers changed somewhat and those of terminal spines remain less than 1000 kN if the rub-plate is longer than 25 m. Hence, considering the forces of piers and terminal spines as well as the engineering cost as a whole, we regard the requirements of forces and displacements as satisfied, provided that the rub-plate is longer than 25 m.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Accordingly, we can make following recommendations about the proper rub-plate length:
<list id="list4-0954409711420776" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The 100-m-long rub-plate used on the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway line can be shortened.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A length ranging from 50 to 75 m will be appropriate as the case may be.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In unfavourable engineering cases, it could be kept within the range 25–50 m.</p></list-item>
