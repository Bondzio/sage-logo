<p>“Why do parents parent the way they do?” remains an important question since it concerns both scientific issues, such as the stability or change of childrearing behavior, and clinical issues, such as the way to promote positive parenting in evidence-based programs. Using an accelerated design, the aim of this study was to examine several parental and child predictors of childrearing behavior trajectories among 373 mothers and 356 fathers of 2- to 9-year-old children. Hypotheses were drawn from Belsky (1984) and subsequent studies of the determinants of parenting. The parental and child predictors were assessed and analyzed as time-varying (parental self-efficacy beliefs and child externalizing behavior) or time-invariant (parental educational level and personality traits) predictors, according to their conceptual properties. The results show a linear decrease in both supportive and controlling childrearing behavior in mothers and an improvement in supportive but a decrease in controlling childrearing behavior in fathers over time. Moreover, the results support the idea that childrearing behavior is determined by multiple factors, in particular the parents’ self-efficacy beliefs and the child’s behavior. Finally, the results confirm the hypothesis of a greater influence of child predictors than of parental ones in the case of mothers, while the reverse hypothesis of a greater predictive power of parental variables than of child ones is confirmed for fathers. The results are discussed both for research and clinical purposes.</p>

<p>“Why do parents parent the way they do?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>, p. 83) is not a new question but it remains an important one. Both the scientific and the clinical implications of this question are numerous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165025411434651">McMahon &amp; Kotler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel &amp; Riksen-Walraven, 2002</xref>). With regard to the scientific implications, the stability or change of childrearing behavior is cast into question as is, more generally, the development of parenthood. With regard to the clinical implications, how to promote positive parenting in evidence-based therapies or parenting programs is the core question. Our aim is therefore to examine the determinants of parental childrearing behavior trajectories.</p>
<p>Parents’ childrearing behavior (CRB) has often been conceptualized along two key dimensions: support and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025411434651">Aunola &amp; Nurmi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025411434651">Baumrind, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0165025411434651">Roskam &amp; Schelstraete, 2007</xref>). Support encompasses the affective nature of the parent–child relationship and refers to a variety of related behaviors including warmth, acceptance, involvement, autonomy, monitoring, and the establishment of guidelines. Control encompasses parents’ efforts to control their children’s behavior including, for example, discipline and rewarding. In this study a set of hypotheses about the development of supportive and controlling CRB was drawn from previous literature and tested in a longitudinal design encompassing selected parental and child variables.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky (1984</xref>) was one of the first researchers to propose a theoretical model of the determinants of parental behavior. Individual differences in parenting were considered to stem from three main sources of influence: the parent’s own characteristics, the child’s characteristics, and the contextual support sources. The aim of the current study is not to test Belsky’s model as a whole, but rather to test two of his major conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0165025411434651">
<title>The multiple-factor determination hypothesis</title>
<p>The first conclusion is that parenting is determined by multiple factors and therefore “buffered against threats to its integrity that derive from weaknesses in any single source” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>, p. 91). There is considerable empirical support for this conclusion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel &amp; Riksen-Walraven, 2002</xref>). In line with this approach, the present study considers several parental and child variables. The significant prediction of childrearing trajectories from both parental and child variables would support the hypothesis. Studies that have discussed, reviewed, improved, and tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky’s (1984)</xref> model allowed us to make precise predictions about the effect of the selected parental (educational level, personality, self-efficacy beliefs) and child (externalizing behavior, personality) variables on the development of CRB.</p>
<p>Parental <italic>personality</italic> was considered to be an inner source that affected parenting. The direct effect of personality traits on parenting behavior has been confirmed in several studies. Parents high in emotional stability and in agreeableness have been reported as being more supportive, stimulating, sensitive, and warm, and less controlling and dominant with their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411434651">Belsky, Crnic, &amp; Gable, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025411434651">Kendler, Sham, &amp; MacLean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025411434651">Kochanska, Clark, &amp; Goldman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0165025411434651">van Aken et al., 2007</xref>). A recent meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025411434651">Prinzie, Stams, Deković, Reijntjes, and Belsky (2009)</xref> using 5,853 parent–child dyads from 30 studies also confirmed the relationship between parental personality traits and parenting. Higher levels of agreeableness and emotional stability were related to support for autonomy. Higher levels of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness have also been associated with warmth and behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411434651">Denissen, van Aken, &amp; Dubas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165025411434651">Metsapelto &amp; Pulkkinen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025411434651">Prinzie et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have extended the set of parental predictors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025411434651">Abidin (1992</xref>) stressed the absence of any consideration of parental cognition in previous models of parenting determinants. Evidence for the central role of parental cognition as a determinant of CRB came particularly from research linking <italic>self-efficacy beliefs</italic> and parenting behavior. In Bandura’s social learning theory (1977), self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief in his or her ability to successfully perform a particular action. Self-efficacy beliefs are thought to affect both the initiation and the persistence of appropriate behavior. In the parenting context, self-efficacy has been defined as the parents’ self-perceived competence in childrearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025411434651">Coleman &amp; Karraker, 2003</xref>). Parents with low perceived control and competence have been thought to be more likely to fear losing authority and consequently to be less engaged in positive interactions with their child, while displaying more control than support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0165025411434651">Walling, Mills, &amp; Freeman, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0165025411434651">Simons, Beaman, Conger, and Chao (1993</xref>) supported this view that parents who are confident about the impact of their parenting behavior on child outcomes display highly supportive CRB.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel and Riksen-Walraven (2002</xref>) suggested the importance of parental <italic>education</italic>, which was later combined with parental attachment and personality as additional variables in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky’s (1984)</xref> model of parental behavior. The direct influence of parental personality and education was confirmed in their results obtained from a broad-ranging sample of Dutch parents with their 15-month-old infants. Highly-educated parents were assumed to show more supportive CRB than poorly-educated parents because they had enjoyed opportunities to acquire tolerance, management, and planning competencies both in school and in work environments, and because of their ability to transfer these competencies to interactions with their children. The educational level of parents was previously seen as the criterion that would best predict child-centered parenting styles, highly supportive child development behavior, and little harsh discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025411434651">Bluestone &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025411434651">Frias-Armenta &amp; McCloskey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025411434651">Kendler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0165025411434651">Simons et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, educational level was documented as a powerful predictor of maternal perspective-taking and demand for the child to achieve autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025411434651">Gerris, Deković, &amp; Janssens, 1997</xref>). More recently, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165025411434651">Vandenplas-Holper, Roskam, and Pirot (2006</xref>) have not confirmed that well-educated mothers provide more cognitive stimulation and autonomy demands vis-à-vis their child than those with a low educational level.</p>
<p>
<italic>Child behavior and personality</italic> are important sources of parenting influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025411434651">Fox, Platz, and Bentley (1995</xref>) reported strong correlations between child behavior problems and parenting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025411434651">Kendler and colleagues (1997</xref>) also found evidence for the impact of child behavioral problems (i.e., hyperactivity and personality traits such as neuroticism and disobedience) on parenting behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel and Riksen-Walraven (2002</xref>) confirmed the direct influence of child traits in their path model. The influence of child personality was also recently explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411434651">Denissen et al. (2009</xref>), with child agreeableness predicting warmth in parent–child relationships.</p>
<p>The predictive power of child variables on parental CRB has also been explored in the extensive literature on parent–child bidirectional influences. A popular set of theoretical models have emphasized the interactional nature of the parent–child relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025411434651">Bell, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025411434651">Patterson, 1982</xref>). Like many other relationships, this one is created by two people interacting over time, and the behaviors of both parties are intertwined in cycles of reciprocal causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025411434651">Lollis &amp; Kuczynski, 1997</xref>). Parental effects on child development and behavior were well-documented: CRB associated with high negative control and low support is generally related to negative outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025411434651">Aunola &amp; Nurmi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025411434651">Patterson, 1982</xref>). Although fewer studies have examined child-driven processes, child effects on parenting are supported empirically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025411434651">Belsky, Rha, &amp; Park, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025411434651">Day, Peterson, &amp; McCracken, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025411434651">Huh, Tristan, Wade, &amp; Stice, 2006</xref>). The studies focusing on child-driven processes are of particular interest for our purpose since they give empirical support to the child effect as an important determinant of parenting. The way parents decrease their positive parental behavior and increase their controlling behavior in response to children’s difficult behavior has been well-illustrated in several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411434651">Gadeyne, Ghesquière, &amp; Onghena, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0165025411434651">Reitz, Deković, &amp; Meijer, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The predictive power of parental and child variables</title>
<p>The second of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky’s (1984)</xref> conclusions we examined in the present study is that there are differences in the predictive power for parenting of the three sources of influence. Given both their direct effects on parenting and their influence on contextual variables, parental variables, especially personality traits, have generally been seen as having greater predictive power for parenting than either child or contextual variables. Nevertheless, the importance of the child’s characteristics as an influence on parenting emerged from the studies discussed earlier examining child-driven processes. As we have said, low levels of supportive parental behavior and high levels of controlling parental behavior have been reported in response to children’s antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025411434651">Day et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025411434651">Huh et al., 2006</xref>). Children were most likely to influence their parents’ behavior when displaying externalizing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165025411434651">Rueter &amp; Conger, 1998</xref>). In addition, some authors have suggested that child effects are stronger in early childhood because their high level of agitation and non-compliance at this age is particularly challenging for parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165025411434651">Shaw, Bell, &amp; Gilliom, 2000</xref>). In contrast, other authors maintain that younger children are less influential because they are less actively involved in initiating and controlling family interactions than older children or adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165025411434651">Larsson, Viding, Rijsdijk, &amp; Plomin, 2008</xref>). In the studies we found which explicitly addressed the two main parenting dimensions (support and negative control) in a longitudinal cross-lagged design with young children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411434651">Gadeyne et al. (2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025411434651">Meunier, Roskam, and Browne (2011</xref>) reported that child-driven effects were stronger than parent-driven ones.</p>
<p>In accord with this literature, the present study attempted to disentangle the two competing hypotheses. The first hypothesizes that parental variables have greater predictive power than child variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>); the second the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411434651">Gadeyne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025411434651">Meunier, Roskam, &amp; Browne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165025411434651">Rueter &amp; Conger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165025411434651">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0165025411434651">
<title>Current study</title>
<p>Our study broadens the scope of previous research in two important ways. First, with the exception of the vast literature on parent training, which evaluates change after intervention programs, studies using repeated measures of parental behavior to capture developmental change as children grow older are rare. The cross-sectional way in which most empirical studies have been conducted reinforces this view. A few of these previous cross-sectional studies have considered age-related influences. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165025411434651">Vandenplas-Holper et al. (2006</xref>), for example, the mothers favored power-oriented, directive strategies less frequently, and more often preferred stimulating and autonomy-enhancing strategies for dealing with unskilled social behavior towards their 9-year-old than towards their 3-year-old children. In this way, CRB appeals to children’s ability to distance themselves from the here-and-now and to solve problems on their own. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411434651">Denissen et al. (2009</xref>), no main effect of child age was, however, reported on parental warmth and control towards 12- and 14-year-old adolescents. Second, in this study we also consider the parental and child predictors as time-varying or as time-invariant predictors according to their conceptual properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025411434651">Hoffman &amp; Stawski, 2009</xref>). Parental self-efficacy beliefs and child externalizing behavior were treated as time-varying predictors since they were expected to vary across measurement occasions. Child externalizing behavior has indeed been found to decrease over time in several longitudinal studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025411434651">Owens &amp; Shaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0165025411434651">Shaw, Lacourse, &amp; Nagin, 2005</xref>), while parental self-efficacy beliefs vary across measurement occasions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025411434651">Dumka, Gonzales, Wheeler, &amp; Millsap, 2010</xref>). Time-invariant predictors are those measured only once per person because they are not likely to change over the course of the study. Because of the conceptually and empirically supported stable status of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness) over a relatively short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025411434651">Costa, Herbst, McCrae, &amp; Siegler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025411434651">Measelle, John, Ablow, Cowan, &amp; Cowan, 2005</xref>), initial personality traits for both children and parents, as well as parental educational level, were treated as time-invariant predictors.</p>
<p>In sum, the literature we reviewed led us to expect an improvement in supportive CRB and a decrease in controlling CRB as children grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165025411434651">Vandenplas-Holper et al., 2006</xref>). In line with the multiple-factor determination hypothesis, it was expected that a significant proportion of the changes in CRB would be predicted by the parental and child variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel &amp; Riksen-Walraven, 2002</xref>). With regard to child effects, low externalizing behavior and a personality high on agreeableness and emotional stability was expected to be related to higher supportive and lower controlling CRB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165025411434651">Van Bakel &amp; Riksen-Walraven, 2002</xref>). With respect to parental effect, it was hypothesized that high self-efficacy beliefs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0165025411434651">Walling et al., 2007</xref>), high educational level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025411434651">Bluestone &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 1999</xref>), and a personality high on extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411434651">Denissen et al., 2009</xref>) would be related to higher supportive and lower controlling CRB. As stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411434651">Denissen et al. (2009</xref>), these patterns should differ between mothers and fathers. However, since previous research has mostly been restricted to mothers, the possibility of making predictions specific to one or other parent is limited. Finally, the predictive power of parental and child variables will be compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025411434651">Day et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411434651">Gadeyne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025411434651">Meunier, Roskam, &amp; Browne, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>This study was part of the longitudinal H2M (Hard-t(w)o-Manage) children research program and was conducted by the Institute for Research in Psychological Sciences of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL, Belgium) with the collaboration of the Saint Luc University Clinic in Brussels (Belgium). Data were collected from a sample of 373 mothers and 356 fathers of Belgian non-referred (66%) and referred (34%) children (59% boys). The non-referred subsample (<italic>N</italic> = 250 for mothers and <italic>N</italic> = 249 for fathers) was recruited when the children were in the first to third kindergarten years in several elementary schools in the French-speaking part of Belgium. The referred subsample (<italic>N</italic> = 123 mothers and <italic>N</italic> = 107 fathers) was recruited from pediatric units in Belgian hospitals where the children had been referred for externalizing behavior problems (arousal, opposition, agitation, aggressiveness, non-compliance); in all cases this externalizing behavior was the immediate and principal reason for the referral. Parents of children with substantial language delays, with developmental disorders or attending special school were excluded from the sample. The parents were informed about the longitudinal research program. They were also told that the data would remain confidential. Informed consent was obtained from the parents.</p>
<p>The educational level of the parents was taken to be the number of years of education they had completed, counting from first grade onward. Some 27% of mothers and 37% of fathers had completed 12 years of education or less (corresponding to the end of secondary school and to compulsory education in Belgium); 56% of mothers and 42% of fathers had completed 3 more years (corresponding to undergraduate study); 17% of mothers and 21% of fathers had gained a 4-year degree or more. These data and their employment status (86% of mothers and 89% of fathers employed) indicate that the sample mostly comprised families of middle to high socio-economic status.</p>
<p>Note that the way of treating referrals for externalizing behavior in Belgium is such that very young children can be referred for behavioral problems to a pediatrician or to mental health services, but in the absence of a neurological or biological origin of the problem, neither diagnosis nor systematic treatment is usually provided under the age of 7. In this context, the referred children in our sample had not undergone any systematic treatment (including medication) between the three waves of assessment, although a few of them at T2 (5%) and T3 (10%) had taken part in psychomotor activities conducted by physiotherapists. The frequency of such activities and their relation to the parents’ CRB and children’s externalizing behavior were controlled for in this study and found not to have any significant effect on the variables under consideration.</p>
<p>The data presented here come from the three assessment waves: at the outset of the research program (T1), at the 12-month follow-up (T2), and at the 24-month follow-up (T3). Such a design allowed us to estimate an accelerated latent growth curve model spanning a 7-year period with parents of children aged 2.6 to 9.5 years of age, using only three waves of data. The aim of an accelerated design is to estimate mean change and its predictors over a broad range of ages by using data collected over a relatively short period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025411434651">Miyazaki &amp; Raudenbush, 2000</xref>). As is customary in longitudinal research, attrition occurred. Some 26% of mothers were missing at T2, and a further 2% at T3. The corresponding figures for fathers were 31% and 2%.</p>
<p>At T1, T2, and T3, both parents were asked to complete three separate questionnaires: the first assessed their CRB towards the target child, the second related to the child’s externalizing behavior, and the third to their self-efficacy beliefs as a parent. At T1 both parents were also asked to complete separate questionnaires assessing their child’s and their own personality traits. The set of questionnaires was given by the kindergarten teachers to the parents of non-referred children and by the physicians to the parents of referred children. The parents were asked to complete them at home within the following 2 weeks and to send them back to the research team at the Psychological Sciences Research Institute.</p>

<title>Measures of the outcome</title>
<p>
<italic>Parental childrearing behavior</italic> (CRB) was assessed by the parents at T1, T2, and T3, with the <italic>Evaluation des pratiques éducatives parentales</italic> (EPEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025411434651">Meunier &amp; Roskam, 2007</xref>). The EPEP is a 35-item instrument yielding nine factors: positive parenting, monitoring, rules, discipline, inconsistent discipline, harsh punishment, ignoring, material rewarding, and autonomy. A five-point Likert-type scale is provided for each item ranging from “never” to “always.” Recently validated on 493 French-speaking mothers and fathers of children developing normally, the EPEP scale has good psychometric properties. Cronbach’s α ranged from .65 to .89; the total percentage of variance explained by the nine factors was 64.3%; test/retest correlations for a sample of 45 parents varied between .51 and .84. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that two second-order factors covering the supportive and controlling dimensions of parenting emerged from the initial factor solution. The supportive factor was composed of positive parenting, autonomy, monitoring, and rules, and included items such as “When my child has a problem, we look together at different possible solutions.” The controlling factor included discipline, harsh punishment, material rewarding, inconsistent discipline, and ignoring, and included items such as “When my child doesn’t obey a rule, I sometimes threaten to punish him or her, but in the end I don’t carry out the threat.” The fit measures demonstrated an acceptable fit to the data with goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.92 and root mean square residual (RMR) = 0.04, although root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was only 0.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025411434651">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). All the estimated factor loadings were significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025411434651">Meunier &amp; Roskam, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>
<italic>Parental self-efficacy beliefs </italic>were assessed at T1, T2, and T3 by parents using the <italic>Echelle globale du sentiment de compétence parentale</italic> (EGSCP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025411434651">Meunier &amp; Roskam, 2009</xref>). Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025411434651">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> self-efficacy theory and subsequent work on parenting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411434651">Coleman &amp; Karraker, 1998</xref>, for a review), the EGSCP is a 25-item instrument related to five domain-specific self-efficacy factors: discipline, nurturance, playing, instrumental care, and teaching. A five-point Likert-type scale was provided for each item ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Items tapping into the discipline scale include, for example, “Despite my efforts, I find it is hard to influence the way my child behaves,” whereas “I am a fun playmate for my toddler” measured the playing scale. It was validated on 705 French-speaking parents of non-referred children. The internal consistency of the five factors was moderate to high, with Cronbach’s α ranging from .60 to .84. The total amount of variance explained by the factors was 55.29% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025411434651">Meunier &amp; Roskam, 2009</xref>). In order to reduce the number of constructs, a single “self-efficacy beliefs” variable was computed at T1, T2, and T3 for each parent by averaging the five domain-specific self-efficacy factors. The internal consistencies were moderate to high, with Cronbach’s α ranging from .74 to .78.</p>
<p>
<italic>Child externalizing behavior</italic> was assessed at T1, T2, and T3 separately by the two parents who had to complete the four subscales related to externalizing behavior (angry, aggressive, egotistical, and oppositional behavior) of the <italic>Profil Socio-Affectif </italic>(PSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025411434651">Dumas, LaFrenière, Capuano, &amp; Durning, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025411434651">LaFrenière &amp; Dumas, 1995</xref>). It provides six-point Likert-type scales under each item, ranging from “almost never occurs” to “almost always occurs.” Items scoring high on the externalizing behavior scale include, for example, “takes pleasure in harming others.” The French adaptation of the scale was validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025411434651">Dumas et al. (1997</xref>) on a sample of 800 preschoolers (387 girls, 413 boys) aged from 30 to 78 months, and demonstrated good properties. At the outset of the current study, all of the children were in this age range. In order to make the longitudinal analysis of the developmental growth curves possible, the PSA was also administered at T2 and T3. At T2, 20% of the sample was older than 78 months and by T3 some 49% were over 78 months. We therefore checked the internal consistency of the externalizing behavior scale carefully. Cronbach’s alphas were of .85 at T1, .84 at T2, and .90 at T3 ensuring good validity of the measure in the longitudinal collection of data. The scoring of the PSA is such that a higher score on the scale corresponds to a higher level of behavioral adjustment, in other words to a lower level of externalizing behavior. For the readability of the results, we recoded the PSA scores so that higher scores indicate more externalizing symptoms. A single index of the children’s externalizing behavior was used in the analyses based on the average of the mothers’ and the fathers’ responses. Externalizing behavior was here considered as a continuum ranging from regular to pathological levels of externalizing behavior. A certain overlap was seen between the two subsamples since several non-referred children displayed a moderate to high level of externalizing behavior and several referred children displayed only a moderate level. As an illustration of this overlap, the scores on the externalizing behavior scale ranged from 20 to 74.25 (<italic>M</italic> = 53.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.61) in the referred sample and from 41.50 to 89.67 (<italic>M</italic> = 69.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.37) in the non-referred sample. Since the socio-demographic characteristics of the two subsamples were very similar, they could be taken together to form a single sample, on which, considering both non-referred and referred children, we maximized the distribution on the continuum from regular to pathological child behavior.</p>

<p>
<italic>Child personality </italic>was assessed at T1 by parents who completed bipolar rating scales based on the Big Five model (EBMCF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025411434651">Roskam, de Maere-Gaudissart, &amp; Vandenplas-Holper, 2000</xref>). These scales include 25 items, five for each of the five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness. A nine-point Likert-type scale is provided under each item. Items that load high on the extraversion scale include, for example, “shy/confident,” and on the emotional stability scale, for example, “nervous/calm.” The instrument was validated on a sample of 1,196 mothers of non-referred children aged 3 to 9 years. Cronbach’s α varied from .67 to .90, test/retest correlations over a 1-week period varied between .80 and .89, and the total amount of variance explained by the factors was 60.5%. The stability of the constructs over a 2-year period (at T1 and T3) was appraised in the present study in a subsample of 100 children from the non-referred cohort. Coefficients ranged from .83 to .87. Single indices of the children’s personality traits were used in the analyses based on the average of the mothers’ and fathers’ responses.</p>
<p>
<italic>Parental personality</italic> was assessed at T1 with the 44-item French version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025411434651">Plaisant, Srivastava, Mendelsohn, Debray, &amp; John, 2005</xref>). A five-point Likert-type scale was provided for each item ranging from “never” to “always.” Items that load high on the openness scale include, for example, “I am creative,” while the agreeableness scale includes “I am generous and helpful with others.” Good psychometric properties were obtained in a sample of 477 French-speaking adults. Internal consistency was between .62 and .83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025411434651">Plaisant et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0165025411434651">
<title>Analysis strategy</title>
<p>Prior to examining the developmental course of parental supportive and controlling CRB, several preliminary analyses were conducted. First, descriptive statistics were calculated on all the variables under investigation. Second, parental self-efficacy beliefs and child externalizing behavior were regressed on the indicator of assessment wave in order to check that they were time-varying predictors. Pearson correlation coefficients were also calculated to examine the relationships between child and parent predictors. Finally, differences between mothers’ and fathers’ average levels of supportive and controlling CRB were explored, as were differences in these factors between parents from the referred and the non-referred samples.</p>
<p>To examine the developmental course of parental CRB, the main analyses in our study were conducted using a multilevel modeling (MLM) framework with the HLM 6.06 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0165025411434651">Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, &amp; Congdon, 2008</xref>). MLM capitalizes on the multilevel structure of the data, providing information about the variability of individuals over time (level 1, repeated measures) as well as between individuals (level 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0165025411434651">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Because attrition is common in longitudinal data, MLM estimates are based on all the available data with the assumption that the missing data are random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025411434651">McCartney, Burchinal, &amp; Bub, 2006</xref>). In our sample, statistical comparisons between parents who dropped out and parents who completed the three waves revealed no systematic significant differences in either socio-demographic variables or the variables under investigation.</p>
<p>We tested two models separately for the mothers and fathers to predict the developmental trajectories of the outcomes; that is, supportive and controlling CRB. The <italic>unconditional</italic> <italic>growth models</italic>—in which time is the only predictor—were tested to examine the developmental trajectories of the CRB outcomes. The time component used was the child’s age estimated in years at each of the three assessment points. This enabled us to compute an accelerated design from 2.6 to 9.5 years of age. Because of the accelerated design, the intercept was not under consideration in the analyses. Hence the intercept in each of the three cohorts is different as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025411434651">Duncan, Duncan, and Hops (1996</xref>). The meaning of the results for the intercept in the accelerated design is therefore somewhat confusing and less interesting than in a true longitudinal design.</p>
<p>The <italic>conditional model</italic> tested the effect of the predictors on the CRB outcomes. MLM allows both time-varying and time-invariant predictors to be included in the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025411434651">Raudenbush, Brennan, &amp; Barnett, 1995</xref>). As a result, we were able to predict the change in CRB from changes in the child’s externalizing behavior and the parents’ self-efficacy beliefs as well as from the time-invariant predictors (parental educational level and personality traits). Time-varying predictors were added to the level 1 equation, and time-invariant predictors to the level 2 equation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025411434651">Raudenbush et al., 1995</xref>). At level 1 the time-varying predictors were within-person centered in order to address bias due to unobserved heterogeneity or unmeasured factors that vary across individuals and have a consistent effect over time on the construct of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0165025411434651">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Time-varying predictors were also constrained to have fixed effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025411434651">Raudenbush et al., 1995</xref>). Their average level over the three assessment waves was calculated and added as predictors of the slope coefficient at level 2. This procedure aimed to examine the pure effect of change in the time-varying predictor over time (as its mean level was controlled; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025411434651">Hoffman &amp; Stawski, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Mothers’ and fathers’ self-efficacy beliefs and children’s externalizing behavior were, as expected, found to vary across occasions. Correlation coefficients between the three occasion measurements ranged between .37 and .81 for mothers’ self-efficacy beliefs, between .46 and .72 for fathers’ self-efficacy beliefs, and between .36 and .67 for children’s externalizing behavior. All three displayed a linear improvement with β = .11, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001 for mothers’ self-efficacy, β = .12, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001 for fathers’ self-efficacy, and β = .36, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001 for children’s externalizing behavior.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165025411434651">Table 3</xref> shows the correlation coefficients used to assess the relations between the predictors. Results reveal coherent patterns of relations which support the validity of the measures in our sample. For example, children whose personality was agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experience displayed lower levels of externalizing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0165025411434651">Prinzie, van der Sluis, de Haan, &amp; Deković, 2010</xref>); parents’ self-efficacy beliefs were negatively related to children’s externalizing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025411434651">Dumka et al., 2010</xref>) and positively to personality traits in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165025411434651">Meunier, Roskam, Stievenart, van de Moortele, Browne, &amp; Kumar, 2011</xref>); the five personality factors were not totally independent of each other, either for children or adults (as already indicated by previous validation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025411434651">Plaisant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025411434651">Roskam et al., 2000</xref>]).</p>

<p>Differences between mothers and fathers, as well as between the referred and non-referred samples, in CRB according to the age of the children were explored. Significant differences were reported for support, with mothers providing more support than fathers at ages 2–3 (<italic>F </italic>= 14.94, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001) and at age 4 (<italic>F </italic>= 22.98, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), but not at age 5 or later. The non-referred sample also received more support at ages 2–3 (<italic>F </italic>= 7.98, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) and at age 4 (<italic>F </italic>= 5.76, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05), but not later. No interactions were significant. Mothers provided significantly more control than fathers at age 7 (<italic>F </italic>= 4.03, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05), but not at other ages. Control was higher for the referred group at ages 4 (<italic>F </italic>= 4.36, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05), 5 (<italic>F </italic>= 15.77, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), 6 (<italic>F </italic>= 11.80, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), and 7 (<italic>F </italic>= 26.69, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). No interactions were significant. The discriminative properties of the EPEP scale were verified in the expected sense that mothers were more supportive and more controlling than fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0165025411434651">Roskam &amp; Meunier, 2009</xref>), and the parents of children referred for externalizing behavior were less supportive but more controlling than parents of normally-developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025411434651">Meunier &amp; Roskam, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the unconditional modeling are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165025411434651">Table 4</xref>. Negative slope (i.e., association with linear age) values show that mothers’ supportive and controlling CRB decreased by .06 points per year, and fathers’ controlling CRB by .07 per year, while the positive slope (i.e., association with linear age) for fathers’ supportive CRB indicates that it increased by .03 per year. The results from the random sections indicate significant individual variability around the slope and show that it was appropriate to examine the predictors of the rates of CRB linear change.</p>

For every unit above the average level of externalizing behavior, an increase of .001 units of support and of .002 units of control were evident over a year for mothers and an increase of .001 units of control for fathers. The average level of self-efficacy beliefs predicted changes in fathers’ support and control and in mothers’ support. For every unit above the average level of self-efficacy beliefs, there was an increase of .081 units of support and a decrease of .037 units of control over a year for fathers and an increase of .087 units of support for mothers.</p>
<p>Parental educational level had no significant relationships to any of the CRB variables. Turning to personality traits, the level of child extraversion predicted changes in fathers’ controlling CRB. For every unit above the average level of child extraversion, there was an increase of .010 units of control over a year. The level of fathers’ conscientiousness and emotional stability also predicted change in fathers’ CRB. For every unit above the average level of conscientiousness, an increase of .023 units of support was evident over a year, while for every unit above the average level of emotional stability, there was a decrease of .022 units of control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of our research was to examine the determinants of parental CRB trajectories. Parental behavior was treated as a dynamic variable that could change over time as children grow older and was therefore tested in a longitudinal design. Several direct effects of parental and child variables were tested. Only some of our hypotheses (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky’s [1984</xref>] model and subsequent studies on the determinants of parenting) were supported by the results.</p>
<p>Parental CRB was seen to change over time, so corroborating our dynamic view of parental behavior and previous findings in cross-sectional studies focusing on age-related child influences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165025411434651">Vandenplas-Holper et al., 2006</xref>). According to our hypotheses, controlling CRB should decrease as children grow older, and this was supported by the data. As children become more mature, they have less need to be disciplined, punished, or rewarded by their parents for their behavior. We also hypothesized that, faced with increasingly mature children, parents should increase their use of monitoring, negotiated rules, and autonomy-enhancing strategies. However, this proved only to be true for fathers. A linear decrease in supportive CRB with child age was seen in mothers.</p>
<p>Several of our preliminary analyses and unconditional growth models allow an interpretation of this result. The average level of supportiveness in mothers and fathers differed at ages 2–3 and 4, but not later. The level of supportive CRB was also seen to differ in mothers and fathers. At an early age mothers, on average, used much more supportive childrearing strategies than fathers, but their level of support steadily decreased between ages 4 and 6, by which time it was similar to that of fathers. At age 6 and over, the average level of support and its development were the same for both parents. It may be that mothers’ greater involvement in the childrearing of very young children implies a very high level of supportiveness that has to decrease to allow the maturing child a certain space for self-regulation.</p>
<p>In accord with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky’s model (1984)</xref>, both parental and child variables were significant predictors of the trajectories of CRB. Our study thus supports the multiple-factor determination hypothesis. As expected, high parental self-efficacy beliefs were related to increases in supportive and to decreases in controlling CRB. High levels of children’s externalizing behavior were also related to increases in supportive CRB from mothers and controlling CRB from both parents. Contrary to our expectations, the influence of educational level was not significant, while only three isolated effects were found for personality.</p>
<p>The lack of results for educational level and personality points to a greater influence of time-varying predictors than of time-invariant ones. Changes in CRB were influenced by other dynamic parental and child variables to a greater extent than by stable variables. These results could be viewed as logical because the time-varying predictors capitalized on the same time-variant sources of error as the outcomes, whereas the time-invariant predictors at level 2 were predicting systematic linear change. Nevertheless, while previous research had supported the view that CRB was greatly influenced by parental personality traits, our study suggested that the developmental trajectory of CRB was only slightly influenced by parents’ personality traits. The same is true for child personality traits. In addition, our study does not support the findings of some previous research that changes in CRB were influenced by the parents’ educational level. However, this could be due to the homogeneity of our sample. As mentioned in the Method section, our sample comprised mainly parents of middle to high socio-economic status.</p>
<p>One of the time-invariant predictors to have a consistent effect on parental CRB trajectories was parental self-efficacy beliefs. As suggested in the introduction, parents who saw themselves as competent were more likely to increase their supportive CRB and to decrease their controlling CRB over time than were parents who thought of themselves as less competent. Through their strong beliefs, self-efficacious parents would be increasingly motivated to engage in positive interactions with their child as well as to persist in carrying out their daily parental tasks. On the contrary, parents who felt less sure of themselves would be more likely to fear loss of authority and, consequently, to rely more on controlling than supportive CRB towards their child.</p>
<p>Mothers were also found to be influenced by the extent to which their child displayed externalizing behavior. Faced with a difficult child, mothers would maintain their early high involvement in supportive CRB. Both parents of difficult children would maintain their controlling strategies. Children with hard-to-manage behavior could lead their parents to resort to a high level of discipline, punishment, material rewarding, ignoring the child and inconsistent parenting. Our results thus showed that mothers’ CRB development in particular depends very much on the child’s behavioral development.</p>
<p>These results confirm the hypothesis that child predictors have more influence than maternal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411434651">Gadeyne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025411434651">Meunier, Roskam, &amp; Browne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165025411434651">Rueter &amp; Conger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165025411434651">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). The reverse hypothesis that paternal variables are more influential than child ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411434651">Belsky, 1984</xref>) was also confirmed. This could be explained by the fact that mothers provide more of the child’s emotional care and spend more time with their young children than fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025411434651">Aunola &amp; Nurmi, 2005</xref>). They are therefore more sensitive to their child’s behavior and consequently their CRB is more influenced by its quality. Spending relatively less time with their young children fathers should, on the contrary, be more influenced in their CRB by their personal attributes, in particular their self-efficacy beliefs as a parent.</p>
<p>In sum, and coherent with a life-span developmental perspective, parenting has to be seen as a dynamic adaptive developmental process. Several parental and child variables were found to underlie this developmental process. Our results, as set out and discussed in this paper, offer empirical support to existing parenting programs as well as providing several additional guidelines. First of all, they confirm that parental CRB is not a permanent once-and-for-all trait. Parenting programs have to be seen as intervention tools for modifying the parental developmental course. They are of particular interest for parents rearing a child with externalizing behavioral problems. Programs can be used to promote parental development through the implementation of positive support, rules, autonomy demands, and monitoring techniques, which suit the child’s difficult behavior; and, at the same time, to decrease the level of inconsistent parenting, reducing the use of harsh punishments, ignoring the child, and giving material rewards.</p>
<p>According to findings on intertwined cycles of reciprocal causality in the parent–child relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025411434651">Lollis &amp; Kuczynski, 1997</xref>), we can expect good parental development to decrease children’s externalizing behavior which, in turn, should reinforce the developmental course of optimal supportive and controlling CRB. Irrespective of their educational level or personality, for example, all parents are able to develop because this developmental process is driven by other dynamic variables. These can become the focus of parenting programs. This is especially the case for the self-efficacy beliefs that may be an appropriate point of entry for intervention efforts. Self-efficacy beliefs can, for example, be improved through selected cognitive techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025411434651">Briesmeister &amp; Schaefer, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While innovative and important from both clinical and research perspectives, this study has several limitations. The age of the parents should have been considered as a parental predictor, but it was unfortunately not available for most parents. The same is true for the gender of the child, which might be an important predictor. However, these questions went beyond the purpose of the present paper. Another limitation concerns the causal relationship between the time-varying predictors and the outcome, CRB. Inferring causality requires, inter alia, demonstrating that the presumed cause precedes the effect in time. In this respect, the data collection of our time-varying predictors should have preceded the data collection of our outcome. This time-consuming procedure was actually not possible also because of the risk of attrition with an increasing number of measurement occasions. Furthermore, the personality variables have been treated here as time-invariant. Nevertheless, personality changes, especially in childhood, are possible across three years. Finally, in line with our developmental objective and the accelerated design of the current study, we only focused on predicting trajectories of parenting. The personality dimensions and even educational level would probably explain more variance in the intercepts than in the slopes.</p>
<p>This study is by no means definitive. Contextual variables, especially co-parenting, should be considered in future models as time-varying predictors influencing parenting over time. Attempts should also be made to replicate the findings with other assessment procedures, especially observational measures, which could limit the shared-method variance due to the exclusive use of parent-report data. The results obtained with parents of young children should be compared to those obtained with parents of adolescents. And other referred and culturally-diverse samples should be considered to evaluate the specificities of parental development in several clinical samples and in culturally-diverse environments.</p>

<p>As the conditional model includes time-varying variables, the random-effect coefficients around the slope are not comparable to those in the unconditional models and are therefore not presented. Unlike level 2 predictors which essentially affect the level 2 variance components, time-varying predictors (level 1) affect all variance components because they vary both within and between individuals. For this reason, a change between the unconditional and the conditional models in the level 2 variance is not meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0165025411434651">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>).</p>
