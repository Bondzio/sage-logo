<title>Background:</title>
<p>To what extent the progressive increase in the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) observed in the province of Padova over the period 1970–1999 was an expression of a real increased risk of developing MS remained unclear.</p>

<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The objective of this paper is to update the epidemiological figures of MS and probe whether the risk of having MS has increased in the province of Padova during the decade 2000–2009.</p>

<sec id="section3-1352458512461970">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>All patients born in Italy and having a diagnosis of MS or possible MS identified through analysis of all available sources of information were included in the study. The incidence and prevalence rates between 2000 and 2009 were obtained and compared with our previously published data.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>On 31 December 2009, the overall prevalence was 139.5/100,000, 192.0±9.5 for females and 83.9±6.3 for males.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A progressive and significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) was observed in the province of Padova, Veneto region of Italy, over the period 1970–1999.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512461970">1</xref></sup> On 31 December 1999, the annualized incidence rate and the normalized prevalence were 4.1 and 80.5, respectively, both showing a five-fold increase compared to the 1970s. However, it remained unclear to what extent this increase was the expression of an early and more accurate diagnosis that determined a significant reduction in the interval of time between clinical onset and definite diagnosis (onset-diagnosis delay). Thus, we went on with a further 10-year epidemiological survey of MS incidence and prevalence in our province aimed at evaluating whether the risk of having MS is increasing in our geographical area (Northeast Italy).</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1352458512461970">
<title>Area of investigation</title>
<p>The province of Padova is situated in Northeast Italy, between 45°5’ and 45°4’ north and 10°14’ and 11°14’ east, and covers an area of 2142 km<sup>2</sup> with 104 towns and villages. The area is mostly flat with 218 km<sup>2</sup> covered by hills (maximum altitude 603 m) and a 10 km coastline on the Adriatic Sea. The province has a temperate climate. No significant climate changes have occurred over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The local population (LP) of the province descends from a mix of Mediterranean and Celtic European ethnic groups (information on the ethnic fluxes over the centuries was given in a previous paper).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512461970">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Italy, the National Health Service delivers medical care through local health units (Azienda Sanitaria Locale, ASL) that are organized according to population density. At the time of this study the province had three ASLs and six neurology units. The standards of medical care in the province of Padova are considered among the highest in Italy.</p>
<p>Detection of IgG oligoclonal bands (IgGOB) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain and spinal cord and evoked potentials have been available since the early 1980s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512461970">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>All demographic data about the resident population in the province of Padua were obtained from the official database of the Veneto Region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://statistica.regione.veneto.it">http://statistica.regione.veneto.it</ext-link>). Between 1999 and 2009, the population increased from 853,357 in 2000 to 927,730 in 2009 (Δ=+9.1%), maintaining the same female/male (F/M) ratio of 1.1. This increase, however, was minimally due to the expansion of the LP (i.e., inhabitants born in Italy), which increased from 832,196 to 841,597 (Δ= +9401, 12.7% of the total increase) but was mainly due to immigrants from several countries (immigrant population, IP) whose number increased from 21,161 to 86,133 (Δ= +64,972, 87.3%), accounting for 2.5% of the general population in 2000 (2.6% for women, 2.9% for men, F/M. 0.7) and 9.3% in 2009 (9.28% for women, 9.47% for men, F/M: 1.0). Considering (i) the significant differences between LP and IP in terms of demographic parameters, (ii) the lower prevalence and incidence rates of MS in the home countries of many immigrants (i.e., China, North Africa, Thailand, etc.), (iii) the possibility that many immigrants refused to go to the ASL, and (iv) in order to compare the actual epidemiological data with those previously observed in our province, only the LP was considered in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458512461970">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data about MS patients were obtained from all the neurological centers of the province of Padua (Camposampiero, Cittadella, Monselice, Padova and Piove di Sacco). Further sources of data were the neurorehabilitation service centers, chronic care centers, the membership rolls of the local branch of the Italian Society for Multiple Sclerosis, the Association of Invaliding Disease of Padua, the archives of the National Pension Institute and the National Health Insurance. The team of the MS Centre of the University of Padua made a systematic review of patient clinical history, including in the study all patients with a diagnosis of MS or of possible MS according to McDonald criteria (2001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461970">2</xref></sup> All doubtful cases were discussed with the referring neurologist. Prevalence was defined as the total number of patients with a definite diagnosis of MS per every 100,000 inhabitants at the prevalence day of 31 December 2009, while an incident case was defined as any individual who first experienced symptoms between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2009, later related to MS, while residing in the province of Padua, expressed for every 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Padova.</p>

<sec id="section11-1352458512461970">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed assuming a Poisson distribution. The comparison between prevalence rates or incidence rates was performed using χ<sup>2</sup>. The <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the onset-diagnosis delay and the mean age at onset during 1990–1999 and 2000–2009.</p>

<title>Prevalence</title>
<p>On prevalence day 1173 patients with a definite diagnosis of MS (McDonald et al., 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461970">2</xref></sup>) were identified among the LP of the province consisting of 841,597 individuals (431,735 females, 409,862 males), giving a crude prevalence rate of 139.5/100,000 (CI 95% 131.3–147.5). The prevalence rate was 192.0 (CI 95% 182.5–201.5) for females and 83.9 (CI 95% 77.7–90.2) for males (females: 829, males: 344; F/M: 2.3). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512461970">Figure 1A</xref> shows that the prevalence rate of MS in the province of Padova increased by 73% in the last decade compared to the previous one, maintaining the same gender ratio.</p>

<title>Incidence</title>
<p>The mean annual incidence rate of MS in the decade 2000–2009 was 5.5 (CI 95% 5.0–6.0), 7.4 for females (CI 95% 6.6–8.2) and 3.5 for males (CI 95% 2.9–4.1, F/M: 2.1). Thus, the mean annual incidence increased from 4.1±0.3 during the decade 1990–1999 to 5.5±0.5 during the decade 2000–2009 (&gt; 34%), and the difference was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the increase of MS incidence since the 1970s was surprisingly linear: Δ=+1.6 during the decade 1970–1980, Δ=+1.7 during the period 1981–1999, and Δ=+1.4 in the last decade. In order to evaluate the impact of the McDonald/Polman diagnostic criteria on the incidence data, we applied the Diagnostic Criteria of Poser used in the previous study to all the incident cases diagnosed during 2000–2009, and obtained a mean incidence rate of 5.1±0.5, and the difference was not significant (McDonald/Polman vs Poser: <italic>p</italic> = 0.20).

<title>Onset-diagnosis delay and mean age at onset</title>
<p>The onset-diagnosis interval did not statistically differ between the last two decades (1990–1999: mean: 8.9, range: 1–95 months; 2000–2009: mean: 8.5 months, range: 1–93 months; <italic>p</italic> = 0.695), while a mild increase in the age at onset (mean±SD: 35.2±11.4) was observed due to an increased number of patients having had MS onset after the age of 50.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the third epidemiological survey on the incidence and prevalence of MS in the province of Padova conducted over a period of 40 years. As previously described, in the period 1970 to 1999, the incidence of the disease increased fivefold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512461970">1</xref></sup> However, an extraordinary improvement in the diagnostic work-up for MS occurred during that period, since new powerful diagnostic procedures (MRI, IgGOB, evoked potentials) and more specific clinical criteria (Poser’s criteria) became available, and a significant reduction of the onset-diagnosis delay was achieved. Thus, the exact evaluation of the real risk of developing MS remained undefined.</p>
<p>During the decade 2000–2009, the only significant change in the diagnostic work-up of MS was the establishment of new diagnostic MRI and clinical criteria, namely the McDonald (2001)-Polman (2005) Criteria. Although these criteria were designed to further shorten the diagnostic interval, their impact in the incidence rate was expected to be minimal given the onset-diagnosis delay observed in 1999. Interestingly, we found that the mean annual incidence rate of MS in our province further increased, beyond the predictions, in the last decade rising from 4.1±0.3 to 5.5±0.5 (Δ=+1.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), following the almost linear trend of the previous 30 years.</p>
<p>Several findings of our study suggest that the increased incidence of MS in the province of Padova is mainly due to a real increased risk of developing the disease rather than the expression of a further improvement in the diagnostic procedures: (i) the quality of the data obtained by applying different diagnostic criteria (Poser vs McDonald/Polman) on the incident rate in the last decade, (ii) the similar onset-diagnosis delay observed in the last two decades and (iii) the minimal change in the mean age at onset. Moreover, the paraclinical investigations applied during the last decade did not substantially differ from those applied in the prior decade (we may suppose that their impact on MS epidemiology was almost completely “absorbed” before 2000).</p>
<p>In light of the actual incidence and prevalence of MS observed in this study and similar data obtained in other Italian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512461970">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512461970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512461970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512461970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512461970"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512461970"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512461970">9</xref></sup> and European<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512461970">10</xref></sup> epidemiological surveys, the classic placement of Italy among the low-risk countries for MS appears out of date, and MS should no longer be considered a “rare” disease in our region.</p>
<p>From an etiological point of view, however, an interesting aspect of MS epidemiology in our province that is shared with other epidemiological long-term surveys conducted in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512461970">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512461970">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512461970">12</xref></sup> is the impressive linearity of the incidence curve, which starts with a value of 0.8 during the decade 1960–1970.</p>
<p>Of course, although clearly under-diagnosed, MS was known before that time, and we may argue that its incidence before the 1960s was probably low but not far from that observed in the first survey (0.8/100,000 inhabitants). Therefore, it seems that the slope of MS incidence has significantly changed in the second part of the 20th century. Inasmuch as epidemiological research may furnish elements to generate a hypothesis for the causation of the disease, our data seem to suggest a primary role of exogenous agents rather than of genetic factors in determining the increased risk of MS in our region.</p>
