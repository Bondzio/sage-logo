<title>Background:</title>
<p>Fatalities in football are rare but tragic events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513478572">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The purpose was to describe the causes of fatalities in high school and college football players and potentially provide preventive strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513478572">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513478572">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We reviewed the 243 football fatalities reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research from July 1990 through June 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513478572">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Football fatalities averaged 12.2 per year, or 1 per 100,000 participants. There were 164 indirect (systemic) fatalities (average, 8.2 annually [or 0.7 per 100,000 participants]) and 79 direct (traumatic) fatalities (average, 4.0 annually [or 0.3 per 100,000 participants]). Indirect fatalities were 2.1 times more common than direct fatalities. The risk of a fatality in college compared with high school football players was 2.8 (95% CI, 0.7-8.2) times higher for all fatalities, 3.6 (95% CI, 2.5-5.3) times higher for indirect events, 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6-3.0) times higher for direct injuries, 3.8 (95% CI, 1.8-8.3) times higher for heat illness, and 66 (95% CI, 14.4-308) times higher for sickle cell trait (SCT) fatalities. Most indirect events occurred in practice sessions; preseason practices and intense conditioning sessions were vulnerable periods for athletes to develop heat illness or SCT fatalities, respectively. In contrast, most brain fatalities occurred during games. The odds of a fatality during the second decade, compared with the first decade of the study, were 9.7 (95% CI, 1.2-75.9) for SCT, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.8-2.9) for heat illness, 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.7) for cardiac fatalities, and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4-1.2) for brain fatalities. The most common causes of fatalities were cardiac failure (n = 100, 41.2%), brain injury (n = 62, 25.5%), heat illness (n = 38, 15.6%), SCT (n = 11, 4.5%), asthma and commotio cordis (n = 7 each, 2.9% each), embolism/blood clot (n = 5, 2.1%), cervical fracture (n = 4, 1.7%), and intra-abdominal injury, infection, and lightning (n = 3, 1.2% each).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513478572">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>High school and college football have approximately 12 fatalities annually with indirect systemic causes being twice as common as direct blunt trauma. The most common causes are cardiac failure, brain injury, and heat illness. The incidence of fatalities is much higher at the college level for most injuries other than brain injuries, which were only slightly more common at the college level. The risk of SCT, heat-related, and cardiac deaths increased during the second decade of the study, indicating these conditions require a greater emphasis on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.</p>

<body>
<p>Football is one of the most popular team sports in the United States, with more than 1 million high school participants annually since the 1998-1999 academic year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513478572">20</xref></sup> Football also is associated with the highest number of fatalities for any sport reported to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research (hereinafter termed the “Center”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513478572">17</xref></sup> In one report on sudden death secondary to blunt trauma in young competitive athletes in all sports over a 30-year span, football was associated with almost 60% of the fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478572">24</xref></sup> Another review of all football fatalities at the professional, college, high school, and sandlot levels over a 55-year period (1945-1999) identified 718 fatalities, or an average of 13 annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478572">5</xref></sup> Football was also associated with the highest number of nontraumatic sports deaths in high school and college athletes identified by the Center (n = 67, 42%) over a 10-year period (1983-1993).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513478572">28</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>However, to our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive published studies focusing solely on football fatalities at the high school and college levels during the past 2 decades. Our goal was to review the Center data for 20 years (July 1990 through June 2010) to determine the incidence and causes of high school and college football fatalities and potentially provide preventive strategies.</p>

<sec id="section8-0363546513478572">
<title>Injury Definitions</title>
<p>This study was exempt from institutional review board approval (all information was public domain). The Center classifies fatalities as direct (trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury) or indirect (from systemic compromise such as cardiac failure, heat illness, sickle cell trait [SCT], asthma, or pulmonary embolism secondary to exertion while participating in a sport).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513478572">18</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546513478572">
<title>Injury Reports</title>
<p>From July 1990 through June 2010, the Center collected data on high school and college football fatalities in the United States. It annually contacted and requested reports of any catastrophic events in organized school-sponsored sports from high school and college coaches, athletic directors, and athletic trainers; executive offices of state and national athletic organizations; and a national newspaper clipping service. Once information was received concerning a possible catastrophic football injury, the Center contacted the college athletic trainers and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFSHSA) contacted the high school coaches or athletic trainers to obtain preliminary data (eg, the athlete’s name, date of injury, age, diagnosis, school, circumstances such as practice session versus game, and mechanism of injury).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513478572">
<title>Injury Surveillance</title>
<p>In 2011 and 2012, we performed extensive Internet searches to acquire additional information about any football fatalities reported to the Center. A detailed questionnaire was used to collect data on player characteristics (weight, height, position played), timing of injury, and participation level. Information was recorded regarding the mechanism of injury, previous head injury and equipment worn, medical diagnosis, and treatment. Weather conditions on the day of the heat and SCT fatalities were also obtained via Internet searches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513478572">30</xref></sup> The odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) was assessed for college versus high school athletes, and the common causes of fatalities were compared for the first and second decades. The locations for the heat-related and SCT deaths were divided into 4 regions using the United States Census Bureau classification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513478572">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513478572">27</xref></sup>

The risk of a cardiac death in the second decade of the study was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.7) times greater than a cardiac fatality in the first decade, which may be caused by a spike of fatalities during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 academic years. A precise diagnosis could not be determined in 63 cases. For the remaining 37 cases, the diagnosis was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 22), coronary artery anomaly (n = 11), mitral valve abnormality (n = 2), or myocarditis (n = 2).</p>

<title>Brain Injuries</title>
<p>In contrast to a study of all catastrophic brain injuries (fatal and nonfatal) that reported a 3-fold higher incidence of injury at the high school level compared with college,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513478572">4</xref></sup> our current findings showed a slightly higher risk of brain fatalities in college players. The explanation for this discrepancy is difficult to determine, but younger athletes may be more predisposed to nonfatal, catastrophic brain injuries, although the incidences for fatalities are similar.</p>
<p>From 1945 to 1975, there was an average of 9.5 brain fatalities annually at the high school and college levels, with a peak of 17.2 annually from 1965 to 1969.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478572">5</xref></sup> In the 1980s, the average number of brain fatalities in high school and college football dropped to 5 annually, which is a dramatic decline, considering that the number of participants increased during this time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478572">5</xref></sup> One possible factor responsible for this mortality reduction is the improved football helmet and safety standards established by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, which have significantly reduced the number of skull fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513478572">5</xref></sup> The safety standard for football helmets was adopted by the NCAA in 1978 and by the NFSHSA in 1980. During this study, the average number of brain fatalities annually for high school and college players has continued to decline from the first decade (3.6) to the second decade (2.6). This decline may be secondary to improved medical coverage at games and treatment for major brain injuries. Further reduction of brain fatalities will need to focus on preventing return to play after incomplete recovery from a concussion, identification of risk factors that predispose athletes to catastrophic head injuries, additional assessment and improvement of the football helmet, and/or determination of an athlete’s career end point after repetitive concussions.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that we found most brain fatalities occurred during games, which are associated with high-intensity competitive situations. The most common positions for the occurrence of these injuries were linebacker, running back, defensive back, and playing multiple teams (offense and defense, or defense and special teams). Our results are in accordance with those of other reports indicating that running backs, linebackers, and defensive backs are the most vulnerable positions for head-related catastrophic injuries and fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513478572">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478572">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>A worrisome finding in our study is that 25% of athletes with a brain fatality had a history of concussion, with 16% within 1 month of the fatality. All athletes with a history of concussion were at the high school level. Although we were unable to obtain a complete head injury history on all cases, this finding indicates that younger players may be more predisposed to a fatal brain injury if incompletely recovered from a prior concussion. In one study that reviewed both fatal and nonfatal catastrophic head injuries in football, 60% of the contacted athletes had a previous mild head injury, with 71% occurring during the same season.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513478572">4</xref></sup> Because it is more difficult to obtain previous head injury status on fatalities than on survivors of catastrophic brain injuries, it is possible that improved surveillance and diagnostic tests may have shown a much higher incidence of previous concussions in this study. It has been reported that collegiate football players with a history of concussions are more likely to have subsequent concussive injuries than those with no history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513478572">8</xref></sup> Similarly, a history of mild traumatic brain injury may also predispose an athlete to a more severe head injury. The exact role of previous head injuries in the development of a subsequent severe head injury is unknown and requires further study. Nonetheless, it is prudent that any player with symptoms or signs of a concussion not be allowed to return to play on the day of injury and also not be allowed to return to play until all symptoms have resolved and do not recur with sport-specific exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513478572">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Heat</title>
<p>Although most (30 of 38) of the heat illness deaths in our study occurred among high school football players, the risk of a heat fatality was 3.8 times greater in college participants compared with high school participants. The reason for this higher incidence is unclear but may be related to the more intense training at this level. The average BMI of the athletes in our study was 33.9, which confirms that obesity (BMI &gt;30 in adults) is a risk factor for heat-related fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513478572">9</xref></sup> Obese patients have increased heat production and a relatively low surface area necessary for heat dissipation via evaporation. Overweight or obese athletes, especially linemen, should be monitored closely for signs of heat illness.</p>
<p>In our study, the average maximum temperature (89.6°F) and humidity (87.7%) on days with heat-related fatalities equate to an approximate wet bulb globe temperature of 104°F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513478572">1</xref></sup> If the athletes were exercising during the hottest portion of the day, this temperature would place the athletes in the hazardous risk category, well above the level where sporting events should be cancelled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513478572">1</xref></sup> Most (63%) heat-related deaths occurred in the South, which is known to have the highest average temperatures and humidity in the month of August.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513478572">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the 18 fatalities on which we had event information, 83% occurred during 2-a-day practices, 44% occurred on practice day 1, 60% occurred in players wearing helmets, and 25% occurred in athletes wearing full equipment. Preseason practices are often associated with the most intense conditioning during the hottest weather. Uniform wear lowers the heat tolerance for an athlete by decreasing the amount of skin surface available for evaporation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513478572">9</xref></sup> Acclimatization to the weather conditions is a key component of heat illness prevention and often takes 7 to 10 days, with gradual increases in exertion, environmental exposure time, and equipment wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513478572">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The importance of maintaining adequate hydration when exercising is paramount. One athlete in our study had a gastrointestinal virus just before the heat-related fatality, which may have caused dehydration and increased the risk. In addition to the guidelines indicated above, players should be offered frequent sports drinks with electrolytes or water breaks during practice sessions and encouraged to seek shade and remove equipment to facilitate body cooling during rest periods. One athlete in our study population was taking ephedra, a sympathomimetic that causes increased heat production and impedes the body’s ability to regulate temperature; in 2004, after the death of this athlete and several other high-profile athletes, ephedra was banned.</p>
<p>Despite the development of these prevention guidelines, the incidence of heat-related deaths was 1.5 times greater during the second decade of this study. The reason is unclear, but it indicates that additional education, rule compliance, and guideline validation are required as well as improved medical supervision during the early part of the football season.</p>

One possibility is that many fatalities at the high school level are misdiagnosed as cardiac or heat-related illnesses because of nonrecognition of SCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513478572">7</xref></sup> The low incidence of SCT-related deaths during the first decade of the study also may be partially the result of nonrecognition during this time period. It is also possible that the percentage of African American athletes is higher at the college level. Alternatively, college athletes may be more predisposed to complications because of more intense training or other unknown reasons.</p>
<p>In our study, all 11 SCT-related fatalities occurred during intense conditioning drills, often sprinting. In 2 cases, death occurred during conditioning drills on the first day of practice, indicating that this day may be a particularly vulnerable time. The SCT-related deaths typically occur in practice sessions after 2 to 30 minutes of high-level running with limited rest periods as opposed to game situations in which the plays usually last only a few seconds and rest periods of 30 to 45 seconds are provided between plays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513478572">7</xref></sup> The average maximum temperature and humidity on the day of the SCT event were 10°F cooler and 3% less humid, respectively, than those for the heat-related deaths, indicating that temperature and humidity do not play as critical a role in the pathogenesis of SCT-related fatalities. The athletes with SCT on average were not considered obese (average BMI, 28 vs 34 for the athletes who died from heat-related causes). Other clinical features that distinguish SCT from heat illness are core body temperatures of less than 105°F, buttock and low back pain during the crisis, and faster onset of crisis symptoms without warning signs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513478572">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our findings revealed that the SCT status of 4 athletes was not known until postmortem testing and that 1 athlete did not report his SCT condition to the team. It is possible that in all 5 cases, death could have been prevented with proper screening for and knowledge of the condition. In August 2010, the NCAA instituted a universal screening program to test for SCT in all Division I athletes; future research will determine whether this policy will reduce the SCT fatality incidence. Currently, at the high school level, testing is not required, but it is recommended that the athlete be queried about SCT status during the preseason physical examination. Once a player is identified as having SCT, the National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513478572">7</xref></sup> recommends that the athletes should be allowed to perform conditioning drills at their own pace and should stop exercising immediately if unusual shortness of breath, undue fatigue or muscle pain, weakness, or cramping develop. Intense performance tests that last more than 2 minutes without a break should be avoided.</p>

<title>Asthma</title>
<p>Fatalities due to exercise-induced asthma in the older adolescent and adult are extremely uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513478572">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513478572">28</xref></sup> Our results concur with a similar report of 160 nontraumatic deaths in high school and college athletes over a 10-year period in which only 4 were the result of asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513478572">28</xref></sup> In another report, 61 asthma-related deaths were reported from 1993 to 2000 in all athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513478572">2</xref></sup> However, the most frequent sports played, basketball and track, and the most prevalent age group, between 10 and 14 years, were different from our study. Patients with asthma should be properly medicated and understand that rescue medication should be immediately available during exercise activity.</p>

<title>Commotio Cordis</title>
<p>Fifty percent of reported cases of commotio cordis occur in amateur athletes participating in organized sports, and medical personnel should be prepared to treat this often fatal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513478572">13</xref></sup> Although commotio cordis is more commonly reported in baseball, softball, and hockey, our study has shown that it can occur in football players. The average age at death (17 years) in our study was higher than that reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513478572">13</xref></sup> The reason for this difference is unclear, but it may be associated with the large diffuse forces that occur with collisions in football (vs focal impacts from projectiles such as baseballs or hockey pucks). Our fatalities occurred despite the football pads worn by 6 of the players, reinforcing the concept that current chest protectors are not preventive against this condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513478572">10</xref></sup> Although commotio cordis traditionally has a high fatality rate, recent data show that public education to avoid impact to the chest region, prompt initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the increased availability of automatic external defibrillators may reduce the fatality rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513478572">13</xref></sup>

<title>Pulmonary Embolism/Blood Clot</title>
<p>Pulmonary embolism in young athletes is an extremely rare condition, limited to case reports in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513478572">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513478572">23</xref></sup> The condition is more common postoperatively, as seen in our 2 patients, but it can also occur after blunt trauma or fracture to the leg, leading to deep venous thrombosis and propagation of the clot to the lungs. Pulmonary embolism should be included in the differential diagnosis of any athlete with dyspnea, especially if there has been a previous major lower leg trauma or surgery.</p>

<title>Intra-abdominal Injury</title>
<p>All 3 fatalities from intra-abdominal injuries resulted from a collision in a game situation. Our findings indicate that game-day football equipment and padding could be improved to prevent these injuries. Although the incidence of these intra-abdominal fatalities is rare,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513478572">24</xref></sup> it is also likely that for every fatality, there are numerous injuries that do not result in a fatality.</p>

<title>Infection</title>
<p>Two of the 3 infections were the result of direct trauma to the leg complicated by systemic infection. The third infection-related death occurred in 2008 and was caused by MRSA, which has become more common in recent years. Prevention is best accomplished with proper hygiene, including showering after every practice or game, avoiding the sharing of towels and other personal care items, regular cleaning of communal bathing areas, and cleaning or laundering of equipment and clothing after every use. Athletes with draining lesions that cannot be adequately covered should not share athletic equipment that is in contact with the skin, should not participate in contact sports, and should be excluded from common whirlpools or saunas until the wound has healed or drainage can be contained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513478572">22</xref></sup>

<title>Study Limitations and Future Focus</title>
<p>Our study has some limitations. First, it is possible that not all fatalities in organized high school and college football were reported to the Center; therefore, any flaw in the collection of data would have been one of underreporting. Second, we relied on information from the public domain, which may have some inaccuracies. However, these deaths are highly visible events with extensive reporting by the news media. In addition, the diagnosis was confirmed in 146 deaths with an autopsy report. Third, we were unable to locate detailed information on some of the fatalities (eg, cardiac and asthma-related deaths).</p>
<p>Although our data may not have been complete, the problem of football fatalities is real and needs to be addressed by continued surveillance and rule changes when applicable to further reduce the incidence. Knowledge of the causes of football fatalities may allow team physicians to be better prepared to treat these conditions expeditiously and prevent fatalities. Potential preventive strategies that require further research include identifying athletes with potentially fatal cardiac conditions, avoidance of return to play before full recovery from a head injury, and strict adherence to guidelines to prevent heat illness and SCT crises. A greater emphasis needs to be placed on the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heat illness and SCT during practice sessions. Focused data collection templates are being developed to more accurately record information in the future.</p>
