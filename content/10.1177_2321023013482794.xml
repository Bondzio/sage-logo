<p>In the last 25 years, no scholar has contributed more to our understanding of the politics of India’s economic development than Atul Kohli. His new book, <italic>Poverty Amid Plenty in the New India</italic> is a valuable addition to his corpus. It stakes out an incisive argument about the political dynamics behind India’s simultaneous accelerated growth and increasing inequality. Most importantly, it provokes us to ask new questions about India’s political economy.</p>
<p>Kohli’s book marries two important strands of his work. Its argument about the pro-business shift in Indian policy-making develops an argument initially articulated in <italic>State Directed Development.</italic> The volume also draws on Kohli’s study of variation in popular mobilization at the provincial level first begun in <italic>The State and Poverty in India</italic> and <italic>Democracy and Discontent: India’s Growing Crisis of Governability</italic>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Kohli argues that the pro-business shift of the Indian state has simultaneously accelerated India’s growth and increased economic inequality. This creates the challenge of managing a narrow ruling alliance in a rambunctious democracy where the lower castes and classes are highly mobilized. India’s political elite have addressed the challenge through innovations in political institutions and popular mobilization. In the institutional realm, they have shifted policy-making authority from politicians in elected bodies to technocratic experts in bureaucratically insulated sites like the Prime Minister’s office and the Planning Commission. At the same time that the political elite concentrate authority at the apex of the state and claim credit for policy successes, they blame policy failures on politicians and officials at the state and local levels.</p>
<p>The challenge of managing the narrow ruling coalition is not so easily surmounted. At the national level, notes Kohli, the Congress attempts to mobilize electoral majorities through political campaigns advocating inclusive growth while the BJP strives to manage the electoral challenge through appeals to Hindu nationalism. Politics at the local level takes different forms. Kohli suggests that local politics is best understood as tending towards the logic of three ideal types. Drawing from the experience of Uttar Pradesh, Kohli highlights neo-patrimonialism as one important tendency where states are weakly institutionalized and political leaders politicize the bureaucracy and use patron-client relationships and ascriptive politics to mobilize support. In a chapter on West Bengal, Kohli outlines the social democratic tendency where lower classes and castes are mobilized by left-of-centre political parties and the scope of effective redistribution results from the breadth of their political base and the efficacy of administration. Finally, Gujarat demonstrates the developmental state tendency. Here political elites align with business interests in manufacturing—and in other states, with services or agro-businesses—to promote growth while maintaining popular support through ideological appeals such as <italic>Hindutva</italic>.</p>
<p>Kohli’s arguments have sparked controversy with economists like Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati who have recently argued that India’s reforms have achieved inclusive growth. Part of the controversy hinges on the difference between Panagariya’s focus on how growth has improved the plight of the poor—a position that in most instances, Kohli does not deny, though he points out that in terms of nutrition, there has been some deterioration—and Kohli’s concern for increased inequality. Central to the controversy is that for Bhagwati and Panagariya, the 1991 balance of payments crisis was a crucial turning point in the reform process, whereas in Kohli’s analysis the reforms are rooted in broader structural factors such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the impending membership of India in the WTO, and the growing availability of foreign portfolio investment. Though the crisis brought important reforms, the critical juncture was the pro-business policy trajectory initiated by Indira Gandhi in the early 1980’s. Moreover, Kohli’s emphasis on the pro-business underpinnings of India’s reforms underscores a key difference with the economists. At points, he takes the position that India’s pro-business policies are inconsistent with liberalization. In my view, an important implications of his work is that there is not one but many possible liberalization trajectories, and politics plays a central role in determining which path is followed.</p>
<p>Kohli’s distinction between politically insulated technocratic politics at the apex of the state and the politics of popular mobilization develops analysis proposed by scholars as diverse as Partha Chatterjee and Ashutosh Varshney. While capturing a noteworthy development in India’s political economy, it obscures important political dynamics that shape economic policy-making. Technocrats do not speak with one voice, and differences among them shape the reform process. Arguably contention between relentless liberalizers associated with the Ministry of Finance and calibrating conservatives such as Y.V. Reddy and Rakesh Mohan at the Reserve Bank of India have shaped financial sector reform and contributed to India’s relatively successful response to the global financial crisis. The fragility of the reform process is illustrated by the counterproductive tenure of Pranab Mukherjee as finance minister with his politicization of administrative appointments, his crude measures to regulate capital like General Anti-Avoidance Rules, and his stalling of other reforms.</p>
<p>Finally, the distinction between technocratic and mass politics obscures the manner in which mass politics shapes technocratic politics and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The impact is most clear in India’s fiscal politics where subsidies to powerful political constituencies creates fiscal and current account deficits that must somehow be managed by the technocrats. At the same time, technocratic decisions regarding the regulation of markets, pension schemes, and even poverty alleviation policies play an important role in shaping mass politics.</p>
<p>Kohli sees India’s pro-business turn largely in reference to its earlier quasi-socialist era. Cross-national comparison suggests different implications. Does India’s pro-business turn represent a normalization of Indian politics? Countries as diverse as Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States all provide business a privileged place in politics. Depending on the dynamism of private capital to drive economic growth requires coordinating policy with the needs of capital, even though it allows space for a range of responses.</p>
<p>Kohli’s book incites us to explore two current issues that are central to the drama of contemporary India’s economic development. Will business influence create an endogenous political process generating an enduring bias detrimental to broader social welfare, or will the pressure of popular politics drive the Indian state towards the autonomy necessary for equitable business regulation? And finally, will the policies resulting from India’s recent ‘rights revolution’ including the right to work, education, and information about government activities, produce an equitable social welfare state that provides the population with the capacity to effectively participate in India’s market economy and contribute to its growth or will they deteriorate into a populist drag on India’s economic development? The dynamics of the relationship between technocratic and popular politics will be central to the outcome of these issues.</p>
