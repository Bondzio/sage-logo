<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Clostridial myonecrosis usually occurs after trauma. Amputation of limb, antibiotics and intensive care are the mainstay of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412459156">Bryant and Stevens 2010</xref>). Parenteral injection is a rare cause of gas gangrene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412459156">Aggelidakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412459156">Harvey and Purnell, 1968</xref>). We present a rare case of limb salvage after post injection gas gangrene.</p>
<p>A 24-year-old man presented with severe pain and progressively increasing swelling in the right upper extremity over the previous 24 h, with a history of intramuscular injection, of unknown nature, having been administered in the arm about 48 h before for generalized urticaria. There was no history of illicit drug abuse.</p>
<p>On examination the patient was conscious, oriented, febrile and had tachycardia. The symptoms had begun in the arm at the injection site and had progressively increased over 24 h. The right upper limb was markedly swollen from shoulder to hand, with reddish-brown discolouration of the overlying skin, which had changed to bluish-green in some areas. There were bullous lesions containing haemorrhagic fluid over the extensor aspect. A crepitus was felt on the dorsal aspect of the lower arm. An X-ray of the limb showed a gas formation in the arm and forearm in the subcutaneous plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412459156">Figure 1</xref>). Blood investigations revealed a raised total leucocyte count and raised serum potassium levels. A gram stain of blister fluid showed gram-positive bacilli.</p>

</fig>
<p>A diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis was made and the patient was started on intravenous Penicillin G 8 MU 8 hourly, Metronidazole 500 mg 8 hourly and Clindamycin 600 mg 12 hourly. A fasciotomy of both anterior and posterior compartments of the arm, both volar and dorsal compartments of the forearm with two separate incisions, extending to hand was performed. There was extensive necrosis of triceps and proximal muscle in the extensor compartment of the forearm with gas formation. The volar compartments of the forearm and arm were spared. Necrosed muscles were debrided and the wound left open for secondary healing. An anaerobic culture of blister fluid and necrotic tissue revealed <italic>Clostridium welchii</italic>. The wounds were debrided, dressed daily and were subsequently covered with split thickness skin grafts. The patient had good functional recovery.</p>
<p>Clostridial myonecrosis occurring after an intramuscular injection is rare and requires inoculation of the clostridial spores or the organism with presence of an anaerobic environment. The source of the organism can be contaminated parenteral solutions, needles or syringes, especially in illicit drug abusers and antiseptic solutions. Amputation of limb is the usual outcome. Attempts at limb preservation rarely succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412459156">Aggelidakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412459156">Bryant and Stevens, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The most common intramuscular injections associated with gas gangrene are adrenaline and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412459156">Harvey and Purnell, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412459156">Rodriguez et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Clostridium welchii</italic> accounts for the majority of cases, while <italic>C. septicum, C. histolyticum</italic> and <italic>C. novyi</italic> cause most of the other cases. <italic>C. welchii</italic> possesses 12 active tissue toxins and endotoxins. The α- toxin is important in the initiation of muscle infections that may progress to gas gangrene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412459156">Bryant and Stevens, 2010</xref>). Non-clostridial organisms like <italic>E. coli</italic>, aerobic and anaerobic streptococci also cause gas-forming soft tissue infection, especially in diabetics. Plain X-rays identify gas in deep tissues and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may assess spreading of the infection along fascial planes. Needle aspiration or biopsy may identify the etiological agent, but should not delay definitive treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412459156">Aggelidakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412459156">Bryant and Stevens, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Signs of systemic toxicity develop rapidly and many patients present with septic shock. However, most of the cases of limb salvage reported in literature did not present with fulminant systemic disease and the duration of symptoms was less than 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412459156">Aggelidakis et al., 2011</xref>). This may indicate a less aggressive form of the disease or a better treatment outcome because of early diagnosis. Our patient presented within 48 h of injection and 24 h of the onset of symptoms with features of toxaemia.</p>
<p>Cases with aggressive infection are more likely to have advanced local infection that precludes limb salvage, but there is no evidence that amputation controls infection better than adequate surgical debridement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412459156">Aggelidakis et al., 2011</xref>). The realistic likelihood of functional recovery of the limb must be balanced against the risk of death associated with limb salvage. In the upper limb, even minimal preservation of the movement and sensation is better than prosthesis. In conclusion, early liberal fasciotomy, debridement and medical management may be able to salvage the limb in selected cases of gas gangrene.</p>
