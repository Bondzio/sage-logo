<p>This is a book that does everything it promises and almost everything it should. It is founded on a series of arguments, some uncontroversial, some more challenging, relating to a part of the globe about which business school–based scholarship tells us surprisingly little, especially if we think about the global distribution of financial wealth or the cultural roots of scholarship. As an edited collection, it is remarkably coherent—all the contributors respond to the core aim of working towards development of culturally appropriate understandings of leadership. As the editors note, leadership and the development practices conducted in its name rarely acknowledge the depth or detail of cultural circumstance. This book does an enormous amount to challenge the continuing, remarkable resistance to the possibility that culture is significant for us as more than a set of measurable binaries. The authors propose, repeatedly, that empirical, conceptual and philosophical or metaphysical cultures ought to be much more sensitively approached.</p>
<p>The chapters are mostly organized according to nation state geography within the wider idea of the Middle East. (Happily, the editors make clear their sensitivity to both this term and the continuing contestation of boundaries around countries, and there are some notable national absences, most obviously Israel.) Three of the contributions analyse the entire region, examining the intersection of leadership with globalization, change and gender/sex. One chapter takes Islam as its central problematic; two others, the introductory and concluding contributions, speak to wider concerns of political economy and ethics. The remaining eight chapters explore Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Oman, Iran, Egypt, Turkey and Yemen.</p>
<p>However, this book does much more than reiterate a familiar argument about cultural context or the importance of local conditions. The cover photograph of the sun rising behind a mosque dome and its minarets suggest that religious belief will be present in the text; this is confirmed on the first page of the editors’ preface when they refer to the ‘fundamental faith’ that frames organization, management and leadership practices in the area they have been working in as educators and researchers for many years. This aspect of the book is especially welcome, perhaps indicating that business school research is starting to acknowledge its increasingly post-secular context.</p>
<p>The majority of contributors are based in business schools. The first editor and consultant Tony Murfin provide the introduction to the book and the issues it addresses. Rodney Wilson, the first contributor based outside a b-school in a department of government, explores globalization and governance. He concentrates on the emergence of Arab multinationals and the shift from family ownership to market-listed organizations. Abbas Ali then confronts the cultural dynamic that is perhaps the most neglected or silent in transnational studies of leadership, religion. He argues, perhaps surprisingly, that some forms of Islamic belief chime with the more enlightened and humanistic versions of what leadership can be. Abubakr Suliman and Rehana Hayat then take the relatively new state of the United Arab Emirates as their organizing principle, focusing on political leadership’s effects on the society. They also note the differential effects of leading and organizing on women.</p>
<p>Christopher Rees, Rashid Althakri and Aminu Mamman then present a collaborative analysis of change in a public sector organization (the second author’s employer). This chapter has strong roots in development studies, presenting the argument that leadership of organizational change is culturally and temporally located. Richard Common then returns to the issue of political leadership and the effect this has on a dominant public sector. Familial and tribal interdependence is also highlighted, to emphasize the lack of traction that North American/North Atlantic leadership theories have. Following this, the editors contribute a chapter aimed at examining both philosophy and practice in leadership development in Saudi Arabia. Again, the economic, social and cultural are centre stage, contributing to another iteration of the argument against theory importation.</p>
<p>Following this, Samir Abuznaid and David Weir take the country of Jordan as their empirical context, to survey existing research and speculate on future trends. One of the most controversial states in the region, Iran, is examined by Kate Hutchings, Kavoos Mohannak and Sen Sendjaya, all three authors currently based in Australia. This is another contribution that notes a lack of published research, empirical or conceptual, and lays a useful foundation for the future. Interestingly, it concludes with a set of 11 fairly prescriptive ‘recommendations for international managers’. Gillian Rice then explores Egypt, currently the highest profile as well as the most populous country in the region. This chapter provides perhaps the most detailed national profile but is still keen to draw general conclusions about people and practices.</p>
<p>The country historically defined as the gateway to the Middle East, Turkey, is the source of Mustafa Özbilgin’s arguments. He makes a strong, conceptually informed case for more emic approaches to generate data and theory that are more appropriate and meaningful. Nabil Sultan follows this thread in his account of entrepreneurial leadership in what he calls a ‘troubled’ country, Yemen. This chapter, as many others, also has a secondary focus on the position of women. The first editor and Lulwa Mutlaq, a senior vice president in a banking corporation, then take the idea of the feminine as their central theme in the next chapter, which also returns to a wider sense of the region rather than a specific country. This chapter hosts a theoretically and empirically powerful argument, in part by emphasizing the ethical nature of leadership and development. The final chapter, written by both editors and Tony Murfin, moves further into ethics to propose workplaces as crucial to social reform. As might be expected in such a culturally sensitive collection, this proposal is based on the possibility of a locally developed approach to the idea of reform.</p>
<p>I was keen to review this book for a few reasons, mostly related to my own research interest in how religious beliefs are manifested in workplaces. In addition, I visited the region for the first time in March 2012, for various reasons. First, I was curious; second, I was invited to and hosted by the University of Business Administration in Jeddah; but third, most significantly, I was acting as the male ‘guardian’ for the person I live with, who is also sometimes an academic collaborator. She was the person the college faculty really wanted to meet, and she was advised that a visit would be easier if I travelled with her. It was entertaining and intriguing for me to be in this extremely ambiguous position. The week or so there was the most culturally surprising experience of my life so far, in ways that I have not been able to understand yet—that is going to take a while. This book has helped enormously.</p>
<p>There are two very obvious aspects to Saudi Arabia, perhaps the exemplary Middle Eastern society for Europeans, that are especially salient: religious belief and gender (or perhaps sex). This book begins to open the possibility of experiencing, thinking about, talking and writing about, these two oddly prominent but hidden aspects of everyday life in the Middle East. In this respect alone, it is a valuable contribution to the field. In addition to that, however, it also provides a model of collaborative working. It involves business school faculty, academics from closely related fields, doctoral researchers, consultants and some of the people employed by organizations in the region. Finally, the book notes both the complexity and the commonalities of this most controversial of global regions.</p>
<p>In addition to all the good ingredients listed here, there are gaps. For some, this might mean that the book should be read as flawed, something to be dismissed or criticized. However, it is only possible to identify gaps once the process of mapping has begun. Some of the chapters are repetitive, especially when they note the lack of research to review, of the lack of cultural sensitivity in existing theory. I also found the relatively uncritical reviews of the Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) project a little puzzling. Finally, it would have been helpful to read more about human transitions between Middle Eastern societies and, for example, European countries— this is surely one of the most intriguing ways to understand culture.</p>
<p>To sum up: this book, in most of its parts, makes significant empirical, practical and theoretical contributions to the field of leadership studies and management learning. It will be helpful, useful and insightful for research, education and practice. The conceptual work that the editors and collaborator do in the introduction and concluding chapter will be valuable in framing future research. Alongside all these good things, the book is mostly written to attract readers rather than repel them. In this respect, it is suitable for most readers, including those familiar with the region and those with curiosity but limited knowledge of it.</p>
