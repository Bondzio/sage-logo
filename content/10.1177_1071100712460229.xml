<sec id="section1-1071100712460229">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Widespread evidence exists for directed patient information interventions (eg, pamphlets) in the setting of several orthopaedic conditions and interventions. Up until now, no study had assessed the role of these interventions in the management of patients following ankle fractures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460229">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Between 2005 and 2007, 40 patients who suffered an operative ankle fracture were randomized to either a standard treatment group for an ankle fracture or an enhanced information group who received an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ankle fracture information pamphlet that explained postoperative routine at our institution and a physiotherapy handout depicting a standard protocol. Study participants were followed for 3 months clinically and radiographically. At the 6-week and 3-month intervals, study participants completed the Olerud-Molander Questionnaire and 2 questions regarding their level of satisfaction. The primary outcome measure was the Likert-scale-based survey question determining the level of satisfaction with the treating staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460229">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Participants in the enhanced information group were more satisfied with treatment at 3 months (9.2 vs 6.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There were significant improvements in work/activity ability at 6 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .01), but this advantage disappeared at 3 months (<italic>P</italic> = .24). No differences in postoperative complication rates were noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460229">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Information enhancement in the form of pamphlets can be helpful in providing patients with accessible information in the postoperative period. While they do not seem to have a sustained impact on postoperative outcomes, handouts may enhance the interaction between staff and patient at postoperative visits, improving patient satisfaction.</p>

<body>
<p>Ankle fractures are a common injury in the United States, with 4.2 ankle fractures occurrences per 1000 Medicare enrollees annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460229">9</xref></sup> These injuries are commonly managed operatively, with an operative intervention rate of 7% for isolated lateral malleolar ankle fractures and 74% for trimalleolar fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460229">9</xref></sup> Although somewhat controversial, rehabilitation following the open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of ankle fractures usually includes a period of casting, followed by progressive weightbearing on the injured limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460229">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460229">11</xref></sup> During this phase of increasing activity and mobilization, exercises are often prescribed by the treating surgeon or allied health care professionals. This period of remobilization has been studied in an effort to shorten the duration of rehabilitation that is required post–ankle fracture, to improve on both short- and long-term outcomes, and to increase overall patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460229">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460229">2</xref></sup> These interventions, however, have been limited to variations in “safe mobilization” instruction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460229">4</xref></sup> the exercises prescribed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460229">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460229">6</xref></sup> and the method and duration of immobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460229">2</xref></sup> There has been little research into interventions aimed at assessing and improving patients’ knowledge and understanding of their ankle fracture and its treatment following ORIF, as a means of improving their outcomes and satisfaction level.</p>
<p>Pamphlets and patient education interventions are used to give patients a better understanding of medical conditions. While information pamphlets have been shown to be very effective across several areas of orthopaedic surgery and medicine as a whole,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460229">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460229">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460229">10</xref></sup> their utility in the setting of orthopaedic extremity trauma remains unknown. Most important, the effect of information-based interventions on the level of satisfaction that a patient has regarding the attending orthopaedic care team has never been shown. This prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether an ankle fracture information pamphlet, combined with a designed physiotherapy pamphlet, could affect patient satisfaction with the attending orthopaedic care team and outcome in the first 3 months following ORIF of a fractured ankle.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460229" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Following approval from the institutional research ethics board at our institution, 41 patients were identified at the 2-week follow-up visit following ORIF of an ankle fracture. These 41 identified patients were all found to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460229">Table 1</xref>) and subsequently provided informed consent to enroll in the study. One patient was initially thought to have a trimalleolar fracture but on further review suffered from a pilon fracture. This patient was at that point excluded from the remainder of the study. This left 20 participants in the STG and 20 in the EIG. General health information was collected from all participants. The participants’ characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712460229">Table 2</xref>. Preoperative radiographs of the same 40 included participants were analyzed. Of the 40 included cases, 10 were single lateral malleolar (AO 44-A2.1 and 44-B2.1) fractures, 23 were bimalleolar (AO 44A3.3, 44-A2.3, and 44B2.2) fractures, and 7 were trimalleolar (AO 44-B3 and 44-C1.3) fractures. Furthermore, there were 11 dislocated, 21 subluxed, and 8 located ankles that were unstable on stress examination and included in the study.</p>

<title>Randomization Process</title>
<p>The odd-versus-even hospital medical record number system was used for randomization (standard/control group vs experimental group, respectively). The 40 participants were randomized to receive no information package (standard of care, control group) or an information package that contained 2 components: (1) an educational handout summarizing what to expect following ankle fracture repair and (2) a handout depicting standardized self-administered physiotherapy exercises to assist in the rehabilitation process (experimental group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460229">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460229">2</xref>). Twenty participants were randomized to the standard treatment group (STG), while 21 were randomized to the educational intervention group (EIG).</p>

<sec id="section8-1071100712460229">
<title>Surgery and Postoperative Care</title>
<p>The type of operative intervention was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Both groups received the current institutional standard of care postoperatively. Immediately following ORIF of the ankle, all study participants were placed in a bulky plaster splint. The participants were asked to remain nonweightbearing and were instructed regarding safe crutch ambulation prior to discharge home. All participants in the study were managed as outpatients. They returned to the fracture clinic at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months following surgery. At the 2-week visit, sutures or staples were removed, and the study participants were typically transitioned to a removable cast boot. Protected weightbearing was permitted for simple fracture patterns with stable fixation, while comminuted or markedly unstable fractures were kept nonweightbearing. At the 6-week postoperative visit, participants with clinically and radiographically united fractures were permitted full weightbearing without a splint. At 3 months following surgery, all study participants were encouraged to return to full activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712460229">
<title>Follow-up</title>
<p>Study participants were reviewed clinically and radiographically at each clinic visit. Radiographs included anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views of the affected ankle. Clinical and radiographic complications were recorded, which notably included, but was not limited to: (1) the development of a radiographically notable osteochondral lesion of the talus; (2) malunion greater than 5 degrees in any plane, demonstrable shortening of the fibula, or any notable rotational displacement; (3) delayed union, defined as no radiographic healing at the final 3-month follow-up mark. At each visit, study questionnaires were administered after the participant saw the treating physician but prior to leaving the clinic. All participants were asked to complete the Olerud-Molander Questionnaire, which evaluated ankle pain, stiffness and swelling, and performance of activities, such as stair climbing, running, jumping, use of supports, and return to preinjury functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460229">7</xref></sup> All participants were also asked to complete a visual analog scale to assess their satisfaction in “how [they] were treated by staff” and current ankle functioning. Radiographs at the 6-week and 3-month marks were collected and evaluated by a blinded, fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist not involved in the care of the treated participants. Any radiographic evidence of complication or diagnosis was noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1071100712460229">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>At the outset the study, participants’ rating of satisfaction with the treating staff was defined as the primary outcome. All other outcomes data were determined to be secondary outcomes. Statistical differences between the groups were calculated using paired <italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square tests. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. A post hoc power analysis for a Student <italic>t</italic> test was performed to determine if the study was adequately powered to determine a true difference in means of the measured samples. Of the original 40 participants enrolled in the study, completed data were collected for 38 participants. Both participants lost to follow-up were in the STG. Even in account of this loss of follow-up, with a demonstrated effect size (Cohen <italic>d</italic>) of 5.53 in the primary outcome at 3 months and a sample size of 38 at final follow-up, the observed power was 1.0.</p>

<sec id="section12-1071100712460229">
<title>Functional Outcomes Data: Primary Outcome</title>
<p>Although at the 6-week mark, there was no detectable difference between the groups regarding their satisfaction with the staff (6.2 ± 2.8 vs 7.5 ± 2.3; <italic>P</italic> = .89), by 3 months participants in the EIG were significantly more satisfied with the staff (9.2 ± 0.69 vs 6.3 ± 3.2; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<sec id="section13-1071100712460229">
<title>Functional Outcomes Data: Secondary Outcomes</title>
<p>There were no significant differences between the Olerud-Molander Questionnaire results observed between treatment groups. There were, however, a few trends noted. Although the EIG trended toward significance at the 6-week mark in the stiffness (<italic>P</italic> = .10) and squatting ability (<italic>P</italic> = .08), all differences were lost by 3 months (<italic>P</italic> = .94 and .53, respectively). There were no significant differences between participant groups regarding usage of supportive/assistive devices (<italic>P</italic> = .24).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1071100712460229">
<title>Complications and Follow-up</title>
<p>During the course of the study, 3 delayed unions occurred. Similarly, 3 malunions also occurred. One of the 3 malunions required reoperation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712460229">Table 3</xref>). This was the lone reoperation in both groups, which yielded an overall reoperation rate of 2.5%. Two osteochondral injuries were noted in the STG, while only 1 was noted in the EIG. There were no cases of deep infection. No study participants were diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome. The calculated complication rate was not statistically different between groups, with 25% in the EIG (which included 3 malunions, 1 reoperation, and 1 noted talar osteochondral injury) versus 10% in the control (2 talar osteochondral injuries; <italic>P</italic> = .22).</p>

<p>To ensure that those in the STG who were lost to follow-up did not have a potentially confounding effect on our conclusions and sample size calculation, the same post hoc power calculation was calculated by entering in a maximally satisfied response for the missing 3 individuals (ie, score of 10 out of 10 for question regarding patient satisfaction with the staff). Despite this, the difference between groups remained highly significant (6.7 ± 3.2 vs 9.3 ± 0.7; <italic>P</italic> = .001); based on the observed effect size (or Cohen <italic>d</italic>) of 4.82, the observed power remained 1.0.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The orthopaedic clinic setting has been determined to be a very opportune location to use educational interventions related to orthopaedic care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460229">10</xref></sup> Pamphlet-type interventions provided in the orthopaedic clinic setting have been shown to be agreeable to the patients receiving them and have been shown to significantly improve knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460229">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460229">8</xref></sup> It was anticipated that extending the use of a pamphlet intervention to transfer knowledge to patients regarding their ankle fracture would similarly improve their insight surrounding their injury. In a busy fracture clinic setting, patients often have a limited time to interact with their physicians. It was hoped that with improved understanding of the injury, the patients’ interactions with their orthopaedic caregivers would improve. Despite our relatively small numbers, an adequate sample size was obtained. This sample demonstrated a strong association between patient satisfaction with the treating staff and the use of educational handouts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>It is plausible that having a learned insight into the usual postoperative course, in this case, could have contributed significantly to the patients’ understanding of the condition. We believe that study participants in the EIG potentially had an increased awareness and, therefore, patience for their progress through the early rehabilitation process. This may have led to the increased satisfaction with the treating orthopaedic care team.</p>
<p>Educational handouts in this study did not seem to affect functional outcomes following ankle fractures. Study participants in both groups were weightbearing and moving their ankles at equal time intervals. Even optimized physiotherapy programs instituted following ankle fracture have shown questionable benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460229">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, we did not assess study participants’ compliance with the physiotherapy handout recommendations. We do not believe that supplying ankle fracture patients with a generic physiotherapy handout will necessarily affect overall functional outcome following an ankle fracture. The value of the handouts is likely predominantly educational and psychological.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460229">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460229">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460229">10</xref></sup> It is plausible, however, that some motivated patients may reap some undetected benefits, when supplied a physiotherapy handout during the postoperative period. This, in our minds, may be sufficient reasoning for supplying such a handout to the general postoperative ankle fracture population.</p>
<p>In the context of the study, <italic>staff</italic> was a somewhat flexible term. Although most of the nursing, physiotherapy, and allied health care staff that assisted the physician-led fracture care team were trained and experienced in the care of postoperative fracture patients, learners and less experienced individuals taking part in patient care were a reality. In the case of a setting where highly trained and experienced staff were always present, a similar study might have demonstrated a different result. But in the case where patient care staff fluctuate, typified by a hospital where medical and allied health care learners are present, the results of this study would be highly applicable. This environment would heighten the need to standardize the information given to patients, which could be facilitated with the pamphlets used in this study. It could—and, in the case of this study, did—also provide information and guidance for learners and less experienced staff to read prior to helping care for patients.</p>
<p>The length of follow-up was decided before the outset of the study to be 3 months, for 2 reasons. First, in the trauma population, especially in a city that has a relatively high percentage of transient populations (eg, university students, military service members), longer-term follow-up can be very difficult, if not entirely unpractical. Second, it is our experience that patients following operated ankle fractures have the most discomfort and difficulty and must make the most dramatic adjustments in their lives during the first 3 months following their surgery. It naturally follows that during this time patients seem to have the most questions for the care team. Given the constraints of the current health care system, being able to take the time to answer all of the questions can be difficult. This study was therefore designed to assess novel ways of approaching this difficult but potentially better-managed period of time.</p>
<p>This prospective randomized study has an easily interpretable and highly relevant primary outcome measure and was adequately powered for the simple research question posed. It potentially demonstrated a relatively inexpensive and effective method of improving the working relationships between participants and staff in the setting of a busy orthopaedic fracture clinic. The most compelling limitations of this study is the small number of study participants enrolled (n = 40) and the short-term follow-up. Since we were most interested in the early postoperative results, we restricted the study to a 3-month time course. Despite the small numbers, the substantial improvement in satisfaction achieved may validate the use of more educational tools in orthopaedic foot and ankle trauma care.</p>
<p>In conclusion, handouts show promise in being helpful to provide ankle fracture patients with accessible information in the postoperative period. They do not seem to have any significant impact on their functional outcomes. They seem to enhance the patients’ satisfaction with their care following operative treatment of a rotational ankle fracture.</p>
