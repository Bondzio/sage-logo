<abstract>
<p>The past two decades have witnessed increasing global acceptance of the important role that capable leadership plays in education reform and school improvement. Consequently, policymakers internationally have actively sought means of strengthening capacity for school-level leadership, with a particular focus on the design of more effective programmes of administrator preparation and development. In this article we examine trends in the design of graduate education programmes offered in the related domains of business management and publication administration. We analyse data extracted from on-line descriptions of three types of master’s degree programmes: master of business administration (MBA); master of public administration (MPA); and MBA programmes with a concentration in education (MBA-Ed). The study identifies patterns in the programme structure, curriculum content and learning methods employed in these graduate management programmes. The analysis yields features that could add potential value to university-based master of education degree programmes aimed at principal preparation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past decade has been a period of global ferment in the preparation and development of principals and educational leaders in general. Whereas in the USA formal administrator preparation has a history dating back more than 60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485464">Bridges, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485464">Cooper and Boyd, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485464">Griffiths, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143213485464">Griffiths et al., 1987</xref>; Hallinger and Murphy, 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143213485464">McCarthy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143213485464">Murphy and Hallinger, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143213485464">Murphy and Vriesenga, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143213485464">Silver, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143213485464">Wyn, 1972</xref>), in most parts of the world, the initiation of systems of formal preparation and development of school principals is a more recent phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143213485464">Brundrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143213485464">Huber, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143213485464">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143213485464">Lumby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143213485464">Walker and Dimmock 2006</xref>). The current context is, therefore, characterized by expansion of preparation programmes as well as by increased experimentation with different approaches to principal preparation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Bridges, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">Huber, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143213485464">Jackson and Kelley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143213485464">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143213485464">Murphy and Vriesenga, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485464">Peterson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, designers of principal preparation programmes have not only sought information on programmes offered by institutions in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143213485464">Baron et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">Huber, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143213485464">Moyle and Andrews, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143213485464">Murphy and Hallinger, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143213485464">Walker, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143213485464">Walker, et al., 1996</xref>), but also from other sectors of professional education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Snidvongs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485464">Hart, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143213485464">1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143213485464">McCarthy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143213485464">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485464">Peterson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143213485464">Wyn, 1972</xref>). For example, during the 1980s, the University Council for Educational Administration in the USA launched a Center on Cases in Educational Administration that borrowed heavily from similar efforts in business schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143213485464">Christensen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143213485464">Gragg, 1941</xref>). During the 1990s, innovations in medical education led to the adaptation of problem-based learning for the education of school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485464">1995</xref>). Other examples of school leadership preparation adapting methods drawn from other domains of professional education include mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143213485464">Crow and Matthews, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143213485464">Moir and Bloom, 2003</xref>), coaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143213485464">Barnett, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143213485464">Peterson, 2002</xref>), e-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143213485464">Garrison and Anderson, 2003</xref>), structured reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143213485464">Hart, 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143213485464">1993b</xref>) and computer simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Kantamara, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143213485464">Hallinger and McCary, 1990</xref>). The prevalence of this cross-disciplinary sharing of educational practices suggests the permeability of boundaries between fields of professional education.</p>
<p>Recently, the National College for School Leaders in the UK undertook a project to rethink the linkages between their leadership preparation programmes and university-based master of education degree programmes. In addition to exploring current programme structure and content offered in master of education programmes globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143213485464">Walker, Bryant and Lee, 2013</xref>), they also wished to examine approaches used in MBA and MPA degree programmes. In this paper we report the results of this effort to understand current trends in graduate management education in the business and public administration sectors. We began by identifying a set of high profile MBA, MPA and MBA-Ed programmes offered in various parts of the world. We examined features of their programme structure, curriculum design and instructional delivery. Our goal was to identify innovations in these domains that could potentially add value to current educational approaches employed in the preparation of educational leaders.</p>
<p>At the outset, we acknowledge that the long-standing tendency of the schools sector to ‘borrow’ practices from the business sector is not without its critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143213485464">Callahan, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143213485464">Halford and Leonard 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Snidvongs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143213485464">Lumby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485464">March, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143213485464">Tyack and Hansot, 1982</xref>). Scholars and practitioners have questioned whether models of business management <italic>should</italic> be used to inform practices used in leading schools. Critics have pointed to differences in the underlying goals and values of education and business enterprises as factors that moderate the efficacy of modeling either the preparation or practice of educational leadership on business management (Ball, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143213485464">Halford and Leonard 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143213485464">Randle and Brady, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143213485464">Wong, 2008</xref>). With these limitations in mind, the authors encourage readers to assess recommendations from this current effort to examine the preparation of managers for the business and public sectors with an open, but critical mindset.</p>

<title>Administrator Preparation: An Overview</title>
<p>In this section of the article we provide perspective on the relationship between management education in the education and business sectors. Our goal is to provide a foundation for a grounded examination of trends in the business and public administration preparation programmes discussed in the results section. We begin with an historical overview of the administrator preparation in education. This is followed by a brief review of recent critiques of management education in the business sector.</p>

<title>School Administrator Preparation in Historical Perspective</title>
<p>As suggested above, educational administration has had a long and ambivalent relationship with the world of business management. Dating back to the early 20th century in the USA, scholars such as Elwood Cubberly were strongly influenced by ‘scientific management practices’ employed in the business community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143213485464">Tyack and Hansot, 1982</xref>). Reaction against the idea that education should be ‘managed as a business’ was aptly captured in Raymond Callahan’s (1962) classic book, <italic>Education and the Cult of Efficiency</italic>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many important innovations that have been adopted in the preparation of educational administrators originated in business schools. For example, over 60 years ago, Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143213485464">Gragg (1941</xref>), an originator of case teaching at the Harvard Business School, stated: ‘Education in the professions should prepare students for action.’ Gragg's assertion was however at odds with prevailing approaches to management education of his era. He observed that management preparation programmes in business were employing methods that focused on teaching students <italic>about</italic> <italic>the roles of managers</italic>. However, he asserted that these programmes were failing to prepare them with the capacity to think and act successfully in those roles. Gragg’s work led to long-term development of case teaching as a foundation for the teaching and learning methods used in both business and education faculties internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143213485464">Ackerman and Maslin-Ostrowski 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143213485464">Andrews, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485464">Bridges, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143213485464">Christensen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143213485464">Garvin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143213485464">Griffiths, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143213485464">HBS, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143213485464">McNair, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143213485464">Merseth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143213485464">Wyn, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost 40 years after Gragg's seminal work at the Harvard Business School, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143213485464">Bridges (1977</xref>) conducted an insightful analysis that compared the work of educational leaders with the tasks of students in administrator preparation programmes along four dimensions: rhythm of the work, hierarchical nature of the work, character of work-related communications and the role of emotions in work. He concluded that there was a major disjunction between the work of a student and the work of a manager. He further contended that this disjunction may result in ‘trained incapacity’ among graduates of management education programmes as they transition to positions of management responsibility in the workplace. To paraphrase Kenneth Burke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143213485464">Bridges (1977</xref>) asserted that the student ‘becomes unfit by being fit for an unfit fitness’. Notably, Bridges’ critique applied equally to modal practices employed in preparation programmes for managers in the education and business sectors.</p>
<p>Since the the publication of Bridges’ critique, the pendulum has swung back and forth several more times as educators have sought to come to terms with periodic calls for schools to be managed more efficiently and effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485464">Cooper and Boyd, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485464">Griffiths, 1988</xref>; Griffiths et al., 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143213485464">McCarthy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2006</xref>). When these calls are issued by government policymakers, business management is often proposed as a model for the management of schools. Thus, there is a periodic tendency to seek guidance from management education programmes in the business sector in the hope that they might yield ideas with relevance for management education in the schools sector.</p>
<p>In the USA, a defining example of this trend took place at Stanford University in the 1970s. Stanford’s School of Education launched an innovative master’s degree in education with a concentration in ‘administration and policy analysis’. This programme included courses typically associated with MBA and MPA programmes, including economics of education, politics of education, sociology of organizations, organizational behaviour and management decision science. Conspicuous by its absence in the programme was any content whatsoever that focused on leading learning and teaching in schools. Despite Stanford University’s status as the top-ranked school of education in the USA at the time, this model never became influential as it became perceived as largely irrelevant to the needs of school-level leaders.</p>
<p>Reinvigorating preparation and development programmes with content and methods borrowed from other professions forces us to examine current practices through fresh perspectives. However, it is not without limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485464">1995</xref>). Indeed, it should be noted that MBA programmes themselves have been the subject of a series of persisting critiques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Bridges, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143213485464">Mintzberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741143213485464">Pfeffer and Fong, 2004</xref>). These critiques actually highlight some of the same deficiencies identified in education management preparation programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143213485464">Bridges, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143213485464">Griffiths, 1988</xref>; Griffiths et al., 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143213485464">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485464">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143213485464">Mintzberg (2002</xref>) questioned whether MBA programmes are producing graduates with the ‘right stuff’ to manage people and organizations for results. More specifically, his critique included the following points:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Many MBA students enter their programmes with an insufficient base of experience upon which to develop the ‘wisdom of practice’ that should be a fundamental outcome of a master’s degree programme in management.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In the absence of students and faculty with significant management experience, graduate programmes tend to focus on what the faculty members know best, content drawn from the academic disciplines.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This results in an MBA curriculum that is organized around the delivery of functional knowledge (that is, marketing, economics, decision science, finance) and which emphasizes the development of skills in analysis and calculating.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Conventional MBA students graduate with the impression that <italic>management</italic> is synonymous with <italic>analysis</italic>, specifically the making of systematic decisions and the formulation of deliberate strategies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Graduates are, therefore, often ill prepared for the predominant ‘work of managers’ which involves solving messy, value-laden, ambiguous problems that often have no clear solution. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143213485464">Mintzberg, 2002</xref>: 10)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143213485464">Bennis and O’Toole (2005</xref>) further argued that the growing emphasis in business schools on ‘scientific’ research has accentuated the tendency to hire faculty members who lack management experience. Consequently, graduates who are often ill equipped to tackle complex, unquantifiable issues that require manages to make judgments on the basis of messy and incomplete data (Bennis and O'Toole, 2005: 96–102). These critiques reprise the analysis offered by Gragg in 1941 and Bridges in 1977. This suggests that business schools continue to struggle with some of the same fundamental challenges of educationg leaders for successful practice as education schools.</p>
<p>Moreover, it should also be noted that no consensus has emerged on the optimal response to these critiques. Nonetheless, the critiques have, over the past decade, stimulated leaders of business schools to reconsider the goals, content and methods of graduate education in their field. Our study seeks to distill potentially relevant lessons for the design of graduate programmes in educational leadership and management.</p>
<p>We wish to reemphasize that this analysis does <italic>not</italic> propose that methods and content of business management education are <italic>directly applicable</italic> to the preparation of leaders for schools. If there is a single lesson that holds true from the management literature of the past century, it is that <italic>context makes a difference in the management of organizations, including schools </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143213485464">Belchetz and Leithwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143213485464">Cuban, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143213485464">Goldring et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485464">March, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741143213485464">Weick, 1976</xref>). Thus, our goal in this article is <italic>not</italic> to use graduate education in business and public administration as templates for preparing school leaders. Instead, our goal is to identify <italic>value-added dimensions</italic> that could enhance preparation programmes for principals and other school leaders. To discount, out-of-hand, the possible relevance of new developments in related domains of professional education would be both short-sighted and limit the future development of our field.</p>

<p>The MPA degree has the core mission ‘to develop the capacity of graduates to exercise delegated public authority wisely, effectively and lawfully’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485464">Henry et al., 2009</xref>: 122). To fulfil the mission, the Task Force on Educating for Excellence in the Master of Public Administration Degree identified two goals that should be accomplished by graduate programmes in public administration:
<disp-quote>
<p>First, transmittal of a full awareness of the broad issues of constitutionalism, politics, and democratic theory that are innately embedded in the practice of public administration in a republic such as ours; and second, transmittal of the essential professional, or ‘craft’ knowledge of the field, along with experiential exposure of students to the world of practice, by means of non-classroom projects, internships, case studies, practitioner involvement in teaching, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143213485464">Henry et al., 2009</xref>: 122)</p>
</disp-quote> It is interesting to note the substantial extent to which these objectives overlap with goals described in 21st century educational leadership and management curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">Huber, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143213485464">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143213485464">Lumby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485464">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143213485464">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143213485464">Walker and Dimmock, 2006</xref>). We also observed that both MBA and MPA programmes goals are designed around their core businesses: serving the market and serving the public, respectively. For educational management programmes, we suggest that programme goals should similarly give primacy to the ‘core business’ of schools: learning and teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143213485464">
<title>Course Content</title>
<p>This section examines the types of courses and relative emphasis given to difference course domains across the various MBA and MPA programmes. Although ‘averaging courses across programmes’ is not the optimal means of identifying curriculum contents, a synthesis of the findings yielded a number of key foci within the business programmes: decision making; finance, accounting and economics; people management; strategic management; marketing management; operations and project management; research and statistics; and global and future perspectives. Courses unique to the MBA-Ed programmes included school management, school learning, educational policy and law. Simply listing these courses is however not overly productive when considering their relevance for the construction of principal preparation programmes. Therefore, we selected several of these courses for additional comment.</p>
<sec id="section8-1741143213485464">
<title>Decision Making</title>
<p>Courses in decision making included two main types: courses focused on mathematical approaches to decision making (for example, business statistics and management decision science), and courses that emphasized the use and analysis of information for decision making. These courses were especially prominently in the MBA programmes. Given the current accountability and evidence-based foci that predominate in the global education environment, this focus on decision making seems highly relevant for principal preparation programmes.</p>
<p>Our recommendation would, however, be to emphasize the ‘use of information for decision-making’ rather a ‘decision science approach’. This, for example, would emphasize learning how to think about and ask questions that then draw upon data in the school environment for making decisions (for example, test data, surveys of teacher, student and parent perceptions, teacher evaluation data, enrolment trends, marketing data). A problem-focused approach to learning how to synthesize this type of information for making decisions seems most appropriate to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485464">Goldring and Berends, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Snidvongs, 2008</xref>). This should also include how to incorporate data effectively into presentations to different stakeholder groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741143213485464">
<title>People Management</title>
<p>This included a variety of courses that included leadership, organizational behaviour and various courses in human resource management. These courses received emphasis across all of three types of master’s degree programmes and appear relevant for principal preparation programmes. Most of the MBA-Ed programmes included at least one course that focused on leadership and management in schools with the content adapted explicitly for the education context.</p>
<p>Although coursework related to people management is already well-represented in preparation programmes for school leaders, we would note one facet of possible value-added dimension that is given greater attention in MBA programmes in particular. This is human resource strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143213485464">Becker et al., 2001</xref>). Increasingly, the business sector is paying greater attention the means by which vision and strategy for improvement are linked to the management of human resources. Although many educators have criticized the ways in which performance management (one type of HR tool) has been implemented in the schools sector (Ball, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143213485464">Halford and Leonard 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143213485464">Randle and Brady, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143213485464">Wong, 2008</xref>), this does not discount the potential of these tools when directed towards our own desired goals. At a minimum, educational leaders should become more conversant with these tools, if only to influence their use in more productive directions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1741143213485464">
<title>Strategic Management</title>
<p>Courses falling within this domain (for example, strategic management, strategic planning, competitive strategy) were common fare in every MBA programme though less so in the MPA. The latter trend with respect to MPA programmes mirrors traditional master of education programmes around the world. Both public administrators and education administrators have not traditionally viewed their organizations as operating in competitive environments. Thus, preparation programmes have tended not to ignore this content.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the global context of education and education management has changed rapidly in the past decade. One effect has been the introduction of considerably more competition into education systems from the USA to China to the UK. Morevoer, even in the absence of overt competition, strategic planning appears relevant to the future development of schools (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143213485464">Davies, 2003</xref>). Thus, the MBA-Ed programmes have generally responded to this trend through inclusion of coursework in strategic planning and leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1741143213485464">
<title>Customer Orientation</title>
<p>As noted earlier, MBA programmes appear to be crystal clear about ensuring that their coursework focuses on the key goals of business enterprises: meeting the needs customers. We observed that customer orientation is incorporated into a variety of courses related not only to marketing, but other coursework in MBA programs such as information management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485464">Cooper, 2002</xref>), strategic management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143213485464">Kaplan, 2004</xref>) and project management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143213485464">Barkley and Saylor, 2001</xref>). Although courses evidencing a strong customer orientation strongly in the MBA programmes, but they hardly appear at all in either the MPA or MBA-Ed programmes.</p>
<p>A strong customer orientation is, however, taking on greater importance as the education sector becomes more market oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2003</xref>). In an increasing number of contexts around the world, even public schools must compete for students. Moreover, we would argue that today’s school leaders need to become more adept at understanding and meeting the needs of their customers, whether those are defined as the public at-large, local communities, parents or students. This argues for programme content that develops a customer orientation and basic knowledge of marketing for schools (for example, within a course on strategic leadership and planning), even if it does not warrant a separate course in preparation programmes for school leaders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741143213485464">
<title>Operations and Project Management</title>
<p>This is another domain in which the comparison is quite illuminating concerning cross-sector priorities. Virtually all of the MBA programmes included at least one course that focused on perspective and techniques focused on <italic>execution</italic> (for example, operations management or project management). Here we define execution as the organization’s capacity to translate its intentions into results. Courses in operations management in business schools generally focus on quantitative approaches to organization and control of resources. This often has a manufacturing focus that would be unsuitable in an education context. However, equally popular across business management programmes were courses in project management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143213485464">Kloppenborg and Baucus, 2003</xref>). These courses aim to develop skills in planning and execution that maximize the <italic>efficiency</italic> of resource usage and increase the likelihood of goal achievement, whatever those goals might be.</p>
<p>We note that this coursework focusing on execution received considerably greater attention in the MBA programmes than in the MBA-Ed and MPA programmes. Anecdotally, in our 30 years of involvement in school leadership development, we have never seen explicit coursework focused on project management in administrator preparation programmes offered in schools of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Snidvongs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">Huber, 2004a</xref>, 2000b). Skills in project management seems entirely suitable for inclusion in principal preparation. Much of the work of the principal is conducted via ‘projects’ whether they are curriculum projects, school improvement projects, technology implementation projects or facility upgrade projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485464">Bridges and Hallinger, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143213485464">
<title>Curriculum Structure</title>
<p>Data on the scope of different programmes are surprisingly difficult to compare. This arises from the different number of terms, types of terms (for example, semester, trimester and quarter), length of terms (that is, number of weeks vary even when two programmes operate on the same type of term) and number of contact hours within the same type of terms. Thus, a programme that requires 21 courses on a quarter system (for example, Univeristy of Chicago) may be comparable in scope to a programmes that requires 12 courses on a semester system. Therefore, data on total courses required should be interpreted with care.</p>
<p>The following generalizations can be made based on the limited sample of programmes included in this report.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>MBA programmes tend to offer and require more courses than MPA and MBA-Ed programmes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Most of the part-time and full-time MBA programmes included in this project are coursework-based terminal degree programmes without a thesis, though some offer an optional ‘project’.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>One-half of the MPA programmes require the completion of 15 courses and an internship; the other half require the completion of about 10 courses, an internship and a thesis.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The MBA-Ed varied more widely. They require the completion of between 5 and16 courses, some with a thesis or independent study project.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Most MBA and MPA programmes also included short-term study abroad, cooperative programmes offered in cooperation with one or more international partners or foreign exchange programmes. There were presented as means of enhancing participants’ international awareness, cross-cultural competencies, language skills, global vision and future business relationships in other countries. Some of the highly rated MBA programmes even highlight international experiences as a signature feature of the programmes. This was not, however, the case in the MBA-Ed programmes.</p>
<p>We note that education has traditionally been considered a ‘local’ rather than a cosmopolitan enterprise, with national language, national regulations (for example, certification, curricula) and norms defining the scope of managerial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485464">March, 1978</xref>). Thus, outside of the international schools sector, we find relatively little cross-national mobility among teachers and school principals. This is not to say that programme structures should continue this emphasis, only to describe the trend observed in the data and our experience.</p>
<p>We do note, however, some change in this norm. The Bologna process, for example, has resulted in wider channels of student mobility in higher education across Europe. In Australia, the education of school leaders increasingly features a requirement for understanding and linking with schools in the broader Asian context. Thus, we see this particular focus as increasingly relevant in the education of our future school leaders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1741143213485464">
<title>Learning Modes</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143213485464">Table 2</xref>, Most MBA and MPA programmes highlight various forms of experiential learning as a featured approach in instructional delivery as well as a requirement in the curriculum. Learning approaches include case studies, problem-based learning, interactive workshops, field-based learning,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143213485464">2</xref>
</sup> local or global consultancy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741143213485464">3</xref>
</sup> business plan competitions<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741143213485464">4</xref>
</sup> and internships. These experiential learning activities vary in terms of location from in-house workshops to international consultancy, in terms of extent of participation from observational experiences to advisory consultation, and in terms of medium of experience from a virtual computer simulation to an organizational problem or a public issue in real world. These projects are often team based, and conducted under the supervision of faculty or business leaders.</p>

<p>Part-time MBA programmes are more likely to adopt school-based and in-house experiential learning approaches such as workshops, competitions and computer simulations. Full-time MBA programmes tend to favour field-based or international learning activities such as international consultancy projects. MPA programmes tend to adopt public service internships as the predominant form of professional learning. For instance, Harvard University requires MPA students to spend the summer between their first and second years working as interns on development projects, preferably in developing countries. These internships give MPA students a practical opportunity to put the skills they have learned in their first year of studies to the test and give them additional real-world experience and guidance as they consider the coursework they will choose for their second year.</p>
<p>Independent study is another feature highlighted in several MBA programmes as an optional means to customize students’ learning experiences. Students are able to explore their interest and apply their field knowledge into a specialized topic for elective credits. This is often carried out with an approved subject topic with the supervision of one to two faculty members.</p>

<title>Project Orientation</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143213485464">Table 2</xref>, these management education programmes offer and require a wide range of types of projects. These include research theses, consultancies, independent study projects, business competitions and organization inquiry projects. It is notable that these projects feature more prominently in the MBA programmes than in the MPA and MBA-Ed programmes. The MBA-Ed programmes tend to offer students the option of choosing between a thesis and an inquiry project. Research theses are far more common in the UK and UK-influenced contexts (for example, Asia, Australia, Canada) than in the USA.</p>
<p>That said, research theses do not comprise a predominant form of capstone project across any of these types of programmes. More common are practice-oriented consultancy projects. The goals, processes and skills involved in these capstone projects are geared to the goals of graduate management education. As noted earlier, these are generally treated as terminal degrees rather preparation for research post-graduate research degrees (that is, MPhil, PhD). This is consistent with trends in educational leadership and management over the past 15 years in the USA and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143213485464">Huber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143213485464">Murphy and Vriesenga, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought to analyse current trends in management education outside the mainstream of master of education degree programs in educational leadership and management. More specifically, we undertook a selective assessment of master’s degree programs designed for business and public sector managers, as well as adaptations of the MBA designed for educational administrators. In this section of the article we discuss some of the implications for principal preparation programmes.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, however, we wish to identify a limitation of the study that bears on our interpretation of the findings. Specifically, this study did not incorporate a ‘contrasting groups’ research design comparing non-education master’s degree programs with educational management programmes. Thus, the ‘data’ reported in this study focused explicitly on programme features and trends ‘within’ a sample of non-education master’s degree programmes. Nonetheless, this information must ultimately be assessed in light of current trends within master’s degree programmes in education leadership and management. Therefore, in this concluding section of the article we draw upon our broader reading of the global literature on the structure, design and delivery of educational leadership and management programmes to place the findings from this preceding analysis in perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143213485464">Huber, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143213485464">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143213485464">Lumby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143213485464">Murphy and Vriesenga 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143213485464">Walker and Dimmock, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current era, education leadership and management programmes most typically place their greatest focus on people management, teaching and learning, and organizational behaviour. These foci seem appropriate given the goals, structure, culture and processes of leading and managing schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485464">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143213485464">2006</xref>). Our analysis of MBA and MPA programmes, however, identified several knowledge domains that are less commonly included in preparation programmes for school leaders, and which deserve closer consideration. These include project management, data-based decision making, customer orientation, and strategic management and strategic planning.</p>
<p>Indeed, we already see evidence of greater attention to several of these domains already. Data-based decision making has attained broad currecy in education sector programmes in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485464">Goldring and Berends, 2009</xref>). The increasing marketization of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485464">Bush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143213485464">Murphy, 2003</xref>) has increased the awareness of a need for school leaders to adopt a more explicit customer orientation, as well as to develop the capacity for using tools in this domain. Related content could be integrated into coursework on strategic management and planning in the schools sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143213485464">Davies, 2003</xref>). Similarly, development of skills in project management could be incorporated more explicitly and intentionally into coursework on school improvement. Indeed, we see no rationale for failing to teach school leaders how to use their scarce resources more efficiently and effectively, the goals of project management.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature highlighted in this study, concerned the extent to which these non-education management programmes sought to develop a <italic>global or international perspective</italic> among their graduates. More specifically, these management programmes tended to view the development of an international outlook as an explicit and important goal for their learners. Programme structure, curriculum content and required learning activities all reflected this goal. A striking feature of the MBA programmes, in particular, was the frequency of cross-national partnerships in programme provision, as well as international exchanges, visitations and internships. It is no exaggeration to observe that these features have become part and parcel of almost all highly regarded MBA programmes.</p>
<p>In contrast, these features remain the exception rather than the rule in preparation programmes for school leaders. We note that the management of education services has traditionally been approached from a ‘local’ rather than from a ‘cosmopolitan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143213485464">March, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143213485464">Tyack and Hansot, 1982</xref>) or ‘international’ perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143213485464">Baron et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143213485464">Hallinger, 2003</xref>). Teachers (and school administrators) are trained and ‘certified’ to serve specific within regulated markets defined by national, state or provincial boundaries. Other than education professionals working in the international schools sector, the frequency of teachers or administrators moving from one nation to work in another nation is a rare event.</p>
<p>In sum, the traditional <italic>scope of vision</italic> of educators has seldom gone beyond the defined boundaries of their particular territory. This has, in turn, been reflected in the scope of vision of their preparation programs. We assert that this is an area in which preparation programmes must change in the future. More specifically, they must expand the scope of vision of school leaders to include an understanding of education in the global context. This will breed numerous benefits as educators begin to explore what they can learn from the experiences and practices of educators in other societies.</p>
<p>We view the development of an international or global outlook among citizens of all countries as an issue of social justice. Many of the significant problems of the world that we are tackling today (for example, water shortage, deforestation, population growth, nuclear proliferation), will only be solved through international cooperation. Therefore, it is no longer acceptable for education systems to limit their core purposes to national perspectives. If the leaders who inhabit the education systems of the world, at every level, are not imbued with a global perspective, how will it be possible for teachers to view this as a priority when working with their students?</p>
<p>From a more instrumental perspective, cross-national programme collaboration is both a key source of innovation through knowledge sharing and a vehicle for students to obtain new perspectives, knowledge and skills. It is also a means by which both faculty and students can develop new networks for future collaboration and learning. Similarly, international collaboration, exchanges, internships and visitations also enable faculty and students to learn about education practices from other societies. Although the general trend, in the recent past, has involved education policies and practices moving from Western developed countries to other parts of the world, there is ample rationale to support the argument for a reverse trend as well. Learning about the use of teacher inquiry teams in mainland China, multi-cultural education practices in Malaysia, methods of parental involvement in Japan, and national educational goals centring on virtue and happiness (as well as competency) in Thailand all represent potentially fruitful lessons that could be learned from a more explicit and well-integrated focus on education management from international perspectives.</p>
<p>The learning methods employed in the management education programmes reviewed in this study were diverse. They included case teaching, project-based learning, problem-based learning, simulations, internships, study visits, business competitions, inquiry and consultancy projects, exchange programmes, as well as more ‘traditional’ lecture and discussion approaches. This diversity of action-oriented learning approaches suggests the importance not of mandating specific learning methods, but perhaps of ensuring that programmes have a stated learning philosophy and are able to provide evidence of how that is incorporated into instructional delivery and assessment.</p>
<p>When interpreting these data with our knowledge of typical master’s degree programmes in educational leadership and management, we find no evidence to suggest any substantial differences in approaches to instruction. On the margins, however, we identified inter-university program competitions around business planning and innovation as something that might potentially yield an analogous activity in the education sector. These competitions are designed to motivate students to integrate their learning in the form of innovative, high quality ‘products’ similar to those that are valued in the workplace. Inter-university competitions not only contribute to honing student skills, but also provide an impetus for change in the content and delivery of the university programs themselves.</p>
<p>It was noted that the MBA and MPA are often considered terminal degrees and therefore tend not to require research theses. Instead, these programmes tend to require various forms of project-based learning during a capstone phase in their programmes. Of course, this project orientation is not and need not be limited to the capstone phase. Nonetheless, we find a distinct trend towards the practical orientation of capstone projects as opposed to the traditional research thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143213485464">Hallinger and Bridges, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143213485464">Murphy and Vriesenga 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Cross-sector sharing of program structures, curriculum content and learning methods seems like a natural means of useful innovation. For a variety of historical reasons, scholars in education have been conditioned to be ‘on guard’ when alternative practices are proposed for adoption from the business sector. In this article, we have provided a two-step process of first identifying trends in non-education leadership administrator programmes and then filtering those trends in light of our reading of the current literature in the field of school leader preparation and development. We hope that the results may lead programme developers in our field to consider alternative approaches commensurate with the changing needs of schools and their leaders around the world.</p>
