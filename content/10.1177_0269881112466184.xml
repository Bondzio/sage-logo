<abstract>
<p>A recent line of studies has brought attention to the question whether repeated exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is capable of producing psycho-physiological effects in non-smokers and whether symptoms of nicotine dependence can develop in the absence of active smoking. Children seem to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of ETS. We examined the occurrence of psycho-behavioural symptoms, designed to assess nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal, in a sample of 778 never-smoking children aged 9–12 years using cross-sectional survey data collected in 15 Dutch primary schools. In the present study, 6% of never-smoking children reported symptoms of craving, 8% reported cue-triggered wanting to smoke, and 20% reported subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure. In never-smoking children, a higher number of smokers in the child’s social environment was associated with more symptoms of cue-triggered wanting to smoke and more subjective symptoms in response to ETS. Never-smoking children and children who had initiated smoking were equally likely to report subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure. In conclusion, environmental smoking is associated with self-reported psycho-behavioural symptoms in never-smoking children. Future research needs to investigate whether symptoms in children exposed to ETS are physiologically based or whether they reflect other characteristics which predispose youth for smoking initiation in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A substantial body of evidence indicates that novice smokers may experience symptoms of nicotine dependence (e.g. craving and withdrawal symptoms, tolerance to nicotine, loss of autonomy over smoking, unsuccessful attempts at quitting) very soon after smoking initiation and at very low exposures to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112466184">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112466184">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112466184">Kandel et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that non-smokers who are exposed to high levels of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may absorb amounts of nicotine comparable with light or non-daily smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112466184">Al-Delaimy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112466184">Dimich-Ward et al., 1997</xref>). In recent years, a new line of research is beginning to investigate whether the psychoactive properties of nicotine absorbed from ETS are capable of producing psycho-physiological effects in non-smokers. Hypothetically, the absorption of nicotine from prolonged and repeated ETS exposure may engender symptoms of nicotine dependence in the absence of active smoking. In line with this, pharmacological exposure to ETS smoke has recently been shown to produce nicotine dependence in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112466184">Small et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112466184">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). Up to this point, however, research on nicotine dependence symptoms in non-smokers poses significant challenges, as no validated measures to assess nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal exist for never-smokers.</p>
<p>Children seem to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of ETS. Compared with adults, children display higher relative cotinine and nicotine levels during and after exposure to ETS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112466184">Willers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112466184">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that they absorb higher doses of nicotine at the same amount of ETS exposure. In North America and Europe, children are frequently exposed to ETS. At least one-third of children live in a household with smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112466184">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112466184">Schuster et al., 2002</xref>), and approximately two-thirds of children are exposed to smoking in their social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112466184">USDHHS, 2006</xref>). Parents, siblings, and peers are the most significant sources of children’s exposure to environmental smoking. Parental and sibling smoking, exposure to smoking in a car, and a pharmacological measure of ETS exposure (i.e. salivary cotinine levels) have been shown to predict smoking uptake in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112466184">Becklake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112466184">Glover et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112466184">Leonardi-Bee et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While epidemiological studies have demonstrated for decades that ETS exposure is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, for example cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and behaviour problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112466184">Pitsavos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112466184">Sturm et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112466184">USDHHS, 2006</xref>), research is only starting to examine the psycho-behavioural effects of ETS exposure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112466184">Okoli et al. (2007b)</xref> evaluated the effects of ETS exposure in non-smoking bar and restaurant workers. In this study, hair nicotine levels predicted the report of four or more subjective symptoms adapted from <italic>DSM-IV</italic> nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112466184">Bélanger et al. (2008)</xref> reported that 5% of never-smoking 10–12-year-old children reported self-perceived nicotine dependence symptoms. Exposure to ETS in a car was associated with an increased probability to report these symptoms. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112466184">Racicot et al. (2011)</xref> found that the number of smokers in the child’s social environment, but not a pharmacological measure of salivary cotinine, predicted perceived nicotine dependence in never-smoking 11–15-year-old students. The authors note power limitations due to very low cotinine levels in students. Taken together, these findings indicate a gradient between exposure to environmental smoking and self-reported psycho-behavioural responses in non-smokers and non-smoking youth. Yet, the nature of these responses in non-smokers remains unclear.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that pharmacological exposure to the psychoactive properties of nicotine may lead to neuronal adaptations in the brain and nicotine-induced sensitization of neuronal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112466184">Anthonisen and Murray, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2007a</xref>). As a result, altered psycho-behavioural responses may develop at exposure to nicotine, or symptoms of withdrawal may occur when the effects of nicotine wear off. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that nicotine-induced sensitization may produce tolerance to nicotine’s aversive effects or increase sensitivity to nicotine’s reinforcing effects at the uptake of smoking in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2007a</xref>). While exposure to ETS may engender serum cotinine concentrations similar to levels in light smokers, it should be acknowledged that the effects of nicotine on the brain may be much more pronounced in active smokers than non-smokers exposed to ETS smoke. Currently, research is beginning to examine effects of ETS smoke in the human brain (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112466184">Brody et al., 2011</xref>). However, neuronal adaptations or sensitization induced by ETS exposure are not yet supported by empirical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112466184">Yamada et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While the nature of self-perceived nicotine dependence symptoms in never-smokers is not yet established, there is evidence suggesting that the report of these symptoms may constitute a relevant early predictor of smoking initiation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112466184">Okoli et al. (2009)</xref> reported that, in never-smoking children, self-perceived mental addiction to tobacco was associated with an increased susceptibility to initiate smoking. Measures of perceived addiction to tobacco may constitute a promising way of assessing vulnerability to smoking among youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study aimed to examine the extent to which self-reported psycho-behavioural symptoms, designed to assess nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal in smokers, are reported by never-smoking 9–12-year-old children and whether these symptoms are associated with smoking in the social environment. First, we sought to evaluate whether previous findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112466184">Okoli et al. (2007b)</xref>, whereby ETS exposure predicted the report of subjective symptoms in non-smoking adults, extend to never-smoking children. In addition, we sought to further understand the nature of self-perceived nicotine dependence in never-smoking children. Using two scales which are well validated in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112466184">Wheeler et al., 2004</xref>), we evaluated whether ETS exposure predicts hallmark symptoms of nicotine dependence (i.e. craving and cue-triggered wanting to smoke). Finally, we compared internal consistency of the employed scales between never-smoking children and children who have initiated smoking, and determined whether measures of nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal constitute reliable measures in never-smokers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881112466184">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Study participants were 880 children aged between 9 and 12 years who were recruited from 15 primary schools in the Netherlands. Participating schools agreed to distribute short questionnaires during school hours to all students in Dutch grades 6–8 (US grades 4–6). Parents received written information about the school’s participation in the study as well as information about the procedure and aim of the study. All parents were informed that participation in the study was voluntary and received a form to withdraw their child from study participation and a return envelope (‘passive consent’). Three children were excluded by their parents from study participation. Data collection took place between March and September 2010. Children were informed that participation was voluntary. Questionnaires were filled in anonymously with an instructed teacher present. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Radboud University Nijmegen.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0269881112466184">
<title>Smoking status</title>
<p>Smoking status was assessed using the item: ‘Have you ever smoked, even if only a single puff?’ Children reporting that they had never smoked, not even a single puff, were considered never-smokers (<italic>n</italic> = 778; 88.4%). Children reporting that they had smoked were considered initiators (<italic>n</italic> = 66; 7.5%). A total of 36 children (4.1%) did not respond to this item and were not included in further analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112466184">
<title>Number of smokers in the social environment</title>
<p>To calculate the number of smokers in the child’s social environment, smoking behaviour was assessed among parents, siblings, and peers. Parental smoking was measured using the question ‘Does your mother/father smoke?’ Response options were: 1 (my mother/father has never smoked), 2 (my mother/father quit smoking), 3 (my mother/father smokes), 4 (I don’t have a mother/father), 5 (I don’t know). To measure sibling smoking, children were asked to report the names of all siblings and to indicate for each sibling whether he/she smokes. Response options were: 0 (no, he/she doesn’t smoke) and 1 (yes, he/she smokes). To measure number of smoking peers, children were asked to report the number of friends who smoke. Response options were: 0 (nobody), 1 (one friend), 2 (two friends), 3 (three friends), 4 (four friends), 5 (five or more friends). The number of smokers in the child’s social environment was calculated by summing the number of current smokers among parents, siblings, and peers (range 0–11 smokers) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112466184">Racicot et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881112466184">
<title>Subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure</title>
<p>Subjective symptoms in response to exposure to ETS were adapted from symptoms of nicotine withdrawal based on the fourth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Children were asked the following: ‘After you have been in a smoky environment, have you ever experienced the following: feeling sad, trouble sleeping, feeling irritable, feeling anxious, trouble concentrating, feeling restless, feeling angry or frustrated?’ Answer options were no (0) or yes (1). The number of items endorsed was summed to create a subjective symptom score (range 0–7; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881112466184">
<title>Craving</title>
<p>To assess craving, we used four items from the Hooked On Nicotine Checklist (HONC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2000</xref>). Example items are: ‘Have you ever felt like you really needed a cigarette?’ and ‘Did you ever feel a strong need or urge to smoke?’ Children were asked to indicate the response which described them best. Response options ranged from 1–4 (never, rarely, sometimes, often). Answers were recoded into 0 (never) or 1 (rarely, sometimes, often). The number of items endorsed was summed to create a craving score (range 0–4). In smokers, the number of HONC items endorsed has been shown to correlate with cigarette consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112466184">Wheeler et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881112466184">
<title>Cue-triggered wanting to smoke</title>
<p>To assess cue-triggered wanting to smoke, we used the cue-induced craving subscale of the Autonomy Over Smoking Scale (AUTOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2009</xref>). Example items are: ‘When I see other people smoking, I want a cigarette’ and ‘When I smell cigarette smoke, I want a cigarette’. Children were asked to indicate the response which describes them best. Response options ranged from 1–5 (never, sometimes, regularly, often, very often). Answers were recoded into 0 (never) or 1 (sometimes, regularly, often, very often). A sum score of items endorsed was calculated ranging from 0–4. In smokers, both the number of symptoms endorsed in the AUTOS and symptom intensity have been shown to correlate with cigarette consumption and other measures of tobacco use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881112466184">
<title>Intention to refrain from smoking in the future</title>
<p>To assess intention to refrain from smoking in the future, children were asked to indicate the response which describes them best. Response options were: 1 (I know for sure that I will never start smoking), 2 (I think that I will never start smoking), 3 (I think I will try smoking in the future), 4 (I think I will try smoking within five years), 5 (I think I will try smoking within one year), 6 (I think I will try smoking within six months), 7 (I think I will try smoking within one month), and 8 (I have already tried smoking). Scores were dichotomized into 0 (I know for sure that I will never start smoking) and 1 (any other response), thereby indicating (the lack of) a resolute intention to refrain from smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112466184">Pierce et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112466184">Schuck et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881112466184">
<title>Strategy for analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. Comparisons between groups were based on chi-square analyses for categorical variables and independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables. Frequency distributions of individual symptoms and symptom scores were compared for never-smoking children and children who had initiated smoking. Also, we compared the internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of the symptom scales for never-smokers and initiators. Furthermore, never smoking children who had and had not reported symptoms were compared on several characteristics. Finally, we used structural equation modelling (Mplus 5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112466184">Muthén and Muthén, 2007</xref>) to evaluate the association between the number of smokers in the social environment and symptom scores in never-smoking children. Model fit was evaluated by way of the: (a) root-mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), (b) comparative fit index (CFI), and (c) Tucker–Lewis index (TLI). Preferably, RMSEA values should be ≤ .05 and CFI and TLI values should &gt; .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112466184">Bentler and Bonett, 1980</xref>). Associations between variables are evaluated based on standardized path coefficients (Beta’s) and <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Of the 880 children, 42 children (4.8%) did not respond to one or more of the key outcome variables. If children did not respond to a specific item, we assigned a null value<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269881112466184">1</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112466184">Bélanger et al., 2008</xref>). Missing values for predictor variables were substituted in Mplus by full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation.</p>

<title>Descriptive analyses</title>
<p>Of 880 children, a total of 778 (88.4%) reported that they had never smoked, not even a single puff, and were considered never-smokers. A total of 66 children (7.5%) reported that they had tried smoking and were considered initiators. For initiators, mean age of first puff was 9.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.8). Among the 66 initiators, 46 children (69.7%) reported no current smoking, and 10 (15.2%) reported current infrequent smoking. None of the children reported daily smoking, though 10 children (15.1%) did not respond to this question.</p>
<p>The mean age of the sample (including never-smokers and initiators) was 10.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.0) and 49.6% of the sample were girls. A total of 202 children (23.9%) reported that one parent currently smokes, and 94 children (11.1%) reported that both parents currently smoke. Some 54 children (6.4%) reported current smoking among at least one sibling, and 77 (9.1%) reported current smoking among at least one peer. A total of 357 children (41.2%) reported current smoking in their social environment (i.e. parental, sibling, or peer smoking), and 253 (30.0%) reported daily or almost daily exposure to smoke in their homes from a household member. The prevalence rate of smoking among parents and children in the present sample was similar to corresponding prevalence rates in other national samples and population surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112466184">Otten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112466184">Ringlever et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112466184">Stivoro, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, internal consistency of the symptom scales was evaluated for never-smokers and initiators. Internal reliability for subjective symptoms was good for initiators as well as never-smokers (α = .82 and .79). Internal reliability for craving and cue-triggered wanting to smoke was excellent for initiators (α = .89 and .91), but much lower in never-smokers (α = .59 and .43).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study evaluated responses to environmental smoking in 9–12-year-old children. Out of 778 never-smoking children, 20% reported at least one subjective symptom in response to ETS exposure. Similarly, previous research shows that up to 40% of non-smoking hospitality workers reported subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure, and these symptoms were associated with ETS exposure as measured by hair nicotine concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2007b</xref>). Furthermore, in the present study, 6% and 8% of never-smoking children reported the experience of at least one symptom of craving or cue-triggered wanting to smoke, respectively. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112466184">Bélanger et al. (2008)</xref> found that 5% of 10–12-year-old never-smoking children report symptoms that would suggest nicotine dependence if reported by an active smoker. Together, these studies suggest that never-smoking youth experience craving or wanting to smoke, but the implications of such reports may be different for smokers and never-smokers. Our data suggest that such reports in never-smokers reflect a vulnerability to smoking: both the experience of craving and cue-triggered wanting to smoke were associated with the lack of a resolute intention to refrain from smoking in the future. These findings support previous research indicating that self-perceived nicotine dependence in never-smokers may reflect an increased susceptibility to smoking initiation in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112466184">Okoli et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the present study, the number of smokers in the child’s social environment predicted the number of subjective symptoms following ETS exposure as well as the number of symptoms of cue-triggered wanting to smoke among never-smoking children. Similar findings among never-smoking 11–15-year old students have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112466184">Racicot et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these findings clearly indicate a graded association between smoking in the social environment and self-reported psycho-behavioural symptoms in never-smoking children and adolescents. It has been hypothesized that physiological exposure to ETS and nicotine-induced sensitization may produce these symptoms in never-smokers. However, social context characteristics (e.g. imitation of smoking role models, familial attitudes, social norms) may also contribute to the report of psycho-behavioural symptoms in never-smoking children. Possibly, a social desirability bias may also play a role in the report of psycho-behavioural symptoms. Children may have knowledge of the adverse effects of ETS and report symptoms accordingly.</p>
<p>The present study additionally compared psycho-behavioural symptoms between never-smoking children and children who had initiated smoking. Never-smoking children and initiators were equally likely to report subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure. Previously, among adults, no significant differences were found between smokers and non-smokers in the number of subjective symptoms reported in response to ETS exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112466184">Okoli et al. 2007b</xref>). Apparently, both smokers and non-smokers tend to report symptoms of negative affect, trouble sleeping, or trouble concentrating following exposure to ETS. On the contrary, children who have initiated smoking differ remarkably from never-smoking children in craving and cue-triggered wanting to smoke. Almost half of the children who had initiated smoking reported the experience of craving or cue-triggered wanting to smoke, even though two-thirds of initiators reported no current smoking. Compared with never-smokers, initiators were eight times more likely to report craving and five times more likely to report cue-triggered wanting to smoke. This finding is consistent with a growing body of research showing that novice smokers may experience symptoms of nicotine dependence (e.g. craving and withdrawal symptoms, tolerance to nicotine, loss of autonomy over smoking, unsuccessful attempts at quitting) early following smoking initiation and at very low exposures to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112466184">DiFranza et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study extends previous work by distinguishing between different types of responses to smoking in the social environment. Subjective symptoms seem to reflect a more general response to ETS exposure, with a higher number of smokers in the social environment associated with a higher number of reported symptoms in never-smokers. Correspondingly, subjective symptoms were reported in equal measure by initiators as well as never-smoking children. On the contrary, craving was reported significantly more often by initiators than never-smokers, and the number of smokers in the social environment did not predict craving in never-smokers, suggesting that active nicotine uptake is required for the development of craving in youth. Possibly, the development of cigarette craving may require attributions about the cause of craving and the means to alleviate it. Finally, cue-triggered wanting to smoke was associated with both active smoking as well as environmental smoking. Cue-triggered wanting to smoke describes the conditioned association between smoking-related cues and the experience of urges to smoke. In classical conditioning, smoking-related cues (e.g. seeing somebody smoke, ashtrays, lighters) become associated with smoking behaviour after repeated pairing and can eventually elicit conditioned states of craving in smokers. Much less is known about comparable associations in non-smokers. Recent studies have found that non-smoking children with smoking family members displayed more favourable implicit attitudes as well as attentional biases in response to smoking-related cues compared with children without smoking family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112466184">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112466184">Forestell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112466184">Lochbuehler et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, never-smoking children who were exposed to a high number of smokers in the social environment reported more symptoms of cue-triggered wanting to smoke. However, it should be noted that cue-triggered wanting to smoke may be interpreted differently by never-smoking children and initiators. While ‘wanting’ may reflect a desire or a temptation to smoke in never-smokers, it may reflect physiologically based urges to smoke in initiators.</p>
<p>Considering the differences between smokers and non-smokers in internal reliability of the scales measuring craving and cue-triggered wanting, it seems likely that the scales reflect different underlying constructs in smokers and non-smokers. In never-smoking children, the internal reliability of both scales was rather low, indicating that craving and cue-triggered wanting may not reflect a single underlying construct in non-smokers. It should be noted that content and convergent validity of the scales used to assess craving and cue-triggered wanting have only been established in smokers, and that both scales are not validated in non-smokers. Our results should be interpreted with that in mind.</p>
<p>Several limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting the results of the present study. First of all, smoking in the social environment was self-reported by children and not validated with biochemical assessments. However, previous research showed that children are reliable reporters of the smoking behaviour in their social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112466184">Harakeh et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, it is possible that confounded variables may account for the relation between environmental smoking and psycho-behavioural symptoms in children. Particularly, subjective symptoms (e.g. trouble concentrating, feeling restless, feeling irritated) may be explained by confounders of environmental smoking such as behavioural problems or mental health problems in children, which are associated with lower socio-economic status. Also, the present study does not establish a temporal precedence or causal relation between study variables. Moreover, the present study assessed only a limited number of subjective symptoms in children. Exposure to ETS is known to produce physical symptoms (e.g. respiratory tract irritations) and may engender other symptoms not assessed in the present study. Finally, it should be acknowledged that the number of smokers in children’s social environment may be different from children’s exposure to ETS which may, in turn, be different from the uptake of nicotine in the child’s body. Ideally, measurements should distinguish between these constructs to clarify the mechanisms of action through which environmental smoking produces symptoms in children.</p>
<p>The present study suggests several recommendations for future research. To understand the nature of the reported symptoms, future research needs to clarify how craving and cue-triggered wanting are understood and interpreted by never-smokers. Qualitative data gathered in focus groups may help to differentiate being curious about smoking and being tempted to smoke from a physiologically based wanting, needing, or craving a cigarette. Furthermore, future research needs to clarify the nature of subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure. Subjective symptoms may reflect negative attitudes towards ETS smoke (e.g. annoyance), physical effects of ETS exposure (e.g. toxic exposure, irritation, inflammation), neurophysiological adaptations following nicotine absorption, or nicotine withdrawal. For a comprehensive understanding of the reported symptoms, more information is needed, particularly regarding the frequency and intensity of physiological exposure, the latency to symptoms after abstinence from ETS, and the consistency of symptoms across time. Whether symptoms among never-smokers are physiologically based or whether they reflect other characteristics which predispose youth for smoking initiation in the future will need to be clarified in subsequent studies.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A substantial number of never-smoking children report the experience of craving, cue-triggered wanting to smoke, and subjective symptoms in response to ETS exposure. The number of smokers in the child’s social environment predicted the report of subjective symptoms and symptoms of cue-triggered wanting. Future research needs to clarify the nature of these symptoms and to further examine associates and consequences of these symptoms in never-smoking children.</p>
