Specific research policies are justified as necessary to create a KBBE for societal progress. Playing the role of a master narrative, the KBBE attracts rival visions; each favours a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and its remedies in agro-food innovation. Each vision links a technoscientific paradigm with a quality paradigm: the dominant life sciences vision combines converging technologies with decomposability, while a marginal one combines agro-ecology with integral product integrity. From these divergent visions, rival stakeholder networks contend for influence over research policies and priorities, especially within the Framework Programme 7 (FP7) on Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology (FAFB), which has aimed to promote a Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy. Although the FAFB programme has favoured a life sciences vision, agro-ecological approaches have gained a presence, thus overcoming their general lock-out from agricultural research agendas. In their own way, each rival paradigm emphasises the need for collective systems to gather information for linking producers with users, as a rationale for the public sector to fund distinctive research priorities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sustainable agriculture</kwd><kwd>life sciences</kwd><kwd>agro-ecology</kwd><kwd>Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy</kwd><kwd>agricultural knowledge systems</kwd><kwd>European Union</kwd><kwd>Framework Programme 7</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0162243912438143"><title>Introduction</title><p>The European Union (EU) has long promoted technoscientific advance as a rationale for research and development (R&amp;D), comprising half its budget.

Document analysis provided a basis for semi-structured interviews with approximately 20 individuals in the same organisations. Interviews were analysed for convergent and divergent meanings of key terms relevant to the KBBE narrative.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows: The section “Technoscientific Narratives and Paradigms” elaborates and links two main analytical concepts, master narratives and agri-innovation paradigms. The section “KBBE as a Master Narrative” examines the KBBE as a research agenda. The section “Novel Food for Health” focuses on a life sciences vision of novel food. The section “Non-food Industrial Integration” then does the same in relation to non-food uses of plants, especially in horizontal integration across industrial sectors. The section “Agro-ecology for Sustainable Production Systems” focuses on agroecology as a rival to the life sciences vision in shaping a KBBE. Finally the Conclusion argues that the divergent paradigms of life sciences and agro-ecology are promoted by rival stakeholders contending for influence on EU research agendas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162243912438143">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section2-0162243912438143"><title>Technoscientific Narratives and Paradigms</title><p>EU innovation policy has been critically analysed in terms of master narratives – defined as:<disp-quote><p>… the cultural vehicles through which ideas of progress are linked to S&amp;T [science and technology] in particular ways. These are not ‘merely’ stories or fictions. They are an important part of the cultural and institutional fabric, of taken-for-granted aspects of social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912438143">Felt, rapporteur, 2007</xref>: 9).</p></disp-quote>According to the above critical report, called <italic>Taking European Knowledge Society Seriously</italic>, such master narratives conflate general societal progress with certain forms of technoscientific advance, while avoiding questions about whose definitions of society’s problems or needs should inform technoscientific solutions (ibid).</p><p>Master narratives are exemplified by the Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE), which has especially promoted Information and Communication Technologies as societal progress. The KBE imaginatively narrates a post-Fordist accumulation regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243912438143">Jessop, 2005</xref>) based on the commodification of knowledge through its appropriation by means such as intellectual property rights (IPRs). At the same time, the narrative appears to have flexibility:<disp-quote><p>It [the KBE] has been translated into many different visions and strategies (e.g. smart machines and expert systems, the creative industries, the increasing centrality of intellectual property, lifelong learning, the information society, or the rise of cyber-communities). It is capable of being inflected in neo-liberal, neo-corporatist, neo-statist, and neo-communitarian ways…. (Ibid: 154)</p></disp-quote>Hence a master narrative may encompass diverse visions, which can be analysed as divergent paradigms. For agri-food innovation, there are several binary typologies of distinctive paradigms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162243912438143">Lang and Heasman, 2004</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162243912438143">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Drawing on the generic concept of technoscientific paradigms, one typology distinguishes between genetic engineering and agro-ecological engineering. Also known as <italic>life sciences</italic>, genetic engineering aims to modify plants to enhance productivity in adverse conditions – e.g. caused by pests, pathogens, drought, saline environments and unfertile soils – or to design plants for new objectives such as altered nutritional content. By contrast, agro-ecological engineering aims to design agricultural systems that require as few agrochemicals and energy inputs as possible, instead relying on ecological interactions between biological components to enable agricultural systems to boost their own soil fertility, productivity and crop protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912438143">Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009</xref>: 972). A combination of factors has generally locked out agro-ecology from research agendas:<disp-quote><p>…. agricultural research systems created a technological and institutional lock-in situation that severely hinders or stops the development of one of the technological paradigms, in this case agroecological engineering, though both paradigms make sense and make science….</p><p>Agroecology has stayed however on the margins of the agricultural sciences, as it is distant from the main scientific approach as well as from the technological regime and the larger economic and political dominant trends …. (ibid: 980).</p></disp-quote>Those technoscientific paradigms also relate to different market strategies and product qualities; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162243912438143">Table 1</xref>. As such, these linkages have also been theorised as innovation paradigms for differentiating product quality – e.g. decomposability versus integral product identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Wolf, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Within a decomposability paradigm, innovation identifies single traits or functional attributes (e.g. based on genetic characteristics) which can be extracted, decomposed and recomposed. Emphasising computable data, technoscientific knowledge seeks to characterise such components, for selectively recombining them into novel products. The paradigm seeks to codify consumer preferences and precisely match them with subsequently identified products. Although each firm may attempt to develop proprietary information, this depends on wider systems collecting and standardising information – e.g. regarding compositional characteristics, product quality and consumer preferences. As an innovation paradigm, decomposability ‘is supported by collective and public access to up-to-date data’. However, company efforts to appropriate data tend to downplay ‘recognition of interdependence stemming from knowledge openness requirements’ (ibid: 454). Consequently, ‘The logic of decomposability is a myth in that it masks the essentially public and ambivalent character of information’ (ibid: 441).</p><p>By contrast to a decomposability paradigm, an integral product identity paradigm seeks to valorise distinctive comprehensive qualities which can be socially validated for/by consumers in various forms, e.g. organic certification, territorial characteristics, specialty labels or farmers’ markets. For example, organic food has greatly expanded since 1990, backed by statutory criteria of certification, which facilitate market expansion beyond specialist retailers to supermarket chains. Its success depends on ‘communities of practice that favour holistic principles’. Some product-identity networks expand through alliances between producers, distributors and social movements; the latter can hold products accountable for marketing claims - e.g. about ‘preserving the family farm’ or providing public goods (ibid: 449). Identity-based differentiation depends upon collective resources for accommodating diverse private demands and public norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Wolf, 2004</xref>: 454). In those ways, comprehensive-identity products complement and valorise agro-ecological methods: ‘Agroecologists favour alternative food systems operating at a regional scale or based on closer farmer-consumer relationships, or product networks that mobilize localized resources and have strong identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912438143">Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009</xref>: 981).</p><p>Each innovation paradigm depends on a different hybrid combination of private and collective knowledge, as a dual source of product coherence and market power. Each needs public reference systems; although these need not be public-sector systems, they are collective means to gather information from users and so validate the paradigm’s distinctive form of ‘quality’; this dependence is often downplayed by the paradigm. In that double sense, each paradigm is rational in that it describes some practices which exist and importantly link actors, but each is also mythical in that it downplays other necessary practices, especially collective information systems for better linking producers with consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Wolf, 2004</xref>). In the KBBE case, however, such collective systems are emphasised as a rationale for public-sector research priorities, in distinctive ways within each paradigm, as this paper will show.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0162243912438143"><title>KBBE as a Master Narrative</title><p>When the European Commission launched the Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy in 2005, its future vision conflated the terms ‘sustainable’ and ‘renewable’. More efficient inputs would recompose biological resources, as a basis to enhance environmental sustainability, global economic competitiveness and thus European prosperity:<disp-quote><p>… the EU’s ambition to build the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy implies the existence of an efficient and effective knowledge-based bio-economy: a sustainable economy based on renewable resources. This will help wean Europe off its dependence on diminishing oil supplies and will enable it to better compete with fossil-fuel rich areas of the world by levelling the energy playing field. It will also lead to the creation of new and innovative goods and services that will enhance Europe’s competitiveness and meet the needs of its citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2005a</xref>: 3).</p></disp-quote>These tasks require a ‘holistic approach’ – meaning life sciences, including genomics within converging technologies. According to the DG Research Commissioner:<disp-quote><p>The life sciences and biotechnology are significant drivers of growth and competitiveness here. These sciences will help us to live in a healthier and more sustainable fashion by finding more environmentally friendly production methods and pushing forward the frontiers of science…</p><p>This requires a holistic approach that transcends the narrow confines of scientific disciplines – blending, for example, the bio- and nano-sciences – and cuts across policy areas: from research and innovation, to trade and health and consumer affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2005a</xref>: 1, 3)</p></disp-quote>These themes have been reiterated at many high-profile EU-level events. At the 2007 Cologne Summit of the European Council, its Presidency declared that ‘Europe has to take the right measures … to allocate the appropriate resources to catch up and take a leading position in the race to the Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243912438143">EU Presidency, 2007</xref>: 6). Likewise at a follow-up conference on the KBBE, the DG Research Commissioner stated:<disp-quote><p>Today, Europe has a strong life sciences and biotechnology research base to support the development of a sustainable and smart Bio-Economy. It has a leading position in chemical and enzyme industries and a fast growing biotechnologies sector. However, a lot of work still needs to be done in order to fully exploit the potential of the sector today and ensure that Europe remains competitive tomorrow (Geoghegan-Quinn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243912438143">2010</xref>: 3).</p></disp-quote>In these ways, the KBBE extends the Lisbon agenda, which sought greater R&amp;D investment in a knowledge-based economy to make Europe ‘the globally most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243912438143">European Council 2000</xref>). At the start of the EU’s FP7, moreover, economic competitiveness became the main treaty basis for the EU’s R&amp;D budget. According to the Lisbon Treaty:<disp-quote><p>The Union shall have the objective of strengthening its scientific and technological bases by achieving a European research area in which researchers, scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely, and encouraging it to become more competitive, including in its industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243912438143">EU Council, 2007</xref>: 85).</p></disp-quote>With similar language of competitiveness, research policies and priorities have been developed by industry partnerships sponsored by the European Commission. Specifically, in 2004 the Commission invited industry to establish European Technology Platforms (ETPs), especially to define research agendas that would attract industry investment. This arrangement was meant to contribute to the Lisbon target of spending 3% GDP on research. ETPs were meant to involve ‘all relevant stakeholders’ in developing a ‘common vision’ emphasising societal needs and benefits. For the agri-food-forestry-biotech sectors, ETPs were initiated mainly by industry organisations led by multinational companies, with support and proposals from scientist organisations (especially EPSO and EPOBIO). Early on, ETPs also gained support from COPA, the European federation representing relatively more industrialised farmers. Each ETP then published a vision for the year 2025.</p><p>Membership in ETPs effectively defines who is (or is not) a relevant stakeholder, according to their prospective contribution to future prosperity. Oriented to capital-intensive research and innovation, ETPs have little common ground with civil society organisations. According to ETPs, we need a European society in which all stakeholders understand and trust the concept of the bio-economy, whose public image therefore must be improved through better communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243912438143">Becoteps, 2011</xref>: 21). Citizens are relegated to the role of consumers, at best, who must be educated about the imperatives.</p><p>As a prime target for influence, the FP7 programme on Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology (FAFB) has aimed at ‘building a Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162243912438143">Figure 1</xref>). Here the KBBE is defined as ‘the sustainable, eco-efficient transformation of renewable biological resources into health, food, energy and other industrial products’. Beneficent characteristics are attributed to such products: ‘Eco-efficient products are less polluting and less resource-intensive in production, and allow a more effective management of biological resources’, according to the FAFB programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2006</xref>: 3). As key tools in this transformation, the life sciences encompass ‘omics' technologies – such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and converging technologies –especially their integration within systems biology (ibid: 12).</p><fig id="fig1-0162243912438143" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>FAFB programme, whose code is KBBE.</p><p>Sourec: Credit: DG Research PPt presentation, 2006, European Commission.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="fig1-0162243912438143" xlink:href="10.1177_0162243912438143-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>When FP7 began, approximately half the calls were drawn from proposals of officially recognised ETPs, led by capital-intensive industry. The food, crops and forestry TPs were among those whose proposals had the greatest coverage in FP7 priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2007</xref>: vii). As a route to this successful influence, ETPs’ Strategic Research Agendas (SRAs) have lightened the Commission’s internal evaluation procedure, according to interviews with several staff members. For example:<disp-quote><p>The SRA was written by respected scientists; as a result we have this good document. We have to assume that it is the best document possible. So our internal process is of secondary importance (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 10.10.08).</p></disp-quote>Consequently, the Commission procedure has deferred to ETPs as if they were neutral experts in both technological and commercial prospects of research, thereby outsourcing such expertise.</p><p>Despite those commitments, the FAFB programme has undergone tensions between different accounts of a KBBE, eco-efficiency, product quality and future markets. The next three sections examine specific research agendas. The novel food and non-food sections exemplify the life sciences paradigm, based on genomics and systems biology knowledge (as outlined in the theoretical discussion above). The agro-ecology section exemplifies the rival paradigm. In each section, the latter part analyses stakeholder influence on EU priorities via calls for research proposals.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0162243912438143"><title>Novel Food for Health: from Fork to Farm?</title><p>For its research agenda, the European food industry extended the ‘fork to farm’ concept from Framework Programme 6 (2002-2006). Reversing the ‘farm to fork’ concept of traceability, this strategy has sought to link innovation with consumer markets, especially through precise compositional changes. A decomposability innovation paradigm informs the food industry’s research priorities and their incorporation into FP7; but tensions arise with the comprehensive product identity paradigm and consumer groups, as this section shows.</p><sec id="section5-0162243912438143"><title>Promoting Quality Characteristics</title><p>The European food industry federation has led the ETP ‘Food for Life’. Its research agenda attempts to link food innovation with future markets: ‘consumer demands will drive the R&amp;D and innovation needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">FfL, 2005</xref>: 13; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912438143">FfL, 2007</xref>: 6). To avoid difficulties in marketing, it is ‘essential to build effective systems of product tracing and identification that consumers can have trust in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912438143">FfL, 2007</xref>: 6).</p><p>Although consumer preferences supposedly drive food innovation, a reverse strategy also applies, resulting in many tensions. For example, the food industry has combined technoscientific innovation with appeals to ‘natural’ foods: ‘Most of the novel food processing technologies carry the promise to deliver safe food without sacrificing naturalness and nutritional benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">FfL, 2005</xref>: 25). Yet ‘naturalness’ claims have been difficult to justify, much less to verify; the concept disappeared from the ETP’s later documents.</p><p>Related tensions arise from seeking global economic competitiveness to achieve ‘the Lisbon ambitions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">FfL, 2005</xref>: 16). A key means is techno-scientific innovation: ‘Many of the weaknesses identified could be solved technologically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243912438143">FfL, 2008</xref>: 7). Yet many governments perceive a conflict between ‘breakthrough science’ versus food safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">FfL, 2005</xref>: 8).</p><p>The food industry seeks technoscientific innovation as a basis for public health claims about novel products: ‘These products, together with recommended changes in dietary regimes and lifestyles, will have a <italic>positive impact on public health and overall quality of life’ </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243912438143">FfL, 2008</xref>: 3, italics in original). However, further research is needed to support such claims: ‘Therefore knowledge built up in the priority areas is aimed at reformulating a wide range of foods and designing new foods, and making them eligible for health claims’ (ibid: 18). The industry also advocates life cycle analysis of food production, e.g. to demonstrate eco-efficiency benefits in using natural resources, as a basis for informed choices by consumers (ibid: 40).</p><p>To clarify public health benefits of novel foods, industry proposes to extend existing databases. These already had linked ‘the composition and biological effects of nutrients and non-nutrients with putative health benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243912438143">FfL, 2008</xref>: 51). By combining several information sources, a key aim is ‘Harmonised national databases on food composition and consumption patterns, including ethnic and traditional foods’ (ibid: 32).</p><p>Indeed, the food industry faces demands for locally familiar and speciality foods, along lines of integral product identity. In response, the industry seeks to incorporate food traditions into technoscientific innovation: ‘The integration of the rich traditions of European cuisine with the innovation-driven market place represents a great and constant challenge’, which can be addressed through ‘innovation in and industrialisation of regional gastronomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">Food for Life, 2005</xref>: 9, 22). This strategy aims ‘to offer a more diverse menu, a broader range of choice for consumers, e.g. through prepared products’, according to the Director (interview, FfL, 04.03.09). By extending compositional databases to regional or speciality foods, its research agenda attempts to accommodate consumer desires by translating the product-identity paradigm into the decomposability paradigm.</p><p>For the food industry, better quality depends on applying ‘life science technology’. This means recomposing characteristics via novel food products and processing methods, especially for functional foods with health claims. As already demonstrated by the FP6 Network of Excellence on Nutrigenomics (NuGO), advances in ‘omic' technologies and systems biology ‘will provide valuable tools for determining mechanisms of action of nutrients and bioactive compounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243912438143">FfL, 2008</xref>: 7). Similar components are already available through conventional food, but functional foods will more efficiently, precisely deliver nutrients to consumers (interview, FfL, 04.03.09).</p><p>As a related priority, the industry needs more systematic knowledge about consumer behaviour, especially its basis in perceptions of food risks and benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243912438143">FfL, 2008</xref>: 3):<disp-quote><p>We have proposed several projects to find out what makes consumers choose A or B; the indicators that trigger consumer choices are still not clear enough. And once we have this information, we will be better equipped to know what products to develop (interview, FfL, 04.03.09).</p></disp-quote>As this implies, research pursues standard consumers whose desires can be translated into compositional characteristics of standard novel products.</p><p>By contrast to the plant sector (see below), patents are less important in the food sector, which instead maintain proprietary control through private or public labels – e.g. company, territory or ‘organic’ marketing. For company brands, research partnerships are limited by commercial rivalry. According to the ETP: ‘Research and innovation is important for industry to remain competitive, but joint research efforts can only be done at a pre-competitive stage, as everybody knows’ (interview, FfL, 04.03.09).</p><p>Within the decomposability paradigm, pre-competitive research denotes compositional-nutritional databases and correlations with consumer preferences. On this collective informational basis, each company can develop its own products. For their market power, private labels depend upon collective information systems and social networks.</p><p>In building such networks, tensions arise around wider stakeholder involvement. The ETP stated early on, ‘Consumers play a central role’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243912438143">FfL, 2005</xref>: 23), but they remained an elusive category. Great efforts were made to gain formal involvement by the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC), the European federation of consumer groups, but the organisation declined. At most, staff members attended some consultation events as observers on an individual basis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243912438143">FfL, 2007</xref>: 62). One ETP official recognised that ‘NGOs don’t want to be seen as too close to an industry-led platform – which I can understand’, speaking as a former officer of BEUC (interview, FfL, 04.03.09).</p></sec><sec id="section6-0162243912438143"><title>Funding Novel Food Research</title><p>The FP7 FAFB programme has a research stream on ‘Fork to farm: food, health and well-being’. This emphasises novel foods, novel compositional qualities, databases and links with consumer attitudes. Most calls have been based on proposals from the Food for Life ETP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243912438143">FfL table, 2009</xref>; interview, FfL TP, 04.03.09; interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 23.10.09). Here several research priorities exemplify the decomposability paradigm in two major ways.</p><p>First, research on functional food attempts to extract ‘natural’ substances as additives: ‘Reinforcing consumer trust in food by replacing chemically synthesised additives by natural ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2006</xref>: 38). As an extra technique to standardise knowledge on compositional qualities, biomarkers ‘will develop harmonised European tools to allow data comparability across Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2008</xref>: 72). Although the food industry claims simply to accommodate consumer needs, product innovation can shape consumer behaviour, as acknowledged by a Commission research manager: ‘New products and knowledge about new issues in food sciences have an influence on consumer behaviour’ (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 04.03.09).</p><p>Second, research agendas seek reliable information to standardise novel characteristics, as a means to promote their benefits among consumers and regulatory authorities. This task has been complicated by the EC Nutrient Profile Directive, which requires companies to substantiate health claims with scientific evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243912438143">EC, 2006</xref>); such evidence has remained elusive or implausible in some cases. Some calls address these regulatory problems; for example, research on functional foods ‘will also support the common European policy on health and nutrition claims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2008</xref>: 41). A call on ‘Prospects for novel foods’, including novel technologies; aims to ‘foster a debate between scientists and the general public’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2008</xref>: 38).</p><p>Beyond any officially organised debate on novel food, these research priorities have been questioned. Early on, criticism came from within the FP7 advisory network (interview, DG Agriculture, 05.12.08; interview, member of FAFB advisory panel, 10.11.08). At a public meeting hosted by a Member of European Parliament, NGO speakers attacked these research priorities as driven by private interests rather than the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243912438143">EU Food Law, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless capital-intensive industry has continued to set the agenda for research priorities within the decomposability paradigm, in the name of both public health and competitiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0162243912438143"><title>Non-food Industrial Integration</title><p>The life sciences agenda seeks greater eco-efficiency by diversifying inputs, processing methods and outputs.

In parallel, the Commission anticipated new opportunities for agbiotech from novel biofuels: ‘The production process of bioethanol relies largely on biotechnology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243912438143">CEC, 2007</xref>: 3). The decomposability paradigm has been extended beyond novel food, towards integrating agriculture with diverse industrial processes and value chains, as this section shows.</p><sec id="section8-0162243912438143"><title>Promoting plants as eco-efficient inputs</title><p>The life sciences vision foresees a transition from fossil fuels to abundant renewable resources, thanks to genomics techniques.

According to the industry lobby group:<disp-quote><p>In the coming decades, we anticipate the creation of more efficient plants (able to use water and fertiliser more efficiently and to be self-resistant to pests), leading to more efficient farms and new economic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243912438143">Plants for the Future TP, 2007a</xref>: 9).</p></disp-quote>This agenda also promotes horizontal integration across sectors such as food, feed, energy and other industrial products. Agriculture is framed as the ‘oil wells of the 21st century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243912438143">BiomatNet, 2006</xref>) – i.e. like a mineral reserve for extracting biomass which can be cracked into its various components for further processing. According to proponents, moreover, technoscientific innovation provides new opportunities for rural employment but must horizontally integrate agriculture and energy as value chains:<disp-quote><p>…. the production of green energy will also face the exceptional challenge of global industrial restructuring in which the very different value chains of agricultural production and the biorefining industries must be merged with the value chains of the energy providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243912438143">Plants for the Future TP, 2007b</xref>: 33).</p></disp-quote>Horizontal integration frames technical problems at the molecular level, as indicated by the search for lignocellulosic fuels. Lignin in plant cell walls impedes their breakdown, thus limiting the use of the whole plant as biomass for various uses including energy. For agricultural, paper and biofuel feedstock systems, ‘lignin is considered to be an undesirable polymer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243912438143">EPOBIO, 2006</xref>: 27). As a solution, ‘This larger-scale research effort was considered essential to achieve the foundation for designing <italic>in planta</italic> strategies to engineer bespoke [custom-made] cell walls optimised for integrated biorefinery systems’ (ibid: 34).</p><p>Plants are being redesigned for new market opportunities spanning industrial sectors. Biorefineries already convert oilseeds or grain into liquid fuel and ‘co-products’, which can be used as feed. Going further, some crops are being genetically modified specifically for commercially more valuable feed and/or for easier breakdown of cell walls. As a greater ambition, an ‘integrated diversified biorefinery’ would also produce other industrial products. These strategies attempt to optimize valuable products from novel inputs – e.g. to ‘develop new trees and other plant species chosen as energy and/or fibre sources, including plantations connected to bio-refineries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243912438143">EBTP, 2008</xref>: SRA-23, 24).</p><p>Throughout this agenda, biological resources are invested with mechanical and informatic metaphors, thus naturalising the further industrialisation of agriculture. For example, plant cells are described as factories or micro-computers:<disp-quote><p>Cells are a lot like living computers in the way they read and process the information stored in their genes… These natural computers can be reconfigured by taking away or adding genes to create something new, effectively turning them into ‘cell factories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2005a</xref>: 9, 13).</p></disp-quote>Such metaphors naturalise efforts at redesigning genetic ‘information’ to make plant cells more reliably productive, especially as a basis to integrate agriculture with the chemical industry. Systems biology will allow ‘predictive breeding’ by, for example, precisely correlating novel characteristics with agronomic effects and valuable substances: ‘As systems biology requires massive quantitative genome-wide data, technologies – such as protein arrays – need to be developed to analyse simultaneously numerous possible parameters at multiple time points’ (Plants for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243912438143">Future, 2007b</xref>: 63).</p><p>Likewise a ‘biocrude’ metaphor discursively naturalises the decomposability paradigm as a basis for horizontally integrating agriculture with the energy sector. The metaphor compares plant components with crude oil: ‘The seed oils of plants are structurally similar to long chain hydrocarbons derived from crude oil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243912438143">EPOBIO, 2007</xref>: 10). Plant material becomes analogous to crude oil being analysed and ‘cracked’ into valuable components: ‘New developments are ongoing for transforming the biomass into a liquid “biocrude”, which can be further refined, used for energy production or sent to a gasifier’, according to a precursor of the Biofuels Technology Platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243912438143">Biofrac, 2006</xref>: 21).</p><p>Consequently, the decomposability paradigm recasts plant matter as raw materials or biomass. Here the KBBE is represented as ‘the sustainable production and conversion of biomass into various food, health, fibre and industrial products and energy’; such conversion ‘is also sustainable, being efficient, producing little or no waste, and often using biological processing’, according to a consortium of European Technology Platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243912438143">Becoteps, 2011</xref>: 5). Similarly a key challenge is ‘sustainable feedstock production’; the post-2013 Common Agricultural Policy must help ‘to maintain a competitive supply of raw materials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243912438143">Clever Consult, 2010</xref>: 11).</p><p>As converging technologies, the life sciences facilitate expansion of proprietary knowledge for more efficient production methods. For example, ‘Knowledge and intellectual property will be critical to fulfilling the goals outlined in the other four challenges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243912438143">Plants for the Future TP, 2007a</xref>: 9). Alongside research agendas, the same organisations lobby for policy changes which include: easier access to patents on biological material, more ambitious targets for biofuels, lower agricultural subsidies and public procurement criteria favouring ‘green’ products.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0162243912438143"><title>Funding Non-Food Plant Research</title><p>From the start, the FAFB programme emphasised life sciences and converging technologies. From its average annual budget of €200m, it has allocated approx. one-quarter to a stream on ‘Life sciences, biotechnology and biochemistry for sustainable non-food products and processes’. This Activity emphasises molecular-level changes in plants, especially as the means to link environmental with economic sustainability.</p><p>The pervasive adjective ‘green’ frames plants as raw materials substituting for fossil fuels and thus enhancing sustainability. For example, the call for research on ‘Green Oils’ aims to develop ‘Market driven, hardy, viable and profitable oil seed crops with enhanced traits derived from conventional and biotechnological breeding techniques which exploit the post genomic knowledge base’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2006</xref>: 45). Here the meanings of green and natural are expanded, encompassing any product of biological processes.</p><p>Eco-efficient innovations are expected to link economic and environmental sustainability. According to a DG Research manager who helped to coin the KBBE phrase, efforts to break down plant cell walls are expected to bring profits and save resources:<disp-quote><p>We have a technological priority with cellulose. We are looking at ways to get access to the cellulose within the cell structure. We are looking for microbes that can access the cellulose easily; that would be an <italic>El Dorado</italic>. Then you don’t have to take potential food crops and use them for fuels – which is wrong and ultimately not sustainable (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 23.10.09).</p></disp-quote>Calls for research proposals declare great expectations for economic and environmental benefits. Such benefits are attributed to techniques which generate standard novel data. For example: metabolic engineering will enhance knowledge for ‘green factories’ to provide efficient engineering of high-yield and quality products; research will expand the biochemical diversity of natural product libraries; biocatalytic processes will provide high efficiency and low environmental impacts; modern biotechnology will provide systemics for cataloguing and therefore preserving microbial diversity, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2008</xref>). Thus FP7 funds priorities similar to ETPs’ proposals; together they elaborate decomposability as a route to sustainability, especially by substituting renewable resources for chemicals.</p><p>A key research priority is the means to identify biological characteristics which could enhance value chains in future markets:<disp-quote><p>In the KBBE concept, knowledge refers to convergence of technologies – bio, info, nanotech, cognitive sciences. Their convergence is necessary in order to identify, standardise and so guarantee the composition of products at the molecular level. Such reliability also links with economy and market value (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 24.11.09).</p></disp-quote>Research priorities entail tensions between strategies for public-access versus proprietary knowledge, especially in the life sciences. Patents are evaluated as an aim when selecting projects:<disp-quote><p>… the expected impact builds in an expectation for patents and a strategy to deal with this issue; for example the phrase ‘market driven’ hints at industrial patentable knowledge as an aim (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 10.10.08; likewise interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 04.03.09).</p></disp-quote>However, such prospects can deter research partnerships. According to one EU research manager:<disp-quote><p>IPRs could also be a reason for companies not to cooperate in a project, especially because they must share the background information with other partners, regardless of whether a project has any prospects for patents (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 04.03.09).</p></disp-quote>Amidst those tensions, the ambiguous term ‘pre-competitive research’ plays several roles – legitimising specific priorities as a public good, negotiating relations between public-access versus proprietary knowledge, and potentially overcoming obstacles to research partnerships.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-0162243912438143"><title>Agro-ecology for Sustainable Production Systems</title><p>Organic agro-food organisations formed a stakeholder network to advocate a rival vision recasting the KBBE to favour agro-ecological research.

Based in the FAFB programme, the SCAR Secretariat has promoted agro-ecological approaches in the name of diverse ‘technologies’, as a stronger entry point into dominant policy language: ‘Our overall strategy is to explore as many different technologies as possible’ (quoted in van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162243912438143">Rossom, 2009</xref>: 45).</p><p>Organic methods always had a presence in the Commission’s Framework Programmes. The rationale emphasised many environmental and societal benefits, especially through mixed farming as an efficient means to use and conserve natural resources. ‘Organic farming represents an alternative to industrial farming which can generate rural employment, for instance, by preventing small farms and less productive areas from being abandoned’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2005b</xref>, 17). However, until recently organic farming was relegated to a marginal niche.</p><p>Going forward, FP7 eventually gave greater prominence to agro-ecological themes, which reached a total budget of 20m euros <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243912438143">by 2010</xref> and increased thereafter. These appear especially within the activity on ‘Increased sustainability of all production systems’ (though some also within ‘Socio-economic research and support to policies’<bold>)</bold>. Agro-ecology is seen as a means to several aims – to avoid resource shortages and pollution, to shorten organic cycles, and to provide public goods such as eco-system services. According to a research manager:<disp-quote><p>Agro-ecology has been included in Framework Programmes as means to address environmental issues through agriculture. It matters for how agriculture is integrated into a wider ecosystem and environmental life cycle (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 12.07.10).</p></disp-quote>Although the term ‘agro-ecology’ does not appear in Commission texts, the FAFB programme has featured several agro-ecological themes, some linked with public reference systems dependent on stakeholder cooperation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Woolf, 2004</xref>). Calls have included these production methods: ecological services based on eco-functional intensification, enhancing soil management and recycling organic waste via mixed farming, replacing chemical or copper pesticides with bio-control agents, enhancing on-farm production of renewable energy, etc. – generally as substitutes for external inputs. Some calls emphasised the aim to address climate change by reducing energy inputs (DG Research/FAFB, 2009, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243912438143">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243912438143">2011</xref>). Going beyond production methods, ‘Data network for better European organic market information’ sought knowledge to enhance market access especially for small-scale food producers and distributors: ‘It will reduce the information asymmetry between large processors or retail chains on the one hand, and farmers and SMEs on the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2010</xref>: 35).</p><p>Some research topics have sought to facilitate public reference systems necessary for embedding agro-ecological methods within wider institutions – e.g. through community-supported agriculture, agricultural extension services, food retailers and territorial labels. Knowledge for/about closer producer-consumer relations was the focus of a new topic, ‘Short chain delivery of food for urban-peri-urban areas’. The topic emphasises ‘sustainable solutions for water management and nutrient recycling’ as a task for institutional interactions - e.g. in ‘the relation between peri-urban pressures and the participation of farmers and other stakeholders in rural development measures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243912438143">DG Research/FAFB, 2011</xref>: 31). As originally devised by Technology Platform Organics, this proposal emphasised knowledge alliances across actors in the organics agro-food chain – i.e. farmers, processors, retailers and urban consumers – especially to improve their experience of more proximate relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162243912438143">Schmid, 2009</xref>: 69).</p><p>Most of the above themes drew upon proposals from TP Organics. This success resulted from deliberative and consultative procedures to generate research proposals, especially its networking method:<disp-quote><p>TP Organics operates like a Technology Platform. It brings a sound reflection on research priorities through stakeholder consultation. Its Strategic Research Agenda has high-quality proposals, some of which were incorporated into FP7 (interview, DG Research-E/FAFB, 05.10.10).</p></disp-quote>TP Organics’ proposals recast key terms of the KBBE for agro-ecological research, but the <italic>implicit</italic> recasting was a weakness. Success was limited to a case-by-case adoption of specific proposals and so remained precarious. The Commission’s senior officials still exclusively promoted the life sciences vision. This dominated documents for a public consultation which was meant to inform future research priorities for a European bio-economy, especially in the successor to FP7 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243912438143">DG Research, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243912438143">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243912438143">CEC, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243912438143">2011b</xref>). So the policy process could again marginalise agroecology.</p><p>As a shift in strategy, therefore, TP Organics now highlighted divergent accounts of a European bioeconomy. In responding to the public consultation, it criticised the Commission for favouring ‘specific new technologies (such as genetic modification) and capital-intensive “innovation” at the expense of agriculture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243912438143">TP Organics, 2011a</xref>: 7). It counterposed agro-ecological methods and agro-food relocalisation for a different bioeconomy: government should value agricultural knowledges which have been already developed over many decades, especially in co-producing agriculture with public goods (ibid: 10). Likewise in responding to the Commission’s proposal for the next Framework Programme, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243912438143">TP Organics (2011b</xref>) advocated ‘a network of agro-ecological innovation centres in farming communities across Europe’ for transdisciplinary and participatory approaches. In all these ways, it sought an explicit place for an agro-ecological vision in EU policy documents and long-term resources for stakeholder-knowledge networks. Eventually ‘ecological intensification’ was included in the successor to FP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243912438143">CEC, 2011c</xref>: 55).</p></sec></sec><sec id="section13-0162243912438143"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy (KBBE) has gained prominence as an agricultural R&amp;D agenda of the European Union. Like its precursor the knowledge-based economy, the KBBE plays the role of a master narrative. Specific priorities are justified as necessary to create a Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy for European progress.</p><p>Consequently, this narrative attracts rival visions for agricultural innovation. Each vision favours a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and its remedies in an eco-efficient, sustainable KBBE – e.g. different ways to integrate agriculture with energy production. Each vision links different paradigms of technoscience and of quality: the dominant life sciences vision combines converging technologies with decomposability, while a marginal one combines agro-ecology with integral product integrity; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162243912438143">Table 2</xref> for a summary.</p><p>In the dominant life sciences vision, research seeks technoscientific knowledge for enhancing productive efficiency and thus European economic competitiveness. This is led by multinational companies and plant scientist organisations. In the name of pre-competitive research, this vision seeks generic knowledge for identifying qualities that can be extracted, decomposed and recomposed into more lucrative combinations; converging technologies offer more precise means to identify valuable characteristics, while systems biology predicts their overall effects. In the name of accommodating consumer needs, food innovation aims to shape consumer behaviour, but difficulties arise in standardising information – e.g. to understand consumer preferences, or to substantiate claims for nutritional benefits.</p><p>Within the life sciences vision, a decomposability paradigm has been extended beyond novel food to all natural resources, seen as ‘biomass’, for horizontally integrating agriculture with energy production and other industrial sectors. Sustainability is equated with more efficient inputs and processing methods for using renewable resources. Within the life sciences vision, research priorities undergo tensions between strategies for public-access versus proprietary knowledge; prospects for patents can deter research partnerships. This illustrates tensions of the decomposability paradigm as a rational myth (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Wolf, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In an agro-ecological vision, by contrast, research seeks knowledge for enhancing ecological processes and shortening nutrient cycles in agricultural systems. This is led by the organics industry with support from environmental NGOs. Sustainability is equated with farmers’ knowledge of natural resources as means to reduce dependence on external inputs – e.g. by using residues for nutrient recycling and on-farm biogas production. In the novel concept ‘eco-functional intensification’, farmers and researchers together develop new knowledge which can increase productivity in ways independent of external inputs. Such knowledge contributes to an integral product identity, which can be valorised through short food chains, so that farmers gain more from the value that they add. Promoters have highlighted and built stakeholder networks essential for embedding agro-ecological methods in producer-consumer relations – e.g. via organic, speciality or territorial labels (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Woolf, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The life sciences and agro-ecology paradigms give different meanings to key terms – such as knowledge, biological resources and economy – as strategies to shape a future KBBE. Each paradigm has distinctive metaphors – e.g., cell factories or organic recycling – which project human activities onto nature. Such metaphors naturalise a technoscientific system which frames resource usage in its own image. As this discursive role illustrates, a master narrative can reinforce ‘taken-for-granted aspects of social order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912438143">Felt, rapporteur, 2007</xref>); here the dominant paradigm’s language reinforces a wider narrative of economic-technological progress. As a marginal paradigm, by contrast, agro-ecology somehow must question that social order in order to gain research funds.</p><p>These rival agro-food paradigms have been theorised as quasi-mythical. That is, each paradigm emphasises proprietary knowledge and private labels, while downplaying the crucial role of collective information systems for linking products with users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243912438143">Allaire and Woolf, 2004</xref>). In the KBBE case, however, the rival paradigms emphasise the need for such collective systems, as a rationale for the public sector to fund distinctive research priorities.</p><p>From those divergent paradigms, rival stakeholder networks contend for influence on research priorities. A high-profile target has been the FP7 programme on Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology (FAFB), which aims to promote a Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy. Originally meant to revive the life sciences, the FAFB programme has favoured genomics knowledge for more efficient production methods, as a means to make agriculture more sustainable. Despite this initial agenda, the FAFB programme has increasingly promoted agro-ecological approaches, thus overcoming their general lock-out from agricultural research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243912438143">Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009</xref>). But this advance remains precarious, so its supporters have sought an explicit policy commitment, thereby highlighting distinct choices for a bioeconomy.</p><p>What are broader implications for opening up socio-technical innovation pathways? According to a critical report on <italic>Taking European Knowledge Society Seriously</italic>, the EU’s master narratives impose specific problem-diagnoses and solutions; an ‘economics of technoscientific promise’ closes down European futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912438143">Felt, rapporteur, 2007</xref>: 24-25). The KBBE case exemplifies that pre-emptive role but also illustrates how a master narrative can be appropriated for different future visions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243912438143">Jessop, 2005</xref>). Agroecology promoters interpretively reconstructed official policy language, gave key terms different meanings and eventually made the divergence explicit, to avoid future marginalisation.</p><p>This case study exemplifies wider efforts at democratising innovation from within. Beyond gaining a greater voice and beyond engaging upstream with innovators, prospective users participate in community-based innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162243912438143">von Hippel, 2005</xref>). Such practices have been theorised as ‘a regime of collective experimentation’, which invents new creative interactions among diverse participants and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912438143">Felt, rapporteur, 2007</xref>: 27). A similar idea inspired the foresight report promoting agro-ecological approaches: ‘ongoing experiments… are creating and testing alternatives to business as usual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243912438143">SCAR FEG, 2008</xref>: ii).</p><p>The KBBE case study has wider implications for Science and Technology Studies (STS) in informing efforts to democratise technoscientific innovation. For at least the past decade, academics have been studying, promoting, advising or even organising public-deliberative exercises funded by state bodies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162243912438143">Levidow, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243912438143">2009</xref>). As important roles, such participation can help to make more explicit the assumptions underlying innovation trajectories, to question expert assumptions about problems and solutions, and thus to gain greater accountability for policy choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243912438143">Felt, rapporteur, 2007</xref>: 60). Within and beyond such exercises, civil society organisations can criticise the dominant framing of societal problems and can counterpose alternatives, facilitated by social science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243912438143">Diedrich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this KBBE case study, stakeholder groups organised their own deliberative process to constitute Technology Platform Organics, so that it could carry out an uninvited participation in agenda-setting for public-sector R&amp;D. This effort used an opportunity from wider deliberative processes around the SCAR foresight reports on future agriculture. As a general implication, then, STS should investigate relationships between such activities – between invited and uninvited participation, between state-sponsored deliberation and stakeholder-alliance deliberation, between upstream engagement and collective experimentation, etc. – as complementary strategies for democratising innovation.
