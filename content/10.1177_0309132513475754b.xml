<p>We did not define the ‘humanities’ in our book simply because geographers and humanities practitioners have already spent so much time introducing themselves to each other, and we were eager to move on. However, the question of definition is far from trivial, and so we offer this clarification. We define the <italic>humanities</italic> as the study of the human condition through subjective interpretive analysis, as distinct from the empirical analysis that typifies the natural and social sciences. Humanistic geography is a subfield of human geography that privileges the individual as an active agent and not a passive receptor of social processes. As Rob Wilson observes, Ley and Samuels’ <italic>Humanistic Geography</italic> (1978) provided an important corrective to dominant positivistic and scientific perspectives – although he should have mentioned also that they were responding to the deterministic character of Marxist scholarship of that era. The most prominent current manifestation of the intersection between humanities and geography is the <italic>spatial humanities </italic>(also known as the <italic>digital humanities</italic>). This is principally concerned with the absorption of methods of geographical information science into humanities scholarship. It is most advanced in historical GIS, although the focus on maps, space, and place has reached fever pitch in many humanities disciplines.</p>
<p>It is disconcerting that Rob concludes that ‘I am not quite sure what “geohumanities” means or if the term constitutes a divergence from humanistic approaches in geography’. (The book’s introduction and afterword devoted considerable energies to these questions.) So let us be clear: as expressed in the book’s Afterword, geohumanities is a transdisciplinary and multi-methodological inquiry that begins from the human meanings of place, and proceeds to reconstruct our understanding of those meanings in order to produce new knowledge and better scholarly and political practices. If this definition seems broad and permeable, this is because we sought to avoid closure in the opening offered by <italic>GeoHumanities.</italic>
</p>
<p>To what extent is the geohumanities a ‘divergence’? For us, it represents a radical break from existing traditions. The book is not a ‘balanced survey’ of anything – a field, a history, certainly not a new paradigm. Instead, it is a deliberate provocation drawn from the present epistemological, cultural, and political milieu. Its point of reference, or ‘cultural matrix’, is totally different from predecessors, not least because of the technological and information revolutions, which Mike Hulme would perhaps characterize as the ‘World of STEM’.</p>
<p>How different is the enterprise of geohumanities? There are many answers to this question. The novelty of <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> begins with the book’s identification of a four-fold partition: studies of geocreativity (creative places), geotexts (spatial literacies), geoimagery (visual geographies), and geohistories (spatial histories). This last categorization intersects with the ‘spatial humanities’ – a vibrant and energetic cross-disciplinary inquiry that receives due prominence in our volume. But the spatial humanities is only one of four categories that we identify and investigate, and there will undoubtedly be more.</p>
<p>The methodology of <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> also sets it apart. Ours is already a public discourse that is developing in new directions. We incorporate a wide variety of scholars and non-scholars in our conversations: artists, architects, experimental cartographers, community activists, photographers, and other professionals – many of whom inhabit multiple roles. We prefer short-form presentations, and the electricity created by juxtaposing contributors rarely gathered together in a single volume. We especially value the almost-audible grinding as the tectonic plates of science, art, epistemologies, writing, and visual media collide. Our book celebrates an epistemological openness and non-exclusionary ontology that is recognizable in Mike Hulme’s ‘relational and embodied’ perspective on knowledge.</p>
<p>
<italic>GeoHumanities</italic> becomes an exercise in the art of reading, too. Contributors, editors, and readers all play their parts through viewing and responding to image, text, and map. In many cases, they occupy multiple roles (as artist and scholar, or geographer and art critic, or art-goer and mapmaker), joining a multidimensional exercise in collaborative understanding about place. This is a signal departure from edited books where scholars simply talk to other scholars. Our inclusion of non-academic contributors creates a productive counterpoint to academic voices, exploring new links between style and meaning. The geohumanities foregrounds an interpretive dialectic that is so often ignored in conventional academic inquiry.</p>
<p>A brief word on the ‘jobs’ question. There is no doubt that the stresses of today’s job market are ubiquitous and debilitating, but we remain unclear about the extent to which Wilson is advocating a more utilitarian approach to tertiary education in response to the imperatives of employment. Job credentials are hardly the sole criterion for the pursuit of knowledge or the practice of education. While jobs in some fields of geography may be scarce, this does not appear to be the case in the humanities where growing numbers of interdisciplinary institutes and inter-campus working groups are springing up (a point reinforced by the Stanley Fish quote in Mike Hulme’s commentary). In this light, training in geohumanities could be regarded as a practical career move.</p>
<p>Hulme’s commentary offers the kind of engagement that we hoped <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> would elicit. He brings a refreshing openness to the conversation, including a concise battery of experiential dimensions relevant to many fields of theory and practice: locality, ambiguity, and plurality. From this purview, he concisely expresses a fundamental transdisciplinary question: ‘What does it mean to be human in a world of changing climates?’ He also bequeaths two hard questions: how to deal with the hegemony of the STEM disciplines, and how to deliver collective projects of social and cultural transformation in a world of ‘hyperpluralism’. Knowledge, power and action loom large in our vision of the geohumanities. In an obituary for Nobel Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom, the mathematician Marco Janssen remarked: ‘A lot of important questions are on the narrow borders between disciplines, but it is difficult to find a home for that kind of work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132513475754b">Rampell, 2012</xref>). The <italic>GeoHumanities</italic> provides a home for work on the interdisciplinary borderlands, and we thank our reviewers for their engagement and the journal’s editor for this opportunity to advance our case.</p>
