<body>
<p>Over the past fifteen years Allan Schore’s several books, numerous articles, and many talks have had an important impact on the world of psychoanalysis and analytic psychotherapy. (Schore is on the clinical faculty, University of California David Geffen School of Medicine.) For a profession hungry for validation and overwhelmed by the difficulty, inaccessibility, and sheer volume of research findings, Schore, through his literature reviews and integration of interdisciplinary research, has been a lifesaver and a cheerleader for psychoanalysis. His emphasis on the importance of affective communication embedded in unconscious right brain functioning has provided research-based neuropsychiatric support for recent clinical and theoretical advances in the areas of trauma, attachment, and developmental pathologies. Reading Schore is both an experience of the new, evident especially in his ability to describe research that might be unknown to clinicians, and of the old, as if he were saying something we already know and practice. Affective resonance and responsiveness, the importance of empathy, the function of dissociation and projection, the crucial (perhaps central) role of nonverbal and embodied communication, all have been discussed at length in the recent analytic literature. Even before Schore, not many would have disputed their importance. But it is nice to be told that research has verified that we are on the right path and that the therapeutic approaches we have developed have “proven effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Schore’s new volume, <italic>The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy</italic>, continues his ongoing effort to report on and integrate the vast literature that has accumulated over the past several decades. The book is divided into two parts, the first five chapters addressing issues of affect regulation, clinical neuropsychoanalysis, and psychotherapy, and the final six dealing with a range of issues including family law, ethology, and the etiology of borderline personality disorder. I will focus here mostly on the first part, which deals more directly with clinical matters of greater interest to psychoanalytic practitioners.</p>
<p>Aided by a veritable library of quotes and references, Schore explains how neuropsychiatric research has proved that the right and left brains have not just different functions, but entirely different attitudes and orientations toward reality. The left brain views the world through reason, and is preoccupied with finding the predictable and known, fitting experience into established schemas and making sense of it through language and other symbolic systems. Consciousness finds its home largely in the left brain, though it is a form of consciousness that is dependent on abstractions and has a tenuous tie to reality. Nonetheless, the left brain works hard to figure it all out and put it into words. By contrast, the right brain is the seat of emotional life, self-experience, and social awareness, most notably empathy. Right brain functioning is largely unconscious (in fact Schore equates the right brain with the Freudian unconscious), but much of the thinking and feeling that allows us to deal with the complexity of relationships and self-feeling originates in the right. A fact that is of crucial importance to Schore’s approach is the early maturation of the major functions of the right brain. This development is dependent on interpersonal interactions and the experience of intersubjectivity between child and mother. Research has shown that parental neglect, serious malattunement to affect states, and trauma can impact the phase-appropriate maturation of the capacity for affect regulation and an inability to manage states of hyper- or hypoarousal. These vulnerabilities lead to serious problems with self- and other regulation, as well as with the ability to relate words to feelings, and to decenter from self in order to empathize with others. In adulthood, people who have experienced a failure in right brain development will struggle to manage feelings and to engage in intimate relationships, and will, because of an overreliance on dissociation as a defense, be unable to maintain a positive and stable self-experience. Schore argues that many of our character-disordered patients suffer from right brain dysfunctions and that no amount of the “talking cure” is going to help them.</p>
<p>Although Schore hints at the relevance of his model for psychotherapy in general, most of his discussion of treatment focuses on patients with severe personality disorders and conditions related to early attachment traumas and failures. For these patients, the experience of trauma during the first years of life, when the right brain is developing at a much more rapid pace relative to the left brain, results in deficits in right brain structuralization that lead to enduring vulnerability to affect dysregulation, self-disorders, and a crippling reliance on dissociation as a means to manage stress and reduce the disruptions of uncontrollable hyper- or hypoarousal. In light of this, Schore argues that analytic therapists must deemphasize verbal interpretations and focus on affect management, empathic immersion, and assisting the patient with affect regulation and the gradual establishment of new psychological capabilities. He asserts that psychotherapy is a form of right-brain-to-right-brain communication. Through right brain nonverbal, psychobiological attunement and “affect synchronizing transactions” the analyst creates the conditions for attachment and eventually for achieving the “long-term goal of reorganizing internal working models into earned secure models that allow for more complex modes of intrapsychic organizations and interpersonal behaviors, and a developmental progression of the ability, in a variety of familiar and novel contexts, to maintain a coherent, continuous and unified sense of self, a function of the right brain, the biological substrate of the human unconscious mind” (p. 281).</p>
<p>In chapter five, “Therapeutic Enactments: Working in Right Brain Windows of Affect Tolerance,” Schore elaborates on affective regulation therapy (ART), which as he describes it relies to a large extent on facilitating and managing experiences of stressful affects activated by the treatment relationship. Specifically, long-standing dissociations that have kept painful affects sequestered break down, and old traumas are reenacted. However, in the new relational context, the empathically resonating analyst, being a coparticipant in a “regulated” enactment, works to maintain a right-brain-to-right-brain connection so that previously overwhelming traumatic feelings can be integrated into the patient’s emotional life. Ultimately, Schore believes that this form of right brain psychotherapy changes brain structure and functioning:
<disp-quote>
<p>Effective therapy can positively alter the developmental trajectory of the deep right brain and facilitate the integration between cortical and subcortical right brain systems. The enhanced interconnectivity allows for an increased complexity of defenses of the emotional right brain, coping strategies for regulating stressful affect that are more flexible and adaptive than pathological dissociation. This in turn enhances the further maturation of the right hemisphere core of the self and its central involvement in patterns of affect that integrate a sense of self across state transitions, thereby allowing for a continuity of inner experience [p. 106].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, Schore argues that effective psychotherapy produces massive rewiring of the brain that undoes the damage of a traumatic early childhood. This is an extraordinary claim. Most analysts would want this to be true, but I think we should be cautious about asserting that analytic psychotherapy can reliably accomplish such sweeping psychological and behavioral changes, not to mention fundamental physical alterations of “deep” brain structures. To support this claim Schore sights a <italic>JAMA</italic> editorial by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113475664">R. M. Glass (2008)</xref>, who states, citing various research findings, that “psychotherapy affects regional blood flow, neurotransmitter metabolism, gene expression and persistent modification in synaptic plasticity” (p. 1589). In a review of this research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113475664">Kay and Kay (2011)</xref>, the authors are clear that these physical changes in the brain seem to be associated with <italic>various</italic> forms of psychotherapy (analytic and nonanalytic) and educational approaches. However, Schore fails to note that these findings are more complicated than the quote from Glass suggests; often they are preliminary, their implications as yet unclear. How brain alterations happen, and what the consequences are, we can’t say for sure. This certainly bears looking into, but Schore is jumping the gun when he claims more specific brain effects and outcomes, let alone advances the idea that analytic psychotherapy can undo developmental damage incurred during the earliest phases of brain maturation. In a sentence not quoted by Schore, Glass is more cautious: “Whether such findings [physical changes resulting from psychotherapy] might eventually lead to improved ways to assess psychotherapies or drug therapies, or to match particular psychotherapies or combination therapies to fundamental patient needs, is an exciting but <italic>uncertain</italic> possibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113475664">Glass 2008</xref>, p. 1589).</p>
<p>Despite these uncertainties, I believe Schore’s research and integrative efforts have important implications for a population of challenging clients who suffer early abuse and neglect during the first two years of life. First, along with other child-parent researchers, Schore presents findings that support the idea of early intervention, specifically therapeutic and educational services for the parents of children found to be at risk. Programs focused on developing parents’ capacities for affect regulation and empathy for the child, as well as interventions designed to reduce stress in the home, are being developed throughout the country. Schore has certainly contributed to the growing importance accorded these programs, and his work has helped equip educators and therapists with the knowledge and skills in this area that they need (see, e.g., chapter 11, “Using Regulation Theory to Guide Clinical Assessments of Mother-Infant Attachment Relationships”).</p>
<p>Second, therapists struggle to help adult patients presenting with significant psychoanalytic disorders complicated by insecure attachment. Increased awareness of the specific areas of affect dysregulation, self-organization, and dissociation can help beleaguered therapists make realistic assessments, plan treatments, and make the best use of themselves in engaging and treating these patients. Putting right brain attachment deficits and needs at the forefront of our clinical understanding and interventions is essential with these people, and Schore’s work is enormously helpful in this regard.</p>
<p>That said, however, what are the implications of Schore’s study for the practice of psychotherapy with the general population of patients with whom the issue of attachment is diverse and its impact variable? Most patients who enter treatment do not suffer from primary attachment disorders (let alone early childhood relational traumas); more often the attachment problems they complain of result from the impact of later traumas, adjustment issues, situational stresses, or old-fashioned neurotic conflicts. In these instances targeting attachment would not be central to the treatment. For these people (the vast majority of our patients) attachment is best viewed as a background issue, important to be aware of and to attend to, but not the main focus of the treatment. These therapies require a balanced brain approach. Once the stress that has brought the patient into treatment is addressed with some right-brain-to-right-brain work, the treatment may soon turn to a largely verbal exploration of fantasy, defense, and transference.</p>
<p>Rather than qualifying his model, which is based on the study of a limited population of patients traumatized in early infancy, Schore extrapolates the findings and his hypotheses about adult pathology and treatment to a range of other clinical conditions and to the practice of psychotherapy in general. Characterizing psychotherapy as a right-brain-to-right-brain communication treatment, he elevates his very useful understanding of early attachment disorders and their treatment to the status of a general psychology in which the right brain is dominant and the left brain, along with the use of language, is viewed as at best secondary.</p>
<p>I believe we must temper our excitement over Shore’s work with cautious skepticism. One of the most striking things about Schore’s writing is his enthusiasm for his model. In this sense his book is not your normal research review. Shore believes fully in his model and presents the research in a breathless and utterly confident manner. He never cites studies that fail to support his ideas, and glosses over contradictions within his own references. For example, the research evidence he cites as proving the effectiveness of psychotherapy comes from studies of therapies that are highly verbal and in which transference interpretations are central to the technique (for a review of the components of psychoanalytic therapy used by researchers, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065113475664">Shedler 2010</xref>). The findings of these studies, which have shown that psychoanalytic psychotherapy is highly effective with persons with personality disorders, do not appear to support Schore’s right brain focus. Research has shown that effective psychotherapies combine verbal exploration and insight with supportive techniques, a combination in which the needs of the right brain and the left brain are balanced and support each other. Unfortunately, Schore tends to deemphasize points that are not consistent with his ideas and to neglect any statements advising caution (as in the Glass article quoted above). Tellingly, there are fifty-four references under “right brain” in the index, in which “left brain” does not appear even once. This makes me a bit concerned, leaving me wondering as I read whether something important is being “left” out.</p>
<p>In addition, though Schore’s findings have important implications for analytic therapies, I think we need to be realistic. First, the notion of managing and promoting unconscious affective integrations is a challenging idea. How is this done? Schore doesn’t give much information about the practical aspects of affect regulation therapy. What is the frequency and duration of sessions? Apart from enactments, what does the therapy consist of and how does it differ from standard psychoanalytic therapy? Since enactments often go unrecognized and can be traumatic to the therapist, how can we safely and responsibly integrate them into the treatment protocol? How can therapists work with any certainty or rigor if what they are working with is essentially unknown and unknowable? And finally, most important, what is the role of language in the work? One could say in answer to these questions, “Well that’s the art of psychotherapy!” But then where is the science behind the art? This is where I believe Schore’s approach has its limitations. In the end he offers little scientific evidence or guidance regarding what specifically is effective in psychotherapy. Rather, he presents findings from attachment, neuropsychiatric, and developmental research and then extrapolates those findings to propose a form of psychotherapy that, while challenging and perhaps useful, has not been operationally articulated, let alone tested. He then makes claims for the effects and benefits of such a therapy that are unfounded and at times fantastic. I agree with Schore that this work must be done, but I think we also need to acknowledge just how hard and uncertain the work is, and how difficult it is to find the rare therapist capable of such grueling and emotionally taxing work.</p>
<p><italic>The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy</italic> is a massively left brain book. Stuffed with research results and complex, demanding sentences heavy with technical language and complex ideas, it clearly appeals to our left-brain-obsessed profession. But what Schore is exhorting the therapist to do is to eschew verbal interpretation and go with one’s feeling and communicate body to body, brain to brain, without the stifling restriction of consciousness and language. The overall effect is very dissociative. Schore’s left brain is instructing the reader’s left brain to give up control to the right brain, to stop thinking and to not use words. The problem is we cannot silence the left brain, especially after relying on it so heavily and for so long to understand Schore’s book. In any case, what would the right brain think without the left brain’s words?</p>
<p>Part of the problem is Schore’s tendency to view language as primarily a function of the left brain. Iain McGilchrist points out that language functions are distributed across both left and right brains, and like everything else, have different meanings in the two hemispheres. Each uses language differently, and different aspects of it stand out in the use that each hemisphere makes of language. While things like syntax and vocabulary are housed in the left, the right brain makes understanding the words possible, as well as decoding language’s emotional significance and less rational aspects. The right brain humanizes language. But without the left brain, the right brain would be speechless, without the tools necessary to make sense of the world or of the self. McGilchrist’s findings also imply that language is a tool for the exploration of the unconscious. In fact, the right brain’s crucial role in language, particularly the way language is given emotional meaning by the right brain, supports the idea that the use of language in psychotherapy is a crucial active agent in the communication that goes on between the brains of patients and therapists (a point Schore is aware of but does not elaborate). Without the left brain the right brain is mute, a cauldron of feeling and impressions that cannot be given form (the id?). With the help of the left brain, the right brain is given the capacity to use symbols, which, imbuing it now with passion, feeling, humor, and the like, makes human relationships and human culture possible. I would argue in fact that the only way analysts can manage and make use of the nonverbal, affectively dysregulated experience of enactment is to mobilize the resources of the left brain (equipped perhaps with memory of Schore’s books) to join forces with the emotional right brain, in order to work through and make sense of the until then unconscious clinical event. After all, the power of psychoanalysis has been to bring language and the body together in a dynamic tension that allows the work to get done. The role of the therapist is to assist the patient in bringing left brain and right brain back on line as an effectively functioning system, in which diversity, connectedness, interdependence, and the drive for adaptation create the conditions for creativity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113475664">McGilchrist (2009)</xref> has noted, “Everything human involves both hemispheres: we do virtually nothing with one hemisphere alone” (p. 210).</p>
<p>Let me close with a question: Given our new appreciation of the role played by the right brain, does the left brain still matter? I think it does. The type of thinking the left brain engages in (use of language, identification of regularities, analytic thinking) needs to be included in the picture. While I agree with Schore that psychoanalysis has overemphasized left brain functioning, it seems necessary to inquire how we can more effectively balance left and right functions in a way in which both are included in our models of psychopathology and health. Most important, we need to better understand how our two brains collaborate in effective clinical treatment. Most psychotherapies, including, I would assume, ART, consist of regular, structured, familiar, and conversation-based sessions. Affects are regulated by this structure but also by our use of language. These left brain aspects do inhibit and contain affects, so as to make the inevitable enactment an exception to the ongoing process. Schore is right to point out that in these affectively dysregulated experiences language is not as effective as responsiveness and “deep” contact. However, the therapist’s ability to think through the process and mobilize left brain resources may be essential to his or her ability to figure out what to do. Surrender to a traumatic state of feeling and being can be risky for both patient and therapist. The left brain’s ability to coolly break the situation down and even apply some theory to the problem is frequently necessary. After all, except in instances of severe brain injury or such traumatic states as Schore describes, both brains function simultaneously and should not be viewed apart from one another. The therapist must retain analytical skill and the capacity to access language. This is where Schore’s model needs fleshing out with greater specificity. From the start, Freud emphasized the complexity of the dynamic relationship between consciousness and the unconscious. There was no way to know the unconscious without words and language. The “talking cure” is an affectively charged and passionate enterprise in which language, fantasy, and desire become mixed up so they can then be disentangled, understood, and reintegrated. Psychoanalysis was developed as a means to rectify the imbalance between the physical demands of the right brain, on the one hand, and on the other the left brain struggle to be reasonable and cope. This, I think, was Freud’s point when he developed the structural model: left brain and right brain, conscious and unconscious, ego and id are inherently at odds, but ultimately they are uneasy collaborators whose shared goal is the survival and enhancement of the self.</p>
