<p>The following interview was conducted over email by H. Samy Alim in July <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0075424212463821">2012</xref>. The text reflects our style-shifting between multiple ways of speaking and writing. Some editing of the original exchanges was done in preparing the interview for publication. The quotations from Barack Obama’s speeches represent our own transcription of the original speeches. Geneva Smitherman dedicates this interview to revolutionary linguist, the late Dr. Neville Alexander, her long-time friend and comrade in the struggle for language rights.</p>

<p><italic>As we approach the 2012 American presidential elections, we have our nation’s first Black president. What does it mean for the United States of America to have a president who can shift in and out of Black ways of speaking?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>When we celebrated that historic November night in 2008, my father, Pastor Emeritus Harry Napoleon, who grew up in the Jim Crow South, kept saying “I cain’t believe it!” But the younguns, some of whom had voted for the first time, kept saying, “Why not?” They are, as we point out in <italic>Articulate While Black: Barack Obama, Language, and Race in the United States</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0075424212463821">Alim &amp; Smitherman 2012</xref>], members of an emerging postmodern generation who never doubted the possibility of a Black president. Me? I kept saying, “Not only the first Black but the first Black Language-speaking president!” (and, to myself, “This the icing on the muthafuckin cake!”). From the basketball courts, the campaign trail, Ben’s Chili Bowl, Ray’s Hell Burger, trash talkin wit Hip Hop artist P.Diddy, to signifyin on Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents’ dinner, Obama shifts in and out of multiple ways of speaking—without devaluing any of them. This means we now have a national linguistic role model, not just for Black Americans but for all Americans.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>In what ways does Barack Obama represent or show his “Black-hand side,” when it comes to language? How does he reinvent The Tradition as well?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Barack reppin his linguistic “Black-hand side”? How much time we got? We discuss numerous examples in the book. Here I’ll just say a lil some-un, some-un bout two examples, which made national headlines: the “Race Speech” and “Nah, we straight.”</p>
<p>Obama delivered “A More Perfect Union,” now known simply as the “Race Speech,” during the presidential campaign when he was forced to confront the Black elephant in the campaign room: the treacherous minefield of race. He delivered it at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on March 18, 2008. It was crafted in but went beyond the rhetorical tradition of the Black Jeremiad, a term coined by historian Wilson Jeremiah Moses in his <italic>Black Messiahs and Uncle Toms: Social and Literary Manipulations of a Religious Myth</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0075424212463821">1993</xref>]. . . .</p>
<p>Speaking from a Black and a White (as well as a globally diverse) perspective on race, he displayed a depth of understanding of multiple racial perspectives and the past in which those perspectives are still mired: “The past isn’t dead and buried. In fact, it isn’t even past.” Obama’s oratorical remix allowed him to address Black and White perceptions of past and present experiences around race and racism and to sound the clarion call to Blacks and Whites of the “audacity to hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.” The genius of the “Race Speech” lies in the fact that Obama insightfully analyzed his Black and White audiences and selected a familiar rhetorical touchstone—the Jeremiad—and core, shared values embodied in the American Dream and the prophetic tradition of Christianity. He framed it all in careful arguments, both personal (ethos) and logical (logos), stamping his unique rhetorical imprint on American public speaking conventions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the “Race Speech” contains only one iconic Black Linguistic phrase, but it’s a powerful one: “makin a way outta no way,” rendered by Obama as “making a way out of no way.” A long-standing idiom in B[lack] L[anguage], “makin a way outta no way” reflects the Black will to survive when there is no way out. It announces that, even when given very little to work with or when all the cards seem stacked against us, we will find a way to survive—and thrive. Used by Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his speeches and writings, “makin a way outta no way” is embodied in the “faith of the fathers,” a belief in a God-centered universe and the social justice of Christianity. This idiom became a metaphor for Obama’s overall strategic success in the “Race Speech.” By employing this familiar, culturally rooted Black Vernacular trope in the speech, he symbolically indexed his Black identity, repped his Black cultural affinity and advanced a political stance that framed the Black condition in terms of success, not failure: “What’s remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but rather how many men and women overcame the odds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them.” This rhetorical strategy probably flew right over the heads of most White and other non-Black listeners, but to Black folks it signaled a cultural-linguistic connection and political worldview that validates the Black Experience. Simultaneously, Obama articulated this vernacular idiom in the formal voice of the LWC (Language of Wider Communication, or as some would have it, the Language of Whiter Communication). Most Black Language speakers pronounce this idiom with a particular Black prosody and rhythm and render “out of” as “outta.” Barack, however, utters it in a highly formal register, enunciating every syllable. Thus he found a way to articulate Blackness on a national stage—quietly communicating an important ideological message to the Black electorate—but doing so in a form that was digestible to non-Black America.</p>
<p>Now, on to the “Nah, we straight” event. When President Obama visited Ben’s Chili Bowl, an informal, well-known eatery in the heart of Washington, D.C., he interacted with a Black cashier. When offered his change, he declined with the statement, “Nah, we straight.” Yall can check it out on YouTube. In this simple phrase, Obama uses three features of Black Language: (1) Instead of saying “no,” he says “nah,” a low monophthong. Considered by most linguists as a lexical variant of “no” and used, to some extent, by speakers throughout the United States, “nah” is more often than not associated with the speech of Black folks. Varying between lexical variants and different pronunciations are hallmarks of Barack Obama’s style-shifting. For instance, in a South Carolina speech, where there was a racially mixed audience, he uses the phrase “with my Bible,” monophthongizing the diphthongs in <italic>my</italic> and <italic>Bible.</italic> (2) He uses <italic>straight</italic> in its Black, now-crossover youthful sense to mean he was “OK,” “fine,” “alright” about not getting his change back. Aside from its ever-evolving slang, the lexicon of BL is not as widely known outside the Black community. Obama also uses words and phrases from this less widely known dimension of BL, terms which have survived for generations in the Black community, such as “trifling,” “high yella,” “Tom/Uncle Tom,” and “house nigger,” all of which he uses in his biographical <italic>Dreams from My Father</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424212463821">1995</xref>]. (3) The third BL feature in Obama’s “Nah, we straight” is a well-studied variation of what leading sociolinguist John R. Rickford called BL’s “showcase variable,” the copula. As sociolinguists have shown, BL has a more complex verbal system than any White American variety of English. While speakers of White American varieties only have two ways of representing the copula, BL speakers have three. Depending on context and meaning, in BL, you can say “We are straight,” “We’re straight,” or “We ∅ straight.” Black folks shift among these variants, all of which have the same literal meaning, but differ in social meaning. But Black folks don’t be just leavin the copula out randomly—copula absence follows a well-documented set of linguistic constraints.</p>
<p>Though he confidently and masterfully shifts styles, President Obama is well aware that all is not right with the linguistic world. His take on the linguistic hegemony of this country is eye-opening: “None of us—Black, White, Latino, or Asian—is immune to the stereotypes that our culture continues to feed us, especially stereotypes about Black criminality, Black intelligence, or the Black work ethic. In general, members of every minority group continue to be measured largely by the degree of our assimilation—how closely speech patterns, dress, or demeanor conform to the dominant White culture—and the more that a minority strays from these external markers, the more he or she is subject to negative assumptions” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0075424212463821">Obama 2006</xref>:235].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>Damn, that’s deep. In relation to that, any attempt to cram nearly 50 years of work on the front lines of the language wars into one succinct statement is bound to fail, but if I had to summarize the primary goal of your career, I think it’d go a lil something like this: “Geneva Smitherman’s lifework has been about studying language in order to expose and disrupt White cultural and linguistic hegemony.”</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>I like that. But we need to add the other half of my lifelong struggle to hold up the blood-stained banner of BL. Remixing W. E. B. Du Bois, I would add, “and to uplift the linguistic souls of Black folks.” The European cultural and linguistic hegemony, not only here in the US, but throughout the African diaspora, done made an indelible imprint on the psyche of African people. Yes, our centuries-old struggle against racism and White linguistic-cultural hegemony reflects resistance and struggle, but it also reflects ambivalence about the value of our language and culture. See, this “problem” of BL didn’t become a “problem” until the 1950s, after we had done been here for over three centuries. I mean wahn’t nobody complaining bout Black kids’ speech in 1619, 1719, 1819, 1919. But when Black folks was on the move, circa 1954, the year of the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision on segregation of schools, suddenly Blacks had a language problem.</p>
<p>Yo language is yo identity, yo sense of self, yo community, indeed your very humanity. Ain no denyin that linguistic imperialism shit done took a toll on some—too many—of our people. As Frantz Fanon taught, ways of talking represent ways of thinking. Or like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0075424212463821">Voloshinov [1973</xref>:70] contended, ideology is revealed in a word. <italic>Articulate While Black</italic> draws on that dope-ass quote from Toni Morrison about the Black child coming to school and being “faced with [those] books that are less than his own language. And then to be told things about his language, which is him, that are sometimes permanently damaging. . . . This is a really cruel fallout of racism” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0075424212463821">1981</xref>:27].</p>
<p>It’s the Duboisian double consciousness. In <italic>Talkin and Testifyin</italic> [1977], I dubbed it linguistic push-pull: pushing toward White American Language and Culture while pulling away from it and toward the embrace of Black Language and Culture. How do you reconcile this fundamental contradiction in the development of the Black psyche? The instrumental, functional need for literate proficiency in White American English with the psycho-cultural love and affinity with the Black Language Thang? The Black Movement, with its push for equity and Black empowerment and the reclamation of Black history, Culture, and Language, made a direct frontal attack on this linguistic double consciousness. But it became an unfinished quest, cut off at the pass by COINTELPRO [the FBI’s Counter-Intelligence Program] and by the end of the Second Reconstruction ushered in by the Reagan–Bush era. But now that, like Jay-Z said, the mainstream done crossed over to us, and BL done joined the ranks of Global Englishes, maybe we on our way to becoming a society where everybody and they momma shifts speaking styles, or merges them, as Vershawn Young argues, in coining the term “code-meshing.”</p>
<p>Uplifting the linguistic souls of Black folks is why I wrote <italic>Talkin and Testifyin</italic>. To help us understand who we are linguistically-culturally, to understand why and how we say the things we say as well as why we say the thangs we don’t say (shout out to Haki [Madhubuti]). To recover and reclaim the Black Language psyche from the psycho-social distortions and warped myths that done been inflicted on us during our journey here in what Baldwin once called the “North American wilderness.” Linguists and other academics have critiqued <italic>Talkin and Testifyin</italic> for its lack of adherence to the academic canon. That’s right—for the most part, that canon was pointed at me and my people! I just do like Jay-Z and brush that dirt off my shoulders. I was aware of those critiques, but—hello!—the book wahn’t wrote for academic linguists and scholars up in ivory and ebony towers. It was a labor of love, a gift to my people. Contrary to popular myth, Black folks do read books. It was deliberately designed to appeal to the broader reading public, Black and White, but especially Black. And knowing that some Blacks had not been taught to read, I carefully chose each cartoon in the book to visually convey the written message. I was on a mission, like my intellectual comrades in the Movement—historians, psychologists, sociologists, rhetoricians, and other emerging Black intellectuals—we were all involved in knowledge production to educate the Black community about its true Self. I sought this corrective to linguistic miseducation, to put the lie to the racist discourse of so-called scholars as well as lay folk about BL. Cuz like Brotha Dyson [Michael Eric Dyson] say, conversations about Black Language are ultimately conversations about Black humanity. It’s that critical.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>You used that phrase by Jay-Z there (“get that dirt off your shoulders”)—some folks call you the “Jay-Z of the Academy.” To me, you’re more like Tupac, just straight gangsta, in all of its senses.</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, I can see the kinship wit Pac. In his short life, he was consciously bout the bidness of Black uplift, in his Hip Hop lyrics, conversation, and youth organizing. I think of raps like “Dear Mama,” and “Keep Ya Head Up,” and his last piece, after the Million Man March, where he pleads with us Sistas: “Every woman in America, especially Black, bear with us, can’t you see that we under attack?” He just left us too soon. He mighta become my favorite Hip Hop emcee, had he lived and fulfilled his calling. But my favorite is Nas. He’s a powerful lyricist, and always pushing the creative, linguistic envelope. His beats are sweet (you can even dance to his raps!), and his themes are empowering—“If I Ruled the World,” “One Mic” (my South African colleagues loved that, especially after checkin out the video), and “Nigger” (though he ended up not titling his album that). He is serious about his artistic craft and committed to the aesthetic and social evolution of Hip Hop Culture (“Hip Hop Is Dead”).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>And your favorite Black Arts Movement poet?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>My favorite Black Arts Movement poet, hands down, is Haki Madhubuti, whom I met way Back in the Day when he was Don L. Lee. He more than any other Black Arts Movement poet tapped into BL, wove it into his poetic text (“We walk the way of the new world”), played wit it (“He was cool, or he even stopped for green lights”), and displayed its revolutionary possibility (“Blackman/an unfinished history”).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>That’s deep, cuz I had this conversation with Zion I—some of the illest Hip Hop cats out in Berkeley—and they actually brought up Don L. Lee as an inspiration: “The way he would just like capture words and put this ill-ass-Black-funk-ghetto within it. But he had a crazy intellect, you know what I’m saying? So, when he expressed his shit, it sounded like real street corner. But he was lookin at it like, ‘This shit ain’t cool,’ you know what I’m saying? But it was like so fresh that it was like Black folks was widdit, what he was saying . . . his style. . . . He was talkin about African tikis and ultraviolet-hip-triple-cool-Black, you know what I’m saying?”</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>See, THAT’S what I’m talkin bout! You gotta have skillz AND you gotta be sayin something!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p>. . . <italic>Now, just a while ago you said that, through Hip Hop Culture, BL has joined the ranks of “Global Englishes”—why is that important?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Well, the main thing is the irony of the situation. Since the 1950s, and especially in the 1960s and 1970s, educators and sociolinguists and Black parents have been campaigning for BL-speaking youth to either eradicate their BL or learn to master “standard English” so they will be proficient in both Black and White English. Now, however, the mainstream is on Black Talk like white on rice. Like Black folks—not all, of course—done put all these years and time, and energy into trying to be like Whites, in language and culture, and now Whites tryna be like and talk like Blacks!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>It seem like the linguistic creativity of BL-speakers gets recognized everywhere but schools. Can you walk us through from “English teacher, why you be doing the thangs you don’t do?” [1972] to your latest thinking on language education for Black (and other) youth?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>“English teacher” was a piece I started writing when I was teaching high school English and Latin, frustrated by the linguistic damage I saw being inflicted upon the students, not only at my high school but also at others, as young people at church shared their stories every Sunday. I returned to that piece after I finished grad school which I had entered with the thought of getting my Ph.D. and returning as school superintendent to right the ship. Of course, in my youthful idealism, I ain have a clue bout how this miracle hiring was spose to happen. I just knew that the younguns I was teaching had a lot goin for them, intellectually and creatively, but the language Thang kept hangin them up. Once I convinced them that they could master ANY language, wahn’t no stoppin ’em.</p>
<p>During my years in grad school, I did some K-12 substitute teaching in city and suburban schools, taught Freshman Composition (as it was called Back in the Day) on community college and university levels, conducted several teacher training workshops on language, and attended dozens of local and national conference sessions on language. These experiences were an eye-opener. Many, if not most, English teachers, including those from elite suburbia, had decidedly negative attitudes about any form of American English other than that prescribed in those god-awful English language textbooks in use in K-12 classrooms everywhere. These experiences, coupled with the Black Liberation Movement’s mandate of study and struggle, made me realize that there was a profound need for research on BL—and the need to get the word out about that research to English and Freshman Comp teachers across the nation.</p>
<p>The article was published in the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) <italic>English Journal</italic> in 1972—40 years ago. The journal has a wide readership of K-university English teachers and teacher-trainers. My rhetorical strategy was to give props to those teachers doing a good job and call out the bad teachers (without naming them although I knew a slew of names from Chi-town to Cali). I strategically used loud-talkin and signifyin, remixing a line from the Don L. Lee poem I just mentioned, “Blackman/an unfinished history” for the title, and deploying the message-driven humor of Langston Hughes’s Jesse B. Semple. In the process, I lay waste the prevailing pedagogy for BL speaking students—eradicationism and bidialectalism—and conclude with a Five Point Program for teaching English in the inner-city (as we referred to Black urban areas in those years). Teachers were always asking, “Well, what do I do, if I don’t correct the students’ spelling, grammar, (mis)pronunciation.” So “English teacher” tries to show them what to do. I wrote that article showcasing the flava of BL throughout. It was one of the very first published pieces in which I began to experiment with writing in the “dialect of my nurture” (shout out to <italic>Students’ Right to Their Own Language</italic>, an organizational language policy passed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0075424212463821">Conference on College Composition and Communication—CCCC—in 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The Five Point Program drew on strategies that I had used in my own high school teaching and on the work of Beryl Bailey, our first Sista linguist, who used Black literary works in her language research and applied her theoretical knowledge to language and literacy instruction on public school and college levels. Yeah, I’m standin on the shoulders of many thousands gone. Lemme just summarize the Five Points: (1) Examination of alternative lifestyles—student discussions of life in their everyday world outside of school, so they could make informed choices about their lives; (2) Emphasis on reading—few inner-city students were reading on grade level; (3) Emphasis on oral work, debates, speeches, etc., capitalizing on the rich verbal skills the students bring to the classroom; (4) Intensive study of language and culture and social and regional dialects, and study of the social and political nature of American language varieties; (5) In oral and written work, emphasis on the real components of rhetorical power: content, message, logical development, use of supporting details and examples, analysis and arrangement, variation of word choice and sentence structure, etc. I used student themes, speeches and surveys to illustrate each of the Five Points.</p>
<p>My thinking about the language curriculum for BL speakers has evolved to reflect a twenty-first century perspective. I now advocate language and literacy instruction using Hip Hop and sports, for which I am indebted to the vision and work of Drs. Austin Jackson and Rachel Laws-Myers and history graduate student Kyle Mays. Working as mentors and graduate student coordinators, they developed and refined a Hip Hop and sports language and literacy curriculum for the middle school Black boys in My Brother’s Keeper, the mentoring program I founded in 1990 as a partnership between Michigan State University and the Detroit Public Schools’ Malcolm X Academy (now Paul Robeson Malcolm X Academy).</p>
<p>Today I would have students study their own language, and that of their community, instructing them to use the tools of ethnography. This is an idea for which I am indebted to you, Alim, which grew out of your research and teaching Black high school students out there in “Sunnyside”—from your book, <italic>You Know My Steez</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0075424212463821">2004</xref>]. I am still firm about teaching students from a Critical Linguistics perspective, to analyze and understand the relationship between language, race and power, within a paradigm of knowledge for social transformation. I am firm that we should teach students not how to play the game but “help them understand how the game’s been rigged and, more importantly, how they can work to change it,” as we state at the end of <italic>Articulate While Black.</italic></p>
<p>From Jump Street, I have been opposed to bidialectalism. It places a double burden on Black students since it’s only bidialectalism for them, not for White students who can get by being monodialectal, thank you very much. Since then, I have changed my thinking about the structural/syntactic differences between White and Black English. Then I was arguing that the syntactic differences were superfluous, mere surface structure level differences. The work of Creolists, such as John Rickford and Arthur Spears, and the theoretical linguistics work of Lisa Green, clearly demonstrates structural-semantic differences, especially in aspect. Nonetheless, my call for a language policy of bi/multilingualism for ALL students remains. All kids should have some language learning to do. Cause if it’s only Black kids and other students of Color that have to learn to be bidialectal, then we’re back to what White linguist James Sledd in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0075424212463821">1969</xref> called the “linguistics of White supremacy.”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>One thing that always stood out to me is how you consistently situate your analysis of BL within the Black Experience. For example, if you open up Talkin That Talk and read the intro, the first scholars you come across are not linguists; they are revolutionary philosophers, historians, and psychiatrists (W. E. B. Du Bois, Carter G. Woodson, and Frantz Fanon). Why do you ground your work in this way, in the work of “non-linguists”?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Non-linguists, yeah, but they were all revolutionary in their thinking. They understood and advocated that the role of the intellectual is not just to understand the world, but to change it. I was introduced to the work of these scholar-activists in study groups in the Black Liberation Movement. Having been miseducated and undereducated in the schools, me and my contemporaries were aware of our ignorance of Black history and our lack of scientific knowledge about the Black Experience. I came to understand my language research not just as research for research’s sake, but language research for people’s sake.</p>
<p>Without a grounding in Black social, cultural, and political history, in the norms and values of the Black community, and a historical and contemporary understanding of the Black Experience, there is a serious danger for BL research to be misinterpreted. This is what happened with the work of sociolinguists and ethnographers in the 1960s and 70s. Their research received widespread public attention in the media and in K-12 schools in urban areas. The work was disseminated to a public unacquainted with ethnography and sociolinguistic theory. These scholars were well intentioned; they sought to counter the linguistic-cognitive deficit theorists, like Deutsch, Bereiter, Engelmann, who were arguing that BL was “not merely an underdeveloped version of standard English,” but rather “a non-logical mode of expressive behavior” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0075424212463821">Bereiter et al. 1966</xref>:112-113], etc., etc. However, rather than writing and speaking to the people, and in a language that the people could understand, these scholar elites communicated among themselves in academic venues and allowed their descriptions of BL to be reproduced through the media and lay channels. As a result, in the American mind-set, these descriptions served to reinforce the worst stereotypes of Black people as clowns, low-lifes, sex-crazed. Black speech was looked upon as the lingo of criminals, dope-pushers, teenage hoodlums, and various and sundry hustlers, who spoke only in “muthafuckas” and “pussy-copping raps.” I gotta mention that one of the most important scholars in this tradition, Roger Abrahams, recognized and lamented this sorry state of affairs. In the second edition of his <italic>Deep Down in the Jungle</italic>, published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0075424212463821">1970</xref>, he apologized to his “neighbors and friends” and acknowledged the institutional character of racism in academic scholarship that influenced his work: “. . . My ex post facto judgments had been conditioned by my reading of the scholarship on Black life rather than by the life style I had observed and experienced” [1970:1].</p>
<p>To avoid BL research being sensationalized and exotic, what needs to be presented is the whole linguistic and rhetorical range of Black Life, from the secular trash talkin of the street and basketball court to the talkin and testifyin of the family reunion and the Black Church. When we study BL—ANY language, really—we need to be cognizant that we’re not just studying the language but people who speak the language.</p>
<p>Another case in point has to do with the changing semantics of race, what Black people choose or have chosen to call ourselves at different points in historical time. To those without social and historical consciousness and knowledge of the Black Experience, such changes may appear frivolous, gratuitous, random, erratic, even nonsensical. However, these labels are situated in sociopolitical dynamics. And it’s not only the racial labels, the change from Africanized to de-Africanized English is also linked to historical events and modal experiences. For example, in the early years of enslavement in the seventeenth century, when the African experience and home were painfully fresh, the enslaved population referred to themselves as “African” and inscribed “African” in the names of their institutions. This was also the period of the pidginization of English, developed as a lingua franca between master and slave, and as a common language between Africans from various ethnolinguistic groups. Over time, as Africa became more remote and more enslaved Africans were born on American soil, rather than forcibly imported from the Continent, the racial semantic changed to “Colored,” and the pidginized English became creolized. Each modal experience—Emancipation, world wars, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, etc.—resulted in a shift in semantics to capture the changed material condition and status of Blacks.</p>

<p>It’s now starkly clear that linguistic imperialism, as Robert Phillipson labeled it, knows no boundaries. He considers English linguistic imperialism an example of “linguicism.” It functions through ideologies and practices that reproduce social injustice and inequality between groups on the basis of language. Working with Ana Celia and Victor taught me about the commonality of the Latina/o struggle with that of Blacks, around the issue of language and identity, the suppression of language rights, and linguicism writ large. The movement to amend the US Constitution and/or pass local laws declaring English the official language of the US, which evolved into the English Only Movement, would not just affect speakers of Spanish (and “Spanglish”). BL speakers would also feel the impact as well as speakers of any language or variety other than “standard English.” Because clearly the English that would be legislated as “official” would not be Black English, nor Spanglish, nor Hawaiian (Creole) English, etc., etc.—it would be “standard English” only. One of the things Victor, Ana Celia and I did early on was to work with the CCCC and NCTE to pass the National Language Policy. The ultimate goal is legislation that would mandate the teaching of multilingualism in K-12 schools. Rather than English Only, we call for English Plus: English, as a link language, plus the student’s native language/variety and a foreign language. We’re a long way off from this in the US but I believe the time will come.</p>
<p>As to South Africa, its history of settler colonialism, buttressed in the mid-twentieth century by apartheid, created a different but no less treacherous form of linguistic imperialism. Even now, almost 20 years into their new democracy, and with a policy of eleven official languages enshrined in their constitution, the impact and lingering effects of language colonization are painfully pronounced. There too, there is linguistic push-pull, manifested in ambivalence about the value of indigenous South African languages, in comparison to English and Afrikaans, which reigned as the only two official languages of the country until 1994 and the establishment of the new South Africa. I remember on my second visit there, in 1996, I was living in the home of a Ghanaian sociologist, who had worked with the South African liberation movement and had chosen to resettle there in South Africa. He had hired a isiXhosa-speaking maid (or “domestic worker,” to use current South African lingo) because he wanted his three kids to learn to speak Xhosa from their interaction with her. Ha! She not only refused to speak isiXhosa—which was the language of then-President Mandela!—she also upbraided me when she learned that I was paying a local Xhosa-speaking teacher to tutor me in the language. My girl was like, “What? You’re paying good American dollars for this?” That’s when I realized I was right at home.</p>

<p><italic>White American discourse on the United States as “post-racial” seems to overlap with White South African discourse on a “post-apartheid” era. What are the similarities and differences between the Black American and the Black South African experience in terms of language and the current political moment?</italic></p>
</speech>

<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Both terms seek to capture a social reality in which race no longer matters, to flip the script on Cornel West’s well-known book title. South Africa goes even further and touts itself as the “rainbow nation.” Well, maybe they say race no longer counts, but language sure does, and in both countries language serves as a mirror of race. In <italic>Articulate While Black</italic> we talk about “languaging race.” Language becomes a way of talking about race under another heading. In this country, the speakers of BL are by and large African slave descendants. And during enslavement speaking “good” or “poor” English was a part of how masters described their slaves. Today, the race of Whites and Blacks talking over the phone can be readily identified by their language, as John Baugh’s linguistic profiling work has shown [see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0075424212463821">2003</xref>]. Discriminating against speakers of BL becomes racial discrimination by proxy. So folks can say all they want about “post-racial,” the US sho ain post-language.</p>
<p>In the South African context, race still, by and large, is reflected in language and language issues and preferences, even though the new South Africa tried to step to the challenge by enshrining a constitutional provision of eleven official languages, thus providing for the nine indigenous African languages (isiXhosa, isiZulu, Setswana, etc.) to take their place alongside the historically official English and Afrikaans. However, those who are first-language English speakers tend to be those formerly classified as “White” or “Indian.” First-language Afrikaans speakers tend to be those formerly classified as “Colored” and “White”/Afrikaner. And the overwhelming majority of South Africans, some 75 percent or so, who are first-language speakers of the indigenous languages tend to be those formerly classified as “African”/Black. Yes, the country’s Language in Education Policy provides for each school community to choose, from among the official languages, the language of instruction. And yes, the LiEP also provides for each community to select the additional language that its children will study as a subject. In these ways, they are more linguistically democratic and open than the US. Nonetheless, first-language English speakers, who tend to be “White” or “Indian,” are valued more highly than, say, first-language isiXhosa speakers, for employment. And parents—of all ethnolinguistic groups—tend to “pressurise for English,” as the South Africans say, not isiZulu or Setswana, etc., as the language of teaching and learning for their children. And the flava of English that is highly prized is not BSAE (Black South African English).</p>
<p>South African intellectuals, such as my colleague, well-known linguist and educational activist, Dr. Neville Alexander, vigorously promote mother tongue instruction and reading materials in the indigenous languages. And of course, speaking (“standard”/White) English don’t mean you are White in either South Africa or the US. But the language-race association persists, and it’s gon take some time—either that or a revolution—for “post-racial” and “post-apartheid” to kick in.</p>

<p><italic>On the methodological tip, you’ve made some of the dopest statements I’ve ever heard. One that stands out to me is: “Niggers is more than deleted copulas.” What was the context, and what are the methodological implications of this statement?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Check it: Until I came along and Baugh and Rickford in the 1970s, and with the untimely death of Beryl Bailey, there had been no Black linguists studying BL since Lorenzo Dow Turner in the 1920s. And his research was on Gullah Blacks living on the Sea Islands, a small population in terms of numbers, whose enslavement and linguistic history differed in many respects from that of the millions of enslaved Blacks on the US mainland. In the 1960s, the elephant in the room was that the tremendous body of research on BL—and the allocation of research funds and resources—was done by, and given to, White researchers. It was a time of Black intellectual-activists beginning to raise questions about the theories and research, including typologies and labels, of White scholars in many fields—often leading to breakaway from White organizations and the subsequent formation of Black professional organizations, such as the Association of Black Psychologists, a co-founder of which was Dr. Robert Williams, who coined the term Ebonics in 1972. In sociolinguistics, given the significance of the copula, White sociolinguists frequently cited quantitative data about “copula deletion” in BL—as if that structure was some sort of linguistic exotica that summed up the linguistic repertoire of BL speakers. All emphasis was on language structure, not use, a methodological fault in much of the linguistic research done on Black Talk in that period.</p>
<p>I first used “Niggers is more than deleted copulas” in a talk I gave while I was on the Harvard faculty in AfroAmerican Studies. As I recall, I gave that talk at the Harvard conference on language and the Black child, convened by the late Dr. Gary Simpkins, then a graduate student in clinical psychology at Harvard. The statement repped my critique of the methodological approach and linguistic descriptions in the literature of that period. Not only did quantitative sociolinguistics obscure the creative linguistic vitality of BL speakers, there was also the question of the validity of the variationist paradigm in determining “who speaks Negro,” as poet Sarah Webster Fabio put it back then [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0075424212463821">1966</xref>]. If a group has a few speakers contributing the BL syntax, is it appropriate to aggregate such language data as if these data were evenly distributed among the group? Especially given the work that was coming out of Black psychology pointing toward far greater variability within the Black group, Black vs. Black, compared to intergroup differences, Black vs. White.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>Speaking directly to this point, the general public is coming to understand Blackness as polylithic Folks like Touré are bringing ideas of "post-Blackness" to the public. This makes me think about how linguists describe BL—and how recently, some Black folks (usually educated, middle class, etc.) are pushing back against static notions of BL, resisting the idea that you must speak a certain way to be authentically “Black.” Your recent work has opened up a way of looking at the emergence of a Black bilingual consciousness.</italic></p>

<p>. . . When I say “language,” uhm not talkin bout phonemes and morphemes, deleted copulas, aspectual be, multiple negation, and the like. Or, at least, not JUST that. I’m tryna reference a Linguistic Tradition that has many diverse dimensions, all recognizable as Blackness. I think this is what Spears is trying to get at with his subcategories, like Standard African American English as a variety of African American English.</p>
<p>How we got off track was too narrowly defining BL in the first place, and to make matters worse, not handlin our bidness with reference to receptive and productive competence in BL. There are registers, linguistic touchstones, linguistic-cultural references, oral traditions, and so on that a speaker may not use herself but she recognizes and knows them when she hears or sees them. I’m encouraged by work like Tracy Weldon’s who looks at BL, deliberately selecting for her subjects, middle class, professional Blacks in natural communication contexts, e.g., discussants on the Tavis Smiley Show. Who drew up the rules of engagement and prescribed certain ways you gotta speak to be a legit Black? This is foolishness. We BEEN knowin Blackness ain’t no monolith.</p>

<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>One of the best things that happened to me Back in the Day was my introduction to Marxist thought which came by way of various study groups I participated in. Reading and learning about Dialectical Materialism, Marxism, Marxist Humanism, African and Nationalist Socialism—which were either not taught or only superficially presented in my undergraduate and graduate education—opened up for me a whole new way of theorizing language. Understanding and applying a class analysis, to go along with the Black Intellectual Tradition we studied in those groups, led to my broad definition of Language, which was not only academic and political but epistemological and ideological. In addition to Du Bois, Fanon, and other Black intellectuals early on, Voloshinov’s <italic>Marxism and the Philosophy of Language</italic> was an important book as was Stalin’s little pamphlet, <italic>Marxism and Linguistics</italic>. Closer to home, both being Detroiters, were Boggs’s <italic>Negro Worker’s Notebook</italic> and Leggett’s <italic>Class, Race and Labor</italic>. Among linguists, in addition to Beryl Bailey, as mentioned, there was Whorf, Hymes, Fishman, Halliday, later Fowler and Kress, Chomsky’s <italic>Cartesian Linguistics</italic>, and later his <italic>Language and Mind</italic>.</p>
<p>Language is an inherent human trait, and the process of language acquisition is universal. On these grounds, I ain got no quarrel with the Chomsky school. <italic>Dico, ergo sum.</italic> All well and good. But beyond this basic, biological, species-specific trait is socialization. Language plays a critical, fundamental role in this socialization. In fact, I have always argued that reality is not simply socially constructed, but sociolinguistically constructed. Ideology, identity, worldview, values, consciousness, are all products of the sociolinguistic construction of reality. We can’t get there from just looking at the syntax, phonemic structure, morphology of a language. We have to see how that language is deployed in human, social interaction. This forces us to look at speakers, to struggle to understand the answer to the Hymesian Question: who can say what to whom, under what conditions, with what consequences?</p>

<p><italic>Michael Eric Dyson—in commenting about the speech of Barack Obama—made a statement that connects to your work, and to your writing style in particular. He said: “That’s why Obama is unavoidably representative of Blackness beyond what he says about his, or our, Blackness. How he speaks is talking too, beyond the substance, or at least the content, of his speech. His style of speech is a substance of sorts too</italic>. . . . <italic>Too many folk make the mistake of believing that Black style is a substitute for substance, something set in opposition to substance, when in truth it’s a vehicle for substance</italic>. . . .<italic>” In terms of your writing style—you’ve become world-renown for that inimitable G stizzy. But there’s a danger, to me, when I hear some folks remark about your work and they seem blinded by the bling of your style, if you know what I mean.</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>One, language is our identity, it is what makes us who we are. Two, the linguistic is political. Three, our language can’t be severed from our being in the world. And yeah, Dyson got plenty of linguistic bling himself. If folks are blinded by the linguistic bling, does this mean they don’t get the message? You raise a fascinating question that I’ve never thought about, never thought the style was a cause for concern in this regard. In any event, I think you have to tap both the heart and the head if you want to influence people and call them to action. How does that old saying in rhetoric studies go, “When Cicero spoke, people marveled. When Demosthenes spoke, people marched.”</p>
<p>I want folks to “march.” In the 1960s and 1970s we were in a war for the souls of Black folk. The enemy was cognitive-linguistic deficit and genetic inferiority theorists up in the gown and outright racists in the town. Reserved, distanced, “objective” academic discourse didn’t always work. Sometimes you had to go hard in da paint. To be sure, the outcome is not always predictable, or at least it can be mixed. I remember writing a chapter for a book on Black communication, which never did get published, but that’s a subplot. I had been asked to write a state of the art chapter on research done on BL in order to educate the membership of this professional, disciplinary organization that was going to publish the book. Each chapter had two reviewers. My chapter, written in that “G stizzy,” got diametrically opposite reviews. While the editor wouldn’t identify the reviewers, he did say that they were the same race and gender (White, male). One reviewer was “offended” by the style of the chapter. While he understood how Black people in America could be angry, especially a Black woman, he thought such an “impassioned” tone and “editorializing” had no place in academic scholarship. Moreover, he said the grammar should be changed and corrected to reflect “Standard English” and attached a list of the nonstandard sentences marked up with “corrections.” The other reviewer thought the chapter was “superb,” “thorough,” “comprehensive,” “informative” and concluded his review with the recommendation that “every member of [the organization] should read this.”</p>
<p>I’ve also written my share of the academic straight and narrow. Once I had a funny experience in this regard. I wrote two articles about my 20-year study and analysis of the writing of 17-year-old Black students in the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Me and my research team looked at and coded syntax and discourse over time to see what changes, if any, had occurred from 1969–1989, and the relationship, if any, between the Black English and Black Discourse in the essays and the rating score. I sent one article to be considered for publication in a book being put together by a colleague at Cal-Berkeley. The chapter was accepted, and I later learned that my girl was surprised by the “stiff, formal” style of the writing, bemoaning, “But Geneva, where are the muthafuckas?”</p>
<p>But like Dyson said, the style is also the substance, the medium is the message. Like I said about the emcees and poets, you gotta have skillz AND you gotta be sayin something—but how you say what you say is also talkin. If too many folks “make the mistake of believing that Black style is a substitute for substance” (as Dyson said)—or are “blinded by the bling” (like you put it)—that’s on them. I guess they can either read more critically or go put on some shades.</p>

<p><italic>The Pulitzer Prize–winning Afro-Dominican writer, Junot Diaz, said this in a very recent (and revealing) interview with my Stanford colleague Paula Moya in the Boston Review: “There’s that old saying: the devil’s greatest trick is that he convinced people that he doesn’t exist. Well, White supremacy’s greatest trick is that it has convinced people that, if it exists at all, it exists always in other people, never in us.” He was pointing out that White Supremacy requires more than White people to function, i.e., that we’re all complicit in its reproduction.

<p>A person can be a race man (or woman), but when it comes to language, all that racial pride and Black Nationalism flies out the window. Fanon was dead on when he incorporated language into his analysis of the colonized mentality. It’s a symbolic representation of the colonized personality’s internalized oppression, and more often than not, it’s just below the level of consciousness. I like that line from Rickford and Rickford’s <italic>Spoken Soul</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0075424212463821">2000</xref>], about the large number of Blacks who will applaud the Black Vernacular only when they don’t realize it’s the Black Vernacular they’re applauding! <italic>Articulate While Black</italic> discusses this linguistic paradox, taking note of elite Blacks using nigga, one being a Michigan Supreme Court Judge, another being the Reverend Jesse Jackson caught on a Fox News mic during Obama’s first presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Back in the mid-1970s the late Dr. Gary Simpkins was conducting field tests for his visionary, linguistically-culturally-rooted reading series, <italic>Bridge</italic>. Based on his concept of “Associative Bridging,” Gary came up with the idea of developing “clean” versions of stories from the Black Folk Tradition as reading material for BL-speaking teens who were several grades behind in reading but too sophisticated and street-wise for Dick and Jane type readers. The series began with stories in BL and ended with those in LWC, with booklets in between that contained stories written in a transitional language variety. . . . Despite the demonstrated success of the program, that the students ended up being literate in the Language of Wider Communication, Black middle class leadership rejected <italic>Bridge</italic> because of the BL in the initial readers and because it did not promote eradication of BL. These Black folks could see the Black Vernacular in <italic>Bridge</italic> and they wahn’t bout to applaud it. The vociferous denunciation of <italic>Bridge</italic> (which included letters and calls to the publisher) by Black school superintendents and other members of the Black middle class pounded the nail into the coffin of the series.</p>
<p>It’s a complicated relationship between my people and our language. Some of the greatest struggles around BL have come from Black people, even though most use/understand BL themselves in various contexts. We faced this kind of challenge when I served as the chief expert witness and advocate for the children, from 1977 to ’79, in the “Black English” Federal court case in Ann Arbor, more formally <italic>Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al. v. Ann Arbor School District Board.</italic> The case involved the struggle of single-parent mothers from an Ann Arbor housing project who were determined to get education for their children. Though dubbed the “Black English Case,” it was as much about the mislabeling of the kids as intellectually handicapped, and about teaching them to read, as it was about BL. During the two years before the case was brought to trial and especially during the month-long trial itself, the children’s speech and that of their mothers was held up to ridicule and harsh critique, not just in the White mainstream, but from Blacks themselves, especially the middle class. One Black journalist, known for her pro-Black views, wrote in her column that “mothers whose children can’t read should get the boyfriends out and get the books in”! Media quoted the regressive views of the Black leadership class. And so it went, persistent attempts to discredit the mothers and they kids and to exonerate the (White) school district.</p>
<p>Almost twenty years later, in December 1996, when the Oakland School District passed its resolution on Ebonics, it was like a nightmarish rerun of <italic>King v. Ann Arbor.</italic> What Oakland was trying to do was to promote mother tongue instruction, to recognize and use the Black students’ language, a.k.a. Ebonics, as the vehicle to teach them language and literacy skills in “standard English.” Didn’t all hell break loose, with Kwesi Mfume, calling Oakland’s effort a “cruel joke” and asserting that folk in the hood need to shape up and “speak correctly”; with Maya Angelou, who had used Black English in her poetry and other writings, saying that Oakland’s language policy would “build barriers between the races” and “insult the Black community”; with Reverend Al Sharpton against Ebonics, as well as Reverend Jesse Jackson who went on “Meet the Press” to lambast the Ebonics resolution as an “unacceptable surrender borderlining on disgrace.” (After consulting with John Rickford, Jesse later expressed a degree of support for Oakland.)</p>

One particular insight is the illumination of my intuitively derived rhetorical strategies for presenting my arguments. I be like, oh, yeah, that’s right, that’s what I was doing.

<p><italic>What have been some of the most understudied areas of BL? Moving forward, what questions should the next generation of scholars pursue?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Understudied areas of BL include lexicon, language attitudes of everyday people, women’s language. The Black Lexicon has been given short shrift in sociolinguistics. There is a lot to be learned about the African American Experience and psyche by studying this area of our language. Novelist Norman Mailer made a stab at connecting the language-culture-mind dots when he wrote about the “White Negro” in the 1950s. And linguist Thom Kochman dropped a nugget that never got picked up. He suggested that there is a relationship between Black values and English words selected for inclusion in the Black Lexicon. For example, one such value is action; thus words that have action implied in them (e.g., <italic>game, hustle</italic>) are given positive meanings, and those that imply stasis are given negative meanings (e.g., <italic>lame, hung-up</italic>). In Europe, back in the 1980s, German scholars who specialize in translating Black literary works, realizing the significance of the Black Lexicon, convened several workshops to assist them in developing a BL dictionary. They brought me to Straelen for two of these workshops. The Europäisches Übersetzer-Kollegium published its dictionary, <italic>Black American English</italic>, edited by German scholars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424212463821">Herbert Graf and Eike Schönfeld [1994]</xref>, with short essays from me and several others.</p>
<p>In my work on the Lexicon, I have been on a quest for that common linguistic core, beyond Black slang, for words and phrases known to and/or used by Black people from all walks of life and with staying power. In <italic>Word from the Mother</italic> [2006], I constructed such a list, with definitions and real world examples, as the second chapter of the book. A couple of reviewers, in otherwise laudatory reviews, criticized me for Chapter Two, noting that since there was no discussion or analysis, this “word list” should have been an appendix. But it was a conscious rhetorical move on my part—I mean, really, who reads an appendix?</p>
<p>While there are a number of language attitude studies of K-12 teachers—which is good, we need those—we don’t really know what the people on the ground think about BL, or the LWC, for that matter. We got some anecdotal evidence, but I’d like to see some real systematic, culture-sensitive data on the language attitudes of everyday people in the Black community.</p>
<p>Marcy Morgan’s pioneering research on Black women’s language was brilliant. But we need more and newer/updated studies of Sista talk. We’ve begun moving in that direction with Sonja Lanehart’s much-needed edited volume, <italic>African American Women’s Language</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0075424212463821">2009</xref>]. A space has been opened up for future research. So much work needs to be done across and beyond these areas.</p>

<speaker>HSA:</speaker>
<p><italic>Final question</italic>. . . . <italic>Can you comment on the [case] of Trayvon Martin (and so many other young Black men)—what does linguistics and BL have to do with this?</italic></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>GS:</speaker>
<p>Trayvon’s senseless [death] was the result of racial profiling. He was probably also a speaker of BL. I’m thinking about Baugh’s work on linguistic profiling which builds off of racial profiling and oppressive experiences of young Black males and other males of Color. I’m also sadly thinking about Obama’s promise in his first presidential campaign to pass a Federal Anti-Racial Profiling Act. Would such an act have clamped down on neighborhood watch volunteers like Zimmerman and prevented Trayvon’s [killing]? Probably not. If you think about it, clothing—like language—is a system of signs. And these signs can be interpreted through a framework that views Blackness as not only deficient but deviant and dangerous. That was Zimmerman’s problem—he just “knew” that boy was up to no good, didn’t he? Trayvon—and our young Black men, in general—have to constantly work against their bodies, their clothing, their language being read as incorrect, inappropriate, even criminal. They call it “Breathing While Black.”</p>
<p>To bring this full circle, it’s like that quote from President Obama that we talked about earlier: “In general, members of every minority group continue to be measured largely by the degree of our assimilation—how closely speech patterns, dress, or demeanor conform to the dominant White culture—and the more that a minority strays from these external markers, the more he or she is subject to negative assumptions” [2006:235]. In this case, it really WAS a life or death situation. But you can see how “speech patterns” are just part of a whole array of cultural signs that play a part in how we are perceived, the perception of our humanity in the eyes of others. Moving forward, we need to work towards social justice on many interrelated fronts, because, like I said earlier, language is connected to culture and to our experience as a people. We got much work to do!</p>
