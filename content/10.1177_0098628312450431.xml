<abstract>
<p>A Census Bureau national survey identified baccalaureates aged up to 64 years having major area subspecializations labeled “psychology,” “industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology,” and “counseling psychology.” Median 2009 earnings of all such types of baccalaureate psychology alumni were well below the distribution mean of the153 fields in the survey-wide sample. Further, psychology subspecialization group earnings differed widely from one another. As terminal baccalaureates, those who presumably specialized in counseling psychology earned only 54.7% of the wages of counterparts who specialized in I/O psychology. Undergraduate specializations and psychology subspecializations were associated with patterns of obtained occupational categories. Future developments in subspecializations for psychology majors were discussed in terms of intradepartmental curricular tracks.</p>

<p>Many psychology majors do not enter graduate school. An obligation therefore exists among career counselors to provide students with “accurate information about earning potential with a psychology undergraduate degree” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628312450431">Littleford et al., 2010</xref>, p. 77). Indeed, from the 1970s to the present, advisory reports on wages and other aspects of psychology baccalaureates’ occupational experiences have appeared regularly in <italic>Teaching of Psychology</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450431">Borden &amp; Rajecki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628312450431">Brewer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450431">Johanson &amp; Fried, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450431">Korn &amp; Nodine, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450431">Kressel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628312450431">Lunneborg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0098628312450431">Rajecki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0098628312450431">Rajecki &amp; Borden, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent in-depth review of such employment outcomes was based on data from three nationally prominent sources: PayScale.com, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the National Science Foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki &amp; Borden, 2011</xref>). Trends were that psychology baccalaureates as a group, compared with graduates from many other fields, generally fell in relatively low tiers of salary levels at entry and later career points. These wage disadvantages for psychology alumni were generally attributed to the specific job categories entered, including those involving helping, counseling, clerical, and service work. This article offers a useful extension of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki and Borden (2011</xref>) mainstream advising report.</p>
<p>Notably, Goal number 10.2 of the American Psychological Association’s <italic>APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major</italic> calls on educators to “Identify the types of academic experience and performance in psychology and the liberal arts that will facilitate entry into the workforce. …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450431">American Psychological Association [APA], 2007</xref>, p. 21). Regarding Goal 10.2 and its focus on “types of academic experience,” the point of the current report is to challenge assumptions that “a psychology undergraduate degree” is an undifferentiated generic credential having global implications for employability. Alternatively, it is possible that across psychology students, educational experiences can differ in some meaningful, systematic way, with measurable consequences in the general job market. I review data regarding the existence of certain undergraduate subspecializations within psychology. For the first time in the literature, apparently, findings from the United States Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) allow an inquiry into actual or presumed subspecialization in psychology at the undergraduate level as linked to career consequences.</p>
<p>Preliminary analyses of ACS earnings and occupation data from 2009 in relation to postsecondary education variables were provided in a lengthy report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale, Strohl, &amp; Melton, 2011</xref>). The following article presents a distillation, integration, and further (secondary) analysis of selected information from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) ACS-based document, an effort aimed specifically at readers with an academic psychology orientation. Along with the three national sources previously reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki and Borden (2011</xref>), the ACS material covered here represents a fourth independent and substantial body of recent and relevant data.</p>
<sec id="section1-0098628312450431" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Pertinent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) tables reported responses of full-time, full-year workers aged up to 64 years who held a bachelor’s and no higher degree. The original ACS project determined a respondent’s prior academic specialization/specializations with open-ended Question #12 on Page 8 of its survey instrument:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This question focuses on this person’s BACHELOR’S DEGREE. Please print below the specific major/majors of any BACHELOR’S DEGREES this person has received (e.g., chemical engineering, elementary teacher education, and organizational psychology)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Census Bureau coded information from this item into 171 different degree majors. For summary displays, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) collapsed these specializations into 15 groupings, including one called psychology/social work. Of note here, within the psychology/social work grouping, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) identified earnings and other information for several categories of psychology graduates assigned labels of “psychology,” “counseling psychology,” “industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology,” and “miscellaneous psychology.” (Also listed were the sub-fields “clinical psychology,” “educational psychology,” and “social psychology,” but without salary data because of small sample sizes.) In the full report, earning levels in relation to former major programs were presented separately for 153 fields (of the total 171) with sufficient data.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, employment outcomes of alumni from a variety of selected undergraduate programs are compared in two ways. First, alumni groups’ earnings standings (relative wages) are described. Second, the groups’ obtained occupational categories are sketched. These comparisons focus on the seven fields having full data in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) psychology/social work grouping, in contrast with several academic major fields sometimes characterized as technical/vocational (or career oriented: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628312450431">National Center for Education Statistics, 2008</xref>). The selected technical/vocational fields are petroleum engineering, aerospace engineering, computer science, accounting, nursing, and elementary education. These particular six technical/vocational programs were chosen principally because their earnings levels show considerable variability, and represent many points in the complete sample’s total wage range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0098628312450431">
<title>Earnings’ Standings, by Psychology Subspecialization</title>
<p>For a convenient expression of the relative standing of a group’s annual wage among the rest, one can convert dollar amounts to standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) units. I calculated a distribution <italic>z</italic> score ([<italic>X</italic>—Mean]/<italic>SD</italic>) for the median 2009 salary figure of each field, based on the mean ($56,006.54) and <italic>SD</italic> ($14,153.99) of the total usable ACS sample (<italic>N</italic> = 153). Because a z score is a <italic>SD</italic> unit, it can be used to locate a point on the normal curve’s base line in terms of proportions of salaries that fall above or below that point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450431">Chase, 1967</xref>, p. 81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki &amp; Borden, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The upper panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref> shows median earnings of baccalaureates from the six selected technical/vocational fields; the table’s lower panel presents the seven majors in Carnevale et al.’s psychology/social work grouping. Also, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref> are the fields’ earnings’ <italic>z</italic> scores, and corresponding statistical standings as the estimated proportion of other fields in the sample of 153 that had higher earnings. Of the technical/vocational fields, three (petroleum engineering, aerospace engineering, and computer science) had earnings well above the sample mean; two (accounting and nursing) had earnings somewhat above the mean; and one (elementary education) fell far below the mean. For instance, the <italic>z</italic> of −1.13 for elementary education indicates that the salary of $40,000 was lower than 87.1% of the other salaries in the overall sample.</p>

<p>All the psychology (and social work) subspecializations had median earnings below the distribution mean. The lower panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref> shows that I/O psychology was closest to the sample average, followed lower down by miscellaneous and general psychology, and trailed farther still by counseling psychology. Indeed, the counseling psychology median raw value of $29,000 was the lowest of all 153 reported by Carnevale et al. If the dollar amounts in the lower panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref> are any indication, undergraduate psychology majors who specialize in counseling psychology can expect to earn, as baccalaureates, only 54.7% of the wages of counterparts who specialize in I/O psychology.</p>
<p>For the record, and for the sake of extended types of comparison, wage distribution information for other selected majors from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al. (2011</xref>) is presented here. In descending order of 2009, dollar amounts were economics ($70,000, <italic>z</italic> = 0.99), business management and administration ($58,000, <italic>z</italic> = 0.14), English language and literature ($48,000, <italic>z</italic> = −0.57), fine arts ($45,000, <italic>z</italic> = −0.78), and sociology ($45,000, <italic>z</italic> = −0.78). The ordering of these five median salaries resembles the pattern seen in other national salary surveys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0098628312450431">PayScale.com, 2010</xref>), as does the relative position of general psychology seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki and Borden (2011</xref>) noted that graduates from technical/vocational fields tended to cluster in obtained occupational categories related to their undergraduate major specializations, whereas psychology and other social science graduates were much more dispersed across employment categories. To extend this form of analysis to the current domain, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628312450431">Table 2</xref> shows popular occupational categories—as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450431">Carnevale et al.

On the one hand, as suggested, pluralities or majorities of baccalaureate alumni from petroleum engineering (45%), computer science (55%), accounting (49%), nursing (82%), and elementary education (66%) found work in occupational categories directly related to their specialization. These particular placements no doubt account in large measure for the range of earnings among these alumni groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Concerning Goal 10.2 of the 2007 APA Guidelines, the framers of that passage deserve credit for remarking that “types of academic experience . . . facilitate entry into the workforce.” Indeed, types of academic experience predict entry into highly specific niches in the workforce. A glance at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628312450431">2</xref> indicates that, obviously, worklife features differ greatly depending on whether students majored in engineering versus psychology. Moreover, worklife features differ markedly depending on whether the major was petroleum engineering versus aerospace engineering, or I/O psychology versus counseling psychology. Undergraduate subspecializations can figure importantly in career developments.</p>
<p>Authoritative sources on the psychology undergraduate curriculum allude to career planning for terminal baccalaureates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450431">APA, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450431">Brewer, 2006</xref>), and some writers advocate “thematic models” of coursework that could be construed as subspecializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0098628312450431">McGovern, Furumoto, Halpern, Kimble, &amp; McKeachie, 1991</xref>, p. 605). Accordingly, there may be a number of reasons why a baccalaureate ACS survey respondent might self-identify as having a subspecialization. Speculative factors include (a) undergraduate departments or divisions that actually bear such labels, (b) departmental curriculum outlines that allow or demand the accumulation of many credits in specific areas, (c) students’ involvement with the work of specialized faculty via research, practica, service learning, or capstone experiences, (d) specific internships, (e) enrollment in, or partial completion of specialized graduate programs, or (f) questionnaire items worded in such a way that leads respondents to think that specializations are required.</p>
<p>Two sources provide partial documentation of point (a) in the preceding list. First, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0098628312450431">Table 3</xref> presents a small sampling from an online list of postsecondary schools and their psychology subspecialization programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450431">AllPsychologyCareers.com, 2011</xref>). Entries in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0098628312450431">Table 3</xref> indicate that at some institutions, labeled divisions within the psychology major are clearly available. Second, the <italic>Digest of Education Statistics: 2010</italic> provides the number of bachelor’s degree graduates for 2008–2009 by discipline division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0098628312450431">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>, Table 286). For psychology, selected divisions were “general” (<italic>n</italic> = 89,240), “clinical” (<italic>n</italic> = 138), “counseling” (<italic>n</italic> = 422), “educational” (<italic>n</italic> = 155), “industrial and organizational” (<italic>n</italic> = 251), “social” (<italic>n</italic> = 936), and “other” (<italic>n</italic> = 494). The numbers of graduates within some subspecializations are comparatively small (as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Table 1</xref>), but the significant fact is that they are at least on record in educational circles.</p>

<p>Another fruitful area of speculation concerns factors that may account for patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628312450431">Table 2</xref>, showing that psychology alumni from different subspecializations tend to appear in different occupational categories. Three possibilities are (a) different types of alumni are drawn to different types of work activity, (b) different types of employers seek or admit different types of alumni, or (c) different types of alumni have different types of educational experiences (such as minors or double majors) that fit them to different types of employment. An implication of all three points in this list is a call to align work-bound psychology majors’ academic activities more closely with their likely entry-level occupational opportunities, as follows.</p>
<p>Widely available subspecializations could be the look of the future for undergraduate education in psychology because such curricular opportunities may help resolve issues inherent in the perennial question, “what can I do with a bachelor’s degree in psychology?” Formal subspecializations would allow students to explore areas of personal interest, and employers to have access to graduates with training relevant to particular workplace requirements. But this is neither to say that undergraduate psychology majors should be trained as paraprofessionals, nor that every department’s curriculum should conform to a set of national standards for the inclusion of applied subject matter. Rather, based on local resources and orientations, many students’ career prospects might be enhanced by a renewed consideration of intradepartmental “tracks.”</p>
<p>For instance, there has been debate whether, within a given department, both graduate school and baccalaureate career tracks are warranted (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450431">Borden &amp; Rajecki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450431">Johanson &amp; Fried, 2002</xref>). Ideally, one can imagine various interesting tracks for students headed directly for the general workforce: Psychology and Business; Psychology and Health Systems; Psychology and Human Services; Psychology and Information Technology. A student’s pursuit of a particular track can be recognized on a transcript or diploma for employers’ consideration.</p>
<p>The idea of curricular tracks (or thematic models) is hardly new, but maybe its time has come. Given that existing subspecializations appear related to striking patterns of later employment features in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628312450431">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628312450431">2</xref>, track systems gain credence. Still, in some departments a lack of resources or enthusiasm may preclude the offering of more than one curriculum. In those cases an alternative consideration is at least the offering of a so-called careers course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450431">Brinthaupt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628312450431">Dillinger &amp; Landrum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0098628312450431">Segrist &amp; Helms, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To close, should the content of this article encourage or discourage students’ pursuit of coursework in psychology? Because this article is a scholarly review and not an editorial, it is properly neutral on issues of recruiting and retention. It may be appropriate, though, to point out some recent public commentary. Upon the appearance of the related <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450431">Rajecki and Borden (2011</xref>) article noted previously, the Association for Psychological Science issued a press release, part of which read:<disp-quote>
<p>Rajecki doesn’t think [his economic report] means 18-year-olds should stop choosing psychology as a major. “Psychology is a remarkable academic discipline that seems to get more interesting every passing year. Why should any student avoid the field?” he says. And, of course, money isn’t the only thing that matters. But when academic counselors are giving students advice, they should make it clear that psychology isn’t necessarily the road to riches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450431">Association for Psychological Science, 2011</xref>, p. 1).</p>
