            <p>This study uses discourse analysis to examine the role of storylines in an agency’s exercise of bureaucratic autonomy wherein agencies are able to pursue their policy goals independent, and sometimes in defiance, of political superiors. Most theories of bureaucratic autonomy typically fall into two categories: those based on task-specificity and those based on the agency’s ability to build a reputation for effectiveness. The author contends that examining the storylines surrounding an agency’s creation and purpose provides for a richer application and integration of existing theories. This study focuses on the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) as an exploratory case study and chronicles the storylines associated with its increasing autonomy from 1965 to 1980 and the subsequent challenges to that autonomy in the culture wars of the 1990s. It suggests that storylines associated with the role of the arts in defining and maintaining American identity in a Cold War context were powerful tools for building autonomy at the NEA.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Much as in literature, storylines in public policy tie different elements of a policy debate together into a coherent and convincing narrative, aiming to make sense out of a bewildering array of perspectives on the policy problem and its prospective solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438380">Hajer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438380">Toal, 2002</xref>). Storylines include basic elements, answering the <italic>who, what, why, where</italic>, and <italic>how</italic> questions of a given phenomenon. In turn, individuals are drawn to particular storylines, forming coalitions that aim to spread a given perspective or develop another in opposition. Gradually, storylines are woven into a narrative that becomes the dominant way in which policymakers and their constituents come to understand and respond to a policy problem. These narratives can establish deep roots, marginalizing alternative perspectives and serving as the justification for advancing certain programs, allocating funds, and assigning influence in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438380">Hajer, 1995</xref>).</p>
         <p>Here, I examine the role of storylines in the exercise of bureaucratic autonomy, seeking to understand how political elites use storylines to build, maintain, or challenge an agency’s ability to pursue its own policy goals independent, and sometimes in defiance, of political superiors. Predominant theories of bureaucratic autonomy typically fall into two broad categories: an autonomy based on task-specificity contingent on the function and expertise of the organization (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712438380">Roberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712438380">Theoharis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712438380">Wilson, 1989</xref>) and a reputation-based autonomy depending on the ability of the agency to build and maintain a constituency and to secure a reputation for effectiveness that makes it difficult for elected officials to influence agency action (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712438380">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438380">Roberts, 2006</xref>). Although each approach provides a useful understanding of bureaucratic autonomy, they remain mutually exclusive, with few attempts to integrate task-based and reputation-based perspectives in a way that provides for a richer and fuller picture of bureaucratic dynamics. Furthermore, studies using these perspectives aim largely to demonstrate whether an agency can or cannot be deemed relatively autonomous, but often fail to answer <italic>how</italic> organizations achieve that autonomy. I contend that examining the storylines surrounding an agency’s creation, purpose, and efforts to exercise autonomy can shed light on this question and offer a richer application and integration of existing theories.</p>
         <p>I will proceed with an overview of bureaucratic autonomy and the task- and reputation-based perspectives that predominate the literature, followed by a discussion of the role of storylines in public policy. I then outline my research design, including case selection and identification of texts chosen for analysis. I will analyze the discourse surrounding the establishment and growth of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the later “culture wars” period of the late 1980s and early 1990s to identify persuasive and persistent storylines and the ways in which those storylines assisted the agency in building and retaining autonomy. Finally, I will explore how these storylines apply and integrate the task- and reputation-based perspectives and offer conclusions and issues to explore in future research.</p>

            <title>Existing Approaches to Bureaucratic Autonomy</title>
            <p>Public administration has long concerned itself with the questions of who controls the bureaucracy and the levels of discretion administrators do and should have in designing and carrying out policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712438380">Emmerich, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712438380">Hammond &amp; Knott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712438380">Huber &amp; Shipan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399712438380">Waterman, Rouse, &amp; Wright, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399712438380">Whittington &amp; Carpenter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712438380">Wilson, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399712438380">1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399712438380">Woolley, 1993</xref>). Sharp divisions between politics and administration have given way to the concept of bureaucratic discretion wherein agencies are not simply the obedient servants of politicians but instead have a profound effect on public policy and the political environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712438380">Birkland, 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>Closely related to bureaucratic discretion is the concept of bureaucratic autonomy. In his exhaustive discussion of executive agencies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Daniel Carpenter (2001)</xref> argues that agencies exercise bureaucratic autonomy when they take actions “consistent with their own wishes, actions to which politicians and organized interests defer even though they would prefer that other actions (or no action at all) be taken” (p. 4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438380">Roberts (2006)</xref> uses a more succinct definition, with autonomy being “the ability of an agency to implement its own ideas” (p. 80). Although no agency is entirely autonomous, I adopt a definition close to that of Carpenter and Roberts, underscoring the ability of an agency to act independently or even in defiance of political superiors.</p>
            <p>Scholars generally agree that autonomy develops over an extended period of time. They differ, however, on how such autonomy is established, largely falling into two schools of thought: (a) an autonomy based on task-specificity that is contingent on the function and expertise of the organization and the ability of the agency to accept or reject new tasks, and (b) a reputation-based autonomy depending on the ability of the agency to build and maintain a constituency and to secure a reputation for effectiveness that makes it politically difficult for elected officials to influence agency action. Surprisingly, although scholars offer compelling cases of each (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712438380">Roberts, 2008</xref>), they devote little attention to the interplay between task-based and reputation-based autonomy and how they might be mutually reinforcing in a given context.</p>
            <p>Task-based perspectives emphasize how an agency’s mission leads to and maintains task-specificity and often use law enforcement and national security agencies as examples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712438380">Roberts (2008)</xref> argues that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have gained and maintained autonomy because the nature of their missions requires them “to perform tasks that are so urgent, secretive, and forceful that they cannot be anticipated by law” (p. 1). This exercise of executive authority extends from the distinctive expertise required to carry out their missions and the vague legal mandates governing security agencies. Tasks that use tools of secrecy, information control, and force make it difficult for Congress to oversee these agencies and judge their effectiveness.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712438380">Wilson (1989)</xref> argues more broadly for task-based autonomy. He notes that autonomy stems from relatively undisputed jurisdiction; agencies can achieve autonomy by emphasizing tasks not performed by rival agencies and by fighting any agency seeking to overlap jurisdictions. Highly autonomous agencies have a coherent set of tasks that provide the units with strong and distinctive senses of mission and that allow them to fend off rivals.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712438380">Wilson’s (1989)</xref> typology of agencies relies on the ability to observe outputs and outcomes to predict degrees of autonomy. Procedural agencies in particular, which have easily observable outputs but more elusive outcomes, can result in increased autonomy. Because outcomes are hard to observe, Congress often grants procedural organizations broad authority and relies on experts within the organization to develop the necessary standards for effectiveness. This gives agencies significant autonomy by allowing them to define policy goals and the means for evaluating performance.</p>
            <p>In contrast to task-based perspectives, reputation-based autonomy argues that agencies achieve autonomy by developing and maintaining strong constituencies that make it politically difficult for elected officials to challenge agency decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Carpenter (2001)</xref> suggests that autonomy stems from three conditions prevalent in varying degrees: (a) political differentiation wherein agencies have preferences that differ from those of the actors that control them, (b) development of organizational capacity allowing agencies the ability to act upon their preferences efficiently and effectively, and (c) political legitimacy so that politicians and citizens believe that agencies have the capacity to act effectively, a belief that springs from the agency’s reputation for carrying out objectives with expertise and efficiency.</p>
            <p>Reputation-based perspectives often, though not always, stress the importance of leadership at the mesolevel, examining bureau or division chiefs deemed to be decisive actors in organizational change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2001</xref>). Although members of Congress, presidents, and other political elites develop an understanding of an agency’s capacity through repeated interaction, it is these middle managers who push for greater administrative discretion, build networks of supporters, and advance a particular organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2001</xref>).</p>
            <p>For example, Carpenter points to Harvey Wiley’s success in creating significant autonomy at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) by building strong and influential constituencies as head of the Division of Chemistry. Wiley’s own background and that of the employees in his bureau convinced experts in science, business and agrarian organizations that the USDA had the capacity to effectively implement pure food and drug legislation, thereby convincing Congress to grant it broader authority.</p>
            <p>Other scholars within the reputation-based approach focus less on middle managers and more on the ways in which leaders at varying levels take advantage of the changing political environment to clearly articulate the agency’s mission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438380">Roberts (2006)</xref> chronicles how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was able to resist efforts to expand its mission by building a reputation as the primary disaster management agency. Director James Lee Witt took advantage of FEMA’s poor reputation following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the growing professionalization of the emergency management field to define the agency’s mission as focused on conventional disaster relief rather than national security or counterterrorism.</p>
            <p>These examples demonstrate how precarious an agency’s reputation can be and the importance of leadership at varying levels to forge autonomy. Yet they also give leadership a privileged and isolated position, assigning the ability to exercise autonomy to a single individual or select group without probing how these individuals capitalized on their position within a changing political environment. As the following analysis of the NEA will illustrate, organizational leaders and political elites weave together storylines to produce narratives that allow agencies to define measures of effectiveness, build strong reputations and stave off rivals. Power resides less in a single individual or group than in the storylines themselves and how they are refined and repeated. This approach allows one to determine not only whether an agency can be considered relatively autonomous but also how specific patterns of language and discursive themes are advanced within a given political environment to build and sustain autonomy.</p>

            <title>Discourse Analysis in Public Policy and the Utility of Storylines</title>
            <p>Discourse analytic approaches in areas such as policy analysis (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399712438380">Lejano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399712438380">Outshoorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399712438380">Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399712438380">Tupper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438380">Zittoun, 2009</xref>) have recently emerged as means of opening the “black box” of the policy process by focusing attention away from how policy change is achieved at the macro level and toward how complementary or conflicting policy narratives are produced. Practitioners of discourse analysis define the term <italic>discourse</italic> broadly, with some focusing on a conversation between individuals or a single phrase and others believing that discourse constitutes the entire social system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712438380">Howarth, 2000</xref>). Here, I define discourse as the patterns of language, written and spoken, developed socially, between and among individuals to provide meaning to a given context (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399712438380">Table 1</xref>).</p>

            <p>Within a discourse, narratives serve as coherent and sequential understandings of a particular policy problem, its causes, and its proposed solutions. In turn, storylines make sense of a variety of approaches and interpretations by simplifying policy problems and solutions and fitting them into categories already generally understood.</p>
            <p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712438380">Zittoun (2009)</xref> and others, discourse analysis allows the researcher to connect the actor to a policy through his/her framing of the policy problem and its cause and makes it possible to see how actors come to agreement by building a common narrative. Of particular interest to discussions of bureaucratic autonomy, discourse analytic perspectives can also illuminate how discourse is used as an instrument of conflict by constructing competing policy narratives, and how a narrative becomes stabilized through the formation of agreed upon policy statements advanced by political elites.</p>
            <p>In his examination of the U.S. response to the war in Bosnia in 1992, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438380">Toal (2002)</xref> contends that policy narratives are composed of numerous storylines defined as “sense-making organizational devices tying the different elements of a policy challenge together into a reasonably coherent and convincing narrative” (p. 617). In Toal’s study, storylines advanced by U.S. political leaders made sense of the chaos of the Bosnian conflict by defining it as a “humanitarian crisis” warranting the provision of aid rather than a “genocidal war” prompting military intervention. As he demonstrates, storylines signal the reader/listener to categorize and understand policy issues in a particular way and to respond accordingly.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, storylines draw people together into discursive coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438380">Hajer, 1995</xref>), groups of individuals with shared ways of seeing and reasoning that can become powerful forces in the policy process. Coalitions define a policy problem in a self-serving manner that often is vague enough to draw together a broad range of supporters, but specific enough to be remedied by a limited number of possible solutions. Hajer chronicles the emergence of a sustainable development coalition within environmental politics that advanced storylines defining the earth as a “resource” and pollution as an “externality” of growth. The coalition advanced a narrative resulting in regulatory regimes in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands that focused on remedial rather than preventive solutions to pollution.</p>
            <p>Finally, multiple storylines can share particular elements that can aid in pulling them together into a coherent narrative or pitting them against one another to compete for dominance. Here, I focus on common elements of storylines affecting bureaucratic autonomy. These themes and patterns of language appear within and across storylines, increasing an agency’s ability to act autonomously. They may communicate certain normative values or articulate particular worldviews that are essential to draw people into a given discursive coalition and prompt them to repeat and refine the narrative to gain dominance.</p>
            <p>The work of Hajer and Toal demonstrates the ways in which storylines aid in defining ambiguous policy issues and drawing political actors together around those definitions. Similarly, storylines can illuminate existing theories of bureaucratic autonomy by examining how political actors characterize organizational effectiveness when outcomes are ill defined and how agencies mobilize discursive coalitions to advocate for the agency. Finally, this approach allows the researcher to better explain how task- and reputation-based approaches interact to produce varying degrees of autonomy.</p>

         <title>Research Design</title>
         <p>To probe the contention that prevailing approaches to bureaucratic autonomy can be more effectively applied and integrated by examining organizational storylines, I use the NEA as an exploratory case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712438380">Stake, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712438380">Yin, 2009</xref>). After nearly two centuries of resistance to public funding for the arts, the NEA was established in 1965 amid a Cold War discourse aimed at thwarting the spread of communism, domestically and abroad, by demonstrating the exceptional and superior power of the American democratic regime. Within this discourse, a narrative of cultural superiority through freedom of expression emerged in the United States in opposition to Soviet cultural production (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399712438380">Table 1</xref>). Although American artists enjoyed intellectual and artistic freedom, artists in Soviet bloc countries were constrained by directives from the State that owned the art galleries and concert halls in which they exhibited and performed. As Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would argue, freedom of expression allowed for a healthier society focused not only on economic and military success but also on the quality of American civilization, including schools, cultural institutions, and scientific advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>). This narrative, touted by elected officials and bureaucrats alike, provided justification for not only the creation of particular agencies but also significant increases in funding and influence. The NEA’s rapid growth during this period and subsequent challenges to its autonomy and even its existence make this agency appropriate for analysis.</p>
         <p>It must be noted that the distinction between storylines and narrative can be vague at best in discourse analytic perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712438380">Ewick and Silbey (1995)</xref> argue that to qualify as a narrative, a communication must be temporally ordered and relate characters and events to one another and to a larger overarching structure. Storylines, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438380">Hajer (1995)</xref>, are generative in nature and do not necessarily follow a sequential pattern or assign causality. Rather, storylines help to identify the main characters and context. They begin to make sense out of a bewildering array of potential interpretations of a given policy problem by helping to fit that problem into an existing narrative or to develop a new narrative. For the NEA case, the storylines of quality and access generate a creation story that fits the agency into an existing narrative of cultural superiority. Furthermore, by drawing in the imagery of distinctly American art forms like Abstract Expressionist painting or the work of the American Ballet Theater, these storylines helped the audience to properly categorize the agency as an essential part of demonstrating American excellence within that narrative.</p>
         <p>To uncover and analyze the prevalent storylines in the NEA’s history and their impact on its ability to exercise autonomy, I use critical discourse analysis, identifying and analyzing common themes and patterns of language used by the NEA leadership, members of Congress and presidents. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) emphasizes the ways in which language constructs and sustains power by systematically analyzing the effects of discourse; that is, how language positions and privileges people and institutions in certain roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712438380">Fairclough, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712438380">Howarth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399712438380">Mills, 2004</xref>). Here, I focus on the storylines, and the particular elements of those storylines affecting autonomy, produced by political and cultural elites, including members of Congress, presidents, and the NEA’s top leadership (all political appointees). I examine how they are used to establish and maintain the NEA’s significant autonomy and the challenges to those storylines during the later “culture wars” of the 1990s.</p>
         <p>To set boundaries on data collection, analysis was limited to congressional proceedings, including subcommittee reports, official statements made by the presidents in office during the time periods examined, statements made by the NEA chairpersons, and documentation available on the NEA website chronicling its history. Whenever possible, data were collected from primary sources, but secondary accounts of the time periods in question also were used to produce sufficient data to identify common themes.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399712438380">1</xref>
            </sup> These sources provide a rich array of texts from which to examine how the agency built its autonomy within a distinctive social and political reality—the Cold War—by solidifying its critical role in the advancement of American cultural superiority via artistic achievement.</p>
         <sec id="section5-0095399712438380">
            <title>Storylines and Autonomy at the NEA, 1965 to 1980</title>
            <p>Established in 1965, the NEA is dedicated to “supporting excellence in the arts . . . bringing the arts to all Americans, and providing leadership in arts education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399712438380">NEA, 2009a</xref>). After nearly two centuries of resistance to public funding for the arts, Congress and President Lyndon Johnson came together to advocate for support by framing artists as the harbingers of American cultural superiority in a Cold War context, demonstrating through their work the nation’s acceptance for and celebration of freedom of expression and diversity.</p>
            <p>From the Endowment’s establishment in 1965 until the early 1980s, the agency grew substantially, expanding its programs and influence in the arts community, while resisting calls from Congress for greater transparency in its decision making. During this period, the NEA could be characterized as having considerable bureaucratic autonomy. It was not until 1989, when Congress discovered that funds were directly and indirectly used to support so-called obscene works that the Endowment’s sustained growth and significant discretion were challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438380">Bolton, 1992</xref>).</p>
            <p>I contend in the following analysis that the narrative of cultural superiority relied on two specific storylines—quality and access—to build and maintain the agency’s autonomy during this period. A fundamental part of the NEA’s creation narrative, quality and access later became powerful tools in saving the NEA from complete elimination.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399712438380">2</xref>
               </sup> That these storylines continue to appear in more recent Endowment publications and programs suggests that they are a core part of its mission, sense of identity, and institutional memory.</p>
            <p>A close examination of these storylines within the larger narrative of American cultural superiority, together with careful parsing of the storylines’ elements of expertise, government separation, and elite preferences for professional artists and institutions, reveal the ways in which political actors exercised and maintained autonomy at the NEA. As a procedural institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712438380">Wilson, 1989</xref>) in which outputs are easily measured but outcomes are vague, the NEA required a group of experts, the National Council on the Arts (NCA), that could effectively judge artistic quality and responsibly distribute funds on the government’s behalf. These individuals engendered trust among key constituencies, including prominent intellectuals, wealthy private contributors, and artists themselves, ensuring that only the best American art would be funded and that such art would be judged on its artistic merits without fear of government censorship. Furthermore, they could set a national standard for artistic achievement, while allowing amateur and emerging artists to enjoy support at the state and local levels, thereby constraining access to limited federal dollars, while advocating for the arts broadly. This intellectual and artistic population was exactly the constituency the federal government sought to affect; a group previously intrigued by socialist politics that was turning back toward American capitalist values and exercised considerable influence in the battle against communism at home and abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>).</p>
            <p>The narrative of cultural superiority through government support for the arts was challenged by a variety of counternarratives. Representative George Dondero of Michigan saw the arts as a sinister force serving as propaganda for communism and undergirding a “Red cultural monopoly” across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>, p. 23). Dondero’s rhetoric was extreme, but members of Congress throughout the 1950s and early 1960s rebuffed any and all proposals for federal arts support. Some of these opponents rejected Dondero’s claims and instead expressed concern over government imposing standards that would limit freedom of expression. They pointed to the Works Progress Administration’s projects of the 1940s as evidence that government support could harm artistic quality, and they feared comparisons to Nazi and Soviet dictatorships exercising absolute control of artistic production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712438380">Wyszomirski, 1988</xref>). In this counternarrative, private support ensured that the government could not impede freedom of expression. Although arts advocates would successfully argue that private support was insufficient to guarantee the health and vitality of arts institutions, the narrative of increased private support would gain strength again under the Reagan administration and in the culture wars of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712438380">NEA, 2000</xref>).</p>
            <p>Texts documenting debate over public funding for the arts and the establishment of the NEA illustrate how discursive coalitions formed around shared definitions of artistic quality and access to advance the NEA’s authority and build autonomy within task- and reputation-based perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438380">Toal (2002)</xref> argues that storylines have a distinctive grammar or set of building blocks that define and specify a policy problem and draw together discursive coalitions. This grammar provides a description of the policy situation and provides answers to the <italic>who, what, why, where</italic>, and <italic>how</italic> questions of a policy problem by defining the problem or threat and arguing for a specific solution. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095399712438380">Table 2</xref> draws on and modifies Toal’s concept of grammar, outlining the storylines of quality and access at the NEA and providing representative texts advanced by political elites in support of the agency’s growing authority from 1965 to 1980.<sup>

            <title>A Storyline of Quality: Defining the Art Worthy of Public Funding</title>
            <p>The federal government struggled with its role in promoting American arts and culture since the earliest years of the nation. Puritanical roots combined with a desire to separate the new country from the class-based societies of Europe led American lawmakers to place support for the arts purely in the domain of the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399712438380">Levy, 1997</xref>). Yet, from paintings commissioned from John Trumbull for the capitol building to Theodore Roosevelt’s executive order establishing a Council on Fine Arts, federal officials participated in enhancing America’s cultural landscape through patronage of the arts and design.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, lack of agreement between the executive and legislative branches on the degree to which the national government should be involved in judging artistic quality thwarted efforts to develop a national arts policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>). Beginning in the 1950s, a storyline emerged first among arts advocates and later among political officials who identified a decline in private support for the arts that was leaving professional performing arts organizations in crisis. Most significantly, the Rockefeller Brothers Panel, a group of art patrons, administrators, and educators under the direction of John D. Rockefeller III, published <italic>The Performing Arts: Problems and Prospects</italic>, a sobering account of this crisis that called on the federal government to support the arts by explicitly connecting struggling institutions with a narrative of cultural superiority. The panel aligned itself with the Kennedy administration’s contention that the public sector must work to improve American quality of life as an effective and critical counterbalance to communism and suggested that the arts were an essential aspect of that effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712438380">Saunders, 2005</xref>). August Heckscher, Special Consultant on the Arts to the President, articulated the administration’s view: “The United States will be judged and its place in history ultimately assessed—not alone by its military and economic power—but by the quality of its civilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>, p. 55).</p>
            <p>Discursive coalitions formed quickly around the role of the arts in improving quality of life and combating communism; some advocating for substantial public support for the arts, others believing such support would politicize the arts and limit artistic freedom, and still others suggesting that the arts should continue to rely on private support alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>). These emerging coalitions gave public support for the arts a sense of urgency it had not previously enjoyed and placed it squarely on the national policy agenda in the early 1960s. Bureaucratic autonomy scholarship typically focuses on national security or science and technology agencies entrusted with fighting terrorism or advancing the United State’s position in the global economy (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712438380">Roberts, 2006</xref>), policy issues with a high degree of salience in recent years; yet the Cold War period is a distinctive moment in which the arts took on a similar sense of urgency. With prominent arts organizations struggling to survive, political elites converged around a storyline of quality, one that identified significant threats to American cultural achievement at home and abroad and defined roles for the public sector and private partners in addressing those threats.</p>
            <p>A significant threat to American cultural superiority came from overseas, particularly from communist countries engaging artists in the production of propaganda. Yet, of equal threat were amateur artists within the United States, whose work failed to achieve a level of renown necessary to prove cultural superiority on an international stage. Drawing attention to a growing distinction between elite and amateur art forms, President Kennedy emphasized the professional artist, without whom the spirit of the amateur artist and the audience would not be served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399712438380">Kennedy, 1963</xref>): “I emphasize the importance of the professional artist because there is danger we may tend to accept the rich range of amateur activities which abound in our country as a substitute for the professional” (para. 8). The distinction between amateur and professional assisted the process of categorization for lawmakers who struggled to comprehend the breadth of a proposed federal funding program and allowed for a critical component of the storyline of quality to develop: The establishment of a council of private citizens “engaged professionally in some phase of the arts” that could monitor the state of the American art world and recommend policies and programs that encouraged its development (para. 2).</p>
            <p>Here, the elements of expertise and government separation figure prominently in the storyline as this council of experts was given a substantial role, entrusted with speaking on behalf of the federal government to set a standard for and advance artistic quality in a manner that encouraged artistic freedom, while ensuring that only the “best” professional works received support. The consequences of leaving the judgment of quality to political leaders or bureaucrats were, according to the storyline, disastrous. Government would no doubt quash the innovation of America’s most talented artists and allow for American artistic production to become identified with mediocrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399712438380">Rockefeller Brothers Fund, 1965</xref>).</p>
            <p>The resulting NCA played a critical role in defining the NEA’s goals and desired outcomes and in building the agency’s reputation for effectiveness. Originally created in 1964, the NCA is composed of professional artists, museum directors, theater producers, and other arts experts and intellectuals appointed by the president. Among the Council’s earliest members were actor Gregory Peck, composer Leonard Bernstein, and modernist sculptor David Smith. As the Endowment’s programs grew, the NCA established multiple advisory panels charged with reviewing applications and making recommendations to the full Council. The earliest meetings were held at the estate of the Biddle family—ancestors of third NEA Chairman Livingston Biddle—where it could carry out its work in private without public interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>). In June 1965, just 3 months before signing the NEA’s enacting legislation, President Johnson outlined the distinct roles of professional artists and the federal government that allowed the NCA to operate in such a cloistered environment:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>No people can afford to neglect the creative minds among it. They enrich the life of the Nation. They reveal the farthest horizons of man’s possibility. And Government—as representative of all the people—should always play a role in stimulating our people. <italic>First, and most important, it can leave the artist alone</italic> . . . Secondly, the Government can offer direct encouragement . . . Third, we can create an atmosphere for the arts to thrive. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712438380">Johnson, 1965a</xref>, para. 6-7, italics added)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>The notion that the government would leave the artist, and by extension the NCA, alone, while providing much-needed financial support and encouragement eased concerns over government funding for the arts in competing discursive coalitions. The NEA’s enabling legislation adopted the predominant storyline of quality by giving the NCA and its Chairperson, who also served as Chairman of the Endowment, broad authority to establish and carry out programs of grants in aid to individuals or organizations “of exceptional talent” as defined by the NCA. The distinctive expertise necessary to carry out this charge combined with an expressed desire on the part of Congress and the executive branch to distance themselves from how exactly that charge would be carried out, allowed for considerable autonomy.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the storyline convinced artists and arts organizations that public funding would not preclude artists from freely expressing themselves. In 1969, Chairman Roger Stevens declared that the “bugaboo of government control of the arts” had been killed, while in 1974, Deputy Chairman Michael Straight reported that artists “no longer seemed threatened” by “the danger that government interference could lead to the stifling of creativity or to political control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438380">Wyszomirski, 1987</xref>, p. 208). By building a reputation for considering the quality of artistic achievement without government interference, the NEA was able to mobilize major institutional arts communities and more localized arts groups in support of expanding the agency’s budget and authority all with the promise of benefiting the arts as a whole. For example, in 1971, a diverse array of arts advocates wrote letters, sent telegrams, made phone calls, and paid personal visits to their representatives in Congress to nearly double the agency’s budget from US$16 million to US$31 million at a time when most other agencies were experiencing budget cuts.</p>
            <p>The NEA’s growing autonomy extended beyond budget increases to the establishment of multiple new programs and the ability to fend off rival agencies, such as a proposed Folk Arts agency. To achieve this autonomy, the NEA relied on the storyline of quality to convince supporters and opponents alike that it alone was capable of judging artistic achievement.</p>
            <p>Yet it also relied on a storyline of access, one that defined the role of the federal government’s support for the arts in relation to that of state and local governments, defined citizens as arts consumers rather than participants, and resisted calls for access to critical information about how the Endowment carried out its mission.</p>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712438380">Toal (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712438380">Hajer (1995)</xref> focus their analyses on competing storylines within a given policy area, yet a narrative may also consist of multiple, complementary storylines that share common elements, while helping define different aspects of a policy problem. The storylines of quality and access reinforce one another in the NEA’s narrative of cultural superiority but emphasize certain aspects of that narrative more dramatically and become more salient as the agency evolves. For example, the storyline of quality was critical to placing public support for the arts on the national agenda and to the establishment of the NCA as the body of experts entrusted with identifying and rewarding the “best” of American art. The storyline of access emerges shortly after the Endowment’s establishment as public officials and the larger art world sought to more thoroughly define the relationship between the federal government providing tax dollars to support the NEA and the private panelists given the discretion to spend those dollars. If the storyline of quality helped establish a separation between these entities, then the storyline of access helped observers to understand what that separation should look like in practice.</p>
            <p>The distinction between professional and amateur artists articulated by the Kennedy administration remained a critical part of the discourse surrounding the NEA in its early history. The NCA and the Endowment’s top leadership during this period, most notably Chairman Nancy Hanks (1969-1977), grew concerned that amateur artists and institutions would seek out the Endowment’s limited funding yet do nothing to advance the reputation of American art at home and abroad. The NEA defined its purpose in a manner that plainly stated its preference for professional, elite art forms. During a lecture at Scripps College in 1972, Hanks articulated this preference when outlining the NEA’s core objectives “to assist our major arts institutions to improve artistic and administrative standards and to provide greater public service” and “to provide support that encourages creativity among our most gifted artists or enhances the ability of the whole field to raise its standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712438380">Saunders, 2005</xref>, p. 610). Hanks’s comments reflect a stringent hierarchy of artistic quality in which the work of major arts institutions such as museums, operas, and symphonies were deemed more worthy of funding than smaller, community based institutions or more localized art forms such as craft and folk music.</p>
            <p>Critics challenged this interpretation of the NEA’s purpose, suggesting that it gave unfair preference to elite performing arts institutions and abstract visual artists and similarly advantaged artists from the East and West coasts over those in the Southern portions of the country. Chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Affairs, Ralph Yarborough of Texas, questioned nominee Hanks on the Endowment’s creation of panels in the East, Midwest, and West to advise on the distribution of grants to individuals. He noted that of the 60 grants distributed to individuals in 1966 all went to these regions, and he suggested that the South and Southwest had been blacklisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712438380">U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 1969</xref>).</p>
            <p>Senator Yarborough also called Hanks’s attention to Senate bill 1591 establishing the American Folklife Foundation, widely considered to be a kind of third leg to work in tandem with the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Hanks agreed that the development of folk arts in the United States should be highlighted and the diversity of American art forms celebrated, but she saw the separate creation of a Folklife Foundation as a threat to Endowment resources. Support for a separate foundation launched a kind of turf war that threatened Endowment funding and had the potential to heighten perceptions of the Endowment as an elitist institution. Hanks addressed the threat by successfully establishing a Folks Arts Program at the Endowment in 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>).</p>
            <p>Similarly, in the 1970s, the NEA succeeded in creating new programs that addressed emerging art forms; however, the creation of separate programs, as opposed to integrating these art forms into already established programs, continued to generate complaints of elite bias. For example, the Expansion Arts Program was created in 1971 to support art made for and by racial and ethnic minorities. Minority art was thus marginalized, excluded from consideration in established programs such as the Visual Arts Program, where it would be considered with the work of more established modernist artists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>).</p>
            <p>The above-mentioned examples indicate a competing storyline emerging in the Endowment’s early history of an elitist agency whose definition of artistic achievement was narrow and antiquated. Yet, Endowment administrators, members of Congress, and Presidents Johnson and Richard Nixon continued to advance a storyline of access in which the NEA, with the NCA and its subpanels, were delegated the authority of judging artistic quality. Although individual political leaders, or the public at large, might not agree with that definition, it was essential that the government give the NEA latitude to avoid claims of censorship that would undermine the narrative of artistic freedom so important in the Cold War.</p>
            <p>As such, the NEA was given broad discretion to define which regions, artistic styles, institutions, and individuals could gain access to public funding, while simultaneously limiting access to information about how that discretion was exercised. Hanks and her successor, Livingston Biddle, characterized members of the NCA and its subpanels as private citizen partners and hesitated when asked by members of Congress to make the names of panel members public. Hanks underscored the advisory nature of the panels and the tremendous pressure placed on members of public panels that might discourage broad participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712438380">U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 1969</xref>).</p>
            <p>The NEA’s ability to fend off claims of bias and the creation of rival agencies while continuing to expand the agency’s budget and influence demonstrate its growing autonomy. Although the 1960s and 1970s saw a broad expansion of acceptance for alternative forms of artistic expression, the most outspoken and influential constituencies remained traditional arts institutions and supporters and the NEA’s leadership worked diligently to develop a reputation for effectiveness among these constituencies.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, expanding definitions of artistic expression threatened America’s message of cultural superiority as emerging artists questioned the status quo in the arts world and in political decision making more generally. To maintain and expand its funding, the NEA aligned itself with Nixon’s desire to avoid political or critical aesthetics. He saw engagement with proper forms of cultural expression as an important way of promoting “real American youth” as opposed to the radical antiwar protesters seen on college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712438380">Binkiewicz, 2004</xref>, p. 173). The President called on Congress to provide the Endowment with the funding necessary to place artists in schools and motivate young people “to master the mechanics of self expression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399712438380">Nixon, 1969</xref>). This alignment allowed the NEA to thrive as its leaders, particularly Hanks, saw themselves as responsible for “putting a program into a political context” and mobilizing the art community to advocate for greater funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438380">Wyszomirski, 1987</xref>, p. 214). The results were astounding. The NEA’s budget grew from US$8.2 million in fiscal year 1970 to US$123.5 million by 1977. Staff increased by 600% and grant applications increased by 900% from 2,000 to 20,000 with a 600% increase in the number of grants awarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712438380">Wyszomirski, 1987</xref>).</p>
            <p>The storyline of access successfully fostered the NEA’s growth by limiting funding to only the “best” art forms and by limiting public access to the experts who regularly defined “best” for the agency. To stave off claims that the NEA’s grant making was biased or secretive, the storyline touted the NEA’s mission to provide Americans with access to great art—even if they could not access information about how or why that art was funded. It places Americans in the role of passive consumers. Minority communities could gain access to museums or attend the theater, but they had difficulty securing federal funding for their own work. Regions without strong museums or performing arts venues could gain funding to establish such institutions; yet money for their locally produced crafts was the responsibility of state and local arts councils.</p>
            <p>However, relevant to its autonomy, the NEA has long distributed a significant percentage of its funding to State arts agencies, many modeled on the NEA’s process of using expert review panels to make grants. While allowing for more localized funding, the relationship has ensured that the national standards of artistic excellence defined by the NEA are broadly maintained at all levels together with its perception of the public as passive consumers. It further strengthens the NEA’s influence by enlisting a powerful group of arts agencies in advancing its vision of public support for the arts and advocating on its behalf to Congress.</p>
            <p>From the first coordinated calls for public support for the arts in the early 1960s to approximately 1980, political elites used the storylines of quality and access to establish and maintain significant autonomy at the NEA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095399712438380">Table 2</xref>). Along with other federal agencies, it experienced modest budget cuts in 1982 and 1986, but generally maintained its reputation as a respected, well-functioning agency. During the 1980s, it gradually expanded its purview to focus on arts education, working with state arts agencies and community foundations to support smaller organizations, and publishing numerous studies on America’s growing artistic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712438380">NEA, 2000</xref>). The storylines of quality and access persisted as critical parts of the organization’s identity and of its ability to persuade Congress and President Reagan that it remained an essential component of the battle against communism. As the remainder of this analysis will illustrate, the storylines persisted, though weakened, as the Cold War came to an end, and the NEA came under fire during the “culture wars.”</p>

            <title>Quality and Access Persist in the Culture Wars</title>
            <p>Although NEA administrators and the Congressional Arts Caucus managed to head off deep cuts in the NEA’s budget during the Reagan administration, controversy erupted in 1989 that eventually led to budget cuts and threats to dismantle the Endowment entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712438380">Moen, 1997</xref>). Igniting the controversy was photographer Andres Serrano’s <italic>Piss Christ</italic> depicting a crucifix submerged in a container of the artist’s urine. Serrano had been awarded a US$15,000 grant from the Southeast Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, an organization that had received NEA grant support. Even though the NEA’s support of Serrano was indirect, Senators Alfonse D’Amato of New York and Jesse Helms of North Carolina immediately attacked the agency calling the work “a despicable and deplorable piece of vulgarity” and urging the Endowment to review its award procedures to prevent similar abuses of taxpayer dollars (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438380">Bolton, 1992</xref>, pp. 29-30).</p>
            <p>The incident was closely followed by uproar over work by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe exhibited at the Philadelphia Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) with the support of a US$30,000 NEA grant. The exhibit, <italic>Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment</italic>, honored the artist who had recently died of AIDS and included graphic, homoerotic images.</p>
            <p>The controversies led to amendments concerning indecent art in both the 1990 appropriations and reauthorization bills and considerable debate over whether Congress could introduce content restrictions for NEA grant programs. The amendments prohibited the NEA from funding obscene projects similar to the legal definition of obscenity decided by the Supreme Court in <italic>Miller v. California</italic> and cut US$45,000 from the NEA budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712438380">Moen, 1997</xref>). Although the amendments left the NEA relatively unscathed, the agency treaded very lightly in the early 1990s, requesting grants awarded for questionable projects before the amendments went into effect be returned and requiring grantees to sign a decency pledge promising not to produce obscene works with government funding. The pledge was eventually eliminated following a successful challenge in court, but the affair proved that the agency’s autonomy was weakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438380">Bolton, 1992</xref>).</p>
            <p>The impact of the culture wars was felt throughout the 1990s as the NEA became increasingly politicized. The NEA budget reached its zenith in 1992 followed by sharp budget cuts in the following years. In 1996, Congress initiated plans to eliminate the agency entirely and placed strict prohibitions on its grant making by eliminating grants to individual artists with the exception of Literature Fellowships and ending seasonal or operating support grants entirely. Similarly, in 1997 Congress restructured the NCA by reducing its size and requiring six members of Congress to serve as ex officio members for 2-year terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712438380">NEA, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712438380">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712438380">2009c</xref>).</p>
            <p>The culture wars caused policymakers on both sides of the aisle to lose confidence in the NEA’s expertise and capacity to support the arts for the benefit of the public at large. During the Reagan administration, the agency increasingly focused its attention on encouraging greater private support for the arts. Initiatives to secure private funding via community foundations and to leverage federal dollars with greater investment by state and local agencies simultaneously weakened the NEA’s role as a primary arts funder, while strengthening the agency’s reputation as a catalyst for artistic support and creative production. The Serrano and Mapplethorpe scandals called this reputation into question as artists and art supporters alike doubted the agency’s ability to set a high standard for the kind of art worthy of funding, a critical rationale for the agency’s founding 25 years earlier. The counternarratives prevalent in the debates of the 1950s and 1960s claiming that federal support would impede the quality of American art reemerged as the NEA lost its reputational uniqueness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712438380">Carpenter, 2001</xref>). No longer was it distinctively positioned to judge and support American artistic excellence. Seeing an opportunity for greater state funding, state arts agencies supported increased decentralization and greater investment in indigenous rather than elite interests, while artists and arts advocacy groups denounced the NEA for recalling funds and instituting the decency pledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712438380">Moen, 1997</xref>). Even the majority of the NEA’s supporters in Congress were lukewarm about the agency, willing to vote for mild content restrictions and budget cuts to send a message and avoid harsher legislative action.</p>
            <p>Yet, despite the loss of reputation-based autonomy and a weakening of the separation between the NCA and Congress, the storylines of quality and access remained persuasive enough to save the agency from elimination. During Senate debate over the 1989 Helms Amendment prohibiting funding for indecent or obscene artwork, Senator Edward Kennedy reiterated the storylines of quality and access, focusing on the elements of expertise and government separation so critical to autonomy:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>When Congress instituted the Endowments, it wisely assigned the review and assessment of program grants to professionals in the arts community who can accurately weigh the relative merits of individual applicants. It was a conscious effort at that time to separate the review process from political interference. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438380">Bolton, 1992</xref>, p. 79)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Senator Kennedy went on to suggest that despite recent controversy over the Serrano and Mapplethorpe works, there would have been “persistent and chronic controversy” during the NEA’s history without the peer review system. Senators Howard Metzenbaum, Claiborne Pell, and Timothy Wirth similarly spoke about the dangers of Congress legislating a moral code on the value of artworks, suggesting that Congressional judgment of artistic quality and appropriateness would limit artistic freedom, elicit claims of censorship, and undermine the professional, peer review process that had made the NEA successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712438380">Bolton, 1992</xref>).</p>
            <p>Although programmatic changes and budget reductions weakened the NEA’s autonomy and reinvigorated discursive coalitions opposed to public funding for the arts, the storylines of quality and access remained powerful enough to protect the agency from much harsher punishment and to keep the peer review system established by the NCA intact.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The NEA provides a useful case for studying the role of storylines in applying and integrating task- and reputation-based approaches to bureaucratic autonomy. After nearly two centuries of resistance to a national arts policy, elected officials agreed to fund arts programs believing that the free expression of American artists was crucial to proving cultural superiority in the Cold War context. The storyline of quality underscored the need for a separate body of experts to set the direction for the NEA without government interference, creating a structural separation between the agency and government oversight. This allowed NCA members to define how the agency would pursue its mission and its standards for success in an environment where outcomes were vague and difficult to measure. That the Endowment’s goals of providing access to great art and leadership in arts education were elusive did not matter significantly to the many politicians and arts supporters who believed the expertise of the NCA and NEA staff would ensure that the agency was fulfilling its mission.</p>
         <p>The storyline of access defined the relationship between the government and the agency more specifically, making it difficult for political officials to get information on how grants were being awarded for fear of being accused of interference or even censorship. The NEA’s leadership deflected accusations of elite bias or a lack of transparency by gradually expanding its programs in accordance with emerging art trends. Introducing programs in folk art and expansion art, for example, fended off potential rivals and competing discursive coalitions in a way that retained the agency’s commitment to professional artists and institutions producing the “best” American art.</p>
         <p>Coherent tasks and reputation also reinforced one another during the culture wars of the 1990s when the NEA lost autonomy not only by losing its reputation for effectiveness among politicians but also by losing the support of the arts community. Although the NEA’s autonomy was dramatically weakened in this period, the storylines of quality and access remained persuasive as the agency’s supporters continued to articulate the necessity of separate peer review panels and the inability of elected officials to judge artistic achievement.</p>
         <p>Even today, these storylines remain powerful. Dana Gioia, NEA Chairman from 2003 to 2009, reported on the agency’s progress, writing “The Arts Endowment’s programs now reach into every corner of our nation—bringing the best of the arts and arts education to the broadest and most varied audiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712438380">Gioia, 2007</xref>, para 4).</p>
         <p>Future research will focus on additional cases to compare and contrast the ways in which political elites use storylines to build and maintain autonomy, particularly for those agencies that exercised significant autonomy during the Cold War period. Such work will investigate how actors build discursive coalitions within a particular historical and political environment, and, in turn, provide public administration scholars with additional tools for analyzing the historical development of government agencies and their oversight. Ultimately, the work will contribute to an increasingly diverse body of scholarship on administrative discretion and the use of discourse analysis in public administration and policy. The NEA’s storylines invite broader discussion of the concept of bureaucratic autonomy and the assumptions political elites make in seeking to limit autonomy by controlling administrative “experts” or contracting-out services to private experts deemed to be more knowledgeable or more efficient. Discourse analytic perspectives allow scholars to analyze the nuances between autonomy and abuse, power and discretion in ways that enhance our field and legitimize administrative practice at all levels.</p>

Storylines seek to resemble other policy phenomena to frame the issue within a given arena of meaning already understood by the reader/listener. Yet, they simultaneously suggest that same issue is unique and requires a specific, individualized solution. The grammar demonstrates exactly how a storyline achieves this by addressing a set of questions needing answers in the political arena, including how the policy situation is being described, from where the threats or problems are emerging that must be addressed, who must address them and why, and how causation is assigned. This analysis modifies Toal’s grammar somewhat, merging the causation and situation description aspects of his framework and giving greater emphasis to how political elites are suggesting the issue be addressed in policy. I further add how the storylines affect the NEA’s ability to build and maintain autonomy.</p>
