<abstract>
<p>This article presents a new concept for electrostatic energy harvesting devices that increase output power under displacement limited inertial mass motion at sufficiently large acceleration amplitudes. The concept is illustrated by two demonstrated electrostatic energy harvesting prototypes in the same die dimension: a reference device with end-stops and an impact device with movable end-stops functioning as slave transducers. Both devices are analyzed and characterized in small and large excitation regimes. We found that significant additional energy from the internal impact force can be harvested by the slave transducer. The impact device gives much higher, up to a factor of 3.7, total output power than the reference device at the same high-acceleration amplitude. The bandwidth of the response to frequency sweeps is beneficially enlarged by up to a factor of 20 by the nonlinear mechanisms of the impact device.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Energy harvesting from surrounding mechanical vibrations can be regarded as a quest for a power substitute for batteries in wireless devices. The energy harvester principally behaves as a transducer to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy based on one of three fundamental mechanisms: electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12436739">Beeby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12436739">Cantatore and Ouwerkerk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12436739">Mitcheson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12436739">Moll and Rubio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12436739">Roundy et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12436739">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12436739">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X12436739">Starner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045389X12436739">Starner and Paradiso, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1045389X12436739">Williams and Yates, 1996</xref>). In packaged systems, the transducers are combined with power conditioning and energy storage. The transducers typically include a spring-mass system with output power generated from relative motion of an inertial proof mass. The energy harvester is designed to scavenge as much power as possible under different vibration conditions. The environmental vibration signal can be found in narrowband or wideband frequency ranges, under low or high excitation levels.</p>
<p>For ordinary energy harvesting from vibration, the output power increases with the input acceleration. However, large excitation and/or high quality factor <italic>Q</italic> of the mechanical system cause large proof mass displacements, which may exceed the limits of the device, these limits usually being in the form of end-stops. When impacts with end-stops occur, nonlinearity and jumping effects in frequency response are caused. A considerable weakness in the use of conventional end-stops is that the output power levels off even as the excitation amplitude is further increased. As a result, the transducer effectiveness decreases for high levels of excitation. These effects have been mentioned by many authors based on their simulation and experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12436739">Blystad and Halvorsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12436739">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12436739">Le and Halvorsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045389X12436739">Soliman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045389X12436739">Tvedt et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our work in this article introduces a concept by which the transducer efficiency can be increased for a device in limited motion under large acceleration amplitude. When excited by sufficiently high acceleration, the impact force between the proof mass and the end-stops is beneficially utilized to increase output power. In terms of energy harvesting using impact forces, various macroscale piezoelectric devices have been constructed by many authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12436739">Djugum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12436739">Funasaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12436739">Gu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045389X12436739">Umeda et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045389X12436739">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1045389X12436739">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045389X12436739">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>), in which the output power is extracted from stress variation on the piezoelectric transducers induced by the impact forces. In our concept, microscale transducers using the electrostatic mechanism are designed to scavenge the kinetic energy from the internal impact forces. Our device design includes a master capacitive transducer as a conventional electrostatic energy harvester, and slave capacitive transducers functioning as end-stops for the master mass motion. At a small excitation level, the master proof mass motion is not beyond the limit, so the output power contribution of the slave transducers is negligible. However, for sufficiently large accelerations, the slave transducers become activated by the internal impact force between the master and slave masses. The total output power therefore significantly increases with the addition of the slave output power from the impact force on the end-stops.</p>

<title>Device description</title>
<p>In this section, we motivate and explain the basic concept of the device operation and its microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementation.</p>
<sec id="section3-1045389X12436739">
<title>Device concept</title>
<p>In a nonresonant energy harvester, the proof mass may be loose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12436739">Lo and Tai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12436739">Naruse et al., 2009</xref>) or have very compliant suspensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12436739">Miao et al., 2006</xref>), while a resonant device will have a spring suspension designed to match the resonant frequency to the ambient vibration spectrum. The maximum inertial mass displacement is limited by die dimensions or the need to avoid beam fracture. Therefore, mechanical end-stops are designed to safely enforce this limit at some maximum distances <italic>X<sub>max</sub></italic>. The end-stops can be bumps on a frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12436739">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12436739">Le and Halvorsen, 2011</xref>) or a more compliant structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12436739">Halvorsen et al., 2009</xref>), but are usually much stiffer than the suspension of the inertial mass in order to have a limiting effect.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12436739">Figure 1(a)</xref> illustrates the typical geometric configuration where the inertial mass motion is confined. The spring suspensions are not shown for simplicity. The maximum traveling distance of the inertial mass is reached at a sufficiently large value of the acceleration amplitude <italic>A</italic> and depends on the total quality factor <italic>Q<sub>T</sub></italic> of the resonance. For a velocity-damped generator, the decisive quantity is <italic>AQ<sub>T</sub></italic>. When the end-stops are engaged, the output power is approximately saturated and little or nothing is gained from a further increase of the acceleration amplitude. The saturated power is not very sensitive to energy loss at the impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12436739">Blystad et al., 2010</xref>). This is the case found even when the proof mass motion has chaotic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12436739">Kaur et al., 2010</xref>). Saturation of power even without end-stop loss is possible because the phase of the inertial mass displacement adjusts so that the fictitious force does negative work on the inertial mass in part of the vibration cycle. Under these conditions, excess energy is stored in the device as kinetic energy of the proof mass. The present design aims to extract some of this energy.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12436739">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows the impact-based harvester utilizing slave transducers functioning as end-stops. The end-stop transducers are designed to confine the master mass displacement to the same maximum value <italic>X<sub>max</sub></italic> as a comparable conventional harvester. For small excitation levels, the impact harvester behaves as an ordinary harvester in which the output power is primarily obtained from the master transduction. For high excitation levels, the master mass is driven into impact with the slave transducers, and extra power is converted. We therefore expect the total output power of the impact harvester to increase beyond that of a conventional device under increasing ambient vibration levels. This mechanism is investigated by comparing the impact-based harvester design to a conventional one.</p>

<title>MEMS implementation of the device concept</title>
<p>We have realized microscale designs for the device concept using electrostatic transduction. The devices were designed for, and fabricated in, the SOIMUMPs process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.memscap.com/en_mumps.html">http://www.memscap.com/en_mumps.html</ext-link>). The process is based on high aspect ratio micromachining of silicon on insulator wafers with 25-µm-thick device layers. Both a conventional reference device and an impact device were designed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12436739">Figure 1</xref>, in order to compare performance under equal displacement constraints.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12436739">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows key features of the impact device design. Three structures constitute the design: one is master structure and two are slave structures acting as end-stops. The master structure includes a movable proof mass <italic>m<sub>m</sub></italic> attached to four linear folded springs. It has two ordinary comb-drive transducers whose overlap varies with opposite phases under in-plane motion. Since the performance of the chosen transducers is straightforward in the linear regime, this aspect is useful to capture the intricate interplay between the master and slave transducers.</p>

<p>The nominal overlap between two electrodes of the master transducer is 10 µm in the design. The maximum displacement of the master mass is set to the same value of <italic>X<sub>max</sub></italic> = 10 µm. The distance between the master and slave masses at equilibrium is Δ<sub>1</sub> = 6 µm; the master mass will impact with the slave mass if its displacement is beyond this limit Δ<sub>1</sub>.

<title>Impedance characterization</title>
<p>As a first step of the measurement sequences, optimal loads of the impact and reference devices were experimentally determined by impedance analysis using the Precision Impedance Analyzer, model 4294A, Agilent Technologies. Both transducers were measured in order to observe impedance variation with frequency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12436739">Figure 5</xref> shows the impedance and phase analysis of the master and reference transducers for the measurement sources: bias of 10 V DC and signal amplitude of 0.5 V AC. Using the impedance data and a linear transducer model, several device parameters were extracted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12436739">Table 2</xref>). The coupling factor <italic>k</italic> was found from the resonant <italic>f<sub>r</sub></italic> and antiresonant <italic>f<sub>a</sub></italic> frequencies by <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-1045389X12436739">

</inline-formula>. The optimal loads of both transducers are found as the lowest values in the impedance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12436739">Lei et al., 2011</xref>). These are 22.8 and 15.2 MΩ for the master and reference transducers, respectively. In the following experiments, we will use these two optimal loads in the characterization of the two devices even when operating in the nonlinear regime. This approach ensures that both devices, when driven at their respective resonant frequencies, are operating at their optimum at the onset of nonlinear behaviour and at the same time avoids the burden of separate load optimization for each set of operating conditions (amplitude and frequency). For demonstration of the device concept, the spring stiffness of the master and reference transducers was designed to achieve the same resonant frequency. Due to minor disparities in the etching affecting the beam width, the resonant frequencies of two devices deviate by about 6%. This is small enough to secure operation in the same frequency range, as will be evident in the measurements.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12436739">Figure 6</xref> displays the output voltage waveforms of the master and slave transducers in the impact device for different excitation levels at the resonant frequency. Both master and slave transducers are biased by the same external voltage, <italic>V<sub>b</sub></italic> = 10 V, through contact pads that connect to the movable electrodes through the silicon spring suspension. A straightforward comparison of the outputs between the master and slave transducers is made possible by choosing the external load of the slave transducers identical to that of the master. All fixed electrodes in the impact device are therefore connected to external loads with the same value of <italic>R<sub>L</sub></italic> = 22.8 MΩ. Buffer amplifiers are used to protect from influences of parasitics in cables and equipment.</p>

<p>At a small acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.03g, the master mass displacement amplitude is still under the limit, meaning that no impact occurs between the master and slave masses. The output voltages from the impact device are predominantly from the master transducers, and the output voltages from the slave transducers are negligible. A higher acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.06g is enough to drive the master mass into contact with the slave masses. The slave transducers become activated, and the slave output waveforms are recognizable. At this level of the acceleration, the impact force of the master mass acting on the slave masses is still weak. Thus, the slave output voltages are small and have two recognizable frequency components in their waveforms: one at the excitation frequency and the other at the slave resonant frequency. For a high acceleration level of <italic>A</italic> = 2.4g, the impact forces between the masses are much stronger. Therefore, the slave transducers are effective in converting proof mass kinetic energy to electrical energy as is evident in their output voltage waveforms. From the output voltage waveforms, we see that the slave transducers have most of their output in a transient and limited time after impact. The period of the slave transducer output is half a period of the master transducer due to the slaves being engaged twice per cycle. A minor variance of the slave performances can be explained by some dissimilarity between the two slave transducers during fabrication. For example, slight differences in the definition of the bumps could cause differences in magnitude and timing of the impact forces on the slave masses.</p>

<title>Response to frequency sweeps</title>
<p>In the following, we investigate how the output power varies with frequency. The acceleration was swept up and down in frequency between 500 and 1000 Hz in 20 s + 20 s with constant acceleration amplitude. The output was sampled at a rate of 48 kHz, and each value of the output power was calculated from the mean square value of the measured voltage over an averaging window of 2000 sample points.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12436739">Figure 7</xref> shows the frequency response of the master transducer in the small acceleration regime. The master output power increases quadratically with acceleration and is identical on up- and down-sweeps, that is, we have linear behavior. The maximum output power is 1.9 nW for an acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.045g, and the corresponding 3-dB bandwidth is 7.2 Hz.</p>

For sufficiently high excitation levels, the impact between the master and slave masses around the master resonant frequency causes a hysteresis and jump phenomenon. This leads to rich nonlinearity of the impact device performance.</p>

</fig>
<p>For up-sweep at an acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.62g, the master output power increases up to a frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 603 Hz as one would expect from a linear device. At this frequency, the master mass starts to impact the slave structures as can be inferred from the slave output. The master output power continues to increase in a complicated fashion up to a frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 720 Hz and then jumps down, falling again to what appears approximately like a linear device response where there are no impacts. The maximum output power of the master transducer is 12.2 nW at a frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 705 Hz. The response is generally shifted to frequencies above the linear resonant frequency as is typical for both hardening springs and vibroimpact systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12436739">Blystad and Halvorsen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045389X12436739">Tand and Zuo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>During impact between the master and slave masses, the slave masses can be considered as <italic>soft</italic> end-stops for the master. The master mass still moves an extra distance beyond Δ<sub>1</sub> before it turns. Hence, the master output power can continue to increase with increasing sweep frequency also when impacts take place. The ability to sustain a high-amplitude orbit for the master when impacts occur is dependent on the phase relationship between its displacement, its slave impacts, and the acceleration. It adds to the complexity that the slave structures have a dynamics of their own governed by the impact force, the spring recovery force, and the electrostatic force from the transducer. One can speculate if it is a coincidence that the jump frequency observed around <italic>f</italic> = 640 Hz is so close to the master structure resonance.</p>
<p>The energy conversion in the slave transducers is strongly dependent on the displacement <italic>x<sub>s</sub></italic> of the slave mass because the capacitance varies as <inline-formula id="inline-formula3-1045389X12436739">
<mml:math display="inline" id="math3-1045389X12436739"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math>
</inline-formula>. Thus, the variation of capacitance with displacement increases rapidly as the displacement nears its limit. As we observe in the up-sweeps from 603 to 659 Hz at the acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.62g, the slave output is minute. In the frequency range from 659 to 720 Hz, the master mass is able to drive the slave transducer a larger distance giving a recognizable slave output power.</p>
<p>In down-sweep at <italic>A</italic> = 0.62g, the master output power increases for decreasing frequency down to <italic>f</italic> = 659 Hz with a response that one would expect from a linear device. At the frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 659 Hz, there is an abrupt change that can be explained as the master mass hitting the slave structures. The slave output is still small at this level. The master and slave performances then follow the up-sweep response for further decrease of frequency.</p>
<p>The responses for <italic>A</italic> = 0.92g are similar to, but have higher output power than those for <italic>A</italic> = 0.62g. The jump frequency is shifted up to <italic>f</italic> = 730 Hz. The slave peak power is now comparable to that of the master transducer in the hysteresis region. Further increase of the acceleration to <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g reveals the benefit of the slave transducers, whose output power is now about two times higher than the master output power. There are now new jump phenomena observed in the up- and down-sweeps at <italic>f</italic> = 675 and 698 Hz, respectively. On the down-sweep, after the master mass starts to impact the slave masses at <italic>f</italic> = 698 Hz, the slave output power increases up to a saturated level about 33 nW and then jumps down at <italic>f</italic> = 618 Hz. Erratic slave outputs are observed on parts of the sweep. The saturation of the slave outputs suggests that the minimum gap is reached for the slave transducers. Hysteresis on the low-frequency side of the response is known from softening spring behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12436739">Elshurafa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12436739">Mestrom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045389X12436739">Tvedt et al., 2010</xref>). There is no known mechanical spring softening effect in this device, but the electrostatic pull on the moving part of the slave structure at small gaps is a candidate explanation.</p>
<p>At the higher acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g, the output power of all transducers is saturated in the frequency range of the hysteresis. The hysteresis occurs in a band between the jump-down frequencies in the up- and down-sweeps of width Δ<italic>f</italic> = 807 − 596 = 211 Hz. The corresponding bandwidth is about 129 Hz for <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g. The saturation behavior indicates that the slave masses are displaced to the full maximum distance Δ<sub>2</sub> in each period of the master mass motion. The hysteretic response can be divided into three frequency ranges where the intermediate frequency range displays a unique high-amplitude orbit. The intermediate range is also enlarged compared to the case <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g.</p>
<p>The erratic slave transducer responses obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12436739">Figure 8</xref> for the lower accelerations can be understood from the output waveforms of one slave transducer shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12436739">Figure 9</xref>. The time span of the traces corresponds approximately to one averaging window. For the accelerations of <italic>A</italic> = 0.92g and 1.50g, the slave mass output has large irregular variations in magnitude. Evidently, the dynamics do not resemble steady state, but appear chaotic. Therefore, the average output power of the slave over a time window has a correspondingly significant variation from data point to data point as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12436739">Figure 8</xref>. It is reasonable that the variation of the master output is considerably less because the master proof mass travels approximately between −Δ<sub>1</sub> and +Δ<sub>1</sub> despite variations of the impact force at the ends. The slave mass motion is closer to periodic at the higher acceleration level of <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g as observed in the bottom waveform in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12436739">Figure 9</xref>, which can explain the absence of erratic behavior in the corresponding traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12436739">Figure 8</xref>. We previously observed proof mass motion varying between simple regular motion and chaotic-like motion in simulations of a device with impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12436739">Kaur et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

For the acceleration amplitude of <italic>A</italic> = 0.92g, the nonlinearity is enriched by the interplay of the impact force between the master mass and the slave masses, giving the corresponding frequency hysteresis. The output powers extracted from the end-stops by the slave transducers become considerable when the master mass impacts the slave masses. The impact nonlinearity leads to an achieved maximum output power of 35.2 nW at a frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 702 Hz. The strong variations of the slave output powers are less observed in the total output power. This can be explained by these being self-canceling in the sum at a frequency point. The similar nonlinear performance and a higher output power are the results for an increased acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g. The impact force with strong effects of the electrostatic force is able to drive the slave mass motion to the limit. As a result, the total output power reaches the maximum value of 81.8 nW in the down-sweep of the frequency response. The enriched nonlinearity of the impact performance results in the intermediate region confined by two jumping frequencies in the up- and down-sweeps. The intermediate region is enlarged for a further increased acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g. This region also identifies a maximum level of the total output power, where the slave masses are accelerated to the minimum gap positions.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12436739">Figure 11</xref> shows the dependence of the output power of the master and slave transducers on the acceleration amplitude. The amplitude is swept up and down at the resonant frequency of <italic>f</italic>

Initially, the output of the slave masses is smaller, although their effect is strong enough to cause saturated output power of the master transducer until a small jump at <italic>A</italic> = 0.72g. For further increase of the acceleration amplitude, the master and slave transducer outputs gradually increase up to <italic>A</italic> = 2.65g where a jump of the output power to the saturated level is observed. The saturation can be explained by both master and slave masses reaching the displacement limit together. The saturated output power for each slave transducer is 36.2 nW, about two times the output power of the master transducer. In the down-sweep, each transducer’s output power starts at the saturated level and stays saturated for further decrease of the acceleration amplitude until a jump down occurs at <italic>A</italic> = 1.45g and then the up-sweep response retraces with further amplitude reduction.

<p>A shortcoming of the reference transducer with use of end-stops is evident when the reference mass motion reaches the limit and then impacts the end-stops. Under the high acceleration regime, the output power is roughly leveled-off rather than increasing for the maximum displacement achieved. In our device concept, the output power of the impact device continuously increases when the mass motion reaches the limited maximum displacement. The internal impact force between the mass and the end-stops is utilized for extra output power, extracted from the slave transducers.</p>
<p>In comparison between the two devices, the master output power is smaller than the reference output power when both transducers hit the end-stops at the same acceleration level. For example, at the acceleration amplitude of <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g, the maximum output power of the master transducer is 17.3 nW, but this value is 34.3 nW for the reference transducer. With the additional power from the slaves, the maximum output power of the impact device is significantly increased up to 81.7 nW, much higher than that of the reference device. For <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g, the impact device reaches 91.0 nW while the reference device obtains only 38.2 nW. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1045389X12436739">Table 3</xref> summarises the comparison between the output powers of the two devices.</p>

However, the 3-dB bandwidth is dramatically enhanced for increases in acceleration amplitude. For example, the 3-dB bandwidth is enlarged about 10 times and 20 times higher than that of the linear case for acceleration amplitudes of <italic>A</italic> = 1.50g and 2.70g, respectively. The 3-dB bandwidths of the impact device are approximately equal in the up- and down-sweeps. Compared to the reference device, the up-sweep 3-dB bandwidth of the impact device is smaller in the high acceleration regime. In the down-sweep, the 3-dB bandwidths of the impact device are also less, but the difference is much less than in the up-sweep cases.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12436739">Figure 15</xref> shows a comparison of the output powers between the two devices in the up- and down-sweeps of acceleration amplitude. The reference transducer is swept at its resonant frequency of <italic>f</italic> = 675 Hz, and the master transducer at its resonant frequency of <italic>f</italic>
<sub>0</sub> = 635 Hz and also at <italic>f</italic> = 680 Hz. At the resonant frequency, the reference mass reaches the maximum displacement at an acceleration of <italic>A</italic> = 0.13g, while the value for the master transducer hitting the slave masses is <italic>A</italic> = 0.06g. The reference output power is then at a saturated level of 24.3 nW for further increases in acceleration amplitude. The saturated output power is 17.1 nW for the master transducer at the resonant frequency. This value is slightly larger, about 18.4 nW, at <italic>f</italic> = 680 Hz. However, with the output power extracted from the slave transducers during impact, the total output power of the impact device is significantly higher than that of the reference device despite the same constraints on the maximum displacement, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1045389X12436739">Figure 16</xref>. For example, the maximum output power of the impact device is 88.7 nW at <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g and 91.0 nW at <italic>A</italic> = 1.72g for the two exciting frequencies of <italic>f</italic>
<sub>0</sub> = 635 Hz and <italic>f</italic> = 680 Hz, respectively. These are about 3.7 times higher than for the reference device.</p>

<title>Effects of bias voltage</title>
<p>The bias voltage <italic>V<sub>b</sub></italic> has a crucial effect on the output powers of the reference and impact devices, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1045389X12436739">Figure 17</xref> at their resonant frequencies in the up- and down-sweeps of the acceleration amplitude. The obtained output powers are generally larger for higher bias voltages. Moreover, the output power of the impact device achieves the higher maximum level at lower acceleration amplitude. For example, the maximum output power is 88.7 nW at <italic>A</italic> = 2.70g, 111.7 nW at <italic>A</italic> = 2.21g, and 135.3 nW at <italic>A</italic> = 1.85g for the bias voltages of <italic>V<sub>b</sub></italic> = 10, 11, and 12 V, respectively. The ratio of the maximum output powers between the reference and impact devices also increases when increasing the bias voltage <italic>V<sub>b</sub></italic>. This ratio is 3.7, 4.0, and 4.2 for bias voltages of 10, 11, and 12 V. In the impact device, a higher bias voltage results in a jump to the maximum level at a lower acceleration. Therefore, the acceleration hysteresis is significantly reduced in the up- and down-sweeps of the acceleration amplitude. Since the effect is not seen in the reference device, we attribute it to the electrostatically induced changes in the impacts on the slaves, that is, reduction in slave stiffness and increased electrical loss.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A device concept has been developed that uses end-stops as slave transducers, for extracting extra power from the internal impact force when the transducer mass reaches a maximum displacement under sufficiently high acceleration amplitude. Characterization shows that a variety of jump phenomena in the up- and down-frequency sweeps shapes the intermediate frequency range of the impact device response. A reference device has the highest 3-dB bandwidth, but the lowest power at high acceleration amplitudes. With addition of the extracted output power from the end-stops, the impact device shows a total output power about 3.7 times higher than that of the reference device accelerated under the same conditions. It displays 20 times increase in bandwidth when the acceleration amplitude varies from 0.045g to 2.70g.</p>
