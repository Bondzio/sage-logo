<p>In their <italic>Guide to Early Psychological Evaluation: Children and Adolescents</italic>, Christner, Freeman, Nigro, and Sardar produced a useful resource for professionals working with children. In their introductory chapter, the authors point out that when counselors and other professionals are conducting initial evaluations or screenings, they are seeing children who often present with difficulties in a variety of areas. Determining whether the difficulties warrant a specialized referral is, at times, a challenge for clinicians, particularly when working in isolation from other professionals, such as independent practitioners. Additionally, this may be difficult for those who lack familiarity with the informal assessments used to aide in the referral decision of knowing when to refer a client to a specialist.</p>
<p>The authors attempt to assist with the referral decision by discussing informal assessments in a number of areas in 16 brief, but informative chapters. Included among these areas are discussions of motor coordination, visual-motor functioning, and speech language functioning. Various aspects of neuropsychological functioning are also addressed by Christner and his coauthors. These include informal assessments of executive functioning, attention, and memory skills.</p>
<p>Given the importance of education in the lives of children and adolescents, the authors devote one of their longest chapters to a discussion of academic achievement screening. Here, they include information on reading, mathematics, and written language skills; skills that are typically assessed in educational evaluations. For each of these areas, there is a breakdown of important component skills along with information on conducting informal screenings for each of the component skills. As an example, the authors indicate that reading skills are comprised of alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness and processing, word reading, and reading accuracy, fluency, and comprehension. For each of these component skills, Christner and his associates present easily administered screening techniques. Included with these techniques are administration instructions for the clinician, as well as screening criteria, which identifies approximate ages for achievement of certain skills. When necessary, reproducible charts and graphics necessary to administer the screening techniques are also presented. All of this important information is presented in an easily accessible format.</p>
<p>The authors have a well-developed treatment of psychological functioning, including chapters on emotional and behavioral functioning, personality traits and functioning, and protective aspects of personality. For emotional functioning, they discuss screening for a number of disorders with particular emphasis on the disorders more commonly found in childhood and adolescence. As with the previous sections, the materials are presented in a readable and succinct fashion.</p>
<p>In short, this book is particularly recommended for independent practitioners who must make decisions about whether to refer clients to a particular specialist. With that in mind, in their concluding chapter, the authors might have wanted to suggest the various types of specialists to whom practitioners can refer clients. They might also want to make suggestions about the types of formal assessments that these specialists might conduct. Regardless of these factors, clinicians will find that this book is a useful addition to their reference materials.</p>
