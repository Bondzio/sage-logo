<abstract>
<p>In this study, a ranking strategy was evaluated for comparing subgroups’ change using identical, equated, and nonidentical measures. Four empirical data sets were evaluated, each of which contained examinees’ scores on two occasions, where the two occasions’ scores were obtained on a single identical measure, on two equated tests, and on two nonidentical measures. The two subgroups’ rates of change were compared based on ranked nonidentical measures, on raw and ranked equated measures, and on a raw and ranked identical measure. The results of comparing subgroups’ change were similar when based on the nonidentical measures and on the identical and equated measures. Additional evaluations using simulated data demonstrated that the ranking strategy proposed for nonidentical measures is accurate, especially when the subgroups were large, the difference between the subgroups’ change was large, and scores obtained on the measure(s) were highly correlated across occasions. The statistical power of the proposed ranking method is slightly reduced because of the tendency of the nonidentical measures to have relatively low correlations.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Long-standing concerns in change research pertain to the appropriate use of measures and statistical strategies for assessing change. For the research setting where a single measure is administered to a single group of examinees in two or more time periods, discussions have considered issues such as the use of gain scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013164411405651">Cronbach &amp; Furby, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013164411405651">Rogosa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013164411405651">Zumbo, 1999</xref>) and the estimation of true change from observed scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013164411405651">Lord, 1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013164411405651">1962</xref>). For research settings where multiple measures are used across time periods, discussions have focused on developing and maintaining a coherent scale from the multiple measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013164411405651">Harris, Hendrickson, Tong, Shin, &amp; Shyu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013164411405651">Kolen &amp; Brennan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013164411405651">Rock &amp; Pollack, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For some situations, the use of a single measure or multiple, equated measures across time periods may be regarded as impractical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd &amp; Zumbo, 2007</xref>). Certain settings preclude repeated administrations of the same measure because of security concerns (i.e., high-stakes testing) or because of large anticipated changes in examinee ability (e.g., Grade 7 vs. Grade 4 students). When different measures must be used across time periods, equating methods are not always available because of strict requirements about modeling assumptions, test design, and sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013164411405651">Dorans &amp; Holland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013164411405651">Kolen &amp; Brennan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013164411405651">von Davier, Holland, &amp; Thayer, 2004</xref>). Although interest exists for change evaluations that do not require the use of identical or equated measures, these potential change and growth evaluations have been questioned, “If <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> are different tests designed to measure somewhat different abilities, then it is clear that our study is not concerned with measuring growth at all in the usual sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013164411405651">Lord, 1957</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>Ranking strategies have been proposed for making studies of change feasible when nonidentical measures are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013164411405651">Braun, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd &amp; Zumbo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013164411405651">Lloyd, Zumbo, &amp; Seigel, 2009</xref>). Analyses of ranked nonidentical scores shift the focus of a change study because statements about a total group’s change cannot be made (i.e., the measures’ scores are not identical and there is no clear link for the two measures’ ranks). However, comparisons of subgroups’ changes in relative ranks may be potentially valid, possibly allowing for statements about subgroups’ relative change. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo (2007)</xref> described a situation where two subgroups’ scores on nonidentical measures obtained at two different grades were ranked and used to make statements about how the subgroups’ change compared.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to consider the accuracy implications of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> proposed ranking strategy for comparing subgroups’ change on nonidentical measures. One question about Lloyd and Zumbo’s ranking strategy pertains to the accuracy of comparisons of subgroups’ change when nonidentical measures are used. It may be that the use of nonidentical measures results in misleading conclusions about subgroups’ change because the subgroups’ change is confounded with differences in the measures. For example, subgroups’ apparent improvements may actually be due to the use of an easier measure in the more recent time period, whereas subgroups’ apparent declines may actually be due to the use of a more difficult measure in the more recent time period. The use of ranked nonidentical measures may partially address how differences in the measures affect conclusions about subgroups’ change but may be problematic if the differences in the measures affect the subgroups’ relative ranks. The possibility of misleading conclusions about subgroups’ change because of the nonidentical measures is itself difficult to evaluate when only nonidentical measures are used. For the current study, subgroup data were obtained on two occasions on identical, equated, and nonidentical measures. With these data sets, accuracy evaluations of Lloyd and Zumbo’s proposed use of nonidentical measures for evaluating subgroup change could be conducted, because the results of their proposed strategy with nonidentical measures could be compared with results obtained from similar analyses using identical and equated measures.</p>
<p>Another issue considered from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> proposed ranking strategy for comparing subgroups’ change on nonidentical measures is the implication of using ranked data for statistical accuracy. Simulation studies have shown that ranked data analyses are more powerful than raw data analyses when the raw data are skewed but less powerful than raw data analyses when the raw data are symmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013164411405651">Conover &amp; Iman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013164411405651">Zimmerman &amp; Zumbo, 2005</xref>). Because the data sets obtained for the current study included subgroup change data on identical and equated measures, the implications of using ranked data could be evaluated because the ranking was not actually needed for those measures. Results of comparing subgroups’ change using a raw or ranked identical measure and raw and ranked equated measures created opportunities to directly evaluate how ranking influenced conclusions about subgroup change and to indirectly consider the implications of ranking the scores of the nonidentical measures.</p>

<p>This study’s evaluations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> proposed ranking strategy are based on a design where identical, equated, and nonidentical measures are administered over two time periods to two examinee subgroups. Four empirical data sets were obtained. Simulated data sets were also produced so that the ranking strategy could be evaluated under more controlled conditions. After Lloyd and Zumbo’s ranking strategy is described, the analyses of the empirical and simulated data sets are detailed (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013164411405651">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> proposed ranking strategy for comparing two subgroups’ change at two time periods, Time 1 and Time 2, on nonidentical measures has the following four steps:</p>

<list-item><p>Compare the correlation of the ranked scores from Steps 1 and 2 with the ratio of their standard deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd &amp; Zumbo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013164411405651">Zumbo, 1999</xref>). If the correlation is greater than the ratio of standard deviations, compute the difference between the ranked scores. If the correlation is less than the ratio of standard deviations, compute the residualized change score by regressing the ranked Time 2 scores onto the ranked Time 1 scores and subtracting the expected ranked scores from Step 2’s actual ranked scores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013164411405651">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compare subgroups’ ranked score differences or their residualized change scores obtained in Step 3 (i.e., an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Except for Steps 1 and 2’s use of ranked data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> ranking strategy is conceptually identical to change analysis proposals where subgroups’ changes are compared after regressing or controlling for initial status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013164411405651">Lord, 1962</xref>, pp. 5-6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013164411405651">Zumbo, 1999</xref>, pp. 288-289). For situations where subgroups’ change can be assessed on raw, unranked data (i.e., where identical or equated measures are administered), Steps 3 and 4 can be used without Steps 1 and 2. In this study, subgroup change evaluations from applying Steps 1 through 4 and Steps 3 and 4 to the identical measures and to the equated measures were conducted, allowing for assessments of the implications of the ranking. Subgroup change evaluations based on nonidentical measures would not support the use of raw data, and so in this study, Steps 1 through 4 were always applied to the nonidentical measures.</p>

<title>Four Empirical Data Sets</title>
<p>Four data sets involving national administrations of large-scale licensure tests were obtained. Each of these four data sets had data from two test forms administered on different dates. The two forms were constructed based on the same content and statistical specifications so that equating requirements would be met for them to be equated to each other (i.e., they measured the same content, had almost same reliability, had identical lengths, and shared some items in common). For each of the four operational tests <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013164411405651">Table 2</xref> presents the number of common and noncommon items in the two test forms, the number of repeaters taking the forms at two different administrations, and the time period between the two administrations. The test forms’ scores (i.e., the sum of the common and noncommon item scores) were equated using observed score equating methods in the nonequivalent groups with anchor test (NEAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013164411405651">von Davier et al., 2004</xref>) design. The old and new form scores from examinees who repeated the tests provided Time 1 and Time 2 scores on an identical measure (i.e., the common item scores), on different but equated measures (i.e., the total test scores where the Time 2 form was equated to the Time 1 form), and on nonoverlapping and nonidentical measures (i.e., the scores on the noncommon items on the two test forms).</p>

<title>Simulated Data Sets</title>
<p>To evaluate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> proposed ranking strategy under relatively controlled conditions, data sets that resembled the major features of the empirical data sets were simulated but in simpler ways. The simulated data sets include four scores, Time 1 identical, Time 2 identical, Time 1 nonidentical, and Time 2 nonidentical. Three correlation patterns were considered for the four scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013164411405651">Table 7</xref>). These correlation patterns generally resembled the empirical data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013164411405651">Tables 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013164411405651">6</xref>), in that the correlation of the Time 1 and Time 2 scores on the identical measure was always larger than the correlations of the Time 1 and Time 2 scores on the nonidentical measures. Six change rates for two subgroups were defined by adding constants (i.e., change in standard deviation units) to the Time 2 identical and the Time 2 nonidentical scores in the subgroup data sets, where subgroup change rates (Subgroup 1, Subgroup 2) were either (0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.25), (0.0, 0.50), (0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.50), or (0.50, 0.50). A key assumption in simulating the data was that the identical and nonidentical measures reflected the same subgroup change rate. The simulated data sets were simpler than the empirical data sets in the following respects: the same correlation matrix was used for the two subgroups and the standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>s) of the four Time 1 and Time 2 measures for the two subgroups were all equal (=1).</p>

<list id="list2-0013164411405651" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Two subgroups’ data sets were generated which consisted of four variables with means of 0 and <italic>SD</italic>s of 1. These subgroup data sets were based on one of the three (Subgroup 1, Subgroup 2) sample sizes that were similar to those of the empirical data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013164411405651">Tables 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013164411405651">6</xref>), including (100, 100), (100, 50), and (50, 50).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The four variables in the two subgroup data sets were correlated based on one of the three population correlation matrices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013164411405651">Table 7</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The two subgroup data sets reflected one of the six subgroup change rates. These change rates were created by adding one of the six sets of change rate constants to the (Subgroup 1, Subgroup 2)’s identical and nonidentical scores in Time 2: (0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.25), (0.0, 0.50), (0.25, 0.25), (0.25, 0.50), or (0.50, 0.50).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To simulate unintended difficulty differences on the Time 1 and Time 2 nonidentical measures, a random number from the standard normal distribution was generated and added to the Time 2 nonidentical scores. When this random number was negative, the Time 2 nonidentical measure was more difficult than the Time 1 nonidentical measure. When this random number was positive, the Time 2 nonidentical measure was easier than the Time 1 nonidentical measure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Time 1 and Time 2 total scores were obtained for both subgroup data sets by summing the Time 1 identical and nonidentical scores, and summing the Time 2 identical and nonidentical scores, respectively. The Time 2 total scores were equated to the scale of the Time 1 total scores using the chained linear equating method.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subgroup change rates were compared by applying the ranking strategy with the identical, equated total, and nonidentical scores, and also by using the unranked identical and unranked equated scores.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Simulation Steps 1 to 6 were replicated 1,000 times for each of the three sample size combinations, six change rates, three population correlation matrices, and two distributions. The two distributions were considered to evaluate prior research results about the effects of ranking on statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013164411405651">Conover &amp; Iman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013164411405651">Zimmerman &amp; Zumbo, 2005</xref>). The distributions of the four variables generated in Step 1 were either normal (i.e., symmetric) or nonnormal (i.e., skewed). To consider skewed data, the variables were created with population skewness values of −0.85 using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013164411405651">Fleishman’s (1978)</xref> transformation method for normal variables. The skewness value of −0.85 was selected because it was similar to the most skewed empirical data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013164411405651">Tables 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013164411405651">6</xref>.</p>
<p>In each replication of the simulations, statistical significance tests (i.e., independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests) were conducted for each of the following five measures—raw identical, ranked identical, raw equated total scores, ranked equated total scores, and ranked nonidentical—and then the test results were recorded for each of them over the replications. These significance rates are empirical Type I error rates when the subgroups’ population change rates are equal, the accuracies of which are evaluated in comparison with the intended Type I error rate (0.05). These significance rates are empirical power rates when the subgroups’ population change rates are unequal, the accuracies of which are evaluated in direct comparisons of the strategies’ power rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Change analysis studies can seem impractical under testing situations in which the same measure cannot be administered repeatedly and/or when different measures administered on each occasion cannot be equated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> ranking strategy was proposed as an alternative for comparing subgroups’ change on nonidentical measures but the adequacy of this strategy has not been extensively evaluated. The major purpose of this study was to examine whether the ranking strategy can be used to compare subgroups’ change when only nonidentical measures are available. Four data sets were obtained containing identical, equated, and nonidentical measures for examinees from two adequately sized subgroups across two different time points. These data sets provided opportunities to evaluate the adequacy of Lloyd and Zumbo’s ranking strategy. The subgroup change rates were compared not only on the ranked nonidentical measures (Lloyd and Zumbo’s strategy) but also on the comparable measures (i.e., ranked and raw identical measures, ranked and raw equated measures). A simulation study was also conducted so that the adequacy of the ranking strategy could be evaluated under more controlled conditions.</p>
<p>The overall results obtained from the empirical and simulated data sets indicate that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd and Zumbo’s (2007)</xref> strategy for comparing subgroups’ change using ranked nonidentical measures is accurate, but it may have reduced statistical power relative to the use of comparable measures. The potential reduction in power would be minimal for situations with large subgroup sample sizes, large differences in subgroup change rates, and high correlations between the measures. The major source of reduction in power is the relatively low correlations for the nonidentical measures. This study’s results replicated the results of prior studies on ranking by showing that ranked data can increase power when distributions are skewed and reduce power when distributions are symmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013164411405651">Conover &amp; Iman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013164411405651">Zimmerman &amp; Zumbo, 2005</xref>). Although the results of ranking depend on the shape of the distribution, this study’s simulations showed that the statistical power of <italic>t</italic> tests based on ranked nonidentical measures was always lower than those based on more highly correlated measures (i.e., a ranked identical measure, raw equated measures, and ranked equated measures).</p>
<sec id="section12-0013164411405651">
<title>Assumptions and Limitations</title>
<p>The results from the empirical data were not perfectly consistent with those from the simulated data. The inconsistent findings might be caused by the assumptions used to create the simulated data. Specifically, the simulated data sets were based on measures with equal standard deviations across time, equal correlations across subgroups, and equal subgroup change on the identical and nonidentical measures. These attributes did not completely characterize the empirical data. The assumption of equal standard deviations is regarded as less crucial than the other assumptions because ranking eliminates differences in standard deviations. Assumptions about the equality of correlations and subgroup change rates are probably more realistic when the nonidentical measures do not differ markedly. As a consequence, subgroup change estimates were most accurate when the nonidentical measures were highly correlated, corresponding to conditions where “a commensurable (or comparable or similar) construct is measured across all waves of the study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd &amp; Zumbo, 2007</xref>, p. 415). Very low correlations provide evidence of construct dissimilarity in the nonidentical measures, suggesting that not only the reduced statistical power observed in this study’s results but also, possibly, the nonidentical measures may be so dissimilar that they should not be used for evaluating subgroups’ change at all.</p>
<p>Additional limitations of this study are that comparisons of subgroups’ change on nonidentical, equated, and identical measures must adequately control for confounds such as memory effects in the identical measures and regression to the mean in the subgroup data. The large subgroup differences on the nonidentical measures and the small differences on the identical measures observed in the Mathematics Test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0013164411405651">Table 8</xref>) may have been caused by memory effects. In this test, African American and White examinees showed high and relatively similar standardized mean change rates on the identical means (0.48 vs. 0.70) but substantially different change rates on the nonidentical measures (0.08 vs. 0.57). The 3-month separation of this test’s two administrations, the relatively small number of identical items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013164411405651">Table 2</xref>), and the construct being measured (mathematics ability vs. elementary education) may have resulted in memory effects in which African American and White examinees displayed similar, high change rates on the identical measure but different change rates on the nonidentical measure. The results from the Mathematics Test appear to be atypical among the empirical data sets. The results are also not adequately explained by ranked <italic>t</italic> tests with increased power because of extremely skewed data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013164411405651">Table 4</xref>). For the other three empirical data sets, test administrations were separated by 11 months or more (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013164411405651">Table 2</xref>), so that memory effects were not as likely to influence their results.</p>
<p>Finally, the possibility exists that the subgroup change results from the empirical data sets were due more to regression to the mean than to actual change. The repeated-measures data for two subgroups were obtained primarily because the examinees were self-selected and performed poorly on the Time 1 exam. To the extent that these examinees’ low performances were because of large negative errors on the Time 1 exam, any change observed on the Time 2 exam could be attributable to smaller negative errors or to small-to-large positive errors. The empirical data featured some controls of these regression effects, in that for three of the four tests there was at least one measure containing more than 60 items. The consistency of the empirical change rate comparison results across the identical, equated, and nonidentical measures provided additional evidence that the subgroup change results were not completely due to unreliability. However, the finding that change rate comparisons based on nonidentical measures may have reduced statistical power because of relatively low correlations suggests that measurement errors, low reliability, and construct dissimilarities always have potential to affect the results of these types of change analyses.</p>

<p>The likely result of ranking is that the ranked scores will have equal standard deviations (except for very small differences due to different numbers of tied values) and correlations less than 1 (e.g., this study’s data sets and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013164411405651">Lloyd &amp; Zumbo’s, 2007</xref>, example). This means that except for unrealistic situations, the use of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013164411405651">Zumbo’s (1999)</xref> comparison of ranked scores’ standard deviation ratios and correlations will almost always suggest the use of residualized change scores rather than difference scores.</p>
