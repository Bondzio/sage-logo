<p><italic>Witness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir</italic></p>
<p>Robert Jay Lifton</p>
<p>New York: Free Press, 2011. 430 pp. $30.00</p>
<p>I keep a fluid list of the five living persons with whom I would most like to dine and converse. The list in its fluidity changes from time to time. But Robert Lifton’s name is always among those five. The life he has lived, the research he has done, and the writing he has offered seem to me, in sum, to be among the most compelling and urgent that we have from the twentieth century. The present book is his reflective autobiography.</p>
<p>Lifton’s great testimony is against “totalism,” which he views as any operation of systemic violence that is characteristically reinforced by ideological or religious legitimation. His several subjects of research have been vivid, surely unbearable embodiments of totalism. He sums up the “eight deadly sins” of totalism: “<italic>milieu control, mystical manipulation, the demand for purity, the cult of confession, the sacred science, loading the language, doctrine over persons, and the dispensing of existence</italic>” (381, italics in original; also see 67–68). This wise summing up arises from Lifton’s long career of careful research that has centered on three great crises of totalism:
<list id="list1-0040573611424371g" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>He invested himself intensely among the victims and survivors of Hiroshima and the on-going psychic impact of that trauma. He interviewed both “special persons” (leadership types) and randomly selected ordinary people. Both groups experienced the shock of “everything becoming nothing” (112), a form of “spiritual annihilation” (113).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He became fully engaged with the Viet Nam War disaster, and spent time interviewing Viet Nam vets, with particular attention to the atrocity of My Lai. He coupled this with study of US responses to the nuclear threat, out of which he formulated the notion of “psychic numbing,” the practice of denial whereby one (or many) coped with the threat of “the end of the world” by a readiness to “stop feeling.” His experience led Lifton to become a vocal and vigorous protester of the war, a leader among the dissenters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>His final effort at penetrating the horror of totalism is his work on “Nazi doctors” in which he interviewed the German doctors who operated the death camps as well as death camp survivors, among them Jewish doctors. This research was particularly anguishing for him; as he was a mistrusted American among victims in Hiroshima, so he was a Jew dealing with the Nazi doctors whose work was to kill Jews. He gives special attention to his confrontations with Konrad Lorenz and Albert Speer. In this, as in every part of his research, Lifton is fully present as a person in the midst of his scientific work.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>While Lifton pays close attention to the detail in every crisis, he is able to see the recurring patterns of systemic violence, and the reiterated ways of coping that permitted survival. Before he finishes, Lifton adds, as a Jew, a welcome comment about “humiliating, wounding, and killing Palestine civilians” (353).</p>
<p>All along the way, Lifton is working to articulate a new scientific method that eventually becomes “psychic-historical” practice. In this his mentor and then close confidant is Erik Erikson. But what matters is that Lifton is able to hold together in consistent ways his scientific attentiveness with his deep and urgent moral passion. Here is no scientific jargon, but a deep human repulsion at violence and an intense engagement with and care for those who suffer from that totalism. His book is aptly titled, for his twentieth century is a long season of unbearable and unthinkable violence that brings humanity under threat; and he is a compelling, honest, daring witness who is able and willing to “overcome professional distancing.”</p>
<p>The book concludes with his wise reflection on “atrocity-producing contexts.” He continues to be engaged in dissenting ways amid a culture of violence-cum-denial. He has continued an ongoing round table with other dissenters, notably Norman Mailer, Howard Zinn, and Harvey Cox, a company of those who refuse to join the totalism.</p>
<p>This book is a welcome narrative that will introduce new readers to Lifton’s work. His model of moral passion invites the reader to engage the sweep of totalism that is all around. When I have a chance to dine and converse with Lifton, I will ask him about his sense of a ground for hope amid such horrors. He has already written of “the continuity of life” and “the principle of human continuity” (147). No doubt he would continue the conversation.</p>
