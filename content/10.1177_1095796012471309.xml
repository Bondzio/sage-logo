<p>The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 was as much a victory for organized labor, which identified it as a priority, as for President Obama. Yet there is considerable confusion as to how the ACA will affect union members. With its most salient portions slated for implementation in 2014, some states are rushing and others are refusing to prepare for reform, with many states somewhere in between. “We have lots and lots of questions and not a lot of answers,” a union negotiator, gearing up for contracts affecting 7,000 workers across Florida next year, nervously stated.</p>

<p><bold><italic>There is considerable confusion as to how the ACA will affect union members.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As union researchers, we are bombarded with questions about the impact of the ACA on represented members. Despite our best attempts, it is difficult to predict the numerous ways the legislation will affect contract negotiations and members’ lives as it rolls out across the country. Given that much of the ACA was modeled after Massachusetts’ landmark 2006 health care reform, the bargaining experiences in postreform Massachusetts can shed some insight into what unions across the nation may expect during negotiations. Through a series of interviews with labor leadership in Massachusetts, we learned how state health care reform affected the processes and outcomes of contract negotiations in sometimes unexpected ways.</p>
<p>We interviewed twelve Massachusetts union negotiators during the summer of 2012, including representatives of professional and service health care workers, public-sector teachers, building trades, non–health care service workers, and the nonteaching public sector. With some larger unions, we talked with multiple bargainers responsible for contracts in different industries. We have kept respondent names anonymous and identify unions by their prevalent membership base.</p>
<sec id="section1-1095796012471309">
<title>A Model for Reform</title>
<p>The ACA retains many of the key provisions of the Massachusetts reform, notably the individual mandate, penalties for employers that do not offer affordable health insurance to their employees, and state-led exchanges to offer health insurance products and subsidies to eligible individuals and employers.</p>
<p>The goal of the Massachusetts legislation was 100 percent coverage of its residents. Even before its adoption, Massachusetts outpaced the rest of the country with its high health insurance coverage rate and percentage of residents with employer-provided insurance. In 2004, 7.4 percent of Massachusetts’ population was uninsured compared with a national rate of 14.9 percent. In 2009, three years after reform was implemented, the rate of uninsured dropped to 2.7 percent, while the national rate increased to 16.97 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1095796012471309">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, 70 percent of Massachusetts’ employers offered health insurance to their employees, increasing to 76 percent in 2009. In comparison, 60 percent of employers in the United States offered health insurance to their employees in the years 2005 and 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1095796012471309">2</xref></sup> The combination of high coverage and high employer-sponsored insurance gave Massachusetts a solid base on which to build universal coverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1095796012471309">
<title>At the Bargaining Table</title>
<p>Many of the current concerns that union leaders across the country have about individual impacts and employer behavior under the ACA are similar to what Massachusetts union leaders had in 2006. Will more employers offer health insurance? Will the state-run health insurance exchange open up new opportunities to access health insurance for workers? Will the availability of publicly subsidized options result in employers “dumping” their employees into these programs? What will happen to employees who cannot afford their employer-sponsored health insurance but who do not qualify for Medicaid or state-subsidized products? Will the health care reform mandates bring about improvements to existing health insurance plans? Will the trends of shifting insurance costs onto employees and decreasing plan quality be exacerbated, nullifying potential wage gains?</p>
<p>Most Massachusetts unions we talked with did not see dramatic changes in employer behavior due to health care reform. Union employers that offered health insurance plans before health care reform continued to do so, noting that the employer penalties—up to $295 per employee and possibly additional fees if the employee accesses the state’s free care pool—are too modest to motivate employer behavior. Perhaps because of this, interviewees did not experience employers dumping employees into the state-run health insurance exchange. On the negative side, it is less expensive for employers currently not offering insurance to begin paying penalties than to provide insurance.</p>
<p>One nonhealth care service union, negotiating with a multinational food services employer that had never offered insurance to its part-time seasonal workers, pushed for insurance after reform was passed. The employer responded with a clear “no” and opted to pay the fine. Although the union was unable to find an inexpensive, quality plan that would be affordable for the bargaining unit and viable for the employer, it nevertheless regarded the quixotic effort as worthwhile.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Although [one Massachusetts] union was unable to find an inexpensive, quality plan that would be affordable for the bargaining unit and viable for the employer, it nevertheless regarded the quixotic effort as worthwhile.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the state-run health insurance exchange did not increase health insurance options for a broad group of workers, it did do so for a limited group of eligible workers. Both Massachusetts and federal reform authorize state-led exchanges to offer health insurance products, essentially serving as marketplaces for individual consumers and businesses to purchase health insurance. Massachusetts’ exchange, called the Connector, sells private insurance products to individuals and small businesses, and permits eligible low-income individuals and families to access its state-subsidized products at sliding income scales. Individuals and employers with fewer than fifty employees can purchase nonsubsidized Connector products. Large employers (with 51 or more employees) and nonemployer groups, including unions, are not able to do this, which was particularly lamented by unions representing low-wage workers. By contrast, those representing higher earning members with health insurance options stated that they never considered the Connector because the health insurance plans it offered were often not as generous as their employer-funded plans or those funded by joint employer and union-managed benefit funds known as Taft-Hartley plans.</p>
<p>We learned of two cases where a union was able to use the Connector to negotiate affordable health insurance for its members. Both involved employers with fewer than fifty full-time workers. Because of the individual mandate, more employees at both companies wanted insurance, substantially increasing costs for the employers who were already financially struggling. Passing on more of the costs to these lower-wage workers would have created too much of a financial burden. The union realized that most of the workers could access state-subsidized Connector products as individuals, which would be less expensive for the employers and employees while substituting better quality insurance than what the employers were currently offering. Instead of bargaining for insurance and wage increases, the union—after consulting with their members—decided to take insurance off the table and put more effort into winning bonuses so as to avoid tipping workers into higher wage categories that would have made them ineligible for subsidized Connector insurance. Both employers agreed and the contracts were ratified with overwhelming support. The members accessed Connector products not as a group but as individuals and the employers paid the requisite fines.</p>
<p>Massachusetts unions that represented low-income members with little or no access to health insurance were able to use the Connector to improve existing coverage for their members. Although unions could not access the product directly, unions were able to leverage the standards required of insurance products in the Connector to negotiate higher quality health insurance plans. In one example, a growing union representing approximately 18,000 low-wage, often transitory, workers was able to use this shared understanding of insurance products to bargain a health plan equal to the silver plan, the mid-level plan offered by the state.</p>
<p>Although the Connector is closed to nonemployer groups, it has been beneficial to individuals in the distressed economy. The construction industry has been especially affected by the recession. One trades union that is self-insured and uses a national insurer has been steering unemployed and underemployed union members to access state-subsidized Connector insurance as individuals, offering assistance with paperwork and navigating the system. As part of a community benefits initiative, another union partnered with Boston nonprofit groups to help nonunion individuals understand and access the Connector.</p>

<title>Rising Costs, No Relief</title>
<p>Time and again we heard from interviewees in all workforce sectors that their biggest issues are the escalating costs of health insurance coupled with the decreasing quality of the plans. One veteran bargainer echoed a point made by many: “Everyone is facing these double digit increases and that is where the point of contention is [in negotiations].” There was recognition that some employers are genuinely struggling with this issue. A leader from a union representing close to 9,000 public workers stated,<disp-quote>
<p>For the last ten years you have had unsustainable double digit increases in premiums that employers and employees are facing; health care, as a result, has been the major sticking point in just about any negotiation—public or private—before and after Romneycare.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While health care inflation is a national problem, it is particularly acute in Massachusetts, due largely to the concentration of academic medical centers and high-care usage in high-cost settings; respondents contended that inflation was a trend well before the reform. In 2011, the average premium for family health insurance coverage was $16,953, which is 12.9 percent higher than the average cost nationally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1095796012471309">3</xref></sup> According to union leaders, employers have been steadily shifting plan costs onto employees, which is supported by data collected by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation. From 2001 to 2009, the employer share of health insurance premiums for individuals in Massachusetts decreased from 82 percent to 72 percent whereas the median premium increased 76.1 percent, rising from $251 to $442.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1095796012471309">4</xref></sup> New co-payments are being introduced and existing co-payments and deductibles are being increased.</p>
<p>One interviewee mentioned a recently completed municipal workforce contract where insurance co-pays went from $5 to $15, and the employees’ premium percentage increased, adding, “The mayor, a Democrat, is thrilled. He is saving the city, but he’s not saving [money]. He’s cost shifting.”</p>
<p>The architects of Massachusetts reform concentrated on access expansion, choosing to punt the complex task of curbing inflationary growth down the field. Some respondents were disappointed: “There were hopes with reform around cost containment but they haven’t come to pass.” A few negotiators expressed cautious optimism for the 350-page health care cost-control legislation passed in the state in July 2012, though one interviewee noted that it may be a “long time, if ever, when workers will see the savings.”</p>

<sec id="section4-1095796012471309">
<title>“Swiss Cheese” Plans</title>
<p>As health insurance costs increase, respondents reported that the quality of their health plans has been decreasing. As one said, plans begin to look like “Swiss cheese” as employers seek to curtail insurance costs by limiting plan benefits. As the president of a local trades union summed up,<disp-quote>
<p>Since the Massachusetts law, there has been no change to the economic landscape in health insurance negotiations at all—can’t say if it has gotten worse because the last fifteen years have been bad—you sacrifice wages to maintain health insurance. If you take less wages it affects health insurance and pensions down the road—big issue for members. Just trying to hang on to what you have and hope you don’t get screwed anymore.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To address this health care race to the bottom, Massachusetts reform set a minimum floor for insurance benefits that plans must meet to be sold in the state, referred to as “minimum creditable coverage.” One union, representing 18,000 low-wage private sector workers, has a Taft-Hartley fund but has not been able to persuade an employer of 2,000 of its members to join the fund. The minimum creditable coverage standards helped this union reject poor quality plans and win improvements to the existing health plans, such as no annual caps on medical benefits, something the bargainer did not feel it could have won without the state regulation. However, these standards have not prevented the eroding of higher quality plans that some unions had negotiated before reform.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>As health insurance costs increase [in Massachusetts], respondents reported that the quality of their health plans has been decreasing.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Many union leaders spoke of restrictions on the choice of providers by the new widespread use of “tiered plans” or “tiered networks,” which determine plan costs based on the provider. Multiple respondents said these and “limited network” plans, which restrict employees to specific locations to obtain care, are increasingly becoming the norm; a 2010 amendment to the Massachusetts health care law requires insurers to offer tiered plans with premiums at least 12 percent below their standard plans. Tiered plans now comprise approximately 15 percent of the Massachusetts health insurance market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1095796012471309">5</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-1095796012471309">
<title>Part-Time Workforce</title>
<p>When it comes to part-time workers, the Massachusetts’ law is neither straightforward nor generous. It requires employers with eleven or more full-time equivalents<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1095796012471309">6</xref></sup> to make a “fair and reasonable” contribution toward their workers’ premiums and, at minimum, offer a Section 125 plan (also known as a “cafeteria plan”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1095796012471309">7</xref></sup> Although the calculation of “full-time equivalents” includes hours worked by part-time employees, employers are not required to make a fair and reasonable contribution toward part-time workers’ premiums.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1095796012471309">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, part-time workers (defined as less than 64 hours per month), wait staff, and temporary employees may be excluded from the Section 125 plan without risk of penalty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1095796012471309">9</xref></sup> Federal reform does not require employers to offer affordable health insurance to part-time employees,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1095796012471309">10</xref></sup> with part-time work defined as an average of less than thirty hours per week.</p>
<p>A negotiator for a service workers union with a large number of part-time workers explained how not having provisions for part-timers hurts them. The contract covers 14,000 members, most of whom are part-time working twenty-eight hours or less per week, only a quarter of whom get insurance through the Taft-Hartley plan. With no solution emanating from reform, the union hopes to expand coverage by proposing lowering full-time hours required to twenty-five or more per week when it gets to the bargaining table.</p>
<p>There was some concern that employers would reclassify unions’ full-time workforce into a part-time one to side-step the mandate. However, the union leaders we talked with did not feel this had happened. One noted that employers continued to subcontract work or reduce hours to avoid providing health insurance. While the union thought this practice predated health care reform, reform exacerbated the issue by mandating that individuals maintain insurance coverage but minimizing employers’ responsibilities to provide coverage.</p>

<sec id="section6-1095796012471309">
<title>Key Distinctions between Massachusetts and Federal Reform</title>
<p>A crucial difference between the ACA and Massachusetts reform is the expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid expansion has been critical to coverage expansion in Massachusetts—41 percent of postreform-insured individuals are new Medicaid enrollees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1095796012471309">11</xref></sup> However, in June 2012, the Supreme Court struck down the ACA’s directive that required states to expand Medicaid, which will allow states to opt out of Medicaid expansion fully or partially.</p>
<p>Access to subsidized insurance plans will expand under the ACA, but some subsidies will be less generous than in Massachusetts. A larger group of workers may be able to access subsidies through federal health care reform than what has been provided by Massachusetts health care reform. If the employer does not offer health insurance, workers earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level may qualify for subsidies in the ACA, while workers must earn less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level to qualify in Massachusetts. However, as the subsidies provided by the ACA may not be as large as those provided in Massachusetts, health insurance may be less affordable for qualifying individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1095796012471309">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>As the subsidies provided by the ACA may not be as large as those provided in Massachusetts, health insurance may be less affordable for qualifying individuals.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The controversy over the availability of subsidies in states with the federal-government-run exchanges will also affect health insurance access for low-wage workers. According to various reports, approximately one-third to one-half of states are refusing or failing to establish an exchange by the 2014 deadline. In those states, exchanges will be run by the federal government. The Obama administration has issued a rule allowing for tax credits for insurance purchased in either a state or federal exchange. Critics are arguing that the law only allows subsidies for state-run exchanges and, with the cost of a subsidy averaging more than $6,000 a year per person, it is expected that this debate will continue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1095796012471309">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also the possibility of large groups eventually having access to health plans offered by state exchanges under the ACA. The Massachusetts’ Connector is only available to small employers and eligible individuals. The option for large employers to enter exchanges may open up additional health insurance options for union negotiators.</p>
<p>Interviews revealed that health care reform in Massachusetts mainly affected one segment of the unionized workforce: unions with large concentrations of part-time workers and those representing full-time low-wage workers for small employers. By contrast, it did not bring about increased opportunities for unions that represented higher-wage workers, workers employed by large employers, or unions that have Taft-Hartley insurance plans,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1095796012471309">14</xref></sup> most of whom had benefit-rich insurance plans already.</p>
<p>Although they recognized health care reform as a positive achievement, some union leaders confided that their members are frustrated by the lack of improvement reform has had on their lives, particularly by the lack of cost-control measures. Overall, union leaders expressed a feeling that little had changed significantly. “There were hopes and fear going into bargaining,” said a negotiator from a health care union representing more than 23,000 members, “but neither was realized. More same old, same old at the table.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Health care reform in Massachusetts mainly affected unions with large concentrations of part-time workers and those representing full-time low-wage workers for small employers.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The ACA may affect contract negotiations across the country similarly to Massachusetts: unions representing low-wage workers with few health insurance options may see opportunities to access more affordable health insurance for their members. Female workers may be particularly likely to benefit as they are often employed in these sectors. Unions representing higher-wage workers and workers at large employers will continue to struggle with increasing health insurance cost shifting and decreasing quality of health insurance plans with little relief, at least any time soon, expected from the ACA.</p>
<p>Rising health care costs, declining economics, and sustained assaults by antiunion forces have created a perfect storm that is undoing what decades of struggle have achieved for working people in the United States. Although the ACA is a critical step to providing an opportunity for the rest of the country to experience what organized workers have, it is clear there is still a long way to go before affordable, quality, and equitable access to health care is achieved.</p>

<p>Taft-Hartley plans in Massachusetts reported no impact from Massachusetts health care reform due to these plans being exempted from mandates. The Affordable Care Act’s tax on “Cadillac” plans, set to begin in 2018, will affect Taft-Hartley plans along with many employer-sponsored plans. Union leaders in Massachusetts expressed concern that these additional costs will be passed onto members, promising to be a contentious issue in future negotiations.</p></fn>
