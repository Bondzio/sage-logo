<abstract>
<p>This article seeks to explain the determinants of public entrepreneurship (PE) in two different organizational forms: the local government administration (LGA) and the local government corporation (LGC). Determinants belonging to external environment, managerial characteristics, strategy, and internal environment are considered and hypotheses are presented for each theme. These are tested on data from Swedish LGAs and LGCs in the sectors of waste management and water and sewerage. The analysis indicates that PE can be stimulated in both LGAs and LGCs, but also restrained, at least in LGAs. Furthermore, LGCs appear to have a wider set of PE-determinants than LGAs.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship—the discovery and exploitation of new opportunities—has long been praised as vital for organizations in their struggle to establish and maintain competitive advantage. Entrepreneurship has commonly been studied in a private sector context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12443073">Brush, Manolova, and Edelman 2008</xref>) which, inevitably, has led to a bias in the literature toward private sector organizational forms. Lately, entrepreneurship has emerged in the public sector where, apart from stimulating efficiency and creativity, it has been advocated as a means for public organizations to be transformed into more flexible units that serve their constituencies and taxpayers more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12443073">Diefenbach 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12443073">Mack, Green, and Vedlitz 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12443073">Sadler 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160323X12443073">Zampetakis and Moustakis 2007</xref>). Entrepreneurship, including the dimensions of risk taking, proactiveness, and product innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12443073">Miller 1983</xref>) is thus considered as vital also for the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12443073">Diefenbach 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on public entrepreneurship (PE) tend to treat public sector organizations as homogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X12443073">Kearney, Hisrich, and Roche 2008</xref>). However, this neglects the effect that market-oriented reforms and the New Public Management (NPM) spirit has brought with it, namely, the emphasis on implementing different organizational forms in the public sector, particularly in local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12443073">Grossi and Reichard 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12443073">Kickert 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X12443073">Mattisson, Paulsson, and Tagesson 2003</xref>; Reichard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X12443073">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X12443073">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12443073">2008</xref>). One such form which has increased in use throughout Europe is the limited corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12443073">Argento et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12443073">Collin and Tagesson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12443073">Reichard 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X12443073">Sörensen 2007</xref>). This organizational form is used in the public sector to serve the public, but its organizational structure and governance resemble those of organizations in the private sector and represent one of many hybrid organizational forms that combine characteristics from both public and private sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X12443073">Lan and Rainey 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160323X12443073">Thynne 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160323X12443073">Wettenhall 2001</xref>). By a distinction based on formal characteristics such as property rights and informal characteristics such as values and norms, a separation between organizational forms is possible. This separation enables more specific predictions about determinants for PE in different public organizational forms to be made, something that has received only limited research attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the study reported in this article was to develop and test theoretically deduced hypotheses about determinants of PE, through a distinction of public organizational forms. The study’s main contributions were directed toward PE research by proposing and testing a number of PE-determinants in different organizational forms, hence sharpening our understanding of PE. Its practical relevance is related to the reforms that face public sector entities where higher expectations concerning efficiency and effectiveness are stressed. The identification of PE-determinants could guide these entities in their efforts to achieve higher levels of stakeholder fulfillment.</p>

<title>Two Organizational Forms at the Local Government Level</title>
<p>This article distinguishes between two types of public organizational forms at the local government level: the <italic>local government administration (LGA</italic>) and the <italic>local government corporation (LGC)</italic> that operate in the waste management, and water and sewerage sectors. In a Swedish context, the municipality is the responsible authority for these services, and its operations are generally run under a LGA or a LGC. Both LGAs and LGCs are thus constructed for public purposes. A major difference concerns the distinct entity status of the LGC: that public as well as private sector laws regulate its operations; that an image of a business and economic orientation dominates over social welfare orientation; that the influence of politicians is limited, and that managerial autonomy as well as managerial responsibility is larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X12443073">Koppel 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160323X12443073">Thynne 1994</xref>). Even though LGAs to different degrees may be self-supporting, they can never be that strictly separated from the public apparatus and achieve the same autonomy that is inherent in the organizational form of the LGC. This implies that its governance structure includes high political involvement and hierarchical levels. Moreover, expectations, goals, and objectives are observed to be less distinct and harder to evaluate in core public sector organizational forms (here referring to LGAs), when contrasted with the more distinct economic orientation in hybrid organizational forms (here referring to LGCs) that could be easier to evaluate (e.g., Bilodeau, Laurin, and Vining 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12443073">Fottler 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12443073">Morris and Jones 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12443073">Rainey, Backoff, and Levine 1976</xref>).</p>

<title>Entrepreneurship at the Organizational Level</title>
<p>PE at the organizational level has been considered through the dimensions of risk taking, proactiveness, and product innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12443073">Diefenbach 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>), and the ability to identify and act on opportunities has been emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12443073">Boyett 1997</xref>). A part of PE research has stressed the importance of the outcome of PE, emphasized as creating value for users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12443073">Morris and Jones 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X12443073">Osborne and Gaebler 1992</xref>). This article follows the widely acknowledged definition offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12443073">Miller (1983</xref>), identifying risk taking, proactiveness, and product innovation as important entrepreneurial dimensions. Also, an entrepreneurial organization must have the capacity to interpret new demands and to act upon this interpretation by making new combinations of resources within the organization, creating new products and services without being bound by the firm’s existing strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12443073">Collin and Smith 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12443073">Covin and Slevin 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12443073">Lumpkin and Dess 1996</xref>). Entrepreneurship at the organizational level is further stressed to be a propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12443073">Morris and Jones 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X12443073">Smith 2007</xref>), which implies that at this level it may vary with the influence of different determinants.</p>
<p>Determinants of entrepreneurship at the organizational level are presented in two frequently cited conceptual models by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12443073">Guth and Ginsberg (1990</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12443073">Covin and Slevin (1991</xref>). The models differ in the way they structure entrepreneurial determinants, but they emphasize in a similar way the influence that organizations encounter from the external environment, the internal environment, organizational strategy and structure, as well as performance. Based on these models, the present study highlights four PE-determinants: external environment, managerial characteristics, strategy, and internal environment. The idea is that organizational form frames and defines the determinants, which in turn influence PE.</p>

<title>Determinants of Public Entrepreneurship at the Local Government Level</title>
<p>In this article, we have argued for heterogeneity among public sector organizational entities. Therefore, before consideration of the various determinants that can trigger PE, an initial general hypothesis will be proposed regarding the specific type of organizational form and its overall PE-propensity. First, there is a general difference in the objectives of the two forms: an economic orientation in the LGC versus a democratic social welfare orientation in the LGA. Also, the LGC aims at “being its own entity” whereas the LGA is part of a larger municipality. Accordingly, the first hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) proposes that PE-propensity is higher in the LGC compared to the LGA. It is thereby suggested that PE can exist in both organizational forms, but regardless of any PE-determinant, the LGC would be more proactive, more prone to take risks, and more innovative, compared to the LGA. Thus, we formulate the following hypothesis:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> The PE propensity will be higher in the LGC compared to the LGA.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The external environment has been shown to be associated with entrepreneurship at the organizational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12443073">Covin and Slevin 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12443073">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12443073">Guth and Ginsberg 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12443073">Lumpkin and Dess 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>), but not with traditional public entities mainly because they operate in a predictable and limited market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>). To some extent, this is correct, because the majority of the sector market is a monopoly. But some public services have been deregulated. A Swedish example is the collection of industrial waste, which has led to an emerging private market and new business opportunities. The LGCs’ economic orientation could imply that they are more interested than LGAs in widening their businesses to serve new customers outside the public services. As they constitute their own entity, with limited political influence, one could also expect that they may act on these market opportunities. The underlying objective of the LGA—to provide equal public services—does not directly lead to an interest in acting on market opportunities because such ventures lie outside the public purpose. Instead, they are interested in maintaining good relations with politicians, the implication being that, given this closer control, the LGA is restrained from this kind of deviation from the goal.</p>
<p>Generally, then, the external environmental is considered to stimulate entrepreneurship at the organizational level. It is proposed, accordingly, that this is the case for the LGC, which has a business orientation and is its own entity with less political influence. The LGA on the contrary appears to be less influenced by market opportunities and more influenced by politicians’ agendas, leading to the proposition that, in the LGA, the environment has no influence on PE. Thus, we formulate the following hypotheses (Hypotheses 2a and 2b):<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2a:</italic> The external environment related to dynamism, hostility, and heterogeneity is not associated with PE in the LGA.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2b:</italic> The external environment related to dynamism, hostility, and heterogeneity is positively associated with PE in the LGC.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Two managerial characteristics are considered in this article: autonomy and working experience. <italic>Autonomy</italic> has been argued to be a key ingredient of PE because it implies that actions can be taken free of stifling organizational constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12443073">Boyett 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12443073">Forster, Graham, and Wanna 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12443073">Ramamurti 1986</xref>). Generally, it is argued that one force that restrains PE is limited managerial autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12443073">Ramamurti 1986</xref>). A reason for this is that the public sector is associated with limited delegation of the right to make decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12443073">Morris and Jones 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160323X12443073">Vigoda-Gadot et al. 2005</xref>), a limitation that might be more present in LGAs than in LGCs. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12443073">Grossi and Reichard (2008</xref>, 611) argue “that managers of the municipal corporations use their autonomy to initiate new services and open new markets”; in summary, to act in an entrepreneurial way. As managers are held to be of great importance for PE activities (Morris and Jones 1999), a wider managerial autonomy could have a stimulating influence on PE in the LGC. Managerial autonomy, however, is not identified as present in LGAs, and therefore no association between managerial autonomy and PE in the LGA is expected.</p>
<p>Another strain of input from private sector organizations that could be of relevance in a discussion on PE is <italic>managerial working experience</italic>. New public management has been advocated in the public sector as a tool for implementing private sector business techniques into the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12443073">London 2002</xref>) with the aim of increasing efficiency. One way of stimulating a business approach would be to employ managers who had prior working experience from the private sector. The public sector would thereby get some of the expected benefits from the private sector through a manager with this prior experience. This leads to the following hypotheses (Hypotheses 3a and 3b; Hypotheses 4a and 4b):<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3a:</italic> Managerial autonomy is not associated with PE in the LGA.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3b:</italic> Managerial autonomy is positively associated with PE in the LGC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4a:</italic> Managerial working experience from the private sector is positively associated with PE in the LGA.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4b:</italic> Managerial working experience from the private sector is positively associated with PE in the LGC.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Strategy has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12443073">Covin and Slevin (1991</xref>) as an important determinant for entrepreneurship, and it is an important mechanism through which municipal organizations are governed and controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12443073">Collin and Tagesson 2010</xref>). Yet, in the context of PE, strategy has received little attention. This article applies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12443073">Miles and Snow’s (1978)</xref> approach with a strategic typology including four types: <italic>prospector</italic>, <italic>defender</italic>, <italic>analyzer</italic>, and <italic>reactor</italic>. The prospector appears as the strategic type with the most stimulating influence on PE as it refers to a flexible structure able to adjust to change. The defender is characterized as focusing on engineering tasks and improving efficiency. The analyzer emphasizes stability as well as flexibility and is thus a combination of the prospector and defender types where existing operations are more controlled than new projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12443073">Parnell and Wright 1993</xref>). Whether the reactor has any influence on PE is hard to predict because the strategy is likely to be short-term oriented.</p>
<p>Relating the strategic types to the two organizational forms makes the prospector and its market orientation less likely in LGAs but more likely in LGCs; however, it cannot be excluded from being also present in LGAs. The defender strategy could be an LGC strategy as it refers to tight control over operations, but still with a focus on efficiency—especially in the production areas. LGAs, as part of larger formal structures which should be able to include a variety of activities—all in line with the wishes of politicians—emphasize instead the analyzer type. This implies that the organizational forms, to different extents, might apply different strategies; however, regardless of organizational form, the same relation between strategic type and PE is proposed. Thus, we formulate the following hypotheses (Hypotheses 5a and 5b):<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5a:</italic> In the LGA, the prospector strategy will have the most stimulating influence on PE, followed by the defender strategy, the analyzer strategy, and the reactor strategy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 5b:</italic> In the LGC, the prospector strategy will have the most stimulating influence on PE, followed by the defender strategy, the analyzer strategy, and the reactor strategy.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The internal environment has been shown to be associated with entrepreneurship at the organizational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12443073">Covin and Slevin 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12443073">Cornwall and Periman 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12443073">Guth and Ginsberg 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X12443073">Morris and Trotter 1990</xref>), but it has received little or no attention in PE research. This article highlights the internal environment through the dimensions of <italic>organizational culture</italic> and <italic>public service objective.</italic>
</p>
<p>Emphasizing the dimensions of organizational culture, here in terms of teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12443073">Glaser, Zamanou, and Hacker 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12443073">Al-Yahya 2009</xref>), would suggest an internal environment that in a coherent way helps the organization to work toward its objectives. Whether or not this stimulates PE depends on the organizational form at hand and its overall objectives. It has been argued that the LGC has an economic orientation, including a business mind-set where goals are clearly stated. As such, it is suggested, a strong culture of teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement would have a positive influence on PE in the LGC since it is likely that its goal includes features of development and innovation. On the other hand, the LGA has social welfare and democratic action as its overall objectives. This would imply that a culture emphasizing teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement would be of secondary importance. Also, within a strong organizational culture, it could be argued that actions are not directed toward PE stimulation, but instead toward providing services and attention to citizens’ points of view. This leads us to suggest a negative association with PE, that is, a less strong culture of teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement would stimulate employees to identify and act on opportunities.</p>
<p>Public service objective is an important part of public sector organizations as it sets the ethos of the organization, and emphasizes the public orientation of social welfare and equal service provision. This would imply that the focus is more on providing existing services of good quality than of striving to find new ways of providing existing services or developing existing services, and thus entrepreneurship. This, however, does not imply that entrepreneurship is lacking in the public sector, rather that it might not be as strongly stressed as in the private sector, especially not in the organization that has to implement the agenda of politicians. The public service objective could thus be given more prominence in the LGA than in the LGC. An internal environment stressing the public service objective could however still imply that resources are used for developing these services. This would especially be the case in the economic-oriented LGC where keeping the public service objective in sight could be needed in its otherwise economic orientation. The internal environment in the LGA would, together with its higher involvement in the municipal structure and higher political involvement lead to less focus on PE activities and more on implementation of political decisions. Thus, we formulate the following hypotheses (Hypotheses 6a and 6b; Hypotheses 7a and 7b):<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 6a:</italic> Organizational culture related to teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement is negatively associated with PE in the LGA.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The empirical objects of this research were local government organizations in all 290 Swedish municipalities. With the aim of investigating sectors that included LGAs as well as LGCs, two sectors were selected; the waste management sector and the water and sewerage sector. The services they provide are usually financed by charges to users, and it is the municipal council that decides on the charges. The formal organizational structure of the services differs with municipality, and a screening of all 290 Swedish municipalities resulted in an available population of 312 organizations. Of these, 231 were LGAs and 81 LGCs. Data were collected using a questionnaire which was e-mailed to the person responsible for waste management and water and sewerage in each municipality. 113 usable questionnaires were returned (response rate of 36 percent). The response rate for LGCs was higher than for LGAs (44 percent compared to 33 percent), and the waste sector had a slightly higher response rate than the water sector (37 percent compared to 30 percent).</p>
<p>A nonresponse analysis showed no major bias among respondents and nonrespondents with regard to municipal classification based on structural parameters such as population, commuting patterns, and economic structure. A small bias was detected in the parameter of costs for waste, water and sewerage services for a similar type of house in Sweden’s 290 municipalities, indicating that, concerning the waste management sector and organizational form, the responding LGAs had lower costs compared to nonresponding LGAs.</p>

<title>Variables and Measures</title>
<p>Many variables were captured by a set of scale questions. To measure the reliability of these statements, Cronbach’s α was applied, and the lower agreed limit set to .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X12443073">Hair et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>PE was conceptualized through the three measures introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X12443073">Miller (1983</xref>) and later used by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160323X12443073">Zahra (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160323X12443073">1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12443073">Gabrielsson (2007</xref>); they were product innovation, proactiveness, and risk taking, each measure including 4 items. Respondents were asked to state, on a 7-point scale, whether they agreed or disagreed with the various statements. All three measures scored high α values: risk taking, LGA = .70 and LGC = 77.0; product innovation, LGA = 85.9 and LGC = 88.5; proactiveness, LGA = 81.9 and LGC = 89.5. The total α value of all 12 items was 92.1 for the LGA and 92.7 for the LGC. Due to the high α values, the dependent PE-variable was measured on a scale consisting of the mean of the 12 items.</p>
<p>
<italic>External environment</italic> was described by measures of heterogeneity (3 items), dynamism (3 items), and homogeneity (5 items), as used, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160323X12443073">Zahra (1991</xref>); these were measured on a 7-point scale. The three measures gave separately acceptable α values: heterogeneity, LGA = 72.6 and LGC = 61.0; hostility, LGA = 62.0 and LGC = 74.7; and dynamism, LGA = 73.6 and LGC = 70.5. The total α value on all 11 items was 82.6 for the LGA and 86.4 for the LGC. Environmental challenge was measured on a scale consisting of the mean of the 11 items.</p>
<p>
<italic>Managerial autonomy</italic> was measured by the statement “The CEO/LGA manager has a large freedom to act” where the respondents were asked to agree or disagree on a 7-point scale. Managerial working experience from the private sector was measured as a continuous variable, including number of years that the manager had worked in the private sector.</p>
<p>The <italic>strategy</italic> measure was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12443073">Miles and Snow’s (1978)</xref> typology and included items regarding (a) characteristics of products/services, (b) image at the marketplace, (c) most important goal, (d) managerial skills, and (e) organizational structure. Each item contained four responses, one for each possible strategy. The codification was inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12443073">Parnell and Wright (1993</xref>), where an organization is classified as pursuing the strategy reflected by the highest number of its responses. When there was a tie between reactor and other strategies, the organization was classified as a reactor. When there was a tie among nonreactor strategies, the organization was classified as an analyzer. Four dummy variables were created, with each variable representing one of the four strategic types.</p>
<p>The measure of <italic>organizational culture</italic> was based on research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12443073">Glaser, Zamanou, and Hacker (1987</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12443073">Al-Yahya (2009</xref>). The measure of involvement and teamwork included 3 items, and the measure of managerial engagement included 4 items. All measures were based on statements and measured on a 7-point scale. The involvement measure had an α value of 78.8 for the LGA and 70.0 for the LGC. As for the teamwork measure, only 2 items were used for the LGA due to a low α value; the α for the 2 items was 69.3. For the LGC, the α value for the 3 items measuring teamwork was 66.4. α values for the measure of managerial engagement were 65.0 for the LGA and 65.4 for the LGC. The total α value on these items was 81.7 for the LGA and 80.5 for the LGC. Organizational culture was measured on a scale and represented by one variable consisting of the mean of the items related to teamwork, involvement, and managerial engagement.</p>
<p>
<italic>Public service objective</italic> was measured with a statement asking the respondent to mark the extent to which the municipal mission is emphasized on a 7-point scale.</p>
<p>Two control variables were included; size and board/committee competence. The control of <italic>size</italic> was included as larger organizations have more resources available for entrepreneurial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X12443073">Smith 2007</xref>). Size was measured by number of employees. The control of <italic>board/committee competence</italic> was included to control for political versus other competences in the board. The governing body of local government organizations tends to be comprised of politicians. With such a composition, one could assume that directors tend to be appointed less due to industry skills, and more to control the political agenda. A focus on the political competence could imply that they have less interest in supporting the development of operations of the organization, and more interest in the political agenda. Board/committee competence was measured through asking the respondent to state the number of ordinary board members primarily appointed because of their political competence: 1 represented a board where all directors were appointed because of their political competence, and 0 represented a board where not all directors were appointed because of their political competence.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 was tested with an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test, and Hypotheses 2 through 7 with multiple regressions. On a 7-point scale, the mean of the PE-variable was 2.06 for the LGA and 2.67 for the LGC. Despite these rather low means, a <italic>t</italic> test showed significant differences concerning PE in the two organizational forms where the LGC had a significantly higher mean value compared to the LGA. The <italic>t</italic> value was 2.80 and the significance level was .007. Thus, the test shows that LGCs have higher propensities for PE compared to LGAs, and there is support for Hypothesis 1.</p>
<p>This result had implications for subsequent analyses as it showed that organizational form matters when it comes to PE. In order to capture these differences, separate regression analyses were conducted for LGAs and LGCs. An alternative would have been to include the organizational form as a dummy variable in one regression. This would, however, imply that organizational form would just be one of many determinants, which is not the intention here. Because of missing cases on some of the variables, the analyses include seventy-four LGAs and thirty-four LGCs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X12443073">1</xref></sup> Due to problems of multicollinearity, two models are presented for each organizational form.</p>
<p>Concerning the LGA, two separate multiple regression models each include seven independent variables and they vary on excluding/including organizational culture and public service objective (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X12443073">Table 1</xref>). The analyzer strategy variable was selected for the report as this is the only strategy variable that has a positive significant value. The two reported models are significant and have explanatory power of 45 percent (model 1) and 43 percent (model 2). The independent variables are significant, regardless of model.</p>

<p>Concerning the LGC, model 1 includes six independent variables, and model 2 includes seven independent variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X12443073">Table 2</xref>). They vary on excluding/including organizational culture, managerial experience, and managerial autonomy. The prospector strategy is selected for inclusion in the reported models as this strategic type theoretically was argued to have the strongest positive influence on PE. It is important to observe that when the different strategy variables have been included/excluded, the other independent variables show more or less the same power and significance. Both reported models are significant, and have explanatory power of 66 percent versus 68 percent. The independent variables are significant regardless of model.</p>

<p>In addition to the reported variables, the models have been controlled for two more aspects. One is sector belongingness. The other is a proxy for performance effects and includes user charges for waste, water and sewerage services which differ due to municipality. These variables indicate however no significances. For all models, the variance inflation factor values, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of the standardized residuals, and Mahalanobis distance value and the Cook’s distance value for detecting outliers have been considered, reported, and accepted as they are within suggested limits (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160323X12443073">Tabachnick and Fidell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12443073">Pallant 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12443073">Djurfeldt, Larsson, and Stjärnhagen 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The external environment was hypothesized to stimulate PE in LGCs but not in LGAs. However, the external environment was found to be an important PE-determinant in both organizational forms, which supports prior PE research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>). This suggests that also the LGA has an external orientation and is sensitive for external pressure. One explanation for this could be due to the choice of sectors, where they not only face monopoly markets, but where both LGAs and LGCs may operate in a competitive market, although to a limited extent. This could lead to a stronger customer orientation and recognition of competitors. But also without these financial similarities, local government agencies could recognize each other and start voluntary benchmarking efforts.</p>
<p>The theory argues that the LGC, compared to the LGA, has higher levels of managerial autonomy. With regard to the mean, the data support this argument. One difference, however, is that managerial autonomy is significant in the PE-models for LGCs but shows no significance in the PE-models for LGAs. So, even if both organizational forms experience managerial autonomy, it is only LGCs that appear to use it for PE-stimulation.</p>
<p>In addition to higher levels of LGC managerial autonomy, LGC managers also have more private sector working experience. This working experience is not significant in the PE-models for LGCs, but it is positively significant in the PE-models for LGAs. This would imply that from a managerial point of view, PE in LGCs is stimulated through a structural element which gives the manager freedom to act, that is, autonomy (regardless of prior working experience), whereas PE in LGAs is stimulated when the recruitment process is oriented toward a sector that commonly is more associated with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>None of the strategic types are significant in the PE-models for the LGCs. Thus, the study fails to detect any influence of strategy in the PE-models concerning LGCs. This could be due to failure in measurement, or that other measures than strategic typologies should be used to capture the strategy. The focus here is a broad categorization of organizations’ strategic behavior.</p>
<p>The PE-models for the LGA indicate relevance for strategy, partly in the hypothesized way. The strategic type hypothesized to have the strongest PE-influence, that is, the prospector, is only to a very limited amount present among LGAs. The analyzer is the most common strategic type and also the one with a significant positive influence in the PE-models. Theoretically, the analyzers are complex and change focus due to the nature of the market; in stable markets, they emphasize production and efficiency, and in more turbulent environments they follow and imitate competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12443073">Miles and Snow 1978</xref>). With a PE focus, mainly the emphasis on efficiency would include a possible element for PE-stimulation. As for the negative significance with the reactor strategy, one could interpret that strategy is important. The reactor is short-term oriented and even defined as a lack of strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12443073">Parnell and Wright 1993</xref>) implying that if not having a well-defined strategy, resources could be oriented toward more short-term projects, leaving no space for PE-stimulation.</p>
<p>Internal environment was hypothesized to influence in different ways depending on organizational forms, which also is supported. The analysis shows that in the PE-model for LGCs, the variables of organizational culture and public service objective behave in the hypothesized way. Also, an emphasis on public service objective has a positive influence in the PE-model. This is an interesting finding as it can be interpreted that LGCs are not trying to “hide” as private sector organizations, but express a focus on public orientation. Yet, organizational culture and public service objective do not correlate with each other, so they appear to catch different phenomena. Hence, in order to create LGC-cultures able to stimulate PE, all four dimensions of the internal environment should be stressed.</p>
<p>For the LGA, the variables of internal environment act differently because both variables show a negative influence in the PE-models, which also was hypothesized. An explanation for these results could be that in LGAs, a culture emphasizing the objective of public service objective is strong, and may be even superior to the other cultural dimensions. This reasoning is inspired by the stronger correlation that is present between PE and public service objective, compared to PE and organizational culture. If the internal environment stresses the fulfillment of the public service objective, the dimensions of supervision, teamwork, and involvement will further strengthen this objective, leaving no interest in pursuing entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The control variable of size is significant in the PE-models for LGCs but not for LGAs; this most likely depends on the entity of the LGC, where the benefits of having more resources could be used for PE activities, but where a larger LGA organization could imply a longer decision-making process, thus not stimulating PE. The board/committee competence variable is significant in the PE-models for LGCs, but not for LGAs. In both organizational forms, the majority of the boards/committees are composed of one or many directors with other main competences than political. Still, it is only in the LGCs that this has a positive influence in the PE-models.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160323X12443073">Table 3</xref> summarizes the outcome of the tests. From the analysis, it is concluded that PE in the LGA subsists if stimulated through different instruments, here highlighted as the dimensions of strategy and recruitment, whereas PE in the LGC subsists as long as it is structured in a corporate form allowing the manager to act and create an internal environment of engagement and involvement, and where the public service objective directs the development. Thus, the analysis indicates that PE can be stimulated in both LGAs and LGCs, but also restrained, at least in LGAs. Furthermore, LGCs appear to have a wider set of PE-determinants than LGAs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article contributes to research on public sector entrepreneurship. The article takes an organizational perspective on PE, where it is argued that PE can be influenced by a diverse set of aspects, both outside and inside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12443073">Caruana, Ewing, and Ramaseshan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12443073">Sadler 2000</xref>; Smith 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160323X12443073">Zampetakis and Moustakis 2007</xref>). To this rather new topic, this article gives support to more stimulating factors than what has been empirically found before, and it also shows that some determinants have a restraining influence on PE. Moreover, the article is more exact in its predictions as it acknowledges two distinct organizational forms at the local government level and finds support for making this distinction. This approach appears to be a relevant and worthwhile contribution toward future work, not only when the topic is PE, but in the overall study of public administration and governance.</p>
<p>The main practical implication concerns the result that entrepreneurship can be stimulated in either organizational form. But the ways in which it may be stimulated differ in kind. In the LGC, it is the organizational structure in terms of being a distinct entity that enables entrepreneurship, while in the LGA, entrepreneurship needs to be stimulated through different means. In this study, the recruitment process—especially with a focus on managers with specific working experience from the private sector—is emphasized as of importance for PE.</p>
<p>The empirical data that were tested in this study came from two distinct sectors: the waste management sector and the water and sewerage sector. These sectors are directed by specific regulations, one important being that the services are financed by fees, another being that the main part of the services are regulated by the principle of cost pricing which implies that services that are to be provided by the municipality may not be charged a higher fee than their costs, and finally, the services must comply with certain environmental regulations. Thus, in order to further strengthen the relevance of the model other industries should be given attention.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this study, the author would like to stress the relevance of entrepreneurship research in different organizational forms. While this study has only considered two types, there are many more types in both the private and the public sectors. Another suggestion for future research is to continue to detect factors that could influence PE, either in a positive or negative way. This study has acknowledged several, but there many more to examine—for example, the influence of the board of directors. It would also be of high interest to further develop the understanding of culture, especially in LGAs, in order to see what a culture with positive influence on PE would look like.</p>
