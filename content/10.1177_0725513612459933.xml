<p>If, as it sometimes seems to, political philosophy worked by slogans alone, then that of Enrique Dussel might best be represented by the twist he applies to the demands of the bourgeois revolution: ‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity’ becomes ‘Liberation, Alterity, Solidarity’. It is an attractive move, and must seem more so in Dussel’s Latin American context – one of opposition to US hegemony in the Americas and the ascendancy of the Porto Allegre and Bolivarian left(s), where these more strident abstractions retain their currency. It is all the more attractive in that the new slogan interprets or overlays rather than rejects the old, retaining much of its meaning while shifting from centre to periphery, from system to its outside: liberation is the demand for liberty from those who have none; alterity the foundation of a radical equality à la Badiou from the position of those outside any system of equal rights; solidarity the assertion of brotherhood with the excluded, even if this means outright opposition to their oppressors – all these topographies of inside and out having, of course, something of a geopolitical flavour.</p>
<p>It is something like this shift that structures <italic>Twenty Theses on Politics</italic>: ten theses that found or describe power and political institutions, followed by ten that stand outside of and critique them – a second half of the book that, in Dussel’s words, deconstructs the first. It is one of those books that, after the precedent of Kierkegaard’s <italic>Either/Or</italic>, ask to be read foremost through the device of their juxtaposition – one whose disjunction is, however, also a ‘both/and’ and a ‘yes, but’; and indeed one in which the author comes down firmly on one side rather than the other. I mention this structural aspect because Dussel himself insists on it; but the promise of (self-) deconstruction misleads if it would have us expect a somewhat flagellant Derrida – there is, sadly, no heady explosion of the conceptual or foundational into its histories, utterances and practices. In part, this is because Dussel’s style does not lend itself to such a project. He is, after all, a somewhat systematizing philosopher who hopes to discipline his material into numbered paragraphs and heavily elaborated diagrams, and the eleventh to twentieth theses continue all of this, seemingly adding to an overall synthesis begun with the first.</p>
<p>The other reason the juxtaposition doesn’t quite do its promised work is that the first half already contains a critique of the institutions it describes. This section most importantly elaborates on a distinction and relationship between two forms of power, <italic>potentia</italic> – something like an unrealized ability or capacity – and <italic>potestas</italic>, its actual, institutional exercise. Here, <italic>potentia</italic> always belongs to the people – it is a commonly held potential, a political analogue of the general will or intellect, and the ultimate source of all institutional power and legitimacy. Political leaders of whatever sort then ideally exercise a power that is willingly and consensually delegated by this people, leading by obeying those they lead. For Dussel, a split between <italic>potentia</italic> and <italic>potestas</italic> is original and inevitable – to ask that the people’s power be exercised directly is an anarchist fantasy that ignores the need for an organized division of labour, a planning and direction of effort, ideally with the interests of all in mind.</p>
<p>This split, then, allows for the theorizing of the danger, or indeed inevitability, of the misuse of <italic>potestas</italic>. It is as good an account of political corruption as any, and one which Dussel extends beyond the mere taking of bribes, developing an account of the fetishism of <italic>potestas</italic> that echoes that of the commodity: the mistake of institutional power – which ought to remain a faithful servant to its people – for an end in itself, for which the people then in turn become the servant and the object. Here, then, is the critique inherent in the first ten theses: the exercise of power is removed from its popular source. Removed, to be sure, necessarily and to varying degrees, and it is this that already seems to motivate some form of political struggle – struggle against fetishism and corruption.</p>
<p>The question is whether this struggle is identical to that presented in the book’s second half. There, following from the observation that no political system is perfect and that exclusion is inevitable, the struggle of the excluded is theorized. It is a struggle not for recognition by a system that remains otherwise fundamentally unchanged, but for the transformation of its foundations. This, cast in Gramscian terms, leads to talk of historical cycles and the progressive inclusion of the formerly other, always motivated not by mere self-interest but by the articulation of the latter with universal principles.</p>
<p>Two struggles then: one of <italic>potentia</italic> to reclaim its <italic>potestas</italic>; the other of a new <italic>potentia</italic> – a new or formerly excluded people, as it were – against the old. It is unclear to what degree Dussel wishes these struggles to be identified. After all, the imperfection of the system, its exclusions, might derive exactly from the distance of institutional power from its people, and the impossibility of full representation. It is the question that might either link or divide theories of exploitation and theories of exclusion. It is a question that Dussel doesn’t answer here – or, rather, he seems to offer different answers at different points. To be fair, the either/or it presents is by no means stark: there are mediations to be found between the two versions of politics and their privileged subjects. The army of reserve labour might offer an example from the Marxian tradition – the system of exploitation reaching outside itself to implicate those it doesn’t otherwise seem to touch. This is perhaps the real reason why Dussel’s montage falls flat: the distinctions it relies on, between imperial self and resistant other, inside and outside, centre and periphery – these are, as we could well have expected, not as clear as we might hope.</p>
<p>The book’s most interesting move does hint at a more complex dialectic. At the beginning of section two, we have a belated definition of the problematic category that section one took as a given: the people. And, to be sure, the people is identified with the excluded. Moreover, it only comes into being progressively through the articulation of various claims, as lacks become recognized as new rights and the subject of demands. Here Dussel is close to Laclau, his people close to an empty signifier, one always indeed in the position of the abject. Something comes of the book’s montage after all, even if Dussel doesn’t quite make it explicit: a people simultaneously at the foundation of political institutions, and – by definition – hammering at their gates. It is a paradox that <italic>Twenty Theses on Politics</italic> could make more of.</p>
<p>It is perhaps too brief, sitting atop Dussel’s enormous oeuvre as something of a sketch, a summary of the political end of his thinking – to which, indeed, it serves as a good introduction. It makes elegant and frequent reference to the particularities of Latin American and global politics and, alongside the consequent concerns with indigenous rights, difference and multiculturalism, it incorporates a set of practical demands including a living wage, neighbourhood councils, community media, and recallable delegates. If these diagnoses and prescriptions are somewhat familiar – certainly to anyone familiar with the anti-systemic left, even in the world’s metropoles – it can only make us wonder again how much weight Dussel’s insistence on a peripheral or external perspective can carry.</p>
