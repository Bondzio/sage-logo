<p><italic>Principles and Practice of Child Neurology in Infancy</italic> is an excellent, easy-to-read, reference regarding common neurologic problems that present from the neonatal period through the first year of life. The authors represent a variety of European institutions, in some cases from countries with more limited access to pediatric subspecialists. The perspectives offered and overall content of the book will therefore be useful in multiple settings around the world, including those with somewhat limited medical resources.</p>
<p>The text is divided into two main parts. The first section is dedicated to principles of neurologic care such as team approach, screening recommendations, and infant neurologic exam. This is followed by review of investigations and treatments commonly utilized in neurologic illness. The second main section, likely to be the more commonly referenced part of the book, describes specific neurologic conditions in this age group. Topics include encephalopathy, seizures, some metabolic and genetic conditions, febrile neurologic illness, paroxysmal disorders in infancy, macrocephaly and microcephaly, hypotonia, cerebral palsy, infantile movement disorders, and early developmental disorders. The topics encompass the vast majority of what a child neurologist can expect to see in infancy, though the detail provided on each individual topic varies.</p>
<p>The strengths of this book are clear. At the beginning of each chapter, key messages and common errors are pointed out, enabling quick review of a chapter’s contents. Within the second section of the book, several excellent tables are included, describing differential diagnoses or common causes for the primary symptom under discussion. In many cases, visual flowcharts of evaluation and/or treatment are also provided. The tables and flowcharts are valuable for easy reference. The chapters on evidence-based medicine, neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal seizures, and cerebral palsy seem particularly well written.</p>
<p>One disadvantage is the low level of detail that can be provided about individual disorders within some chapters on a primary symptom. For example, there are simply too many causes of early developmental impairment or hypotonia to give much guidance on investigation or management of individual etiologies. This leaves some of these chapters, though well-written summaries, less clinically applicable. Occasionally, the text described preferred treatments that differ from what might typically be offered at some institutions, based on available evidence (eg, certain infantile spasm and sedation medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073813482772">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073813482772">2</xref></sup>); the assertion that these are the preferred treatments needs to be taken with some caution. Also, the general section on drug treatments seemed to be biased in favor of vitamins and minerals, for which evidence of benefit in neurologic conditions is often questionable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073813482772">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This book would be recommended for child neurologists in training or early career stages, for child neurology nurses wanting a quick reference on problems in infancy, and for general pediatricians or other professionals who do not specialize in neurology but could be providing some aspects of care for patients with neurologic disorders in infancy. It is overall very well written and offers excellent figures and tables that can be utilized for diagnostic and treatment approaches in a variety of clinical settings.</p>
