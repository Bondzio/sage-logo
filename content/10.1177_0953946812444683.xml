<p>The ‘responsibility to protect’ (RtoP) concept has rapidly taken a prominent place in international debates about how to ensure the protection of civilians from mass atrocities in places such as Libya, the Congo, and Darfur. This article argues that RtoP has deep roots both in Scripture and also in Christian political thought of the last two millennia. In particular, it observes that, whereas twentieth-century arguments for ‘humanitarian intervention’ framed the protection of strangers and foreigners as a discretionary right, RtoP echoes Ambrose of Milan and others in framing such protection as a duty. It further suggests that the emphasis of RtoP on the responsibility to work with states and to help build their capacity to protect their civilians, rather than waiting until military intervention is necessary, holds the promise of advancing the Christian principle of assisting the vulnerable while, at least in some instances, avoiding thorny and divisive debates about the justice of war.</p>

<p>At the close of the twentieth century, the international community was confronted with a dual dilemma. On the one hand, how to prevent a repetition of tragedies such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994 in which the world stood by and failed to prevent the slaughter of up to one million Rwandans. And on the other hand, how to avoid a repeat of the kind of international division and controversy that raged around NATO’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 which was undertaken to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians but which was widely understood to have been illegal since China and Russia had refused to authorise the action in the UN Security Council. In response to these challenges, the Canadian government established the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS). In December 2001, the commission produced its report titled ‘The Responsibility to Protect’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812444683">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of the ‘responsibility to protect’ (RtoP) aimed to overcome what was an increasingly intractable debate about the so-called ‘right of humanitarian intervention’ by redirecting the focus away from the rights of intervening states and towards the need to protect victims of mass atrocities. The commission emphasised that the primary or default responsibility to protect civilians lies with the sovereign state and that a secondary or residual responsibility to protect lies with the international community in those instances where a state is unwilling or unable to protect its own population. ‘Where a population is suffering serious harm, as a result of internal war, insurgency, repression or state failure, and the state in question is unwilling or unable to halt or avert it,’ the commission declared, ‘the principle of non-intervention yields to the international responsibility to protect.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812444683">2</xref></sup> The forceful protection of civilians by the international community was thus framed as a responsibility, rather than merely a discretionary right, but it was also cast as an action that should only be taken in response to actual or apprehended large-scale loss of life or large-scale ethnic cleansing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812444683">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the UN World Summit in 2005, member states unanimously endorsed a version of this concept. This was a landmark moment in the history of international efforts to protect civilians. Member states agreed that ‘Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity’. They further declared that ‘The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility’; that ‘The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means…to help protect populations’; and that they were ‘prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council…should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812444683">4</xref></sup> In the years since then, RtoP has taken a prominent place in international debate about how to ensure the protection of civilians from mass atrocities in many parts of the world including Darfur, Kenya, Georgia, Myanmar, Gaza, Sri Lanka, the Congo, North Korea, Cote d’Ivoire, South Sudan, and several states caught up in the ‘Arab Spring’ of 2011 including Libya, Syria and Yemen.</p>
<p>During these years, the prevailing understanding of RtoP has evolved in important ways. Most significantly, since the idea of humanitarian intervention remains deeply controversial, supporters of RtoP have sought to shift the focus away from the question of military force and towards encouraging, assisting, and pressuring states to protect their own populations before mass atrocities occur so that the need to consider resorting to military force does not arise. They emphasise that the primary responsibility for the protection of populations lies with the host state and that there are a range of actions that the international community can take to help ensure this protection without having to resort to the use of force. The choice need not be between sending in the marines and doing nothing. Rather, pointing to the 2005 World Summit agreement, they argue that the international community has a responsibility to encourage states to protect their populations, to help states build capacity to protect their populations, to help develop prevention mechanisms and early-warning systems, and to assist those states that are under stress before crises and conflicts break out. Moreover, if the political leadership of a state is unwilling to work with the international community to protect its population, they observe, there are a range of non-coercive measures that can be taken, through the UN and relevant regional organisations, to pressure states to carry out their responsibilities. Advocates of RtoP thus increasingly insist that the international community need only consider the always difficult question of resorting to military intervention in those instances where encouragement, assistance, dialogue, and peaceful persuasion are insufficient to ensure the protection of civilians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812444683">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, I argue that the ‘responsibility to protect’ concept has deep Christian roots. In particular, I suggest that the seemingly novel notion that the states that comprise the international community bear not merely a discretionary right but a responsibility to protect civilians beyond their territorial borders can actually be understood as echoing claims found in Scripture, and developed further by early Church Fathers, Catholic scholastics, and Protestant natural law theorists, that the protection of strangers and foreigners is a sacred duty or obligation. While the present-day idea of a responsibility to protect civilians beyond borders may represent an important departure from twentieth-century claims about a ‘right of humanitarian intervention’, it has for many centuries prior to the twentieth been a persistent feature of Christian political thought. After briefly considering two concerns that are sometimes expressed about the relationship between RtoP and state sovereignty, I further suggest that the emerging emphasis of RtoP on the responsibility to work with states and to encourage, assist, and where necessary pressure them to protect their own civilians, rather than waiting until military intervention is needed, is one which Christians can welcome. Much good can be done to care for the vulnerable without needing to resort to the use of force. This new emphasis holds the promise of promoting the global protection of human rights while, at least in some instances, avoiding the thorny and divisive debates about the justice of war.</p>

<title>Duties beyond Borders</title>
<sec id="section2-0953946812444683">
<title>Scripture</title>
<p>The Old Testament outlines clear and demanding duties for the protection of the weak, the vulnerable, and the oppressed. In today’s terminology, these are not only negative but also positive duties. In other words, they are duties not only to refrain from doing harm but also duties to protect from harm. Jeremiah proclaims: ‘This is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed’ (22:3). Isaiah admonishes the people: ‘Stop doing wrong, learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow’ (1:16-17). Proverbs instructs: ‘Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy’ (31:8-9). And the Psalmist reports God’s command: ‘Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked’ (82:3-4).</p>
<p>Moreover, these are not merely duties of beneficence or charity but duties of justice. In other words, it is not only right to perform these duties but it is wrong to not perform them. To act without compassion and generosity to the vulnerable is to be unrighteous. Job longs for ‘the days when God watched over me’ and recalls that, in those days: ‘I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban. I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. I was a father to the needy; I took up the cause of the stranger. I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth’ (29:2, 14-17). And he acknowledges that it would be a sin to do any less:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary, if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless…if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing or a needy man without a garment, and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep…then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high (31:16-28).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Proverbs provides a stern warning: ‘Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,” does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?’ (24:11-12).</p>
<p>Such commands to do justice are repeated in the New Testament. We are told: ‘This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?’ (1 Jn 3:16-17). In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, Jesus suggests that doing justice is an indication of one’s heart for Christ and, by extension, one’s saving faith. He says to the ‘sheep’, whatever you did for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the unclothed, the sick, or the imprisoned, ‘you did for me’. And he tells the ‘goats’, whatever you did not do for these people in need, ‘you did not do for me’ (Matt. 25:31-46).</p>
<p>To be sure, some priority is given in the New Testament to the care of family (1 Tim. 5:8) and the care of those who belong to the community of believers (Gal. 6:10). In the Old Testament too, the vulnerable that Israel was called to protect were typically those living amongst them, though it is worth noting that this included aliens or refugees who were not necessarily fellow believers (Deut. 10:19). However, in his Parable of the Good Samaritan (Lk. 10:25-37), Jesus makes clear that we are bound to assist <italic>anyone</italic> in need, whoever they are and wherever they are from. Jesus insists that the command to love our neighbours as ourselves is not limited to family, fellow nationals, or the community of believers. The duty to care for the weak, the vulnerable, and the oppressed is not limited to those we know or to those with whom we feel affinity. Our neighbour is anyone who needs our mercy and care.</p>

<sec id="section3-0953946812444683">
<title>Cicero and the Early Church Fathers</title>
<p>The first systematic discussion of duties would be offered not by a Christian thinker but by the Roman Stoic philosopher, Cicero. In his profoundly influential work, <italic>On Duties</italic>, written in 44 <sc>bc</sc>, Cicero developed an account of the obligations that we owe to each other as part of ‘the common fellowship of the human race’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812444683">6</xref></sup> He argued that there are two types of injustice: ‘men may inflict injury; or else, when it is being inflicted upon others, they may fail to deflect it, even though they could’. Cicero thus articulated the distinction between what would become known as negative and positive duties, and he made clear that humans are bound to perform both. A man is not to harm another, and he is also not to stand by when harm is being perpetrated against another. Indeed, ‘the man who does not defend someone, or obstruct the injustice when he can, is at fault just as if he had abandoned his parents or his friends or his country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812444683">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cicero insisted that duties are not only owed to those close to us. He declared that it is absurd to say that justice and fellowship obtain between family members but not between fellow citizens, and it is equally absurd to say that account should be taken of fellow citizens but not of foreigners. Those who suggest otherwise are said to ‘tear apart the common fellowship of the human race’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812444683">8</xref></sup> However, Cicero indicated that duties owed to family and fellow citizens ought to take priority, declaring that: ‘fellow countrymen are preferred to foreigners and relatives to strangers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812444683">9</xref></sup> In general, he accepted that the performance of a duty to defend others would at times require some degree of self- sacrifice, and he reprimanded those who neglect their duties out of a desire to avoid incurring ‘enmities, or toil, or expense’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812444683">10</xref></sup> Yet, he indicated that duties which were owed to strangers were limited to those instances where ‘assistance can be provided without detriment to oneself’. After all, ‘the resources of individuals are small, but the mass of those who are in need is infinitely great’. We need to be measured in our generosity, therefore, so that ‘we shall still be capable of being liberal to those close to us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812444683">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is worth noting that Cicero’s landmark work also featured one of the earliest and most influential accounts of the conditions under which war could be justly waged. He thus established an enduring connection between arguments about duties and arguments about just war. Over the two millennia since Cicero wrote, claims about duties owed to family and fellow nationals and also to strangers and foreigners have, in various ways, been repeatedly put to work to justify not only demands for the provision of aid and assistance but also wars to rescue the oppressed and to punish their oppressors.</p>
<p>Over the next few centuries, some early Church Fathers took up and developed Cicero’s ideas further. In his <italic>Divine Institutes</italic>, written in the early fourth century, Lactantius enthusiastically embraced the idea that we owe duties to all people and endorsed Cicero’s claim that to suggest otherwise would destroy the common fellowship of the human race. However he firmly rejected the Ciceronian suggestion that fellow nationals should take priority and that we ought to ‘reckon the interests of our country in the first place’. He lamented that Cicero’s patriotic and relativist claims were put to work to justify oppressive rule and wars of aggression: ‘justice itself is taken away, which is unable to bear the tearing asunder of the human race, and wherever arms have glittered, must be banished and exterminated from thence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812444683">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the late fourth century, Ambrose of Milan wrote his own work titled <italic>On Duties</italic> which was intended to be a Christian replacement of Cicero’s work of the same name. Ambrose framed his program of duties as one which met the higher standards demanded and displayed in Scripture than the secular program offered by Cicero and, in those many instances where his claims echoed those of Cicero, he sought to demonstrate their Christian heritage by providing Old Testament injunctions and examples that pre-dated Cicero’s classical citations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812444683">13</xref></sup> Ambrose repeated Cicero’s dictum that there is a duty to protect others from harm: ‘the person who fails to deflect an injury from his neighbour, when he is in a position to do so,’ he declared, ‘is as much at fault as the one who inflicts it.’ And he offered as a scriptural example Moses who killed an Egyptian in order to rescue an Israelite from mistreatment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812444683">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ambrose insisted that the motive for carrying out one’s duties should not be to benefit and bring glory to oneself or one’s state, as Cicero had suggested, but to honour God and bring glory to Him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812444683">15</xref></sup> On these grounds, he challenged in some measure at least Cicero’s insistence that we are to prefer the interests of those close to us over those of strangers. He suggested that family and fellow believers deserve special consideration, but insisted that we must show mercy to everyone and that our mercy ought to flow most generously to those in greatest and most urgent need.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812444683">16</xref></sup> Lactantius was even more forthright, castigating Cicero for emphasising the utility of helping those who may be able to return the favour to us in the future rather than those in greatest need of our assistance and protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812444683">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This line of thinking would be adopted by the medieval canonists and perhaps most influentially by Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas accepted the idea of Cicero, Ambrose and others that we should give priority to those ‘more closely united to us’ when performing our duties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812444683">18</xref></sup> This was articulated as the ‘order of charity’ or the ‘order of love’. However, like Ambrose, he insisted that the most important criterion for determining the requirements of justice and charity is the degree of need. He cited with approval Ambrose’s dictum: ‘Feed him that dies of hunger: if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain him.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812444683">19</xref></sup> And he asserted that individuals have a strict duty of justice to give from their superfluous goods and perhaps even from their own necessities in order to assist those in extreme need.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812444683">20</xref></sup> As we will see in the next section, subsequent theorists would suggest that those beyond sovereign borders were not excluded from the scope of such duties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946812444683">
<title>Early Modern Europe</title>
<p>In the early modern period, Christian theorists would apply these ideas about duties to protect the vulnerable from harm and grave suffering to the international arena, but they would then also suggest significant limitations on the extent to which the duty was compulsory or binding. The internationalisation of duties of protection was impelled by Europe’s discovery of the New World. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholic writers in the scholastic tradition debated whether Spain had a right to conquer the New World and to subject the natives to their rule. While many of these scholars insisted that Spain did not have any such right of dominion, there was some consensus on the idea that there was a right and perhaps even a duty to intervene in the New World to at least defend the ‘innocent’ from tyranny and to prevent the practice of ‘nefarious’ customs such as human sacrifice and cannibalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812444683">21</xref></sup> Bartolome de Las Casas, for example, argued in the mid-sixteenth century: ‘it is the concern of the Church and the Pope, to whom the pastoral care of the whole world has been entrusted by Christ, to prevent the slaughter of such innocent persons lest their souls, whose salvation should be of special concern, should perish forever’. The Christian ruler or other private person whom the Church entrusted with liberating these natives, Las Casas claimed, bore an obligation to rescue which was analogous to the obligation to give alms or an obligation to perform ‘other works of piety or charity’. To free the unjustly oppressed, he suggested, was an act of ‘mercy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812444683">22</xref></sup> The following century, Francisco Suarez similarly argued that, in certain circumstances, war ‘in order to defend the innocent’ was ‘permissible in the order of charity and is, indeed, a positive duty if it can be conveniently waged’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812444683">23</xref></sup> Tragically, of course, while these scholars warned against more interventionist formulations of their arguments and insisted that their cautious defences of war to rescue innocents should not be abused, their ideas and the ideas of others were put to work to justify terrible atrocities against natives in the New World.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946812444683">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In these same centuries, Protestant natural law theorists similarly wrote of duties to protect civilians, not only in the New World but also in Europe, who were subject to tyranny and particularly religious persecution. Alberico Gentili, for example, invoked the arguments of both Cicero and Ambrose in order to defend a duty of forcible intervention. He declared: ‘It is the duty of a man to protect men’s interests and safety’ and on these grounds he defended war waged on behalf of foreigners since ‘the subjects of others do not seem to me to be outside of that kinship of nature and the society formed by the whole world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946812444683">25</xref></sup> Another theorist, the anonymous French Calvinist author of the <italic>Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos</italic>, appealed to the arguments of Cicero and the Parable of the Good Samaritan in arguing that neighbouring princes ought to ‘render assistance to the subjects of other princes who are being persecuted on account of pure religion, or oppressed by manifest tyranny’. Writing in the context of the persecution of Calvinists in France in the late-sixteenth century, the author insisted: ‘justice bids us to check tyrants and overthrowers of right and the commonwealth; and charity to succour and lend a helping hand to the oppressed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946812444683">26</xref></sup> Indeed, misrepresenting somewhat the argument of Cicero, (s)he went so far as to claim that a prince who does not intervene to defend the innocent subjects of a tyrant is to be more seriously condemned than the tyrant since the tyrant’s actions can be attributed to ‘a brief madness’ whereas the neighbouring prince’s failure to act is ‘the product of an evil intention and spirit’: ‘And the madness of the former can be excused in one way or another, but the latter’s fixed purpose cannot be on any account.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946812444683">27</xref></sup> The author then put the argument in even more farfetched terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>But since a prince who idly observes the wicked acts of a tyrant and the slaughter of innocents, which he can prevent, takes pleasure in this sort of gladiatorial show, he is more guilty than the tyrant, to the same extent as he who sets gladiators against each other is more guilty than a murdering gladiator, and as someone who kills a man for relaxation is more guilty than one who is forced to out of fear or necessity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946812444683">28</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The majority of Protestant natural law thinkers did not take such an extreme position. Moreover, the consolidation of the idea of the independent sovereign state through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries led these theorists to downplay the compulsory nature of extraterritorial duties and to place them in strict subordination to the primary duty of self-preservation of the state. They insisted that the duty to protect the subjects of others ought not to be considered a binding duty since each individual state had the right to weigh for itself when and where it could act with justice without putting its own self-interests at risk. In the early seventeenth century, Hugo Grotius defended a <italic>right</italic> of war to punish tyranny and rescue the oppressed but, invoking Cicero, insisted that such action was <italic>obligatory</italic> only in instances where a prince could undertake it ‘with his own convenience’. After all, while it is good to keep violence off another, ‘it is plain, that in case there appears any manifest Danger we are not bound to do it; for a Man may prefer the Preservation of his own Life and Goods before that of the Life and Goods of another’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946812444683">29</xref></sup> In the mid-eighteenth century, Emer de Vattel outlined this argument in more detail with respect to the question of a duty to aid and assist neighbouring states so that they may provide for the safety and well-being of their population. He suggested that states possessed ‘duties or offices of humanity towards each other’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946812444683">30</xref></sup> Each state was bound to assist another state ‘afflicted with famine or any other calamities’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946812444683">31</xref></sup> and to contribute to the ability of other states to procure for their populations ‘every thing of which they stand in need, for the necessities, the conveniences and enjoyments of life, and for their happiness in general’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946812444683">32</xref></sup> However, he also insisted that a state was only bound to carry out these duties where it could do so ‘without being wanting to itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946812444683">33</xref></sup> And to those ‘who might be alarmed’, he argued that states retain the right to judge when and where these duties ought to be performed,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946812444683">34</xref></sup> and emphasised the primacy of the duty of the state to care for its own interests in an international state of nature, declaring: ‘The duties of a nation towards itself, and chiefly the care of its own safety, require much more circumspection and reserve, than need be observed by an individual in giving assistance to others.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946812444683">35</xref></sup> To fail to carry out ‘offices of humanity’, therefore, should not be understood as an act of ‘injustice’ but merely as an offence ‘against equity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946812444683">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>While ideas about duties to protect the subjects of others continued to be put to work to justify terrible crimes by colonial powers, as well as some more praiseworthy provisions of aid and acts of rescue,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946812444683">37</xref></sup> they were by now understood to not require states to assist or intervene where they did not wish to. The protection of vulnerable peoples beyond borders was increasingly perceived in terms of a discretionary right rather than a duty. And thus it remained for the most part until the emergence of the ‘responsibility to protect’ concept in the aftermath of the Cold War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946812444683">38</xref></sup> The development of RtoP was catalysed by the apparent failure of the idea of a ‘right of intervention’ to encourage adequate international responses to those crises that did not engage the material self-interests of bystander states, such as the Rwandan genocide. RtoP’s emergence can be understood, therefore, as a revival of the idea, deeply rooted in Christian political thought, that there exists not merely a right but an obligation to rescue populations from oppression and mass suffering.</p>

<title>Two Concerns regarding Sovereignty</title>
<p>I do not want to endorse each and every one of the claims made by Christian thinkers outlined in the previous section. Indeed, some arguments such as that offered by the author of <italic>Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos</italic> seem deeply problematic. Nevertheless, we can find in their ideas the resources for beginning to offer a Christian response to two concerns that are sometimes expressed about the relationship between RtoP and state sovereignty. Both concerns hold, in different ways, that RtoP fails to take adequate account of the moral significance of sovereign boundaries. First, it is sometimes argued that the duties owed to the vulnerable are appropriately limited by sovereign borders. This argument is occasionally made particularly by scholars and officials within powerful states such as the United States that may otherwise be expected to bear much of the burden of global protection responsibilities. The argument goes that the primary obligation of a state is to pursue its national interest and that it is only bound to take measures to protect civilians beyond borders where such action serves the national interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946812444683">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>This argument can perhaps be understood in terms of the application to the international arena of the principle of the ‘order or charity’ or ‘order of love’ developed by Christian thinkers from Ambrose onwards. The ‘order of charity’ for a state, it might be said, extends only so far as the boundaries of that state. However, it should be recalled that Ambrose and then, more systematically, Aquinas insisted that, while some priority should be given to those close to us, special consideration needs also to be given to those in extreme need. And the Spanish scholastics believed that this duty to help those in extreme need applied not only to the internal affairs of Spain but also to Spain’s relations with other political communities, particularly in the New World.</p>
<p>In order to accept that we have duties beyond borders, we do not have to accept an extreme cosmopolitan argument which says that sovereign boundaries are ‘morally irrelevant’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946812444683">40</xref></sup> The scholastics certainly believed that territorial borders were morally relevant. However, they accepted that, in extraordinary circumstances, there could be a positive duty to protect the vulnerable ‘innocents’ beyond those borders. I think we can draw the same conclusions today. Sovereign boundaries are morally relevant and it is right that states give some priority to the care of the vulnerable within their borders. Nevertheless, states are bound also to care for the vulnerable beyond their borders in cases of extreme persecution and suffering if they can do so without excessive cost to themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946812444683">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, it is sometimes argued that the principle of RtoP undermines the cherished right of sovereign states to self-determination and freedom from external interference. This argument tends to be made by weaker states that remain wary that notions of a responsibility to protect the vulnerable could yet again be employed by powerful states to justify self-interested and oppressive interference in their affairs just as they have in the past, rather than measures genuinely aimed at protecting civilians from mass suffering. It is an argument also made by powerful supporters of these weak states such as China, Russia, and India. They commonly point to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and also the blurring of the line between civilian protection and regime change through the course of NATO’s intervention in Libya in 2011 as examples of abusive misapplication of the RtoP concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946812444683">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>This critique ought to be taken seriously. It should be acknowledged that the rights of sovereign states to self-government and non-intervention have long been recognised as morally valuable. However, so too have the limitations that are understood to be imposed upon these rights. Christian theorists, beginning with the Catholic scholastics, Calvinist resistance theorists, and Protestant natural law theorists of the early modern period, have for centuries warned against the dangers of abusive interventionism, but they have also acknowledged that the rights of sovereignty ought not to prevent international action to assist and rescue civilians in cases of extreme suffering or persecution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946812444683">43</xref></sup> The rights of sovereign states to freedom from external interference should certainly be respected and recognised as having moral worth. The RtoP concept merely asserts, as Christian theorists long have, that there may be rare and tragic situations in which the international community needs to contemplate putting to one side the sovereign right of non-intervention and intervening to rescue the vulnerable. As noted earlier, the scope of the RtoP concept is explicitly limited to extreme situations of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946812444683">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to be clear here that the RtoP concept in no way circumvents the need to engage in serious debate about the justifiability of the use of force in a given situation. Rather, if the resort to military force is ever to be justified, it can only be so in the most extraordinary situations and only where the criteria of a just war that have been developing since the time of Cicero are satisfied. The familiar debate about how these just war criteria ought to be understood, how they might be appropriately applied, and by whom, is not the concern of the present article. Rather, I merely suggest that, if there are ever situations in which the resort to force is justifiable as the appropriate means of protecting the vulnerable, then such action is not merely <italic>rightful</italic>, as it tends to be framed in modern just war theory, but it is a <italic>responsibility</italic> that ought to be discharged insofar as is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946812444683">45</xref></sup> We would do well to recall the words of Augustine regarding the always lamentable but occasionally obligatory nature of war in this regard:
<disp-quote>
<p>But the wise man, they say, will wage just wars. Surely, if he remembers that he is a human being, he will rather lament the fact that he is faced with the necessity of waging just wars; for if they were not just, he would not have to engage in them, and consequently there would be no wars for a wise man. For it is the injustice of the opposing side that lays on the wise man the duty of waging wars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946812444683">46</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That being said, I want to emphasise in the remainder of this article that there is much that the international community can do to protect the vulnerable without needing to threaten or breach the sovereign rights of states and without needing to engage in the always controversial debates about the justice of resorting to war.</p>

<title>From Intervention to Prevention</title>
<p>The ongoing opposition to the idea of a duty of military intervention outlined in the previous section has been accompanied in recent times by a realisation that populations can best be protected by acting to <italic>prevent</italic> the outbreak of mass atrocities rather than forcibly intervening after such atrocities have begun. It is for a combination of these reasons that states, organisations, and individuals supporting RtoP have in the last few years tried to shift the focus away from intervention and towards prevention. That is, towards encouraging, assisting, and, where necessary, pressuring states to protect their own populations so that the tragic need to consider the always difficult questions about the resort to force arises in as few cases as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946812444683">47</xref></sup> This idea of prioritising assistance over forcible intervention also has roots in Christian political thought. Seventeenth-century Protestant natural law theorist, Samuel Pufendorf, for example, insisted on the duty to aid and assist neighbouring states in caring for the safety and well-being of their population, but refuted Grotius’ claim of a right or duty to wage war to punish tyranny since it was ‘contrary to the natural <italic>Equality</italic> of Mankind, for a Man to force himself upon the World for a <italic>Judge</italic>, and <italic>Decider of Controversies</italic>. Not to say what dangerous Abuses this Liberty might be perverted to, and that any Man might make War upon any Man upon such a Pretence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946812444683">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>I want to suggest that this increased emphasis on working <italic>with</italic> rather than <italic>against</italic> states as far as possible to prevent grave human suffering is a development that Christians can strongly welcome. In many instances, there is much that the international community can do to protect civilians well before it is confronted with the need to engage in tortured and divisive debates about the use of military force. International consensus on the preventive and non-coercive aspects of RtoP is much stronger than it is on the military intervention aspect. More importantly, states and commentators tend to agree that greater emphasis on prevention holds the promise of saving more lives. In 2009, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a report titled ‘Implementing the Responsibility to Protect’ which impressively detailed a range of policies of assistance, capacity building, development of early warning mechanisms, and other non-coercive measures that can be implemented by the international community if it is serious about discharging its recognised responsibility to prevent the occurrence of mass atrocities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946812444683">49</xref></sup> The report was enthusiastically embraced by the vast majority of states in a UN General Assembly debate later that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946812444683">50</xref></sup> However, this of course does not mean that implementation is a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the domestic constituencies of those powerful and wealthy western states whose role in implementing RtoP is so critical do not tend to embrace meaningful and substantial policies aimed at preventing the occurrence of mass atrocities and humanitarian crises beyond their borders to the same extent as they support bold and courageous military interventions once the atrocities and crises have begun. Put differently, and at some risk of applying historical ideas anachronistically, they are less enamoured with more hidden and humble acts of justice that bring glory only to God, as called for by Ambrose, than they are of visible and heroic acts of rescue that bring glory to oneself or one’s state (and perhaps also to God), as demanded by Cicero. The more Ambrosian policies of assistance and capacity building tend to have less measurable and less television friendly results. Consequently, western publics do not tend to pressure their governments to implement such policies as enthusiastically as they do to undertake coercive interventions once the time for preventive action has passed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946812444683">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I suggest that we should welcome the attempt to shift the focus of international efforts away from questions of military intervention and towards policies of prevention and, where possible, we should seek to promote it. Such a shift holds the promise of advancing the global protection of human rights and the Christian principle of protecting the vulnerable while, at least in some instances, avoiding the need to make the always tragic decision to resort to a necessary and just war.</p>
<p>To be sure, there will continue to be cases like Libya in early 2011 in which the international community does have to confront the terrible questions about the justice of undertaking military intervention to protect civilians from the threat of mass atrocities. There will continue to be tyrannical rulers who will not consent to external assistance and who will not be amenable to external pressure. Christians will continue to have to wrestle with the difficult questions about the resort to military force to protect the vulnerable from tyranny and they will continue to have important things to say about such questions to political authorities just as they have for many centuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps more commonly, however, there will be situations like Kenya in early 2008 where the international community can act quickly and peacefully to ensure that atrocities are not committed. In this case, ethnic violence had erupted in the aftermath of disputed elections. Up to 1,500 people had been killed and 300,000 displaced from their homes. Comparisons were beginning to be made with the Rwandan genocide and also with more recent crises in Cote d’Ivoire and Zimbabwe. A coordinated diplomatic effort by a group of eminent Africans, including former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was quickly authorised by the African Union. This effort was supported by Secretary-General Ban and his special advisor for the prevention of genocide, Francis Deng, who reminded Kenya’s leaders of their responsibility to protect civilians and warned that if they failed to discharge their responsibility they would be held to account by the international community. The UN Security Council also issued a Presidential statement reminding the leaders of their ‘responsibility to engage fully in finding a sustainable political solution and taking action to immediately end violence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946812444683">52</xref></sup> These non-coercive efforts were successful in persuading the Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki and the opposition leader Raila Odinga to conclude a power-sharing agreement and bring the violence to an end. Moreover, the arrangement reached between the two leaders included a range of longer-term measures aimed at addressing ‘the underlying roots of the conflict, including ethnic divides, disempowerment and alienation among large parts of the population, inadequate checks on the exercise of executive power by the President and inequitable distribution of wealth and land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946812444683">53</xref></sup> Of course it is impossible to say what might have happened in Kenya had the international community not acted with such speed and determination. Nevertheless, it would seem that this moment can be read as a laudable instance of the international community carrying out its responsibility to protect civilians without needing to resort to force. And of course, since helping to pull Kenya back from the brink, the international community now continues to bear a responsibility to assist the African state in implementing the constitutional, legal, social and economic reforms necessary for ensuring that ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities are prevented over the longer term.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946812444683">54</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0953946812444683">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, having offered a largely positive assessment of the ‘responsibility to protect’ concept, I want to caution that RtoP ought not to be embraced as the final and perfect solution to the problem of how to ensure international peace and justice. It is sometimes suggested that RtoP bears the promise of ‘ending mass atrocity crimes once and for all’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946812444683">55</xref></sup> This is not helpful. We ought not to adopt such utopian visions of human perfectibility. We will only know true peace on Earth when Christ returns; only then will swords be beaten into plowshares. Nevertheless, I think we can embrace RtoP as a valuable framework according to which we can continue to strive to carry out duties clearly found in Scripture to protect the vulnerable; to limit the tremendous suffering that so often results from human sin. As Deut. 15:11 acknowledges, ‘There will always be poor people in the land’. And yet it continues: ‘Therefore I command you to be openhanded…toward the poor and needy in your land.’ And as Jesus indicates in the Parable of the Good Samaritan, and as many Christians have insisted over two thousand years, this duty to protect the vulnerable applies not only to our friends and fellow citizens but also to strangers and foreigners beyond our borders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946812444683">56</xref></sup></p>

<p>Samuel Pufendorf, <italic>The Law of Nature and Nations</italic>, trans. Basil Kennett (London: 1729), viii.vi.14. However, somewhat ambiguously, on the matter of taking up arms in defence of innocents, Pufendorf referred his readers to the opinion of Grotius and indicated that a sovereign could forcibly defend the subjects of another when these subjects requested assistance ‘to repress the insupportable <italic>Tyranny</italic> and <italic>Cruelties</italic> of their own <italic>Governors</italic>’.</p>
