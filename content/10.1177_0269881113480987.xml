<abstract>
<p>In 2011, anecdotal data indicated that 3,4-methylene-dioxy-pyrovalerone (MDPV) might become popular among needle exchange program (NEP) clients in Hungary as a possible substitute for formerly used substances such as amphetamines and heroin. The aim of the study reported here was to examine how the emergence of MDPV influenced the choice of the injecting substance among NEP clients. A total of 183 injecting drug users (IDUs) participating in the largest NEP in Budapest agreed to participate in the study and report on their drug use habits. During 2011, remarkable changes occurred in the structure of the primary injected substances. Amphetamine was cited as the primary injected substance by 45.9% of the respondents and MDPV by 48.1%. Close to half of the former amphetamine injectors had switched to MDPV (64 persons, 45.1%) as had 10 (41.7%) of the former heroin injectors and 11 (78.6%) of those using other substances (cocaine and mephedrone). The appearance of MDPV on the illegal drug market had a substantial effect on the drug use patterns of the IDU population. Further research should be conducted to explain the changes, that might include the purity, price and availability of amphetamine and heroin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although opiate use in the form of drinking homemade poppy tea and injecting poppy cuttings had been occurring in Hungary during the 1980s, it became a serious problem only a decade later, after the opening of the borders. During the 1980s, only a few hundred persons used poppy derivatives and opioid medicines in Hungary, but by the second half of the 1990s, several thousand injecting opiate users (most of whom used heroin) were registered in the health care system and identified by the needle exchange programs (NEPs) and other low-threshold services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113480987">Gerevich and Bácskai, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In Hungary, the first needle exchange programs opened in the first half of the 1990s, with predominantly heroin-using clients. However, in recent years, amphetamine users became the largest client group. Recently, anecdotal data indicated that 3,4-methylene-dioxy-pyrovalerone (MDPV) might become popular among NEP clients as a possible substitute for some of the previously used substances such as amphetamines and heroin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113480987">Reitox National Focal Point, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>MDPV is a pyrrolidine derivative of the synthetic cathinone pyrovalerone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113480987">Coppola and Mondola, 2012</xref>). MDPV is a monoamine uptake inhibitor which is more lipophilic and more potent than other cathinone derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881113480987">Meltzer et al., 2006</xref>). The action of MDPV on monoamine reuptake may produce stimulant effects, like cocaine, amphetamines or MDMA. The stimulant effect of MDPV has been compared to methylphenidate at low doses and to cocaine or amphetamines at high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113480987">Coppola and Mondola, 2012</xref>). The dopaminergic stimulation in the reward system could explain the development of tolerance, abuse, dependence, and withdrawal syndrome reported by users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881113480987">Ross and Peselow, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113480987">Coppola and Mondola (2012)</xref> emphasized that the scientific community must monitor the diffusion of MDPV. Recognizing the spread of MDPV among injecting drug users in Hungary, our aim was to examine how its emergence influenced the choice of injecting substance in this population. To examine the possible influence of MDPV, we planned a ‘snapshot’ survey among the clients of the largest needle exchange program in Budapest, Hungary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269881113480987" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was conducted in the Blue Point Drug Counselling and Outpatient Centre’s NEP which is located in one of the poorest districts of Budapest. This NEP, the largest in Hungary, opened in 2006. By the end of 2011, it had more than 2500 registered users: the estimated number of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Hungary is around 6000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113480987">Reitox National Focal Point, 2010</xref>). Clients of the NEP are socially disadvantaged, with low educational attainment, poor labor market situation and predominantly of Roma origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113480987">Márványkövi et al., 2008</xref>). The NEP is open six days a week, from 16:00–20:00, and it has an average of 50.5 visitors a day. The program distributed 217,268 needles in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881113480987">Blue Point, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0269881113480987">
<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>Data presented in this paper come from two sources: the NEP’s general registration protocol and a short survey of its clients.</p>
<p>According to the general registration protocol, all IDUs are interviewed when entering the program and provide their year of birth and gender, place of residence (district in Budapest or city if not living in Budapest) and their primary injected substance. This registration database and the daily needle exchange records are analyzed every year to obtain information on the main characteristics of the clients, their tendencies and changes in substance use. Data presented from this source refer to clients entering the program in the given year.</p>
<p>Data were collected for our short survey over a one-month period between 13 September 2011 and 15 October 2011. During this period, all clients entering the program were asked to participate in the study: 461 IDUs visited the program, of which 183 agreed to participate in the study (response rate 39.7%). Refusal to participate was due to the busy lifestyle of clients, who did not want to spend more time in the NEP than absolutely necessary. The staff of the NEP collected all data after brief training. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous: neither participation nor refusal had any influence on a client’s treatment.</p>
<p>To analyze the extent to which our sample represents the clients of the NEP, we compared the profile of 183 individuals in our sample with the characteristics of the total population registered in the NEP in 2011 (<italic>n</italic>=2572 persons). The results indicated no significant difference in terms of gender (males: 71.1% in the survey of 183 clients vs 73.4% among all registered clients in 2011, chi-square=0.432, <italic>p</italic>=0.282); age (30.4 years, standard deviation (SD)=8.2 vs 30.6; SD=7.9, respectively, <italic>F</italic>=0.117, <italic>p</italic>=0.732); and place (i.e. district) of residence (chi-square=28.174, <italic>p</italic>=0.209). Thus, we consider that our sample reliably represents the 2011 client population of the NEP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881113480987">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Based on our former research experience with this population, we designed a short questionnaire with three simple questions. It was obvious from earlier surveys that that this population is very difficult to involve in a survey and a longer questionnaire would have decreased the response rate. The first question aimed to identify the primary drug that had been injected in the last 30 days. If the respondents had been using more than one substance, they were asked to list them according to the frequency of use. The second question asked for the age at which they started injecting regularly and the third question asked for the first substance that they injected regularly. In addition to these responses, data were collected from the NEP database: all clients are interviewed when entering the program to obtain their year of birth, gender, primary injected substance and place of residence.</p>
<p>The Institutional Review Board of the Eötvös Loránd University approved the study. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 15.0 statistical software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881113480987">SPSS Inc., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881113480987" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data derived from the general registration protocol data revealed that the NEP was used mainly by men (73.3%), the average age of clients was 30.6 years (SD=7.9), and they were predominantly local people or from neighboring districts (75.1%). Looking at recent tendencies, the proportion of young clients (&lt;20 years) has increased during the past years from 0% in 2006 to 8.1% in 2010 and 11.1% in 2011. The gender distribution remained relatively stable during this period, however, with a slight increase in the proportion of women due to a newly introduced program focusing on female clients. The distribution of the primary injected substance as reported when entering the program was relatively stable between 2007–2010, with 56–68% injecting amphetamine and 27–42% injecting heroin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881113480987">Figure 1</xref>). Reports of the use of other substances, such as mephedrone and MDPV emerged only recently. By 2011, the proportion of clients whose primary injected substance was heroin dropped to 13%, while 17% reported MDPV and 7% mephedrone as the primary injected substance.</p>

<p>According to the results of our survey, 45.9% of the 183 respondents cited amphetamine as the current primary injected substance, while 48.1% cited MDPV. The sociodemographic characteristics of the MDPV users (74.7% males; mean age: 30.6 years, SD=8.1) did not differ from the other clients. The proportion of opiate users was low (4.4%) while the use of substances other than MDPV, amphetamine and opiates was reported by only 1.6% of the respondents. Subjects reported to inject illegal substances for 8.7 years (SD=6.48) on average. Responses to the question about the first regularly injected substance, indicated remarkable changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881113480987">Figure 2</xref>). Close to half of the former amphetamine users, (64 persons; 45.1%) and opiate users (10 persons; 41.7%) users changed to MDPV, as did 78.6% of those using other substances (cocaine, mephedrone). At the same time, none of those who started to inject MDPV (only three persons) changed their preference for any other substance.</p>

<p>In terms of whether injectors differ in the measured characteristics according to the primary drug, we found no significant difference between the two major groups (amphetamine and MDPV injectors) by gender (chi-square=2.366; not significant (n.s.)), age (chi-square=1.987; n.s.), place of residence, years of injecting, and years of using the NEP (1.6 years). The other two groups of injectors (opiates and other drugs) could not be statistically analyzed because of the low number of cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, comparing those who had changed their primary injected substance with those who did not, males and respondents with a longer injecting history were more likely to change. There was no difference according to the age of the subjects, however. While 64.4% of the males changed their injecting drug preference, only 44.9% of females did so (chi-square=5.435; <italic>p</italic>=0.02). Similarly, 66.1 % of those injecting for more than five years had switched to another substance, while this is the case only for 43.7% of those who had a shorter injecting history (chi-square=8.923; <italic>p</italic>=0.03).</p>

<sec id="section6-0269881113480987" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881113480987">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that during 2011, remarkable changes occurred in the primary injected substances among the IDUs newly entering the NEP, which was also confirmed by our current survey of 183 IDUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881113480987">Figure 2</xref>). According to our results, more than 40% of the former amphetamine and opiate users and 78.6% of those using other substances (cocaine, mephedrone) switched to injecting MDPV. Though we have little information on clients’ reasons for the change, some tentative explanations can be examined.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113480987">Coppola and Mondola (2012)</xref> suggest that new legal substances could become attractive alternatives to illicit drugs. This argument is however contradicted by the result (above) that the survey respondents have been injecting illegal substances for an average of 8.7 years, so legal status does not seem to determine drug preference. Moreover, according to our results, those who had been injecting illegal substances for a longer period were more likely to change substance than those who had been injecting for a shorter period.</p>
<p>A further possible explanation involves the quality of the available substances. A decrease in the purity of amphetamines and heroin in 2010–2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113480987">Reitox National Focal Point, 2011</xref>) could trigger the change to synthetic cathinones. The effect of price and availability must also be considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113480987">Spiller et al. (2011)</xref> explain the rapid expansion of these drugs into the US drug market because of their wide availability coupled with a low price. We also believe that these are two important contributing factors leading to the extensive use of new synthetic substances among the clients of the NEP. In Hungary, MDPV is far cheaper than heroin. The mean street level price of heroin is €41.2 which is nearly four times as much as the price of equivalent MDPV (€12.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113480987">Reitox National Focal Point, 2012</xref>). Regarding the availability of heroin, beside reports from clients, the number of heroin seizures and the quantity of the seized heroin in Hungary has recently dropped significantly: in 2011 the quantity seized was nearly one-tenth of the quantity seized in the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113480987">Reitox National Focal Point, 2012</xref>) reflecting a shortage on this substance. However, as the present study is a cross-sectional one, further monitoring of the market situation and injectors’ preferences are required: this would ascertain if the changes injecting drug users have made will remain stable, and whether they are because of a change in drug preference or a temporary response to the changes in the drug market.</p>
<p>Even if the above explanations for the change are acceptable to explain the change from one substance to another, another issue needs discussion: the psychoactive characteristics of the substances. MDPV has a strong stimulant effect, maybe even more potent than amphetamines or cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113480987">Coppola and Mondola, 2012</xref>). The primary desired effects of MDPV are increased energy, wakefulness and awareness, diminished perception need for food and sleep lasting approximately 3–4 hours. Thus, its role as a potential substitute for amphetamine is highly understandable. On the other hand, however, MDPV’s potential role as a substitute for opiates remains in question. According to our present knowledge, MDPV has the opposite psychoactive effect to opiates: it is thus not clear how it is able to substitute for heroin, a substance with depressant effects. Regardless of pharmacological action, the subjective effects and the reasons a person addicted to a depressant substance would change to a stimulant drug need further investigation as, based on the drug preference hypothesis, we would expect drug users to seek a substance with similar subjective effects.</p>
<p>Although we are not able to identify the main cause(s) behind the changes observed in substance use patterns, there are examples of how radical changes in the drug market can lead to substantial changes in the primary used substances amongst IDUs. In 2001 in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881113480987">Topp et al., 2003</xref>), the reduced availability of heroin was accompanied by decreased prevalence and frequency of heroin injection, and increased prevalence and frequency of stimulant injection. However, the drugs favored by IDUs during the heroin shortage varied across areas. The most frequent substitute was cocaine in Sidney and metamphetamine in Melbourne, which leads to the assumption that environmental factors (e.g. availability of a substance in the local drug market, initial characteristics of the local IDU population and the legal environment) also play an important role in determining which substance can serve as replacement for another. Furthermore, results reporting an increase in cocaine and metamphetamine use among former heroin users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881113480987">Degenhardt et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881113480987">Degenhardt et al., 2005b</xref>) in Australia reinforces our findings that even a substance with an opposite psychopharmacological profile can serve as a substitute during a heroin shortage.</p>
<p>Our study is not without limitations. Our data collection took place at only one NEP, and even though this program is the largest in Hungary, our sample cannot be considered as representative of the IDU population in Hungary and, especially, the results are not generalizable for other countries. Additionally, as we asked a very limited number of questions (to maximize the response rate, as discussed earlier), the underlying causes of the presented phenomenon could not be investigated. It is the role of future research to examine the motives behind the changes, including whether or not they are occurring in countries other than Hungary.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is clear from the results that, compared to previous years, a remarkable change occurred in the substances injected by IDUs visiting the NEP. It is also clear that the new psychoactive substances have played a major role in triggering the changes. We think that, at the service provider level, measures used to monitor the substances used by clients need to be revised as the availability of substances changes more frequently with the emergence of the new psychoactive substances. We also think that the phenomenon requires and deserves further investigation. Applying more detailed measures and assessing a wider population would help us understand whether this is an isolated occurrence or whether it is present elsewhere.</p>
