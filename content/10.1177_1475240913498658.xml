<abstract>
<p>This article attempts to enhance intercultural understanding, and thereby contribute to international education, by substantiating local and global educational citizenship via a critical examination of the author’s educational life against the framework of cosmopolitanism as a cultural identity form that combines local and global citizenship. Educational developmental stages across four continents and culturally diverse areas (Western Europe, Central America, East Asia and the Middle East) are examined against this framework. The purpose is twofold: first, to enrich and enlarge the development of a personal identity and mindset, namely to provide international students, teachers, interested parents and administrators with a personal identity or developmental model for their own professional or private lives. Second, to open up the institutional arena for a new type of individual aspiration, namely to let personal identity forms that are local and global in spirit enrich educational citizenship programmes that are local and global in setting. En route, a scientific background consisting of a theoretical framework and empirical evidence consisting of an in-depth investigation of young multilingual students is made even more accessible and transparent by self-critical evaluations of the author’s personal and professional educational pathways. This three-pronged approach of theory, empirical evidence, and autobiographical experience and example is open for revelation, comparison and criticism, but also for identification, imitation and inspiration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The most encouraging endorsement for discussing cosmopolitanism in the context of international education might be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240913498658">Hayden’s (2006</xref>: 5) statement that ‘arguably of relevance in any consideration of the concept of international education is that of cosmopolitanism’ before quoting this author and writings referred to in his previous research. From the cosmopolitan side, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1475240913498658">Trepanier and Habib (2011</xref>: 5) write of the ‘growing relevance of cosmopolitanism today and in the foreseeable future’. From the pedagogical side, recent literature increasingly links cosmopolitanism with educational approaches, exemplified by the work of authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240913498658">Hansen (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1475240913498658">Popkewitz (2008)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1475240913498658">Sund and Öhman (2011)</xref>. What all of these authors share are rather philosophical, political, societal and institutional viewpoints, or a kind of <italic>institutionally</italic> mediated approach. By contrast, this article takes a more <italic>personally</italic> mediated approach, encouraged by feedback to, and interest for, this level of address, by participants and presenters at the 2012 Alliance for International Education World Conference entitled <italic>Educational Futures: Innovations and Aspirations</italic>, held in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>My motivation to relate intercultural understanding to local and global educational citizenship, which seeks inspiration from cosmopolitanism, is a combination of personally lived professional experience with previous research on cosmopolitanism and internationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240913498658">Gunesch, 2008a</xref>). The framework of cosmopolitanism here displayed is a summary of over a decade of research and could be described in shorthand as an individual cultural identity form straddling the global and the local with the potential to inform and inspire international education. It had brought my attention to ongoing discussions about key terms in the context of international education. For instance, just the literature that has attempted to delineate the elements of ‘international’, ‘internationalism’ or ‘internationalization’ in the field of international education is already vast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240913498658">Allan, 2003</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240913498658">Gellar, 2002</xref>: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240913498658">Hayden, 2006</xref>: 4–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240913498658">Hayden et al., 2000</xref>: 107–121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1475240913498658">Rumbley et al., 2012</xref>: 4–24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240913498658">Skelton, 2002</xref>: 44).</p>
<p>Current concerns over international education appear to centre on definitions of the field and of international schools, the nature of an international curriculum and the organization and management of international schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240913498658">Blandford and Shaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240913498658">Hayden and Thompson, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240913498658">2000</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240913498658">Hayden et al., 2002</xref>). Even those contributions that imply aims and outcomes of international education in terms of desirable developments and transformations in the individual learner contain remarkably little in terms of clarification and theorization of their nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240913498658">Langford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1475240913498658">Pearce, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1475240913498658">Walker, 1998</xref>), but are discussed in empirical and pragmatic rather than conceptual or theoretical terms. Hence ‘being international’, ‘international-mindedness’ or ‘international attitude’ belong to an institution-bound area of investigation within such frameworks as ‘international schools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240913498658">Allan, 2003</xref>: 83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240913498658">Hayden et al., 2000</xref>: 107–112), ‘international education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240913498658">Hayden and Thompson, 1995</xref>: 394) or ‘international curriculum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240913498658">Skelton, 2002</xref>: 44–53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1475240913498658">Thompson, 1998</xref>: 278–281).</p>
<p>By contrast, cosmopolitanism as an individual identity form does not (yet) have any comparable widespread or traditional institutional attachments, such as schools or associations. Having said that, the model of cosmopolitanism to be outlined here <italic>can</italic>, and – as will be argued – <italic>should</italic> be applied, theoretically and practically, by international educators, globally mobile people and others who believe that they could benefit from its theoretical and practical implications. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240913498658">Gellar (2002</xref>: 32) puts it: ‘The fact that the world is small, fragile, and its inhabitants increasingly dependent on one another … has also made it imperative that international educators … focus on issues and problems that are trans-national and trans-cultural.’</p>
<p>The robustness and practical applicability of this proposed model was tested and confirmed by a group of 11 multilingual students to be relevant to their personal cultural identity. Since the students did this to varying extents, it produced a pattern of ‘cosmopolitan responsiveness’ among them. This in turn enabled me to synthesize three ‘cosmopolitan ideal types’, which were later labelled ‘advanced tourist’, ‘transitional cosmopolitan’ and ‘interactive cosmopolitan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240913498658">Gunesch, 2008b</xref>: 192–197). The conceptual framework of this model is explained in the next section, followed by the empirical investigation that applies it to multilingual students, before a comparison of this established research to lived practice will lead to suggestions as to how individual theory and practice might inspire more institutionalized local and global citizenship programs.</p>

<title>Matrix of cosmopolitanism</title>
<p>Cosmopolitanism is ‘a protean term with a complex history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240913498658">Mehta, 2000</xref>: 620), yet this article focuses on contemporary treatments. Roughly summing up two millennia, cosmopolitanism seems to have been especially intensely debated during three periods: first, in the time of the Greek Stoics of the 1st and 2nd centuries BC; second, in the 17th/18th centuries; and, third, as of the early 1990s (all three periods are mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240913498658">Appiah, 2006</xref>: xiii–xv; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240913498658">Calhoun, 2003</xref>: 538–540; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240913498658">Carter, 2001</xref>: 1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240913498658">2005</xref>: 15–28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240913498658">Grovogui, 2005</xref>: 103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240913498658">Heater, 2002</xref>: 26ff, 40, 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1475240913498658">Mazlish, 2005</xref>: 101; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1475240913498658">Rattansi, 2004</xref>: 615; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1475240913498658">Skrbis et al., 2003</xref>: 115).</p>
<p>From its roots with the Stoics, there has been a wide range of understanding of its meaning, ranging from an aloof societal position to one assuming citizenship responsibilities for the entire world. Even regarding just the third period, the literature openly admits cosmopolitanism to be ‘the kind of … concept that eludes a single, absolute, and authoritative definition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1475240913498658">Trepanier and Habib, 2011</xref>: 5), an identity form <italic>sui generis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240913498658">Brennan, 2001</xref>: 76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240913498658">Clifford, 1998</xref>: 365; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240913498658">Mehta, 2000</xref>: 621; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1475240913498658">Pollock et al., 2002</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1475240913498658">Robbins, 1998b</xref>: 12), and ‘a subject of interdisciplinary debate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240913498658">Dharwadker, 2001</xref>: 1). Therefore, the definition of cosmopolitanism below is a literature synthesis subjected to substantial critical thinking. Its focus is a contemporary cultural individual identity form that is potentially relevant for today’s students and educators.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism can be pre-defined by the catchword phrase of ‘feeling at home in the world’ (as in the title of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240913498658">Brennan’s 1997</xref> book <italic>At Home in the World: Cosmopolitanism Now</italic>). This could be specified as interest in or engagement with cultural diversity by straddling the global and the local spheres in terms of personal identity. ‘Straddling’ in this sense means having one foot in each sphere, and finding a balance in which the global is decisive without necessarily dominating all the time.</p>
<p>One can distinguish between cosmopolitanism and localism, or between people who are cosmopolitans and locals. While the local may not be interested in cultural diversity, the cosmopolitan consciously values, seeks out and tries to access local cultural diversity. Since that cultural diversity always comprises the respective local(s), cosmopolitanism logically presupposes localism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 237, 249–250; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 102, 111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240913498658">Pollock, 2002</xref>: 17). Other literature amends the global and local existences with a notion such as ‘living in between’ or a ‘balancing act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240913498658">Anderson, 1998</xref>: 276; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240913498658">Clifford, 1992</xref>: 108, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240913498658">1997</xref>: 36). These existences do not have to be exclusive, but can be seen as the ends of a continuum, with a possible development process for the individual from local to cosmopolitan. Also, the cosmopolitan’s ability to access local cultural diversity culminates in a competence or mastery in the respective local culture(s) in the form of ‘connaissance’, rather than (mere) ‘dilettantism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 239–240; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240913498658">1992</xref>: 252–253; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 103). This can again be seen as a continuum along which the cosmopolitan can advance, and which serves to distinguish between different cosmopolitans with respect to their local competence, as well as between different degrees of competence (from one local culture to another) within the same cosmopolitan person.</p>
<p>A subjective characteristic of cosmopolitanism is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240913498658">Hannerz (1992</xref>: 252) as ‘a willingness to engage with the Other, an intellectual and ethic stance of openness toward divergent cultural experiences’ (similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1475240913498658">Papastephanou, 2002</xref>: 69–70). This willingness to engage could even include individual dislike of what or who is open-mindedly engaged with. That is, the individual cosmopolitan, while able to engage with a local culture, is not necessarily committed through that engagement positively to endorse that culture, either in its entirety or with respect to components of it.</p>
<p>All this global–local engagement of the cosmopolitan makes travelling indispensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240913498658">Beck, 2000</xref>: 96; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240913498658">Clifford, 1992</xref>: 103); yet travelling is not sufficient unless done with the background of connaissance and the attitude of cultural engagement, lest it be mere tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 240–242; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240913498658">1992</xref>: 246–248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1475240913498658">Robbins, 1998a</xref>: 254). In contrast to a cosmopolitan, a ‘typical’ tourist lacks both the objective requirement of competence or mastery and the subjective requirement of pursuit of open-minded, deep and meaningful engagement with cultural diversity, and instead prefers to hang on to holiday stereotypes and cultural clichés with respect to the target culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240913498658">Bruckner, 1996</xref>: 247–249; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240913498658">Carter, 2001</xref>: 77). Taking out the ‘typical’ does, however, mean that even a cosmopolitan can engage in tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240913498658">Appiah, 1998</xref>: 91). A special case of mobility worth mentioning here are the so-called ‘Third Culture Kids’ (TCK) or ‘Global Nomads’. They have by definition already during their developmental years (as so-called kids) fulfilled the travelling aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240913498658">Langford, 1998</xref>: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240913498658">Pollock and Van Reken, 2001</xref>: 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1475240913498658">Tokuhama-Espinosa, 2003</xref>: 165). While this might give them a head start with respect to the formation of a cosmopolitan cultural identity, being a TCK does not yet make them cosmopolitan. One could thus see the travelling aspect again as a continuum that makes it possible for an individual to develop from tourist to cosmopolitan. Indeed, our investigated multilingual individuals defined an intermediate category of ‘advanced’ tourist on such a continuum.</p>
<p>Even if ‘at home in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240913498658">Brennan, 1997</xref>), the question of where ‘home’ is for the cosmopolitan individual is perplexing, even paradoxical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240913498658">Beck, 2002</xref>: 36; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1475240913498658">Turner, 2002</xref>: 60). With a variety of accessed and accessible cultures, acquired multicultural perspectives or identifications, home might not be the ‘home culture’ any more. For that reason, the ‘classical home’ as locals know it might have ceased to exist. Or, it might indeed be the classical home, albeit seen from the new cosmopolitan perspective, which would then alter its original meaning. Home could also take on an entirely new meaning formed from the multicultural perspective of the cosmopolitan individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 240, 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240913498658">1992</xref>: 253–254; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 110). Another possibility is a multiplicity of homes, combining several or all of the previous alternatives, while logically and logistically home cannot be everywhere. In the end, there is such a wide array of possible homes that this aspect, too, can be substantiated in the empirical part.</p>
<p>A very important and extensive discussion point in the literature is the relationship between cosmopolitanism and the nation-state or national identity. The general salience of the nation-state for identity issues is reflected in literature that does not treat cosmopolitanism but that describes national identity and the nation (state) as still the globally most prevalent single identity frame or reference point, compared to other possible identity frames or reference points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240913498658">Guibernau, 2001</xref>: 257; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1475240913498658">Moore, 2001</xref>: 56). Some writers are very mindful of the etymological classical Greek origin of the word ‘cosmopolitan’, namely <italic>kosmou politês</italic>, ‘citizen of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240913498658">Appiah, 2006</xref>: xiv; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240913498658">Carter, 2005</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240913498658">Heater, 2002</xref>: 7, 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240913498658">Kemp, 2011</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240913498658">Pollock, 2002</xref>: 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1475240913498658">Werbner, 2008</xref>: 2). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240913498658">Appiah (2006</xref>: xvi) asks whether we ‘are really supposed to abjure all local allegiances and partialities in the name of this vast abstraction, humanity’, he and others have put forward the notion of a ‘rooted cosmopolitanism, or … cosmopolitan patriotism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240913498658">1998</xref>: 91), which stresses the feasibility and necessity of having loyalties to nation-states as well as to larger and smaller entities:<disp-quote>
<p>The cosmopolitan patriot can entertain the possibility of a world in which <italic>everyone</italic> is a rooted cosmopolitan, attached to a home of his or her own, with its own cultural particularities, but taking pleasure from the presence of other, different, places that are home to other, different, people … [and have] not just the state, but the county, the town, the street, the business, the craft, the profession, the family, <italic>as</italic> communities, as circles among the many circles narrower than the human horizon, that are appropriate spheres of human concern. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240913498658">Appiah, 1998</xref>: 91–96, original emphases; similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240913498658">Bhabha, 1996</xref>: 202; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1475240913498658">Robbins, 1998b</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a useful summary of this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1475240913498658">Robbins (1998b</xref>: 8) suggests that ‘there is no simple relation between cosmopolitanism and the state’.</p>
<p>The nation-state discussion is then taken to the global level with the concept of ‘internationalism’, which yet by definition (still) centres on <italic>national</italic> (meaning <italic>nation-state</italic>) categories. This then represents logical, geographical, political and cultural limitations compared to cosmopolitanism. For instance, linking up with the ‘home’ aspect, internationalism cannot easily explain why a person’s home might actually be <italic>outside</italic> his or her own nation-state, or in several parts of the world, as symbolized in the cosmopolitan shorthand definition of ‘feeling at home in the world’. Furthermore, ‘being international’ is defined as having ‘attitudes which place the cultures and views of others on a par with one’s own’ or as ‘showing respect for others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240913498658">Hayden et al., 2000</xref>: 120). The possibility, then, of viewing other cultures and views <italic>above</italic> one’s own or showing <italic>more</italic> than just respect for others (for example, a strong emotional involvement or an emulation of local knowledge or habits) is better conceivable in cosmopolitanism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240913498658">Appiah (2006</xref>: 5) puts it in this context: ‘A cosmopolitan openness to the world is perfectly consistent with picking and choosing among the options you find in your search.’ Finally, cultural issues that are below or above the nation-state remit (for instance interest in small-scale local cultural diversity, like regions or cities, or an overarching identity dimension covering the whole world) are easier to capture with cosmopolitanism that we pre-defined above as ‘straddling the global and the local’.</p>
<p>Having discussed nation-states and internationalism, it is useful also to differentiate ‘globalization’ from cosmopolitanism. While globalization is associated with cultural uniformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1475240913498658">Sifakis and Sougari, 2003</xref>: 60) rather than with cultural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1475240913498658">Scholte, 2000</xref>: 23), cosmopolitanism is concerned only with the latter. Therefore, globalization defined as going ‘global and local at the same moment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240913498658">Hall, 1991</xref>: 27; similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240913498658">Held, 2010</xref>: 4) is not the same as our pre-defined ‘straddling of the global and the local’. Also, globalization started to be debated only in the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240913498658">Nicholson, 1999</xref>: 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1475240913498658">Scholte, 2000</xref>: 16), while cosmopolitanism’s much deeper historical roots were shown earlier.</p>

<title>Emerging empirical types of cosmopolitans</title>
<p>For the empirical part of a research project that investigated ‘cosmopolitanism’ related to ‘multilingualism’, I had analysed qualitative, exploratory, in-depth interviews with 11 multilingual, international post-graduate students at the University of Bath in England, selected as being the most multilingual students out of a larger overall sample. All of the interviewees had already mastered at least three and up to five foreign languages on an advanced working knowledge level in all four skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. While this article does not focus on the identity of multilingual persons, the literature agrees that much more research is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240913498658">Aronin and Ó Laoire, 2004</xref>: 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240913498658">Gunesch, 2008b</xref>: 74–81). Two writings however to be pointed out here, as some students reflected them strikingly, are those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240913498658">Susan Bassnett (2000</xref>: 66–71) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1475240913498658">George Steiner (1998</xref>: 12–127), who vividly describe several explanatory models for their multi-layered personal identities arising out of their many languages mastered. Thus in the empirical analysis against the theoretical framework, a pattern of three broad types of (multilingual) interviewee profiles emerged, which I called ‘advanced tourist’, ‘transitional cosmopolitan’ and ‘interactive cosmopolitan’. These three ideal types were compared to each other by means of an empirical <italic>synthesis</italic>. Each of the paragraph quotes corresponds to a statement made by one individual interviewee; in some places several of them below are assembled under an ideal type and aspect to stress the empirical synthesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240913498658">
<title>The advanced tourist</title>
<p>The advanced tourist’s identity dimensions centre on the local, regional or national. While rational stances are taken about being open and worldly, the emotional inner world reveals rather parochial or local limits with respect to the matrix issues of ‘identity dimensions’ as well as ‘home’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First of all I’m Basque, and afterwards a European. I don’t know; my European feelings haven’t been very developed yet.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Specifically with respect to language, the advanced tourist stresses more than the other two ideal types the <italic>professional usefulness</italic> of language learning, which suggest that the advanced tourist is a prototype of the literature concept of ‘transnational occupational cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 243, 246; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 108; similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1475240913498658">Robbins, 1998a</xref>: 254):<disp-quote>
<p>I think why I chose Spanish is especially because … Latin America is for Political Scientists a very interesting field of study … This was more utilitarian, to have more possibilities afterwards with the language … to find a job, in the now uniting Europe or in a job market that is getting more international every time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1475240913498658">
<title>The transitional cosmopolitan</title>
<p>Transitional cosmopolitans move along the continuum between the advanced tourist and the interactive cosmopolitan. Accordingly, they can have a profile more of an advanced tourist regarding certain matrix issues, such as the question of home, where national and even local attachments prevail, with wider attachments only established exceptionally:<disp-quote>
<p>I tend to live wherever I go … It’s where you are brought up, where you had your first friends, and where you live, where your parents’ house is … But then, you have other parts of the world where you feel very comfortable as well … Madrid … became my second home … It usually doesn’t happen … but when it happens, it’s something exceptional.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, transitional cosmopolitans have a very cosmopolitan attitude towards their (native) nation-state, with their expressions of sympathy for cultures abroad triggering criticism from compatriots:<disp-quote>
<p>The nation-state makes you homogeneous, and makes you patriotic, and gives you myths, gives you symbols, and gives you a whole set of ideas which are not very helpful if you want to live as a global person, and not as an ethnocentric person.</p>
<p>I have been treated as a xenomaniac by my friends sometimes … The fact that I can criticize Greece, it means that for them [the Greeks] I am a little bit of a foreigner.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1475240913498658">
<title>The interactive cosmopolitan</title>
<p>The interactive cosmopolitan reveals the most open-minded, flexible, holistic and giving attitude of the three ideal types, substantiating and contributing to core literature on cosmopolitanism. This type also has the most widespread and intensive linguistic mediation of (vital) matrix-generated categories. This means that for interactive cosmopolitans’ identities, languages are much more pervasive and important. For instance, they substantiate and personalize the link between multilingualism and cosmopolitanism by rephrasing and substantiating the key aspect of effort in one of the most advanced literary concepts of cosmopolitanism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240913498658">Bruckner’s (1996</xref>: 247) ‘finding joy and strength in overcoming habitual limits’ in linguistic terms when it comes to overcoming linguistic insecurities and learning stages:<disp-quote>
<p>[Learning and keeping up Dutch] was always kind of like a struggle, it was always hard to maintain, somehow. But … I could find out something that was beyond my limits … Through improving your language … you always go a step further.</p>
<p>I would really look forward to that [being in a culturally completely unfamiliar environment], if I could. When I went to Morocco … I was just so amazed … that … it was just totally different … a bit uncomfortable, but because I couldn’t speak the language …</p>
<p>I would be curious [in that culturally unfamiliar environment], nosy, would like to get to know … and would look for the keys … Keys being … language as a main source … Of course it’s also again feeling insecure, feeling incapable … but I think the feeling, or the eagerness of wanting to cope would be higher, or weigh more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the interactive cosmopolitan, language mastery allows for highly open and interactive two-way cultural access and engagement. Reflexivity about the link between language and culture, as altered by the linguistic-cultural experience, culminates in critical self-reflection about one’s own country and culture. This enables a highly interactive travel with a ‘giving’ element:<disp-quote>
<p>[Languages] mean the opportunity of learning … Not only learning about people … It also would inspire your personal view of things. It makes you more open … It makes me feel more that I know where I’m going, and getting to know people better.</p>
<p>If I travel, I like to talk with people, and to learn something about their country and to teach then something about mine … Language learning … it’s a way of education, it’s a way of learning not only more about other cultures but also about yourself … You can anticipate to give something.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The more interactive a person is, the more he or she sees the professional and the private aspects of learning and using foreign languages are indissolubly intertwined. The reasons for their learning and use also evolve from function or profession to mindset, worldview or aesthetics:<disp-quote>
<p>In contrast with European languages, you see that there are other systems, other ways of indicating things. For instance … my first inclination [of interest in the Arabic language] was because of the artistic way of writing. It’s really like a piece of art … It’s a beautiful language.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In terms of identity shifts related to languages, interactive cosmopolitans concede a ‘foreign identity’ but refuse to substantiate it linguistically. In a more developed version, they would be taken into ‘another sphere’ when using certain languages. This is almost on a par with the ‘strata’ or ‘onions’ dimensions described by just two authors on the identity of multilingual persons, namely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240913498658">Bassnett (2000</xref>: 66–67) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1475240913498658">Steiner (1998</xref>: 120–125):<disp-quote>
<p>I act differently when I speak Spanish. I’m more in the Spanish way of life. A bit more open, I’m more eager to say personal things … Maybe because values, education, family, and so on, brought with them, aren’t established in my Spanish identity. Spanish identity, of course is an exaggeration, but when I speak Spanish … of course I have several identities, but you can’t stick to the languages.</p>
<p>Speaking with a Dutch person carries me into another sphere. So kind of this cake [of my identity dimensions] changes and shifts, like from context to context … But a piece of it is definitely always Dutch … It’s another way of seeing, of perceiving, I think … of being aware of yourself and of other people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For an interactive cosmopolitan, language knowledge is not a causal, but an essential and indispensable, requirement for feeling at home. It is a matter of global identity, where languages serve as a passport or qualifier to access and cope in foreign environments:<disp-quote>
<p>Knowing the language well doesn’t make you feel at home. But you cannot feel at home unless you know the language.</p>
<p>The language that is necessary to cope in the [everyday] situations is a basic factor of feeling [at] home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interactive cosmopolitan picture of ‘home’ is highly differentiated, multi-dimensional and complex, strikingly reflecting two of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz’s (1990</xref>: 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 110) alternatives, namely of ‘a privileged site of nostalgia’, or ‘a comfortable place of familiar faces, where … there is some risk of boredom’. ‘Home’ can also be seen on different context-dependent geographical levels, triggering a complex diversity of dynamic interactions, and be embraced with an open attitude, besides involving multi-sensory perceptions:<disp-quote>
<p>[Home:] How boring, at first. But of course, it’s more than that … The word ‘home’ is ‘stick to the same place’, and I would like to move a lot … I would like to say that it is an uninteresting concept, but I still have some nostalgia towards home.</p>
<p>It [home] means people I relate to … But it’s not something where you’re born. It is also where you’re born, but other home places accumulate … It captures all of your senses, it’s what you see, it’s also what you smell … Then again it depends on the context … I would say that ‘a home’ is a place where I can live any mood, a range of different situations.</p>

<title>Comparing established research to lived practice</title>
<p>Having shown how multilingual students revealed themselves against the theoretical framework, I shall discuss some of my professional and personal experiences selected according to their perceived relevance for international pupils, students, educators and administrators. That most of these experiences tend to be in ‘institutions’, such as schools or universities, should help to build bridges between the individual pursuit of the cultural identity of cosmopolitanism, and more institutionalized frameworks within which much of the formal efforts at international education and citizenship development happen to be realized and written about. A corresponding professional aspect may sometimes resonate with the literature description of cosmopolitans as people ‘with credentials, decontextualized cultural capital’, representatives of ‘transnational occupational cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz, 1990</xref>: 243, 246; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>: 108; similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1475240913498658">Robbins 1998a</xref>: 254), but this too can be seen as the necessary consequence of our focus. Finally, I try not to link my account too often to cosmopolitan matrix features, or to corroborate it with interviewees’ voices, so as to inspire readers to bring the cosmopolitan model to (their own) life, and to fill it with their own stories.</p>
<sec id="section11-1475240913498658">
<title>The Western European (EU) experience</title>
<p>During a decade and a half of Western European academic experience, European open-mindedness and cultural diversity seemed to be elevated to a level of a professional obligation, or a <italic>conditio sine qua non</italic> for ‘success’. Even if doing this voluntarily, I felt that my private desire to <italic>experience</italic> diversity was also fuelled by an academic and politically correct pressure to <italic>qualify</italic> for it. Hence cultural and linguistic diversity and corresponding experiences were seen as required from the very beginning of university studies, even in relatively ‘nationally’ bound studies such as law. During the First State Examination period of my German Law degree, I specialized and attended courses in international law as well as participating in an international law moot court competition (debating a fictional case in front of real judges) at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. This in turn spurred me into learning Dutch (which over a decade later I would use to present my doctoral research at a conference in South Africa to speakers of Afrikaans). Subsequently, in order to complete a legal internship at the Association of Swedish Engineering Industries in Stockholm, I acquired a working knowledge of Swedish, which is relatively closely related to German.</p>
<p>During the Second State (Bar) Examination in Law, I chose as my final stage the Canadian-German Chamber of Commerce in Montreal. Since most German future barristers prefer spending this final revision period close to home, this meant again sacrificing local preparation and grade average for international experience. However, the depth of the Canadian experience more than compensated for it: the commercially oriented Chamber work offered different legal insights, while nearby McGill University offered a chance to take intensive night classes in Written and Oral English and French Business Communication. The unfamiliar commercial and linguistic aspects were intellectually as well as physically demanding. After a full workday at the Chamber, the classes were topped up by hours of homework. Cosmopolitan ‘engagement’ thus came at a high personal price. The results of those Montreal months, however, have always stayed with me: my French solidified (the Quebecois accent balancing the Parisian), and this was the place where I learnt most about the art of writing <italic>concisely</italic>.</p>
<p>A master’s degree in Contemporary European Political Cultures at the universities of Bath, Siena, Madrid and Paris was pursued explicitly to broaden my cultural, geographic and academic-departmental horizons in what I would find later expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240913498658">Hannerz (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240913498658">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240913498658">1996</xref>) as ‘connaissance’ and ‘metacultural position’. Consequently, doctoral studies in the Department of Education at the University of Bath, UK, provided the opportunity to reflect on and conceptualize all the previously made cultural and linguistic experiences. In that spirit, most of the time I lived in the library, feeling that even weekend work on the dissertation thesis was pure self-realization. Only when the campus shut down did I allow myself to practise what I preached, taking off to the Netherlands, Portugal, Catalonia and Greece to solidify those recently (or not yet fluently) acquired European languages. Upon doctoral graduation, I was able to communicate fluently, <italic>both</italic> linguistically <italic>and</italic> culturally, in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Dutch. Personally, for the first time in my life, by scaling European linguistic and cultural heights, I fully felt I was living up to the motto of the famous mountaineer Reinhold Messner, ‘I am what I do’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1475240913498658">
<title>The East Asian (China) experience</title>
<p>A post-doctoral Research Assistantship at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) of the University of London prepared me for a research post in Hong Kong, which in my view is <italic>the</italic> place where ‘East meets West’. Despite having read (what felt like) every available writing on Chinese/Eastern cultural values, for instance on ‘saving face’, nothing quite prepared me for the shock of feeling the consequences ‘first-face’ of small cultural missteps when I actually made my Chinese interlocutor ‘lose face’. For example, a desperate plea to repair the broken hot water connection in my room was taken personally, and the repercussions of that remark felt over the next few months.</p>
<p>The academic challenge was a research assistantship in a completely new area, namely in one of the world’s leading family therapy institutes, which however lasted only for the contractual six months and seemed too short. To extend my stay in Hong Kong, a research assistantship in the Department of English at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (for once in a partly familiar area, namely ‘professional multilingualism in Hong Kong’) was linguistically complemented by an intensive course in Modern Standard (Mandarin) Chinese at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Even more than in Canada, the demands of a full-time research position combined with a full-time student workload (even if officially coordinated with both sides) brought me right to my intellectual and physical limits. Weekends had to be completely sacrificed, and sleep reduced to cope with continuous double shifts.</p>
<p>The language experience was made more ‘authentic’, but also more demanding, owing to me being the only non-Asian student among Japanese, Cantonese and Korean classmates who were almost ‘by birth’ much more familiar with the complex Chinese characters. Despite this, I successfully completed three levels, from Beginners to Advanced. Until my later Arabian experience, this was my greatest (and in just about every way hardest) achievement of combining academic-linguistic learning with personal-cultural growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1475240913498658">
<title>The Central American (Panama) experience</title>
<p>An international academic conference presentation made during my stay in Hong Kong brought an offer from the two Laureate International Universities in Panama City to be an English teacher and academic director at its two English Language Centres, which provided language instruction or improvement for all university departments.</p>
<p>This was my first managerial responsibility and it somewhat clashed with my linguistic background and expectations of what can realistically be demanded of students and teachers, especially in a relatively relaxed Latin American culture. My longstanding ‘Northern/Western’, and recently also ‘Far Eastern’, academic discipline and achievement spirit needed more cultural flexibility than I had at the time, to fully fit with the local ‘Latin laidback-ness’ and ‘relationship connectivity’ (Panamanian words for this are ‘Rosca’, meaning ‘file’ to remove problems, or ‘Pull’, symbolizing leverage). Hence I only lasted a year as academic director before my European-imported language learning materials and method were changed back to the previous local system.</p>
<p>In the spirit of broadening of cultural horizons even in the face of sacrifices, I accepted a professorship (which in ‘Northern’ systems would correspond merely to a lectureship) in global business. Over the next three years, I taught more than 20 management and cultural studies subjects in its bilingual (English/Spanish) and accredited double-degree (US/Panama) undergraduate as well as executive MBA programme. For once, the local language had already been mastered before entering the country. Yet the new academic area was, intellectually at least, in many ways a return to school: I actually had to study the material myself before being able to present and request my students to master it. These demands felt like a ‘biological rejuvenation’, similar to my first student days at law school, and since it was not German law any more but now a truly wide-ranging global subject area, it was also intellectually a ‘window to a new world’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1475240913498658">
<title>The Middle Eastern (Arabian) experience</title>
<p>The Panamanian subject area continued in a different geographical and cultural area: in the United Arab Emirates. This opened up the chance to fulfil my childhood dream of learning about the language, culture and perceived adventure of the <italic>Arabian Nights</italic> in one of the most dynamic cities on the planet, being accommodated in Dubai itself. Geographically and culturally presenting itself as even more global than London or Hong Kong, situated between the ‘developed’ and the ‘developing’ world, and with imported investments prominently displayed everywhere in the forms of technical expertise or working manpower, Dubai combines <italic>both</italic> ‘North and South’ <italic>and</italic> ‘East meets West’, in a motto that I would describe as ‘everyone meets everything’.</p>
<p>The academic demands on students at the Emirati ‘colleges’ seemed to be considerably higher than in the Panamanian ‘universities’. Embracing this, I still found it hard to follow the strict standards for teaching materials, course outlines, learning outcomes, exam specifications or administrative guidelines. After all the cosmopolitan cultural growing and academic freedom enjoyed all over the world in the past, these constraints seemed a formidable challenge to local cultural and professional adaptation.</p>
<p>One of the motivators to accept this challenge was my desire to study the Arab world, linguistically and culturally. As in the Chinese context, I was aware of the possibility that I might never master this language to a degree to be able to rely on it exclusively. I saw it as a key that might open one or several doors in this culture, but not the entire house. On that humble basis, it was possible to strive for a blending of professional and private pursuits in the long term, even if only in terms of being able to engage with a part of the Arab world on cultural and linguistic terms, not forgetting the simple but potentially profound pleasure that this cosmopolitan engagement might bring. Similar to the earlier ‘interactive cosmopolitan’ feature of merging professional and private motives for language learning, and one interviewee describing the beauty of written Arabic, my learning about the local language and culture language coalesced into an aesthetical-practical philosophy of seeking art and beauty even in everyday pursuits.</p>
<p>This professional and cultural adaptation, and a somewhat slower language progress in Arabic compared to most previous language learning experiences (with the exception of Chinese), still make this life stage and experience a very demanding one to go through. However, with more cultural insights, professional development, personal acceptance and linguistic immersion there is concrete evidence that I am currently scaling the steepest professional and personal learning curve in my life so far. This process is still ongoing, and the Arabian experience still being written.</p>

<title>Summarizing lessons from theory and life</title>
<p>After linguistic-cultural experiences in four different corners of the world, I cannot say any more whether I am German, or any of the other nationalities which I have honestly, at some point in my itinerary, felt to ‘be’ more: Italian, Spanish or Brazilian. During my first few weeks of the masters module in Spain, fresh out of Italy, <italic>everyone except me</italic> thought I was Italian, and I was actually able to speak <italic>only</italic> that language at that time. During my stay in Brazil, <italic>everyone including me</italic> thought I was Brazilian. Leaving Brazil, I tried to maintain that notion by spontaneously introducing myself to new acquaintances as a <italic>Carioca</italic> – a native of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>While <italic>nobody</italic> takes me to be British, <italic>that</italic> is what I feel to be <italic>academically</italic>, since all my meaningful (and truly enjoyed) scholarship and training comes from Britain, and I have written this article largely against its educational blueprint. Disciplinarily, I feel an academic not of my original backgrounds (law and politics) but of my later acquired ones (education, cultural studies and languages). Emotionally, I am <italic>most reluctant</italic> about the area in which I have been active for the <italic>longest</italic> time in my teaching career (business).</p>
<p>Next to my German passport, I keep the collected official Identity Cards of the Republic of Panama, of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong in China and of the United Arab Emirates. Next to those, I keep all the versions of official working visas or student identity cards (such as the ISIC) obtained in every country I ever worked and/or studied in. I can read every word written on them, and it took a long and tiring time of bureaucratic ‘runarounds’ to obtain each. They are just of symbolic value, even those that are valid for several years, and are probably the least important documents that I have accumulated – compared to certificates, photographs, letters and other memories. Yet as mere symbols of something that I even <italic>criticize</italic> personally – national borders as a basis of differentiation – they mean to me that in the current era, one can be a world citizen who is qualified and empowered purely by <italic>international education</italic>, and who can access invaluable cultural riches in a respectful and sustainable manner via acquired <italic>linguistic</italic> expertise and <italic>cosmopolitan</italic> cultural curiosity and respect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1475240913498658">
<title>Offering insights from one’s own life</title>
<p>A comment on an earlier version of this article suggested that there might be a more feasible route to become internationally minded than the one I have taken, and that one need not be so multi-lingual and extensively travelled to acquire a cultural identity that straddles the global and the local. It was even suggested that by comparison some readers might feel they have barely left the ‘advanced tourist’ post. The aspect of effort has been omitted from the cosmopolitan model as it is not exclusive to it but probably part of any worthwhile human endeavour. We might therefore wish to look beyond external indications of ‘success’, and instead at encompassing involvements of ‘self’.</p>
<p>To reply with an earlier interviewee quote, I would say that: ‘Knowing the language well doesn’t make you feel at home. But you cannot feel at home unless you know the language.’ Another interviewee had formulated her impression of the relationship between language knowledge and cosmopolitan identity like this: ‘Knowing the languages does not make you cosmopolitan. But you cannot be as cosmopolitan without the languages as with them.’ So neither multilingualism nor cosmopolitanism is about competitive zero-sum-game achievement, but about constructive personal and mutual enrichment. The ‘interactive cosmopolitan’ interviewees expressed very nicely that the more you give of yourself to the cultures and people of this world, the more you get back from them, and the model’s continua were described as stages of individual development but also as overarching philosophies of cultural sharing.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s ‘the limits of my language are the limits of my world’ means to me also ‘the limits of our identities are the limits of our world’. Something can be done about language, identity and world via the Chinese saying ‘before improving the world, go three times through your own house’: we improve linguistically, we might notice changes in identity, and the world will probably take care of itself in the process. In a free paraphrase of the well-known verse that appears in both the Talmud (Folia 37a) and the Qu’ran (Fifth Sura), and that has found its way into popular global culture for instance through a quote in the movie <italic>Schindler’s List</italic>, maybe by improving parts of our own life we can improve the whole world after all.</p>
<p>Put simply, I am a citizen of the world – no more, but no less either – who still makes mistakes and feels uneasy, or downright bad, in many situations in any culture, but with the capacity to make in that cultural context a home, assisted by the language, and in the process contributing to intercultural understanding via local and global educational citizenship. While the holistic construction of a cosmopolitan personal cultural identity might never be finished – if only because we can never know all the languages or cultures of the world – a Taoist ‘the way is the goal’ philosophy could inspire the continuous effort to weave the model into our cultural fabric on the path of individual development.</p>
<p>Thus, even the seemingly eclectic mix of sources in this section underpinning this path could be seen as an honest quest for the best of the world’s diversity, so as to be the best not only for ourselves, but for our fellow world citizens as well. It might in the end be the limitation of its ambition to individual (and not societal) cultural identity that the cosmopolitan model might be able to combine personal humility with practical effectiveness. It does not (yet) have any large-scale societal – and much less political – power, but its increasing scientific and popular interest might herald its potential for long-term transformation on a larger scale. On this note, as this writing also set out to contribute to more institutionalized local and global citizenship programs, this shall be the concluding part of our journey together.</p>

<title>Potential contributions to more institutionalized local and global citizenship programmes</title>
<p>We have critiqued the concepts of the ‘typical cosmopolitan’ and the ‘typical tourist’ as extremes which cannot adequately encompass empirical reality. A detailed development of the model of cosmopolitanism, which has more historical roots than today’s all-pervasive notions of globalization or internationalism, recently resuscitated in academic discussion, provides a more accurate model for the analysis of real-life, historical phenomena and attitudes to identity of real people. That cosmopolitanism models this in the present-day context of world-wide demand for foreign language knowledge makes it all the more suitable as a theoretical tool to foster foreign language learning in our time.</p>
<p>‘International education’ and ‘understanding’ has hitherto focused on ‘internationalism’, and basically only within its own institutional settings. These limitations could be challenged by cosmopolitanism as related to the individual learner rather than ‘international education’ or ‘international schools’. An international education inspired by it can now be based, less on an educational context such as a particular type of school or a purpose arising from particular views of the ‘needs’ of contemporary global society, but rather on a clear conceptualization of the outcomes, in terms of ‘identity’ or ‘the individual’, as outlined summarily above.</p>
<p>This suggests a possible model for the individual outcomes of an international education. Certain educational objectives implicit in the model and its overarching educational purpose, summarized as ‘world citizenship as individual engagement with cultural diversity’, might even be more suitable for the individual than ‘international education’ or ‘international schools’, if one sees those rather as derivative concepts. In any case, as this model is neither narrowly prescriptive regarding educational experience or curriculum, nor predicated on any specific educational programme, it might in turn be even <italic>more suitable</italic> as a source of definition, or at least inspiration, of such an education.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism need not <italic>replace</italic> internationalism, but can <italic>enrich</italic> inter/national identity and cultural attachments <italic>if and where</italic> that proves to be advantageous to the philosophy of ‘international education’ in the sense of ‘international understanding’. It can provide a cultural depth of engagement with other cultures, loci and locals which internationalism, for its inherent traditional geographical, geopolitical and political definition and scope, even within the educational context of international education, cannot provide. But above all, it can represent a personal identity of knowledge of and engagement with cultural diversity, which in the end is part and parcel of the notion of ‘international’ or ‘intercultural’ understanding that lies at the core of international education. As such, it can be an agenda of international education for the individual in terms of development (along the continua and criteria suggested) of the characteristics of a cosmopolitan person. The notion of continua of development would allow for multiple agendas to suit the wide range of ‘clients’ found in a wide range of international schools, thus even including locals and various degrees of ‘tourists’.</p>
<p>With clarity in our educational aims regarding the development of the individual, we can then usefully engage in practical issues such as curriculum and school management. There are important educational implications of the cosmopolitan analysis presented here, but these are open to translation into practice in a diversity of ways in both international and national education systems. It is for this combination of freedom of programmatic constraints, motivation by specific feasible aims, and substantiation by specific workable criteria, that cosmopolitanism can soundly and emphatically inspire intercultural understanding via local and global citizenship, now and in the future.</p>
