<p>The taken-for-granted assumption that breast milk is superior to formula is not based on scientific fact, according to this well-written book, but rather the combination of inconclusive scientific studies, the United States’ culture of avoiding risk, and the ideology of motherhood. This book does not take a stand on whether women should breast or bottle feed. Instead, it unpacks how the prevailing wisdom that breastfeeding is better for infants’ short- and long-term health has come to be and the consequences of that wisdom for expectations of mothers.</p>
<p>Wolf’s book is organized into six chapters. The first chapter provides background information on the cultural and medical forces that have resulted in a dominant belief that breastfeeding is best. Chapter two analyzes a large body of scientific research on the benefits of breastfeeding and aptly demonstrates that correlation does not equal causation. Although many observational studies find a positive relationship between breast milk and children’s health, they cannot rule out other explanations that have not been controlled, most importantly behaviors associated with sustained breastfeeding. Those behaviors, rather than breast milk alone, may affect children’s health including lower rates of obesity, diabetes, asthma, ear and respiratory infections, and cognitive development. Only lower gastrointestinal infections are clearly associated with breast milk compared to formula. In addition to maternal behavior, Wolf argues that research should examine how resources like flexible jobs, social networks, and safe neighborhoods available to those who breastfeed at higher rates, namely, economically privileged mothers, may affect children’s health.</p>
<p>Why do doctors and popular media promote the positive effects of breastfeeding when scientific studies are inconclusive? Wolf persuasively shows through a synthesis of past research that many physicians rely on abstracts to understand studies’ major findings. Therefore, doctors may overlook the discussion of studies’ limitations, including confounding variables, such as mothers’ behaviors. Wolf examines a range of issues with the popular media from journalists not questioning studies’ hypotheses to the dwindling resources of media outlets. Also, journalists report the benefits of breastfeeding as fact rather than a possibility because scientific language on statistical significance is misunderstood as medically important. In other words, a positive statistical relationship between breast milk and health outcomes is reported as medical evidence that breastfeeding is best.</p>
<p>The next two chapters focus on the prevalence of personal responsibility in a risk culture, and the ideology of what Wolf terms “total motherhood” to further Wolf’s argument that the imperative to breastfeed occurs in a broader social and political context with problematic consequences for women. Wolf persuasively argues that an increasing focus on risk in science, public health, and popular discourse frames women as more responsible than ever for children’s health. Chapter 4 on total motherhood covers familiar arguments about social and medical pressures put on women before and after pregnancy to ensure children’s health at all costs. This chapter would be stronger with less discussion of the wide range of ways motherhood is constructed, and a greater focus on empirical research on how medical and cultural pressures to breastfeed affect mothers. Instead, Wolf briefly presents examples of women’s attempts to breastfeed in blog posts and newspaper letters as evidence “of a dedication to total motherhood” (p. 106).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 provides a case study of the U.S. Health and Human Services National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign (NBAC) from 2004 to 2006 as a striking example of the government’s efforts to scare women into breastfeeding. The campaign overstated breast feedings’ benefits and ignored structural inequalities that may affect breastfeeding rates. The evidence presented of “many mothers” who felt guilty or “like a failure” for bottle feeding, however, is based on mothers’ quotes in <italic>Parenting Magazine</italic> and <italic>Newsweek</italic> (p. 136). Incorporating a synthesis of literature on women’s experiences of bottle- or breastfeeding would strengthen the book’s argument that scientific, public health, and popular discourses negatively affect women who do not breastfeed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the book provides an important critique of how scientific knowledge about the benefits of breast milk is disseminated as objective fact in a culture that increasingly frames health in terms of risk and constructs individual women as primarily responsible for children’s health. The conclusion emphasizes that women should be provided accurate information about the advantages and disadvantages of bottle and breast, and that both choices can be feminist ones. Either way, children’s health outcomes should not be attributed solely to mothers’ feeding decisions. Structural changes are needed to support all children’s health.</p>
<p>This provocative book could be adopted for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in Sociology and Women’s Studies on gender and health, public health, health policy, and methods. The chapters that critique scientific studies on breast milk’s purported benefits would be useful for discussions in any course on gender, epistemology and science, methods, and the politics of research.</p>
