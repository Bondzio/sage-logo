<p>Most research on occupational stress and health examines singular psychosocial or physical work characteristics. Occasionally, the interactive health effects of multiple psychosocial and physical work characteristics are examined. Most approaches to occupational stress and health, however, do not fully capture the complex, dynamic ecological context of work stress. This article proposes and tests a model of cumulative risk, a concept adapted from developmental psychology, as an alternative perspective on occupational stress and health. Cumulative risk models categorize singular psychosocial or physical work characteristics dichotomously as risks or stressors that are either present or absent for each worker. Cumulative risk is then the simple additive summation of these multiple dichotomous categories. Herein, the authors show in two different work settings (clerical offices and primary care hospitals) that the accumulation of relatively modest, low levels of multiple physical and psychosocial stressors is associated with multiple indicators of well-being, including fatigue, job stress, and psychological distress. The cumulative risk index, unlike singular risk exposures, predicts well-being. Furthermore, these associations replicate in two quite different work settings and are statistically independent of a control for negative affectivity, a general indicator of neuroticism.</p>

<p>The workplace has been conceptualized as a complex ecological system comprised of a dense web of interdependent social and physical factors that, together, affect the performance and experience of individuals and teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510389981">Becker, 2004, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510389981">Becker &amp; Steele, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510389981">Danielsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916510389981">Steele, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510389981">Sundstrom, 1986</xref>). Although considerable research has been done examining how individual psychosocial and, to a lesser extent, physical factors affect the health, performance, and well-being of workers, relatively little research has examined the possibility that factors which do not generate significant levels of stress when considered individually may well do so when considered in combination. In two pilot studies, this article explores cumulative risk, a concept adapted from developmental psychology, as an alternative perspective on occupational stress and health. Cumulative risk categorizes risk dichotomously (present or absent) for each worker’s exposure to a particular work setting characteristic, whether psychosocial or physical. It offers an additional and promising methodological perspective for understanding the complex web of interdependent factors that cumulatively may contribute to adverse worker outcomes such as stress.</p>

<title>Multivariate Conceptualizations of Work Environments</title>
<p>The idea that isolation of specific personal, social, or physical risk factors does not adequately capture the ecology of work is not new. Work environment scholars have long appreciated the multivariate nature of the ecology of work. Perhaps the two best-known multivariate formulations of occupational stress and health are person–environment fit and job strain.</p>
<p>Person–environment fit models of work settings posit that the interaction of worker characteristics (e.g., personality) and work environment conditions (e.g., job control) provide better insight into the etiology of job stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510389981">French, Caplan, &amp; Harrison, 1982</xref>) than each factor considered separately. This insight led to a plethora of studies examining interactions between individual worker characteristics and work psychosocial characteristics (e.g., workload demands) on health and behavioral outcomes. Overall, modest support emerged for person–environment fit models of work environments and human well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510389981">Baker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510389981">Caplan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510389981">Kristof, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510389981">Sparks &amp; Cooper, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Job strain, the additive combination of high workload demands and low job control, has proven to be a highly generative model of occupational stress and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510389981">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510389981">Sauter, Hurrell, &amp; Cooper, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510389981">Schnall, Landsbergis, &amp; Baker, 1994</xref>). Many job strain studies have found that neither workload demands or job control alone precipitated ill health—only the combined effect of the dual risk factors was pathological. Furthermore, the addition of other occupational risk factors, such as low social support, or poor organizational climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510389981">Johnson &amp; Hall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510389981">Sparks &amp; Cooper, 1999</xref>) as well as the integration of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510389981">Parker &amp; Sprigg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510389981">Parkes, 1991</xref>), into job strain and health models have provided additional explanatory variance.</p>
<p>A few investigators have explored the consequences of more than two or three multiple physical risks at work and health outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510389981">Oldham and Fried (1987)</xref> found that office lighting, room enclosure, crowding, and personal space intrusions interacted to accentuate the adverse impacts of each singular physical risk factor on job satisfaction and worker turnover among female clerical workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510389981">Melamed and colleagues (1999)</xref> showed that the risk of occupational injury was linearly related to the total additive combination of physical risk factors encountered on the job among male factory workers. Parallel results were found for fatigue and general health symptoms among seafaring workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916510389981">Wadsworth, Allen, McNamara, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). One limitation of such multivariate formulations of work environments is that they are typically restricted to two or, on occasion, three psychosocial constructs. Cumulative risk offers an analytic alternative allowing for the simultaneous consideration of a much larger number of psychosocial and physical characteristics of work settings.</p>
<p>The concept of cumulative risk emerged from statistical and conceptual limitations in multivariate models of human development. The ecological context of human development, similar to work settings, consists of personal, social, and physical processes that interrelate to shape the character and functioning of the developing human over time. Main effect or single variable models of human development quickly progressed to multivariate representations of the ecology of human development, recognizing that the interplay of personal, social, and physical processes yielded a more accurate and complete picture of how humans develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510389981">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>). Empirical investigations of this multivariate ecology of human development, however, quickly confronted a major obstacle. Multivariate models, particularly higher order models with multiple interaction terms, lack statistical power. Moreover, human ability to comprehend higher order statistical interactions is limited.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the situation is analogous for occupational stress and health. Most workers, the majority of the time, suffer few or no ill effects when exposed to a singular occupational stressor. However, the accumulation of exposure to multiple occupational stressors is more likely to produce ill effects.</p>
<p>Because of the statistical and interpretive limitations of multivariate interaction analysis methods, a quarter of a century ago, Sir Michael Rutter, an eminent British child psychiatrist, proposed an alternative analytic model, cumulative risk. It developed from a fact well known to family physicians and other clinicians: Children who confront a single trauma, even if rather severe, tend to be resilient. Most children, the majority of the time, came through various stressful life events largely intact physically and psychologically. However, as the number of risk exposures increased, physical and psychological well-being were rapidly compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510389981">Rutter, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389981">1993</xref>). This relationship has proven quite robust in the developmental literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510389981">Evans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510389981">Sameroff, Bartko, Baldwin, Baldwin, &amp; Seifer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389981">Rutter’s (1993)</xref> cumulative risk theory, personal, social, and physical risk factors are modeled additively. For each individual or environmental characteristic, a dichotomous classification of risk exposure is determined. This is done either on the basis of theory (e.g., low birth weight = risk) or according to a statistical cutoff (e.g., &gt;1 standard deviation above the mean for residential relocations = risk). Cumulative risk is then calculated as the simple summation of the various dichotomous personal and environmental risk factors.</p>
<p>The field of stressful life events implicitly employs the same model, counting up the number of different stressors one has been exposed to and summing the number of exposures for an overall index of life-event exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510389981">Turner &amp; Wheaton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510389981">Wethington, Brown, &amp; Kessler, 1995</xref>). Two important differences between the cumulative risk and stressful life-events approaches, respectively, are as follows: (a) Cumulative risk typically defines exposure as the high end of the frequency distribution, either using a statistical cutoff (e.g., &gt;1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) or theory (e.g., low birth weight); whereas, stressful live events methodology counts the frequency of stressors, regardless of their severity and (b) cumulative risk models typically categorize risks or stressors by domains and then counts the number of domains in which high risk/stress occurs. Each of these domains, as in the present article, often consists of multi-item scales or observations to assess the risk or stressor. Stressful life events typically just add the number of events, drawing no distinctions across different domains. There are a few exceptions to this in the life-events literature; however, most typically categorize event domains in a much broader manner such as by counting only negative events or only events that are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that cumulative risk theory, derived from developmental psychology, may provide a useful heuristic to examine the ecology of work stress and human well-being. Exposure to low to moderate levels of singular psychosocial or physical work stressors often has minor or no consequence. However, when relatively modest levels of multiple psychosocial and physical work stressors are confronted in combination, adverse outcomes may emerge. Herein, we explore the application of this additive cumulative risk formulation to two different work settings, offices and hospitals, which employ a large segment of the U.S. workforce.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0013916510389981">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and thirty-five female clerical workers (18 to 55 years of age) at a medium-sized, northeastern university agreed to participate in a study of working conditions and human health. We restricted our sample to women because the population size of male clerical workers available was too small. Only nonsupervisory staff who had been in their current position for at least 1 year were eligible to participate. Each respondent received a raffle ticket good for round-trip air travel to any place in the United States. Four prizes were awarded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916510389981">
<title>Procedures and measures</title>
<p>Each participant was contacted individually and provided a short questionnaire incorporating standardized scales of job stress, job satisfaction, physical health and fatigue, and mental health. Job stress was measured by a seven item, 4-point scale (e.g., “How tense do you feel at work?”; α = .88) that has undergone extensive psychometric work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510389981">Pearlin &amp; Schooler, 1978</xref>). Job satisfaction was assessed by a visual ladder scale (bottom rung = 0 [<italic>not satisfied</italic>]; top rung = 10 [<italic>very satisfied</italic>]). This type of scale is routinely used in life satisfaction surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510389981">Campbell, Converse, &amp; Rodgers, 1976</xref>). For physical health, each respondent was asked to compare herself to others of the same age (1 = <italic>poor</italic>, 4 = <italic>excellent health</italic>). This comparative assessment of physical health has proven reliable and valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510389981">Krout &amp; Wethington, 2003</xref>). Fatigue was assessed with an 11-item standardized index focused on postwork experiences (e.g., “At the end of a work day, I am really worn out” Yes__ No__; α = .83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510389981">Sluiter, 1999</xref>). Mental health was assessed with a 5-item scale designed to assess psychological distress in the general population (e.g., “During the last month, have you felt downhearted and blue” 6 = <italic>most of the time</italic>, 1 = <italic>none of the time</italic>; α = .82). This scale is regularly used in survey work because of its reliability and convergence with in-depth clinical evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510389981">Berwick et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Social characteristics of the work setting (workload demands, job control, and social support) were also included in the respondent questionnaire. Workload demands and job control were each measured on five item, 1 to 4 Likert-type subscales of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389981">NIOSH, 1994</xref>) Job Environment Scale that were derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510389981">Karasek’s (1979)</xref> Scale. Internal reliability estimates for the present sample compared favorably with NIOSH data (demands α = .78; control α = .82). Social support at work from supervisors and coworkers was also reliable (α = .79). This six-item subscale came from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389981">NIOSH (1994)</xref> Job Environment Scale. Based on factor analytic work and checks for reliability, we shortened the respective NIOSH Scales to reduce respondent burden. As indicated, estimates of reliability compared favorably to the original, longer subscales.</p>
<p>Physical work characteristics noise (five items), maintenance and appearance (seven items), and natural elements (four items) were assessed by trained raters using an observational checklist developed by the authors. Each work characteristic consisted of multiple items that were averaged to obtain an index. For natural elements and maintenance, individual items were standardized because of varying response formats on specific scale items. Interobserver reliabilities (<italic>Ebel r</italic>) for the three respective physical work characteristics were .79, .86, and .92.</p>
<p>Cumulative risk was calculated by first dichotomizing each social and physical exposure into 0 (<italic>no risk</italic>) and 1 (<italic>risk</italic>). Risk was defined as exposure to more than one standard deviation above the mean for workload and noise and less than one standard deviation below the mean for control, support, maintenance, and nature for the entire sample of 135 clerical workers. Then the six dichotomous risk variables were summed for each participant (i.e., cumulative risk = 0 to 6 per respondent).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510389981">Table 1</xref> provides descriptive data on the six work environment risk factors and cumulative risk. Because the frequency of exposure to levels of cumulative risk above 3 was very small (&lt;5%), cumulative risk was recoded for subsequent inferential analyses into 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 risk factors. As one would expect for clerical workers in a university setting, the average levels of risk exposure are low and the variance within each variable rather restricted.</p>

<p>As the outcome variables are all self-reports and some of the work risk factors are also dependent on worker perception, we included an assessment of negative affectivity as a statistical control. Negative affect, closely aligned with neuroticism, influences self-reports both of environmental conditions and personal symptoms and feelings. Therefore, when one measures both predictors and outcomes with self-report variables, negative affect can lead to spurious relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510389981">Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989</xref>). To at least partially offset this possibility, we assessed negative affectivity with the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510389981">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>) and then incorporated it into our inferential analysis as a statistical control. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510389981">Table 3</xref>, cumulative risk, statistically partialling negative affectivity, is significantly related to each of the outcome variables. Higher cumulative risk at work is related to more job stress and fatigue, lower physical and mental health, and reduced job satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of additional interest, each of the significant correlations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510389981">Table 3</xref> between cumulative risk exposure and the outcome variables remains statistically significant when statistically controlling for any one of the singular risk factors. For example, the correlation between cumulative risk and job stress remains significant when any one of the singular risk factors that contribute to cumulative risk is also added to the model. This means that above and beyond the impact of any one singular risk factor on health or well-being, cumulative risk still explains a significant amount of residual variation in these outcomes. However, the opposite is not true. If we control for cumulative risk, none of the singular risk factors that constitute the additive accumulation of stressor exposure remains statistically significant in predicting health or well-being.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<sec id="section8-0013916510389981">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>In comparison to industrial workers, white-collar office workers throughout North America and Europe encounter relatively few major psychosocial or physical environmental problems in their places of work. Thus, it is not surprising given the relatively high quality of these workplaces that few singular psychosocial or physical characteristics of workplaces correlate strongly with worker health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510389981">Barling, Kelloway, &amp; Frone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510389981">McCoy &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>). However, the data in Study 1 suggest that if one examines the accumulation of relatively minor work problems in the social and physical settings of modern office buildings, a different picture emerges. As the level of cumulative risk exposures escalates, adverse health and behavioral outcomes emerge (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510389981">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510389981">3</xref>).</p>
<p>To further test the cumulative risk approach, we conducted a second study among a different sample of workers, primary care hospital nurses, whose work is characterized by high levels of occupational stress, burnout, and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510389981">McVicar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510389981">Parkes, 1986</xref>). The second study allows us to explore whether the cumulative risk model works in an occupational sector, nursing, where one would expect more challenging working conditions than found in the typical clerical job at a university.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section10-0013916510389981">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 191 female nurses (licensed vocational nurses or registered nurses) involved in primary care delivery during day shifts (25 to 55 years of age) at four different, medium-sized, community hospitals participated. As in Study 1, because very few eligible participants were men, we restricted our sample to women. Only nonsupervisory nursing staff who had been in their current position for at least 1 year were eligible to participate. Each respondent received a US$10 gift certificate to a local major merchant (e.g., Target). The refusal rate to participate was less than 10%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013916510389981">
<title>Procedures and measures</title>
<p>Each participant was contacted individually and provided a short questionnaire incorporating standardized scales of job stress, job satisfaction, physical health and fatigue, and mental health. Workload demands, job control, social support, job stress, fatigue, and mental and physical health were measured with the same respective scales as used in Study 1. Job satisfaction was assessed by a single item scale (1 = <italic>not very satisfied</italic> to 4 = <italic>very satisfied</italic>) from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389981">NIOSH (1994)</xref> Occupational Stress Battery.</p>
<p>Role ambiguity was from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510389981">NIOSH (1994)</xref> Workplace Stress Scale and had comparable internal consistency (α = .67). One sample item from the six items was “I work with two or more groups who operate quite differently” (1 = <italic>often</italic>, 4 = <italic>never</italic>). Technological stress was assessed by a four-item scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510389981">Ogan and Chung (2003)</xref>. The scale is reliable (α = .71) containing items such as “How often does time lost on the job because of technology failure cause you stress”? (1 = <italic>often</italic>, 4 = <italic>never</italic>). Physical work characteristics of noise and crowding were assessed by trained observers. The noise scale was the same as used in Study 1. Crowding (three items) was based on ratings of space availability and situations where nurses had to squeeze by one another. Ratings of maintenance and of natural elements were dropped from the hospital study because of invariance. The addition of three new dimensions of occupational stress in Study 2 (role ambiguity, technological stress, and crowding) were based on the nursing stress literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510389981">McVicar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510389981">Parkes, 1986</xref>) and from pilot qualitative interviews and observations of nurses.</p>
<p>Cumulative risk was calculated as in Study 1 by first dichotomizing each social and physical exposure into 0 (no risk) or 1 (risk) based on values more [less] than one standard deviation from the mean. Then the seven dichotomous risk variables (workload, control, role ambiguity, technological stress, social support, crowding, and noise) were summed for each participant (i.e., cumulative risk = 0 to 7 per respondent).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The present findings have potentially important theoretical and policy implications for work environments, occupational stress, and human health and behavior. From a theoretical standpoint, these data reveal, much like the large body of evidence with children, that exposure to low to moderate levels of risk are largely inconsequential as long as one examines one risk factor at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510389981">Ackerman, Kogos, Youngstrom, Schoff, &amp; Izard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510389981">Evans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510389981">Evans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389981">Rutter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510389981">Sameroff et al., 1998</xref>). However, if one examines the accumulation of exposure to multiple, albeit rather modest levels of risk exposure in modern office and health care settings, negative health and behavioral outcomes become apparent. As the number of suboptimal social and physical risks in the workplace increases, negative health and behavioral outcomes rise. Thus, traditional approaches to the study of singular, work environment characteristics in isolation may underestimate the true worker burden of poorly designed and managed work settings. The complex, dynamic multivariate nature of the ecological context of work is not well represented in traditional single main effect or simple interaction models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510389981">Becker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510389981">Becker &amp; Steele, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510389981">Evans, Johansson, &amp; Carrere, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510389981">McCoy &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the cumulative risk metric is its ability to model a large number of risk factors without the major statistical and interpretive limitations of multivariate interaction formulations. Cumulative risk models also reflect the natural covariation of risk factors in work settings. As an illustration, people with less education tend to work in settings that are high in workload demands and low in job control, and are exposed to more hazardous physical conditions such as noise, crowding, and toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510389981">Berney et al., 2000</xref>). A confluence of physical and social risk exposures on the job is much more common among low-wage workers, workers who are disproportionately non-White, and, in many societies, women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510389981">Evans &amp; Kantrowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510389981">Frumkin &amp; Walker, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Cumulative risk offers a model of the ecology of occupational stress and health that builds on and extends the foundations of multivariate models of work stress provided by person–environment fit and job strain models. It enables the conceptualization and measurement of a wider range of psychosocial and physical work setting characteristics without making assumptions about the degree of independence among singular work characteristics. Cumulative risk models do not require very large sample sizes to achieve requisite statistical power to analyze higher order interaction terms. Most importantly, as repeatedly shown in the child development literature, cumulative risk additive models outperform singular risk factors in predicting adverse worker outcomes.</p>
<p>Cumulative risk provides an additional benefit for studying job stress and human well-being. Most workers in economically developed countries no longer must contend with hazardous physical conditions. Although the physical working conditions of employees in retail, service, and health care industries undoubtedly vary, for the most part, the range of exposures is rather constrained and lies at the positive end of the spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510389981">Becker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510389981">Becker &amp; Steele, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510389981">Evans et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510389981">McCoy &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510389981">Sundstrom, 1986</xref>). This leads to model misspecification as estimates of covariation are very sensitive to invariance. By summing exposure to many singular workplace characteristics, cumulative risk creates the potential for investigators to examine the impacts of the convergence of a larger number of relatively small risky exposures that in isolation typically have weak effects.</p>
<p>From a management perspective, the present findings are challenging. Efforts to understand and intervene in work settings where health or well-being is compromised may easily miss the underlying dynamics of cumulative risk exposure uncovered herein. Design or management interventions that zero in on singular work factors as suspected causal agents are unlikely to yield desired outcomes because they fail to address the complex and dynamic, multivariate nature of the ecology of work.</p>
<p>While addressing a large number of social and physical factors simultaneously can be daunting, it can be feasible if the interventions are small and relatively inexpensive. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510389981">Becker and Poe (1980)</xref> found in a study of medical/surgical units of a community hospital that small physical changes such as introducing cork bulletin boards in nursing stations reduced noise, minimized clutter, and improved job satisfaction for nurses. Similarly, relative small-scale interventions in social and organizational factors, such as how nurses are assigned to different patients and areas within a nursing unit, have the potential to reduce job strain by better matching skill levels and patients’ special needs. Such interventions can be made without incurring cost increases. Engaging frontline staff and management in thinking about how the ecological context of work leads to individually minor but cumulatively significant stressors is likely key in the identification and implementation of meaningful changes in work settings.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A major limitation of the cumulative risk, additive exposure model is the implicit assumption that personal, social, and physical risk factors are of equal consequence and thus can simply be added together to represent the total load placed on the organism. Although singular risk factors do vary in their respective impacts on human health and behavior, each of these singular impacts pales in comparison to the explanatory power of the cumulative risk metric in accounting for a wide range of developmental outcomes in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510389981">Evans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389981">Rutter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510389981">Sameroff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510389981">Sameroff, Seifer, &amp; Bartko, 1997</xref>). Similar conclusions are reached when one attempts to examine weighted multivariate models or clusters of risk patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510389981">Ackerman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510389981">Evans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510389981">Rutter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510389981">Sameroff et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510389981">1998</xref>). Individual risk exposure does not predict health or well-being as well as cumulative risk exposure models do.</p>
<p>Another important drawback of cumulative risk modeling is that the metric is additive even though we know that specific singular, physical, and psychosocial risk factors in settings can interact to influence health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510389981">Donald &amp; Siu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510389981">Leather, Beale, &amp; Sullivan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510389981">Maxwell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510389981">Ruback &amp; Pandey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510389981">Wallenius, 2004</xref>). Interactions provide evidence for nonadditive effects but, as indicated earlier, run into serious statistical and interpretative limitations once more than three or four variables are included in the models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510389981">Oldham &amp; Fried, 1987</xref>, for an exception). It is worth remembering, however, as reported above, that the trends for cumulative risk and each of the outcome measures in both samples (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510389981">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0013916510389981">5</xref>) were tested for nonlinearity and found not significant. Linear increases in the outcome variables herein for each increment in cumulative risk suggest that an additive model fits the data better than a nonadditive model.</p>
<p>The nonexperimental design of this study demands caution in how the findings are interpreted. Although the methodology incorporates several strengths—particularly a conceptual replication across two samples, the inclusion of negative affectivity as a covariate, independent ratings of some aspects of the work setting, and attention to both physical and the more commonly studied psychosocial job stressors—longitudinal research tracking the same workers over time as work conditions change would significantly strengthen the research design. Using the same participants in a longitudinal design lessens the threat of participant-selection bias (i.e., certain types of people choose or get stuck in certain types of job environments). As we were unable to collect background data, we restricted our sample by age and gender but could not statistically control for sociodemographic variables such as age, marital status, or socioeconomic status. Obviously we also need to examine whether the findings for female clerical workers and primary care nurses would apply to males and workers in different job sectors.</p>
<p>In conclusion, focusing on relatively minor psychosocial and physical limitations in the work environments of many office and health care workers may mask their cumulative effects. The cumulative risk method applied in the studies considered here, though not without limitations, provides an alternative conceptual model and corresponding analytic method that has potential for enhancing our thinking about the ecological context of work settings, health, and behavior.</p>
