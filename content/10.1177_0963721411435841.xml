<abstract>
<p>Considerable advances have been made in understanding how emotional information is coded in the brain and used in the service of adaptive behavior, yet the developmental origins of these processes remain relatively unexamined. In this article, we review recent studies in human infants and experimental animals that have highlighted the importance of the first years of life in the development of emotion-processing capacities, particularly the ability to respond preferentially to threat-alerting stimuli. We discuss mechanisms that might govern the development of these capacities and suggest directions for further research into the nature and functional significance of infants’ early-emerging biases in the perception of emotional information.</p>

<p>An important function of the brain is to scan one’s surroundings for the presence of biologically relevant features (e.g., stimuli that represent a threat to well-being) and grant them priority in access to attention, awareness, and, ultimately, action. The significance of this function for well-being and survival has given rise to the argument that specialized neural mechanisms for processing biologically salient stimuli may exist, and that these mechanisms may require little, if any, experience to develop normally. Supporting this possibility, brain-imaging studies have identified an amygdala-centered neural network in the adult brain that appears to mediate the capacity for rapid, preferential processing of threat-alerting stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721411435841">Fig. 1</xref>). The ontogeny of this network and associated behavioral capacities have received little attention in the literature, despite the theoretical importance of the topic and the significant influence of early developmental processes on the development of various psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety) that are characterized by heightened sensitivity to threat-related information.</p>

<p>Recently, the understanding of the ontogenetic origins of emotion processing has been advanced by studies examining infants’ early-emerging perceptual biases to threat-alerting stimuli. In this article, we review these studies, discuss their contribution to our understanding of the developmental foundations and time course of fear-processing capacities, and call attention to some intriguing similarities between the development of fear processing in human infants and the emergence of fear-related behaviors in the young of other species.</p>
<p>Although the findings reviewed in this article point to an early-emerging attentional predisposition to threat-alerting information, they also raise several questions about the nature and functional significance of this perceptual predilection. We argue that these questions are amenable to empirical investigation and propose several ways in which future studies of infants’ perceptual biases can shed light on the ontogenetic origins of emotional-information processing and the emergence of individual differences in this capacity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0963721411435841">
<title>Development of Fear Preference in Human Infants</title>
<p>Humans detect and learn about danger through direct interaction with their physical and social environment and through observations of the emotional reactions of other individuals. Humans are therefore adept at detecting not only stimuli that themselves pose a direct threat to our well-being (e.g., impending collision with an object; conspecific aggression, or aggression from a member of the same species) but also stimuli that are not threatening in themselves but signal the presence of threat in the environment (e.g., fearful facial expressions). Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that the amygdala and connected brain areas may be especially important for processing these latter, indirect signals of threat and for assigning emotional significance to events or objects in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721411435841">Hooker, Germine, Knight, &amp; D’Esposito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963721411435841">Olsson &amp; Phelps, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963721411435841">Whalen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The perception of fearful facial expressions and the learning of emotional associations may be particularly relevant for preverbal infants who lack firsthand experience with many of the objects, events, and people they may encounter in their natural environments. Early studies examining the development of this ability showed that infants begin to visually discriminate and categorize facial expressions by the second half of the first year of life (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963721411435841">Nelson, 1987</xref>). Interestingly, at around the same age, infants start to exhibit a spontaneous visual preference for faces that express fear.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was demonstrated by findings showing that 7-month-old infants are able to categorize multiple exemplars of happy expressions, but not multiple exemplars of fearful expressions, possibly because of a slower rate of habituation to fearful expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963721411435841">Nelson, Morse, &amp; Leavitt, 1979</xref>), and by findings that 7-month-old infants look longer at fearful facial expressions than at happy ones when pictures depicting these two expressions are presented side by side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721411435841">Nelson &amp; Dolgin, 1985</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that this preference for fearful expressions emerges between 5 and 7 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721411435841">Farroni, Menon, Rigato, &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721411435841">Peltola, Leppänen, Mäki, &amp; Hietanen, 2009</xref>) and is manifested not only in overt visual preferences but also in brain activity, as increased amplitudes of event-related potentials related to sensitivity to fearful, as opposed to happy or neutral, facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963721411435841">Nelson &amp; de Haan, 1996</xref>). It has also been shown that the preference may reflect a difficulty in disengaging attention from fearful facial expressions. For example, 7-month-old infants are less likely to move their eyes from a face to a salient, peripheral visual stimulus if the face displays a fearful expression than if it displays a happy or neutral expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963721411435841">Leppänen et al., 2010</xref>). This occurs even though the capacity to disengage and shift spatial attention from one stimulus to another is well developed by 7 months of age.</p>
<p>An important question concerns infants’ possible sensitivity to the referential nature of fearful expressions—that is, infants’ ability to “understand” that the expressions may have a referent in the environment and that they convey information about the valence of the referred object or event. Studies delving into this topic have shown that by 6 months of age, infants are able to discriminate between fearful expressions that are directed toward a specific referent in the environment and expressions that have no referent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411435841">Hoehl &amp; Striano, 2010</xref>). More strikingly, infants also appear to use adults’ facial expressions to preferentially attend to some objects over others: Infants exhibit larger attention-sensitive event-related potentials in response to an object if they have seen an adult displaying a fearful expression while looking at the object than if they have seen an adult displaying a neutral facial expression while looking at it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721411435841">Hoehl &amp; Striano, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0963721411435841">
<title>Sensitivity to Threat-Related Signals</title>
<p>Infants’ attentional preference for fearful facial expressions develops slightly before or at about the age at which other fear-related behaviors, including fear of heights and fear of strangers, increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963721411435841">Braungart-Rieker, Hill-Soderlund, &amp; Karrass, 2010</xref>). A recent study examined whether infants exhibit an attentional bias to other threat-related stimuli, such as pictures of angry facial expressions (indicative of conspecific aggression) and pictures of snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963721411435841">LoBue &amp; De Loache, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, 8- to 14-month-old infants in this study did not look longer at angry expressions than at happy expressions and did not look longer at pictures of snakes than at pictures of flowers; however, the infants oriented faster (i.e., moved their eyes from the fixation point to the location of the stimulus) to both angry faces and pictures of snakes than they did to happy faces and pictures of flowers. These findings implying a difference in infants’ processing of fearful and angry expressions parallel findings from studies on adults and may partially reflect a fundamental difference in the nature of threat posed by these stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963721411435841">Whalen, 1998</xref>). Specifically, fearful expressions signal the presence of threat in the environment and may therefore engage prolonged processing (e.g., to identify cues that provide information about the possible source of the threat), whereas angry faces (and snakes) pose a direct threat to the observer and may therefore elicit avoidance.</p>

<sec id="section3-0963721411435841">
<title>Development of Fear Processing in Other Species</title>
<p>Overall, it seems that human infants are relatively insensitive to threat-related information during the first months of life and exhibit an almost step-like increase in fear-related behaviors during the second half of the first year of age. Interestingly, a similar developmental shift occurs in other species. Rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) begin to exhibit various fear-related behaviors at around 2 months of age, which, in terms of development, is roughly comparable to 8 months of age in human infants. By this age, infant macaques avoid fixating the faces of dominant or aggressively gesturing conspecifics, produce fear grimaces and freezing behaviors in response to physical and social danger, and begin to exhibit fear of unfamiliar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963721411435841">Bauman &amp; Amaral, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Functional maturation of limbic brain structures and, in particular, the amygdala appears to play an important role in the emergence of fear-processing capabilities. Neuroimaging studies on infant macaques show rapid increases in the amygdalar volume during the first months of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963721411435841">Payne, Machado, Bliwise, &amp; Bachevalier, 2010</xref>). In addition, infant macaques with neonatal lesions to the amygdala do not exhibit normal fear reactions in response to nonsocial fear-inducing stimuli, such as rubber snakes, but they exhibit elevated fear reactions in response to social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963721411435841">Bauman, Lavenex, Mason, Capitanio, &amp; Amaral, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A developmental shift in fear processing also occurs in rodents (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963721411435841">Sullivan &amp; Holman, 2010</xref>). During the first 10 days of life, rat pups are able to form preferences but are incapable of learning to avoid stimuli that are associated with <italic>aversive</italic> consequences (i.e., consequences that evoke avoidance behavior). This 10-day period may be a sensitive period during which the ability of the pup to form attachment to the mother increases. The behavioral capacities of these animals change drastically between 10 and 12 days of age, when rats begin to exhibit fear-related behaviors and avoidance of stimuli associated with aversive consequences. Detailed studies of this developmental transition have shown that endogenous increases in stress hormones (corticosterone) and associated changes in the plasticity and functionality of the amygdala are important in initiating the developmental shift from relative insensitivity to threat-related information to “adult-like” discrimination of appetitive and aversive stimuli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963721411435841">
<title>Mechanisms of Development</title>
<p>The emergence of fear-processing capacities during the second half of the first year of life in humans raises the questions of how this developmental transition originates and what neural mechanisms underlie it. Given that infants’ visual system is sufficiently developed well before the developmental shift occurs, it is unlikely that improvements in visual acuity contribute to the onset of the perceptual preference for fear-related stimuli. Instead, the second half of the first year of life may mark a functional maturation of a neural circuitry that involves emotion-related systems (e.g., the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) and connected visual and attention-related systems in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721411435841">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721411435841">Leppänen &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>). The maturation of this circuitry in humans and possibly other species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963721411435841">Fig. 2</xref>) may coincide with the point in development at which the infant begins to spend increased time away from the caregiver, locomote, and actively explore the environment (i.e., the point at which fear-related cues become behaviorally relevant). Furthermore, the functional maturation of the circuitry may correspond with a sensitive period during which infants expect exposure to species-typical emotional expressions and are biased to process and store information about associations between emotions and objects (e.g., a fearful facial expression directed toward a specific object).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although it can be argued that some predetermined neural preparedness for processing fearful facial expressions is consistent with the obvious importance of these signals for survival and well-being, this argument leaves open a number of unanswered questions. One of the biggest challenges for interpreting infants’ perceptual biases is to establish that the observed bias is indeed driven by the attribute in question (in this case, threat) and does not reflect a bias in attention or brain responses to some concomitant stimulus feature (e.g., novelty; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721411435841">Kagan &amp; Herschkowitz, 2005</xref>). Preliminary studies have suggested that the preference for fearful facial expressions is not simply due to their relative novelty in infants’ environments or to their distinctively large eyes, as infants fail to show a similar preference for novel, nonemotional grimaces or neutral faces with large eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963721411435841">Peltola, Leppänen, Palokangas, &amp; Hietanen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963721411435841">Peltola, Leppänen, Vogel-Farley, Hietanen, &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>). However, more studies of this kind are needed to address this issue more conclusively. Further research is also needed to examine whether young infants simply attend more to fearful expressions or also use these expressions as signals that allow them to derive information about the valence of objects in their environment (i.e., whether infants “understand” that the objects possess positive or negative attributes).</p>
<p>Finally, studies of infants’ emotion-processing capacities may provide insight into sensitive periods in emotional and social development more broadly. For example, it is interesting to speculate that the time period from birth to the onset of the fear preference (i.e., from birth to 5–7 months of age) may be a sensitive period during which infants are able to form preferences but unable to detect and learn about danger; this period of development may facilitate attachment in human infants, as it does in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963721411435841">Sullivan &amp; Holman, 2010</xref>), and the formation of attachment may become more difficult after this period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963721411435841">
<title>Implications for Understanding Fear-Related Disorders</title>
<p>Further research examining infants’ early-developing sensitivity to threat-related stimuli may also shed light on the early precursors of individual differences in emotional-information processing. Both genetic and experiential factors are known to modify emotion processing and perceptual sensitivity to threat-related information (see Recommended Reading). The findings discussed in this article raise the possibility that during the early stages of development, genetic and experiential factors may act to establish changes in emotion-related neural systems and to give rise to individual differences in perceptual preferences for threat-related cues. It is noteworthy that even subtle biases in attention to threat-related cues may exert powerful influences on the ways in which children interact with the environment during development and may affect children’s sensitivity to potential adverse events. The importance of research on individual differences in the early-emerging attentional preferences toward threat-related cues has been highlighted by findings suggesting that heightened attention to fear-relevant stimuli may be causally related to increased vulnerability to anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963721411435841">Bar-Haim, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0963721411435841">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we have summarized and discussed recent advances in the understanding of the developmental foundations of the ability to perceive and adaptively respond to emotion-related information. Converging evidence from studies on human infants and animals has shown a developmental change in emotion-related neural circuitry and the capacity to recognize threat-alerting information during the second half of the first year. Besides highlighting the importance of this time period in the development of emotion-processing capabilities, these studies raise a number of testable hypotheses regarding the potential origin and nature of early-developing emotion-processing capabilities and the influence of early developmental processes on individual differences in sensitivity to threat-related information. Although infants’ perceptual biases are not likely associated with a rich conceptual understanding of the meaning of different emotional expressions, simple perceptual biases in early life may provide a foundation for later conceptual understanding of emotions, and individual variations in these early biases may later manifest as variations in more complex emotional processes.</p>
