<p><italic>Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy</italic></p>
<p>Paul C. Gutjahr</p>
<p>New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 477 pp. $74.00</p>
<p>The towering theological figure at Princeton Seminary and in nineteenth-century American theology generally was Charles Hodge (1797–1878). This splendid biography by Paul C. Gutjahr, Associate Professor of English at Indiana University, is a model of historical research, tapping on the riches of archival materials in Princeton and beyond. Gutjahr leaves no stone unturned in providing a critical biography that supplements and widens the context for the only other biography of Hodge (1880), by Archibald Alexander Hodge, his son and successor as Professor of Didactic and Polemic Theology.</p>
<p>While biographies can be tedious as a stride by stride account of one’s walk through life, Gutjahr has provided a truly engaging look at Hodge as a theologian, churchman, public figure, and Christian person. The many facets of his life and work are interestingly portrayed in a number of short chapters that hold interest and invite one to explore the next step in Hodge’s long career. A full-orbed Hodge is displayed here, engaged in steady devotion to his calling through the years, even as he lived a decidedly “conservative” life with set routines that included buying his clothes at the same shop in Princeton for decades.</p>
<p>Hodge is known to later generations for his three-volume <italic>Systematic Theology</italic> (1872) that enshrined the Calvinistic orthodoxy of the “Old Princeton” theology. Gutjahr tells us there are clues suggesting Hodge envisioned a fourth volume, on ecclesiology, although in the end he did not pursue it (349). For years, the seminary’s board of directors had encouraged Hodge not to publish a systematic theology, afraid would-be Princeton students would simply read Hodge and not enroll in the seminary. Until his systematics appeared, Hodge had used Francis Turretin’s <italic>Institutes of Elenctic Theology</italic> as his “core textbook,” having his students read 20 to 40 pages in Latin as preparation for class. We are reminded that Hodge believed, as he wrote to a friend, that Turretin’s <italic>Institutes</italic> was “incomparably the best book as a whole on systematic theology” (214).</p>
<p>In addition to his biblical commentaries and other works, Hodge wrote thousands of pages in the various Princeton Seminary journals, addressing theological, ecclesiastical, and social issues. His arguments were persuasive to many and gained him a mighty prominence in Presbyterian churches. Yet Hodge’s views did not always prevail. He sought to preserve Presbyterian denominational unity by protesting the Gardiner Spring resolutions in the 1861 Old School General Assembly, he never could gain support for the establishment of Christian schools to educate youth, and he opposed the reunion of Presbyterian Old and New School sides in 1869, believing the New School as a whole had exhibited “latitude in matters of doctrine and order, which the Old-school have conscientiously resisted” (341). Hodge was consistently true to his foundational principles, even when in the minority—and even when friends urged him to view things otherwise. This latter instance was the case when Hodge defended Roman Catholic baptism as a valid sacrament since, despite corruptions, Catholic baptism followed the biblical admonition to baptize with water and was done in the name of the Trinity (238).</p>
<p>Gutjahr helpfully handles Hodge’s views on slavery in which Hodge distinguished between slaveholding, which he believed was not condemned by Scripture, and slave laws, which are wrong when they contravene biblical mandates on how God desires people to be treated. These conceptual differences, says Gutjahr, showed Hodge as “a victim of his own limited exposure to slavery and the insularity of his life in Princeton. The type of slaveholding he had personally practiced … was a much milder form of the institution than was found in other parts of the country” (174). When the Civil War came, Hodge was a firm Unionist and came to see “how central the issue of race was in the pro-slavery mindset of the South.” For Hodge, according to Gutjahr, “all humans were indeed of the same species and thus equal” (325–26). But the primary principle of the war was to save the Union. Hodge burst into tears at Lincoln’s death, considering that day—as he told his brother—“the saddest day in the whole history of our nation” (332–33).</p>
<p>Hodge’s influence endures. As Gutjahr writes, “His thinking has remained a vibrant part of a wide range of American Protestant theology up to the current day” (384). This book is a fascinating, critical, and very personal look at a leading Reformed theologian whose imprint has been strong and persistent. We are much indebted to Gutjahr for his fine labors, even as we continue critically to appraise Hodge’s legacy.</p>
