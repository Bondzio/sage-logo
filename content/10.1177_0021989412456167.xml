<p>Without doubt, some of the most important work in postcolonial theory and criticism has considered issues of gender and sexuality as well as those of race, nation, and empire. Some important examples that spring to mind are Robert J. C. Young’s <italic>Colonial Desire: Hybridity in Culture, Theory and Race</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021989412456167">1995</xref>), Ann Stoler’s <italic>Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power: Race and the Intimate in Colonial Rule</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021989412456167">2002</xref>), and Anne McClintock’s <italic>Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021989412456167">1995</xref>). In his book, Young argues for the centrality of colonial, or “inter-racial” desire to the project of empire, which cannot be understood in entirely economic terms, and points out that concerns about miscegenation echo problematically within a term like “hybridity”. Similarly, Stoler traces the connections between “beliefs about European manliness, racial membership, sexual morality and the management of empire” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021989412456167">Stoler, 2002</xref>: 6) in her examination of domestic, intimate, and sexual arrangements in colonial Indonesia and other colonial contexts. McClintock’s book demonstrates the crucial role of feminized images of the “unknown world” laid out “for male exploration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021989412456167">McClintock, 1995</xref>: 23) in the implicit assumptions of Victorian and other imperialists. Thus, in their different ways all three of these critics sketch out the processes by which gender and sexuality are necessarily imbricated in colonialism and its legacies and cannot be neglected by postcolonial critics.</p>
<p>In his treatment of colonial desire, Young pays attention primarily to the desire of the white man for the black woman; one finds only brief allusions to the desire of the white woman for the black man and perhaps even less about the desires of black women themselves. Yet in many colonial environments it is the fear of what came to be known as the “black peril” that is enshrined in law. In Southern Rhodesia, for example, the Immorality and Indecency Suppression Act of 1903 made sexual intercourse between an African man and a European woman illegal. In the 1950s, proposals made by women’s groups attempted to extend this to relations between European men and African women, but were not successful. The complex relationships between people of different races and cultures in particular local contexts are undoubtedly difficult to trace. Equally, in some of those relationships, with their difficult patterns of domination and exploitation and unequal distributions of power, the place of desire is highly contested and contestable. Those who have attempted to do the work of unravelling these webs have produced some of the most interesting postcolonial criticism; could such work also be described as some of the best feminist work?</p>
<p>If we consider the most influential criticism on the relationship between feminism and postcoloniality, we tend to think of those classic essays, such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s “Three Women’s Texts and a Critique of Imperialiam” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021989412456167">1985</xref>) and Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s “Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021989412456167">1984</xref>), which criticize (Western, liberal) feminist scholarship for its universalizing, in fact, colonizing tendencies. Spivak argues that “the emergent perspective of feminist criticism reproduces the axioms of imperialism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021989412456167">Spivak, 1985</xref>: 243), while Mohanty claims that the production of the image of the “third world woman” as always and everywhere oppressed is what sustains the illusion of “first world” women’s autonomy: the assumption that they are “secular, liberated, and hav[e] control over their own lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021989412456167">Mohanty, 1984</xref>: 353). Both of these essays make a crucial case in arguing for a more nuanced feminism that admits that, as Judith Butler puts it, “the very subject of women is no longer understood in stable or abiding terms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021989412456167">Butler, 1990</xref>: 1). In effect, they suggest that we can no longer assume that the category “woman” is unchanging, existing in a transhistorical state of othered oppression, patiently awaiting the intervention of feminists who have themselves somehow escaped this position via what Spivak refers to as the narrative of “feminist individualism”.</p>
<p>The difficulties with the narrative critiquing feminism are considerable, however. In fact, the essays are just as guilty of the tendency to universalize: the term “feminism” is itself treated as a stable, transhistorical critical and political position. Mohanty does observe that “[c]learly Western feminist discourse and political practice is neither singular nor homogeneous in its goals, interests or analyses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021989412456167">Mohanty, 1984</xref>: 334). However, the slippage in the title of the essay, which moves the term “Western” to the main title and leaves the term “feminism” unqualified in the subtitle, does make a series of substitutions which imply first, that all feminism is Western feminism; second, that all feminist scholarship is Western feminist scholarship; and third, that all Western feminist scholarship is the same. Neither critic acknowledges that, despite its limitations, under the auspices of the “feminist individualist” narrative, considerable successes have been achieved both politically and critically in a variety of contexts. Nor does either essay admit the diversity and range of feminist work outside and also within the “Western” context. Consider that at the same time as some (Western, liberal) feminist critics were focusing on the narrative of feminist individualism, Donna Haraway was arguing the opposite in “A Manifesto for Cyborgs”, suggesting that rather than differentiating ourselves as women from nature we should not be “afraid of our joint kinship with animals and machines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021989412456167">Haraway, 1991</xref>: 154) and that cyborg “[w]riting has a special significance for all colonized groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021989412456167">Haraway, 1991</xref>: 174).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021989412456167">1</xref></sup> While the cyborg is certainly a figure of immense promise for feminist theory, Haraway’s use of it has not been without its critics, many of whom have focused on the question of (as Chela Sandoval puts it) “who counts as ‘we’ in the statement that ‘we are all cyborgs’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021989412456167">Sandoval, 1999</xref>: 381). The potentially problematic (although interesting) association that Haraway makes between cyborg identity and constructions of “women of colour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021989412456167">Haraway, 1991</xref>: 174), the fact that the figure of the cyborg now seems somewhat outdated, its potential to be associated with a “post-gender” world, and the possibly unthinking celebration of technology involved in its use, have all been challenged in recent feminist work. However, as Haraway herself suggests, “instead of giving up because it has become too famous, let’s keep pushing it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021989412456167">Haraway, 1998</xref>: 36). Elsewhere she argues that “there is some really new tropic work that has to be done in this figure … I think cyborg figurations can continue to do critical work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021989412456167">Haraway, 2003</xref>: 52). In a recent article, Margaret Toye argues that one of the ways feminist theory can make fresh use of the figure of the cyborg is through considering it in relation to a “poethics of embodiment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021989412456167">Toye, 2012</xref>: 190). (The term poethics is a portmanteau word Toye uses to blend poetics and ethics.)</p>
<p>Whereas the historical diversity and local specificity of postcolonialism as a discipline, and its capacity to embrace the insights about gender and sexuality deriving from feminist theory, are usually recognized, differences within feminisms are not always acknowledged in the same way. This has much to do with the current political climate in which the narrative of “feminist individualism” is seen as the only feminist narrative and is increasingly being challenged, in the West as well as the non-West. In our era of austerity, neo-conservativism, and backlash, it is not surprising that feminism singular can easily be positioned as offering an outmoded, “blanket” approach. Instead, we want to argue for the historical and geographical specificity of feminisms, and their capacity to engage productively with difference.</p>
<p>The academy itself has some responsibility for “ghettoizing” criticism in silos (to deliberately mix a metaphor). Appointment committees decide whether they need a postcolonialist or a feminist; journals indicate their allegiance by their titles; conferences and professional associations are aimed at different constituencies. Some of this is inevitable, but surely it is in the intersections between critical positions that some of the most interesting work appears? In this issue of <italic>JCL</italic> we have a nexus of criticism that focuses, in different ways, on what Toye refers to as the “ethics of embodiment”. A number of this issue’s articles examine the ethics of the emotional, sexual, and domestic work done by the bodies of servants and labourers of different kinds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021989412456167">Dashini Jeyathurai’s (2012)</xref> article examines the figure of the Malaysian Indian estate girl in three texts: Preeta Samarasan’s <italic>Evening is the Whole Day</italic>, K. S. Maniam’s <italic>Between Lives</italic> and a humanitarian comic, <italic>Meena: A Plantation Child Worker</italic>. Jeyathurai suggests that “the Malaysian estate girl invites us to consider those Indian diasporic subjects who crossed oceans to work in unfamiliar lands before it became de rigueur for Indian professionals to move from Chennai to New York, Tokyo, London, Singapore and so on” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021989412456167">Jeyathurai, 2012</xref>: 318). For Jeyathurai the exploited body of the Malaysian Indian estate worker provokes a questioning of our assumptions about cosmopolitanism. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021989412456167">Lee Erwin’s (2012)</xref> essay focuses on the domestic and emotional labour performed by a “member of an ethnic minority, Dalit, or villager” in middle-class domestic spaces and the “domestic plots” of prize-winning recent fiction from around the world. Erwin’s attention to class and subalterneity allows him to conclude that “one figure who now works to authorize the operations of capital is not the woman in the domestic space naturalized by the novel two centuries ago but the male labourer (still) in the domestic space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021989412456167">Erwin, 2012</xref>: 335).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021989412456167">Robbie Goh’s (2012)</xref> essay examines the unbridgeable material and cultural chasm between the Overseas Indian and the local or resident Indian in Aravind Adiga’s <italic>The White Tiger</italic> and Amitav Ghosh’s <italic>The Hungry Tide</italic>, suggesting that the resident Indian’s body “becomes the ideological and symbolic battleground in which this foreign-local distinction is played out” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021989412456167">Goh, 2012</xref>: 342). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021989412456167">Marakand Paranjape (2012)</xref> also scrutinizes Ghosh’s fiction, but to some extent challenges the dominant critical discourse which applauds him for representing “the subalterns who have been passed over by both the imperialists and the nationalists, those labouring classes whose sweat and toil built empires and nations, but who have been swept aside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021989412456167">Paranjape, 2012</xref>: 370). Comparing Ghosh to his artistic antecedents, Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray, Paranjape argues instead that the novelist is unable to escape the political clutches of the Bengali middle class or <italic>bhadrasamaj</italic>, of which he himself is a member.</p>
<p>The focus on class and gender continues in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021989412456167">Oano Sabo’s (2012)</xref> discussion of Kiran Desai’s <italic>The Inheritance of Loss</italic>, as he considers how Desai juxtaposes underprivileged subjects in India and the United States. In contrast to Goh’s emphasis on the “suave, knowledgeable” India-returned Overseas subject, Sabo looks at this figure in the diaspora, functioning in a much more vulnerable state as “the illegal immigrant, the foreigner, and the stranger” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021989412456167">Sabo, 2012</xref>: 377). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021989412456167">Shou-Nan Hsu (2012)</xref> analyses Michael Ondaatje’s <italic>Handwriting</italic> for its representation of a Sri Lanka-returned narrator who writes to gain understanding of the Sri Lankan civil war and possible means of ethnic reconciliation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021989412456167">Amor Kohli’s (2012)</xref> essay considers the grounded utopian impulse of ordinary characters’ questioning in Edward Kamau Brathwaite’s <italic>Rights of Passage</italic>, suggesting that this “faithful rendering of the everyday language of the women” constitutes “large-scale questioning that carries within it the seeds of a potentially emancipatory and secular inquisitiveness”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021989412456167">Chitra Sankaran (2012)</xref> examines representations of rivers and serpents in Gita Mehta’s <italic>A River Sutra</italic>, adapting ecofeminist criticism to categorize Mehta as a “littoral writer” whose descriptions hug the river shores of the Narmada River and who invokes nature as a force for change and resistance (linking nature and women has of course often been a patriarchal strategy). In conclusion, much of the work presented in this issue of <italic>JCL</italic>, as well as the classic criticism mentioned at the beginning of this article, can be considered as the best feminist work (even in its attention to masculinity) just as much as it may be seen as the best postcolonial work, suggesting the importance of crossing and challenging artificial borderlines between the two apparently separate schools of criticism.</p>
