<p>Patrick de Maré was the most original thinker and writer from those who surrounded Foulkes as his earliest collaborators. From Patrick’s first writings we see that he had assimilated Foulkes’ central thesis: matrix, locus, boundary and the conductor’s role. These concepts found their place in what de Maré had himself constructed from his deep knowledge of philosophy, religion and of course medicine. Throughout his life he continued these deep explorations, with new concepts emerging.</p>
<p>Whenever I read any of de Maré’s texts—the marvellous perspectives—his later books and papers I am always surprised and alerted to meet him full of originality; the way he sought out the path less taken. Once I visited his evening social club at St George’s Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, where his group of both staff and volunteers’ vigorous social life enveloped and contained a very varied group of ‘patients’.</p>
<p>De Maré moved Foulkes’ group analytic circle beyond its original size to both large and median groups. He settled to exploring the qualities and characteristics of the median groups and as a result his work has reached out to, and is used by those who work in hospitals, prisons and rehab centres. As his close friend and colleague Rocco Pisani puts it,
<disp-quote>
<p>… the median group belongs to group analysis. It is large enough to represent society and small enough to allow people to express themselves and become individuated. It is the best tool to get out of kinship (the narcissistic family) and to get into kith-ship (citizenship and society). It is a question of transcultural transposition rather than transference</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the median group the members learn to bear the strains of remaining together through troubled times emerging into fuller selfhood and common citizenship. It is the work of humanizing the mind.</p>
<p>Here it is important and significant to state that Pat de Maré’s attention in recent years has been to this issue of ‘what is mind’ and that he has written several papers published in Group Analysis in collaboration with Roberto Schoellberger.</p>
<p>Whether starting in early childhood or in adulthood, one must first elaborate an awareness of how one’s own mental life is both similar and different from that of others, to elaborate further in understanding of how to make these similarities and differences explicit in dialogue, to construct procedures for negotiating with the other(s) in the face of differences. These are all essential features of the group analytic situation.</p>
<p>De Maré does not refer to the great Soviet researchers Vigotsky and Bakhtin who tell us that our minds are ‘given’ to us by others through language and the pre-language interplay between infants and caregivers, which I find rich sources of understanding of cultural and mental processes. I think it is a feature of the time when these papers were written that the concept of empathy is not spoken of. Empathy weaves a web of connection that supports and contains our mental and emotional lives. De Maré was a member of Foulkes’ original group of colleagues, which included Norbert Elias. Norbert pointed out that we live our lives in chains of interdependency, figurations as he called them and that we need each other if we are to survive physically, mentally and effectively. The strength of empathy arises from commitment to truthful self-knowledge and truthful understanding of others. Through this search for truth we protect ourselves from self-deception and from deception by others. Group analytic psychotherapy gives to us and to our patients opportunities to see ourselves more clearly, to understand others more accurately, to communicate our perceptions in sensitive and tactful ways. I quote here from Foulkes’ short paper, <italic>Concerning Criticism of Inner-object Theory</italic> 1990: ‘Human relationship are essentially relations between whole persons, between individuals whose relationships form a new whole, a new system’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483075">Foulkes, 1975</xref>. 1990, p 271.</p>
<p>In his article on <italic>My Philosophy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413483075">Foulkes, 1974</xref>. 1990, p 281) Foulkes writes of the role and function of the therapist as a perceptive and creative act, like a conductor’s interpretation of the work of the composer. He writes that the therapist is akin to a poet, who finds a way to recognize and express deeper meanings as does the poet express his motives in society. How well these words fit to the image and experience of Pat de Maré who is in so many ways a poet of group analysis, a far-seer throughout his life as a psychotherapist.</p>
<p>Not long after Pat’s death, his closest collaborator Roberto Schoellberger organized a conference at Bolzano, North Italy. The articles given at this conference, which I had most kindly been invited to, show that his knowledge has been retained and developed.</p>
