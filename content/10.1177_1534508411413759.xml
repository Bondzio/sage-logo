<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Screening Test for Emotional Problems–Self-Report</italic> (STEP-S) was designed to assess students aged 10 to 17 years referred for wide-ranging emotional disturbances categorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act. Preliminary analysis indicated that subscale coefficients alpha ranged from .76 to .85 and test–retest coefficients from .65 to .79. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a marginal fit of the five-factor model to the data, whereas substantial support was provided for diagnostic, convergent, and discriminant score validity.</p>

<body>
<p>An estimated 2% to 20% of school-aged youth experience emotional disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411413759">Mash &amp; Dozois, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411413759">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>). Less than 1% of students, however, are currently being served under the significant emotional disturbance category of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411413759">U.S. Department of Education [USDOE], 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411413759">Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411413759">Walker et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, there is a strong need for proactive, time-efficient, inexpensive, and psychometrically sound screening measures to assist in identifying school-aged children and adolescents with emotional disturbances. Screening is used to determine whether children identified as at risk for experiencing emotional disturbances warrant further assessment. The reauthorization of the IDEA emphasizes prevention and early identification of at-risk students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411413759">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>), instead of relying on the traditional “wait-to-fail” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411413759">Glover &amp; Albers, 2007</xref>). Efficient screening can lead to early identification of emotional disturbances and the delivery of appropriate academic and mental health supports and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411413759">Kamps, Kravits, Stolze, &amp; Swaggart, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>To receive services for an emotional disturbance under IDEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411413759">USDOE, 2004</xref>; Section 300.7[c]), a student must display difficulties in learning not due to intellectual, sensory, or health factors but due to inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships, inappropriate behavior or feelings under normal circumstances, depression, or physical symptoms or fears. Several screening instruments have been developed to assist educators in identifying students in need of further assessment, but few have operationally defined emotional disturbance in accordance with the federal definition above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411413759">Epstein, Nordness, Cullinan, &amp; Hertzog, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of their somewhat subjective nature, the eligibility guidelines for emotional disturbance often create confusion for educators trying to assess whether or not individual students meet the criteria. Contributing to this problem, few cost- and time-efficient instruments that align with the majority of the five characteristics of emotional disturbances defined by IDEA exist to help school personnel accurately screen or identify emotional disturbances. This article presents results of the development of a new self-report instrument, called the <italic>Screening Test for Emotional Problems–Self-Report</italic> (STEP-S), which was designed to screen students for emotional disturbances as defined by the five categories included in IDEA. The following four studies include results of reliability and validity of student responses.</p>

<p>Four independent samples were used in the following four studies. Participants were volunteers recruited as samples of convenience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411413759">Table 1</xref> for participant characteristics). Guidelines for approval of human subjects study were followed and informed consent obtained. Minor-status participants were recruited from public and private schools and provided assent, and their parents/guardians provided consent to participate.</p>

<title>The Screening Test for Emotional Problems–Self-Report (STEP-S)</title>
<p>The STEP-S can be individually or group administered to students and scored in less than 15 min. The STEP-S consists of 40 items, with 8 items rationally assigned to each of five subscales designed to align with the five IDEA categories for identification of emotional disturbances: (a) Academic Problems, (b) Social Problems, (c) Behavior Problems, (d) Depression, and (e) Anxiety. Each item was rationally derived and written by the primary author and shown to correlate &gt;.30 with the designated subscale in a previous, unpublished item development study (<italic>n</italic> = 75). Raw scores for each subscale are determined by a simple sum of score procedures and can be converted into <italic>T</italic> scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50, <italic>SD</italic> = 10) and percentile ranks.</p>

<title>Conners 3rd Edition–Self-Report (Short) (Conners 3-SR(S))</title>
<p>The Conners 3-SR(S) is a self-report measure widely used to assess problem behavior in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411413759">Conners, 2008</xref>). The Conners 3 is a multi-instrument system consisting of both long and short versions for parents, teachers, and self-report. The short-form version of the self-report instrument used in this study consisted of 39 items, assessing problematic behaviors across five factors. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale: 0 = <italic>not true at all</italic> (<italic>never, seldom</italic>), 1 = <italic>just a little true</italic> (<italic>occasionally</italic>), 2 = <italic>pretty much true</italic> (<italic>often, quite a bit</italic>), 3 = <italic>very much true</italic> (<italic>very often, very frequent</italic>). The Conners 3-SR(S) is appropriate for use with children ages 8 to 18 years.</p>
<p>The normative sample for the Conners 3-SR(S) included 1,000 children ages 8 to 18 years: 50 males and 50 females at each age level 8 to 16 and 17/18 years. Participants’ race/ethnicity was approximately representative of the U.S. population. Parental educational level indicated that about 4% of the norm group had parents who did not complete high school, 18% had only a high school diploma, 29% completed some college or vocational programming, and 41% were college graduates.</p>
<p>Factor analysis of items composing the long version of the Conners 3-SR(S) led to the selection of five to six items for each of five Conners 3-SR(S) subscales, presented here with accompanying coefficients α: Inattention, α = .92, range = .91–.93; Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, α = .89, range = .89–.90; Learning Problems, α = .84, range = .84–.85; Aggression, α = .85, range = .75–.87; and Family Relations, α = .88, range = .84–.90. Test–retest reliability coefficients of scores were as follows: Inattention, <italic>r</italic> = .75; Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, <italic>r</italic> = .75; Learning Problems, <italic>r</italic> = .79; Aggression, <italic>r</italic> = .76; and Family Relations, <italic>r</italic> = .63. Factorial and convergent validity are well documented and discussed at length in the Conners 3 manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411413759">Conners, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The DBRS-II-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411413759">Erford, Miller, &amp; Isbister, 2010</xref>) can be individually or group administered to students and scored in less than 10 min. This second edition of the DBRS consists of 35 items, with 7 items assigned to each of five subscales designed to assess childhood behavioral difficulties and accompanied here by coefficient alphas: (a) Distractible, α = .79; (b) Hyperactive/Impulsive, α = .83; (c) Oppositional, α = .74; (d) Antisocial Conduct, α = .79; and (e) Anxiety, α = .79. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale, where 0 = <italic>never, rarely, or hardly ever</italic>; 1 = <italic>occasionally</italic>; 2 = <italic>frequently</italic>; and 3 = <italic>the student displays the behavior most of the time</italic>. Raw scores for each subscale are determined by simple sum of score procedures and can be converted into <italic>T</italic> scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50; <italic>SD</italic> = 10) and percentile ranks. Significant convergent validity correlations were reported with similar scales from the STEP-S and Conners 3-SR(S).</p>

The SES-S consists of 42 items rationally assigned to four subscales designed to provide a total score (α = .94) and assess various facets of self-esteem, accompanied here by coefficient alphas: (a) Physical, α = .74; (b) Academic, α = .80; (c) Family, α = .75; and (d) Peer, α = .83. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale (i.e., U, <italic>usually</italic>; S, <italic>sometimes</italic>; or R, <italic>rarely</italic>, with the numerical equivalents of 2, 1, and 0, respectively). Of the items, 10 were reverse scored (i.e., U = 0, S = 1, R = 2).

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Participants were administered the STEP-S, DBRS-II-S, SES-S, and SESRS according to standardization specifications and in a counterbalanced order. Computation of internal consistency coefficients (alpha coefficients) for each scale was conducted and interscale correlations were conducted using Pearson <italic>r</italic>. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of STEP-S items was conducted using Mplus version 5.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411413759">Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2007</xref>) to determine the items scores’ fit to the hypothesized five-factor model.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>The STEP-S and Conners 3-SR were administered to the 75 participants in a counterbalanced sequence to avoid order effects. All protocols were scored according to standardization specifications.

<sec id="section12-1534508411413759">
<title>Study 4</title>
<p>Exactly 50% of the sample was previously identified with a mental or emotional disorder and were receiving special education services for students with an emotional disturbance. Twenty-five of these 50 participants were identified primarily because of inappropriate behaviors, and 25 because of substantial depression. Each of the participants with an emotional disturbance was matched with another participant of the same sex, age, and school who was not diagnosed with an emotional or academic impairment. The participants were administered the STEP-S and results were subjected to decision accuracy analysis as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411413759">Erford, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411413759">Erford &amp; Stephens, 2005</xref>). Indexes of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power (PPP), negative predictive power (NPP), and percentage of correct classifications were computed. Criterion for a significant elevation on the STEP-S was <italic>T</italic> ≥67, effectively identifying the upper 5% of the population. The criterion of a 5%selection rate was chosen for several reasons. First, it provides an approximation of the best classification cutoff score for minimizing Type I error, whereas it is likely that a substantially lower or higher cutoff score will lead to greater inaccuracy of classification. Second, many of the constructs comprising the STEP-S (clinical depression, anxiety, and behavior disorders) have an approximate prevalence rate of 5% in the child and adolescent population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411413759">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). Third, previously conducted studies have used the 5% cutoff rate with success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411413759">Erford &amp; Hase, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Factorial Validity</title>
<p>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on item responses of the participants in study 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 652) using Mplus version 5.21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411413759">Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2007</xref>) CFA procedures to determine how well the data fit the hypothesized five-factor model. Mplus was used because the program makes modified computations for STEP-S ordinal scores. The output statistics generated by Mplus indicated a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) χ<sup>2</sup>:<italic>df</italic> ratio of 2.57:1, a comparative fit index (CFI) of .86, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of .051 (90% CI = .048–.054, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) of .063. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411413759">Dimitrov (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411413759">2008b)</xref> suggested that for adequate model fit, chi-square should not be significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), the χ<sup>2</sup>:<italic>df</italic> ratio should be less than 5:1, CFI should be &gt;.95, RMSEA should be &lt;.06, and SRMR should be &lt;.08. Thus, the results of this CFA indicate a marginal fit of the data to the five-factor model; chi-square and CFI indicate a poor fit, whereas the χ<sup>2</sup>:<italic>df</italic> ratio, RMSEA, and SRMR indicate an adequate fit.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These preliminary studies investigated item reliability, validity, and accuracy of decisions of the STEP-S, and indicated that this screening tool is a psychometrically adequate approach to use with students who have a broad range of IDEA defined emotional disturbances. In this sample, the percent of correct classifications, sensitivity, specificity, PPP, and NPP of the STEP-S Depression and Problem Behaviors subscales were excellent; however, further research is necessary to assess results on varied populations and other conditions, such as for the Anxiety and Social Problems subscales. Future researchers should pay specific attention to the method used for establishing the criterion for emotional disturbances. In this study, previous identification of an emotional disturbance was used as the criterion.</p>
<p>Though these results seem promising, a number of limitations and cautions were present. A measure of item equivalence among respondents must be determined. Since the same items appear on different STEP respondent versions (e.g., self-report, parent report, teacher report), it is important to observe if the responses of the student, parent, and teacher are viewed as equivalent for each item across versions. It is also important to conduct interrater reliability and pattern analysis studies. Even though different respondents respond to the same items, different interpretations may result from the resulting subscale scores for the different respondent groups (e.g., parents, teachers, students). Consistency in response patterns across versions allows an “apples to apples” comparison when scores are triangulated. If respondents do not define and respond to items in an equivalent manner, a desirable comparison is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the present study involves the type of response scale used. Using a 3-point scale for infrequently endorsed items may result in the suppression of reliability and validity estimates. In other words, 3-point scales may lead to homogeneity in scores, typically lowering reliability and validity estimates. Future studies should determine if a 4- or 5-point response scale leads to more heterogeneous response patterns, particularly for low-frequency items.</p>
<p>A final caution involves sampling issues of selection and diversity, which can be addressed in future studies. For the most part, the current studies were conducted in urban and suburban areas in the Mid-Atlantic region. Having larger sample representation from rural areas and different regions of the United States would increase generalizability. In addition, there was an overrepresentation in this study of students whose parents graduated from college, and thus had a higher socioeconomic status. Future studies should include samples with more representative and diverse educational and economic levels. Moreover, findings from this study were influenced by self-selection because only the teachers and parents who wanted to participate in the study completed the response forms. This potential source of bias has been an ongoing concern within social science research.</p>
<p>Regardless of the limitations listed above, these preliminary studies present important, initial data regarding the STEP-S. With replication and further research, consistent, useful, and multifaceted evidence may bolster the effectiveness of this instrument. The development of reliable and valid screening tools for students with emotional disturbances is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411413759">Cullinan &amp; Sabornie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411413759">U.S. House of Representatives, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this study also suggests that the STEP-S may have important practical implications for those involved with ensuring students’ academic success, including teachers, parents, professional school counselors, and other educational stakeholders. For example, the STEP-S seems to present an effective and quick method for determining if students have symptoms that may indicate emotional disturbances. Administration and scoring of the STEP-S requires less than 15 min. This could prove to be an appealing and simple tool for practitioners to use, especially in the school setting, where the pressure on academic time is paramount.</p>
<p>Another positive contribution presented by the STEP-S is determination of the need for further diagnostic testing, which could lead to decisions that involve special education services. Moreover, it can help a multidisciplinary student support team develop targeted early intervention strategies and plans. Early intervention programs are not only time and cost effective, but can also prevent children from manifesting more significant symptoms of emotional disturbances.</p>
<p>Because there is a discrepancy between special identification rates and the estimates of prevalence of emotional disturbances in society, it is imperative that educators, parents, and others invested in students’ success have effective and reliable tools that align with the IDEA and other applicable nosological systems (e.g., the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.–text rev.), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411413759">APA, 2000</xref>). With further research and development, the STEP-S has the potential to become a tool that yields consistent and useful scores, thus contributing to the effective and appropriate screening of students with emotional disturbances.</p>
