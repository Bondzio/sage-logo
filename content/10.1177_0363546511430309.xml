<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Despite its importance, few studies regarding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after rotator cuff repair have been reported.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: To evaluate the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in terms of HRQOL using SF-36 and to analyze factors affecting postoperative HRQOL.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: We included 309 patients who were followed-up for a mean 26.3 months (range, 12-48 months) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, between November 2004 and August 2008, and who underwent periodic measurement of HRQOL using SF-36 preoperatively, 1 year postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. The correlation between SF-36 and shoulder-specific functional outcome measures (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES], Simple Shoulder Test [SST], and Constant score) was evaluated using correlation analysis, and the relationship between various clinical factors, including rotator cuff healing and HRQOL, was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The SF-36 scores for physical HRQOL and mental HRQOL showed significant improvement, from 40.40 to 47.53 and from 44.45 to 50.55 at 12 months after surgery, respectively (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and improvement was maintained with 48.24 and 50.45, respectively, at the final follow-up (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Scores also showed improvement according to all clinical variables, even after stratification of each variable. The correlation between SF-36 and shoulder-specific functional outcome measures was fair to moderate (Pearson correlation coefficients, 0.199-0.528). Various factors had significant effects on preoperative physical and mental HRQOL; however, postoperatively (at 12 months and final follow-up, respectively), only older age (<italic>P</italic> = .008 and .013), female sex (<italic>P</italic> = .036 and .043), presence of diabetes (<italic>P</italic> = .026 and .027), and low level of sports activity (<italic>P</italic> = .049 at final follow-up) had a negative effect on postoperative physical HRQOL in multivariate analysis, and female sex (<italic>P</italic> = .010 and .001) was the only factor leading to worse postoperative mental HRQOL.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair significantly improved the patients’ HRQOL both physically and mentally. Older age, female sex, diabetes, and low level of sports activity were related to low postoperative physical HRQOL, and female sex was also related to low postoperative mental HRQOL.</p>

<body>
<p>Rotator cuff tear is a common condition that causes pain and disability, including weakness and decreased range of motion in the shoulder joint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430309">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430309">19</xref></sup> and it is more prevalent in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430309">14</xref></sup> Along with population aging, the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear has improved, and its incidence has shown a rapid increase. Consequently, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, a commonly accepted treatment for rotator cuff tear, is performed with increasing frequency, and fortunately, the functional outcomes of rotator cuff repair have been satisfactory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430309">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430309">27</xref></sup> Functional outcomes are evaluated using various outcome instruments; currently, more than 20 different region-specific and condition-specific outcome instruments are being used in the determination of functional outcomes after rotator cuff repair surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511430309">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430309">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511430309">21</xref></sup> However, the general health status or quality of life after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair cannot be adequately assessed by these functional outcome instruments.</p>
<p>The term “quality of life” (QOL) is a broad description involving the response of individuals to the physical, psychological, and social effects of disease during daily activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511430309">40</xref></sup> Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is performed to improve QOL, which is dependent on shoulder functioning relevant for daily activities rather than to prolong the patient’s life; therefore, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) should be emphasized when evaluating the outcome of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and assessment of treatment should focus on the patient as a whole and include the patient’s subjective perception and not be limited to improvement of a specific region or condition separately. However, despite the recognized importance of HRQOL evaluation, to the best of our knowledge, few studies of HRQOL after rotator cuff repair have been reported. In addition, as mentioned above, most shoulder functional outcome instruments do not adequately reflect HRQOL and have the disadvantage of being filled out by the attending physician or researcher, with results vulnerable to bias, particularly when assessing the mental aspect of HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511430309">32</xref></sup> Therefore, a self-reported patient-based outcome measurement focusing on HRQOL after rotator cuff repair is needed.</p>
<p>The Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was developed in the early 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0363546511430309">57</xref></sup> and has become the most widely used and most reliable self-reporting method for the assessment of general health status, HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546511430309">50</xref></sup> It has been translated into more than 25 languages, including Korean, and validated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430309">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we evaluated the outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in terms of HRQOL using SF-36 as the gold standard for HRQOL measurement. In addition, various clinical factors and several shoulder-specific outcome measures were analyzed to reveal the correlation with postoperative HRQOL.</p>

<title>Demographic Data</title>
<p>Among 482 patients who had undergone rotator cuff repair at our hospital between November 2004 and August 2008, we included patients who underwent evaluation by SF-36 both preoperatively and at least 1 year postoperatively. Patients were considered surgical candidates if they had persistent shoulder pain not responding to at least 6 months of adequate nonoperative treatment, such as anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, subacromial injection of cortisone, and activity modification. Presence of the rotator cuff tear was confirmed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and arthroscopic findings. Shoulder-specific functional outcomes were also evaluated by means of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Constant score, preoperatively and at least 1 year postoperatively, and compared with SF-36 results. We excluded patients with either open or mini-open repair (n = 92), irreparable cuff tears (n = 3), workers’ compensation status (n = 13), previous surgery on the same shoulder (n = 3), a follow-up period of less than 12 months (n = 39), and those who did not undergo SF-36 evaluation either preoperatively or at least 1 year postoperatively (n = 23). We excluded patients who were receiving workers’ compensation, as their nonanatomic issues might affect the outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546511430309">41</xref></sup> Finally, 309 patients with an average age of 56.5 ± 11.5 years (range, 35-80 years), including 151 men and 158 women, were enrolled. The mean follow-up period was 26.3 ± 10.1 months (range, 12-48 months; 138 patients with &lt;24 months and 171 patients with &gt;24 months). Two hundred thirty-nine patients had isolated supraspinatus tears, 46 patients had supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears, 15 patients had supraspinatus and subscapularis tears, and 9 patients had tears in all 3 muscles. All data on clinical factors that can affect postoperative QOL, such as age, sex, hand dominance, symptom duration, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), traumatic onset, level of sports activity, work level, preoperative stiffness, preoperative pain intensity, tear size of both anteroposterior (AP) dimension and retraction, fatty infiltration of each rotator cuff muscle, repair technique, and repair integrity, were prospectively collected and evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511430309">Table 1</xref>). Levels of sports activity and work were recorded as high, medium, and low. High level of sports activity was defined as enjoying dynamic or contact sports (eg, boxing, rugby, basketball, football, volleyball, and tennis), medium level as enjoying static sports (eg, golf, yoga, swimming, cycling, and running), and low level as rarely joining sports. High work level was defined as heavy manual labor, medium level as manual labor with less activity, and low level as sedentary work. We defined shoulder stiffness for forward elevation as less than 120° passively, external rotation with the arm at the side as less than 30° passively, and internal rotation at the back as lower than L3 passively, as described in the previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546511430309">45</xref></sup> Fatty infiltration of each rotator cuff muscle (the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis) was evaluated according to the criteria established by Goutallier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511430309">22</xref></sup> In addition, tear size was measured intraoperatively using a calibrated probe after debridement of degenerated tendon edges. The AP dimension was measured at the lateral edge of the footprint, and medial retraction was estimated by the distance from the apex of the tear to the lateral footprint.</p>

<p>For comparison of each clinical variable affecting HRQOL, we divided each variable into subgroups: age as less than 55 years, between 55 and 60 years, between 60 and 65 years, and more than 65 years; symptom duration as less or more than 1 year; fatty infiltration of each cuff muscle as grade 1 or less (normal to mild) and grade 2 or more (moderate to severe); tear size as less than 3 cm (small to medium tear) or more than 3 cm (large to massive tear); preoperative pain intensity as pain visual analog scale (VAS) score below 5 (mild pain) or above 5 (moderate to severe pain). We obtained institutional review board approval for the study protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511430309">
<title>Surgical Procedures</title>
<p>All surgical procedures were performed by one senior author (J.H.O.). Subacromial decompression was performed in all patients for removal of inflamed bursal tissue, and acromioplasty was performed in patients with spurs for creation of a flat acromion. Distal clavicle resection was performed in patients who experienced symptomatic acromioclavicular arthritis, and biceps tenotomy or tenodesis was performed for symptomatic biceps tears involving more than 50% of the tendon and for symptomatic degenerative superior labral anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions, according to the age or activity level of the patient. If the patient had a stiff shoulder, we applied brisement force under anesthesia, with or without capsular release. The repair technique was either single or double row, according to the tear size, tendon status, tear configuration, and reparability. All knots were tied securely using self-locking, sliding knots.</p>
<p>Immobilization after cuff repair was maintained with an abduction brace, and duration of immobilization was based on tear size, as measured at the time of surgery, from 4 to 6 weeks. However, passive range of motion was allowed during the immobilization period and performed immediately after surgery, except in cases of large to massive tears. Active-assisted range of motion exercise was allowed after weaning off the brace. Muscle strengthening exercises were started between 9 and 12 weeks, and sports activities were permitted at 6 months after surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511430309">
<title>Repair Integrity</title>
<p>Postoperative rotator cuff healing was evaluated either by computed tomography arthrography (CTA; n = 227) or ultrasonography (USG; n = 82); evaluations were performed at a mean of 12.9 ± 5.2 months after surgery. Experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, who were unaware of the present study, performed and interpreted the CTA or USG and further evaluated rotator cuff healing to the greater tuberosity. In CTA interpretation, we regarded contrast media leakage through the footprint as a failure of rotator cuff healing; however, leakage with maintenance of the cuff insertion into the footprint was not considered a failure of healing, as other authors have argued previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0363546511430309">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0363546511430309">58</xref></sup> For USG, the criteria for diagnosis of unhealed cuffs were as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430309">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0363546511430309">60</xref></sup>: nonobservation of the repaired tendon attributable to retraction, focal defect, or gap within the repaired tendon with consecutive loss of the normal anterior arc of the subdeltoid bursa; loss of the repaired supraspinatus substance with widening of the gap between the supraspinatus and biceps tendon; and hypoechoic or anechoic cleft extending through the entire substance of the repaired cuff.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546511430309">
<title>SF-36 QOL</title>
<p>Health-related quality of life was measured periodically using SF-36 preoperatively, 1 year postoperatively, and at the last follow-up. The SF-36 health survey has 8 scales measuring 8 domains of HRQOL: physical functioning (PF), role limitations because of physical health problems (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perception (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations because of emotional problems (RE), and mental health (MH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0363546511430309">57</xref></sup> The 8 SF-36 scale scores can be summarized into 2 summary components providing the overall assessment of HRQOL related to physical and mental health, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546511430309">48</xref></sup>: the physical component summary (PCS; PF, RP, BP, GH, and VT) and mental component summary (MCS; MH, RE, SF, VT, and GH). The PCS was chosen as a measure of general physical HRQOL, and the MCS was chosen as a measure of the patients’ emotional status that could affect HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430309">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546511430309">38</xref></sup> The SF-36 is currently the most widely used and most reliable self-reporting method for the assessment of general health status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546511430309">50</xref></sup>; it has been translated into Korean and validated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430309">23</xref></sup> In this study, the reliability of SF-36 was evaluated and showed very high internal consistency (Cronbach α = .926). In addition, the responsiveness of SF-36 was also good, with an effect size of 0.61 to 0.92 and a standardized responsiveness mean of 0.50 to 0.89. We used the translated form of the SF-36v2 health survey (acute form, version 2.0) licensed by QualityMetric (Lincoln, Rhode Island).</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546511430309">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The paired <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparison of preoperative and postoperative scores in all 8 domains of the SF-36 and various shoulder-specific functional outcome instruments. The independent <italic>t</italic> test or analysis of variance test was performed for the examination of differences in SF-36 scores between subgroups of each clinical variable, and the correlation analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was performed to identify the relationship between various shoulder-specific functional outcome instruments and SF-36 at each period. Although the interpretation of PCC values is somewhat arbitrary, it is generally interpreted as almost perfect (0.81-1.00), excellent (0.61-0.80), good to moderate (0.41-0.61), fair (0.21-0.40), or slight (0.00-0.20).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511430309">33</xref></sup> In addition, multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine the independent factors affecting postoperative physical HRQOL by inputting every significant variable derived from univariate analyses along with the preoperative PCS score in multivariate analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois), and a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Scores of various shoulder-specific functional outcome instruments (ie, ASES, SST, and Constant scores) also showed significant improvement after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511430309">Table 2</xref>). Each shoulder-specific outcome instrument showed significant correlation with the SF-36 regardless of assessment time and correlated higher with the PCS than with the MCS. However, correlation with the PCS was only fair to moderate, with correlation coefficients of 0.199 to 0.528 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511430309">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors Affecting HRQOL</title>
<p>Preoperatively, the SF-36 scores differed significantly according to various factors; however, postoperatively, tear size and fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus no longer affected the PCS scores, and similarly, symptom duration, preoperative stiffness, and initial pain intensity no longer affected the MCS scores. The postoperative PCS scores were significantly worse in older patients, women, DM, and those with lower level of sports activity, more severe preoperative pain, more fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus and subscapularis, and failure of rotator cuff healing. The overall failure rate of cuff healing was 18.1% (56 of 309) in this study, and it significantly affected the postoperative PCS score at 12 months after surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .031) and at the final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .008). The postoperative MCS scores were significantly different only by sex; that is, a significantly lower MCS score was observed in female patients. These results are presented in Appendix 3 (available online).</p>
<p>However, in multivariate analysis, only age, sex, DM, and sports activity level showed significant correlation with postoperative PCS scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511430309">Table 4</xref>). Bonferroni post hoc analysis demonstrated significant differences in PCS scores between age &gt;65 and &lt;55 years and between age &gt;65 and 55 to 60 years and between high and low levels of sports activities (Appendix 4, available online). Older patients with age &gt;65 years showed lower PCS scores than relatively younger patients with age &lt;55 years (by 5.220 points at 12 months and by 4.754 points at the final follow-up) and also patients aged between 55 and 60 years (by 3.704 points at 12 months and 3.751 points at final follow-up). Being female appeared to lower the PCS scores by 2.408 points at 12 months and 2.332 points at the final follow-up, and concurrent DM also lowered the PCS scores by 3.676 points at 12 months and 3.696 points at the final follow-up. In addition, in patients with high level of sports activity, PCS scores increased by 3.590 points at the final follow-up compared to those with low level of sports activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511430309">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Health-related quality of life was defined by Bullinger et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511430309">8</xref></sup> as “the impact of perceived health on an individual’s ability to live a fulfilling life.” It has recently gained increasing attention, particularly within the elderly population. Rotator cuff tear is a common problem in the elderly population and affects mood, physical activity, and HRQOL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511430309">37</xref></sup>; however, outcome evaluations after rotator cuff repair have been confined to disease- or region-specific measurement tools assessed by doctors or researchers based on a range of shoulder motion or muscle power and imaging studies, such as MRI or CT, for the evaluation of rotator cuff healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430309">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430309">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546511430309">44</xref></sup> The medical outcome study SF-36 is a widely used patient-based health status measure. Previous studies have demonstrated that the SF-36 is a reliable, valid, and responsive general measure of overall HRQOL in patients with musculoskeletal disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546511430309">51</xref></sup> and with shoulder disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546511430309">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0363546511430309">61</xref></sup> Using the SF-36 HRQOL measurement tool, we evaluated the general health status and satisfaction of patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair as well as various clinical factors affecting HRQOL.</p>
<p>In the current study, with the exception of GH (general health perception), all subscales of the SF-36 showed significant improvement after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and the improvement was sustained over the follow-up period. This result demonstrates that arthroscopic rotator cuff repair can significantly improve the general health status or HRQOL of patients with rotator cuff tear. Among the 8 subscales of the SF-36, the BP (body pain) score was the lowest preoperatively and improved most markedly after surgery (Appendix 1, available online), which may indicate that pain intensity is the most important factor in HRQOL and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in substantially reduced pain, leading to improved HRQOL. We believe that improved sleep generated by decreased pain may be one of the reasons for improved HRQOL because night pain and disturbed sleep were known to have a profound impact on HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511430309">35</xref></sup> The fact that initial pain VAS significantly affected preoperative PCS and MCS scores (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and even postoperative PCS scores (<italic>P</italic> = .003 at 12 months postoperatively and <italic>P</italic> = .013 at the final follow-up) supports the importance of pain control for enhancement of HRQOL (Appendix 3, available online). In addition, the mean scores for RP (role limitations because of physical health problems) and RE (role limitations because of emotional problems) were relatively low compared with other subscales (Appendix 1, available online). We believe that the influence of rotator cuff tears on mood and shoulder-related physical activity caused severe limitations in role function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511430309">37</xref></sup> Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair appears to reduce role limitations because of physical and emotional problems and helps patients to enhance their physical and social functioning, which consequently contributes to achievement of a higher level of HRQOL.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported significant improvement in patients’ general health status or HRQOL after rotator cuff repair. Baysal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430309">5</xref></sup> demonstrated that mini-open repair of a full-thickness tear improved the postoperative HRQOL measured by the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index scores; Vitale et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0363546511430309">56</xref></sup> also reported postoperative increases in HRQOL measures, based on the Health Utility Index and the European Quality of Life Measure, suggesting that rotator cuff repair is a highly cost-effective intervention in health care, comparing favorably to other common interventions including the coronary artery bypass graft. Results showing significant improvement in HRQOL after rotator cuff repair are consistent with those of the present study. In addition, several studies have reported a beneficial effect of rotator cuff repair on general health status, as measured with the SF-36. In their relatively short-term follow-up study (mean follow-up, 12.7 months), Gartsman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430309">17</xref></sup> showed that arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear in 50 consecutive patients improved SF-36 scores at the most recent follow-up from 34.1 preoperatively to 46.5 in the PCS score and from 49.7 preoperatively to 52.6 in the MCS score. This result is in agreement with ours. McKee and Yoo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511430309">39</xref></sup> also investigated the effect of surgery for rotator cuff disease on general health status of 31 patients, demonstrating that surgery for chronic rotator cuff disease improved the physical HRQOL at 24 months, from 36.4 to 42.4 in the PCS score, but not the mental HRQOL. This is contrary to our result, which showed significant improvement in both physical and mental HRQOL. We consider that this difference might be caused by differences in sex composition (women comprised only 29.6% in the study by McKee and Yoo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546511430309">39</xref></sup> and 51.1% in our study) and ethnicity. However, these studies have the major limitations of small case numbers and limited evaluation of prognostic factors. Although we showed similar improvement in the PCS score from 40.40 to 48.24 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and MCS score from 44.45 to 50.45 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), the preoperative baseline score and the degree of improvement were different from those of other studies. We consider that differences in baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, and ethnicity, or assessment time between studies, may reflect the differences in results.</p>
<p>Although we did not compare the effect of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with that of other interventions for rotator cuff tear on the HRQOL in this study, other interventions also seem to increase HRQOL considerably, as shown in other studies. Osti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546511430309">46</xref></sup> compared the HRQOL-related outcome of rotator cuff repair performed using either a mini-open or an arthroscopic technique for rotator cuff tears of less than 3 cm with an average of 31 months’ follow-up and showed similar improvement of SF-36 scores in both groups at the final follow-up (PCS from 33.5 to 55.0 in mini-open repair and 32.8 to 55.0 in arthroscopic repair; MCS from 41.5 to 60.2 in mini-open repair and 41.1 to 58.4 in arthroscopic repair). In addition, Mohtadi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511430309">42</xref></sup> compared the surgical outcomes between open repair and mini-open repair in their randomized controlled trial using Rotator Cuff Quality of Life scores and concluded that there was no difference between the 2 groups at the 1- and 2-year follow-up time periods (<italic>P</italic> = .337 and .943, respectively). Therefore, we can hypothesize that whether it is arthroscopic or mini-open or open repair, the surgery for rotator cuff tear can enhance the HRQOL of patients.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that tear size, fatty infiltration of cuff muscles, symptom duration, and repair integrity after rotator cuff repair are important factors in functional outcomes assessed by shoulder-specific outcome measures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511430309">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430309">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546511430309">44</xref></sup> not necessarily by general health outcome measures. However, these factors do not appear to affect the postoperative HRQOL. In this study, all SF-36 scores showed improvement, regardless of these factors (Appendix 2, available online), and those factors did not cause any differences in physical and mental HRQOL scores in univariate and multivariate analyses (Appendix 3 [available online] and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511430309">Table 4</xref>). The reason for these findings is unclear; however, we think that adequate arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and concomitant procedures may result in consistent improvement of the HRQOL, regardless of these predisposing factors. Bursectomy, acromioplasty, and appropriate postoperative rehabilitation, even if healing after rotator cuff repair fails, can lead to adequate pain relief and subjective comfort of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511430309">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511430309">31</xref></sup> which appear to be more important factors in HRQOL after rotator cuff repair. There could be some massive irreparable tears where bursectomy/acromioplasty is the proper surgical choice before reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and arthroscopic intervention even for massive irreparable tears can still help patients, although the outcomes might not be quite as good.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546511430309">36</xref></sup> In addition, patients with larger rotator cuff tears and more severe fatty degeneration with longer symptom duration, resultantly having poorer initial HRQOL, may feel more subjective satisfaction with the improvement of their symptoms after surgery, and this can affect the results. Moreover, it is possible that rotator cuff repair restores shoulder function to a point where various clinical factors no longer influence the self-reported general health status, even though there may be some functional limitations of the shoulder. In this respect, it has been recommended that the outcome of rotator cuff repair should be evaluated with both general HRQOL measures and shoulder-specific measures to quantify outcomes of shoulder procedures and to compensate for the low disease specificity of SF-36.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430309">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546511430309">43</xref></sup> The fact that the correlation between SF-36 and various shoulder-specific outcome measures was only fair to moderate in this study (Table 3) also shows the necessity of combining both general and shoulder-specific outcome measures.</p>
<p>In the present study, the only factor affecting the postoperative mental HRQOL was sex. In addition, sex was also a significant prognostic factor in postoperative physical HRQOL. Several factors may be correlated with lower level of mental and physical HRQOL in female patients. Razmjou et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546511430309">49</xref></sup> suggested that, in women, role demands or importance of certain activities, such as dressing and grooming, may be contributing factors and showed significantly lower scores in the emotional domain of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index in female patients. Female patients appeared to experience more emotional difficulties than men, including depression, stress disorder, or other anxiety problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511430309">15</xref></sup> Peek and Coward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546511430309">47</xref></sup> reported that sociodemographic factors accounted for sex differences in disability with activities of daily living, and Katz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511430309">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511430309">30</xref></sup> suggested that more severe symptoms of female patients may in part be related to differences in symptom perception. In addition, several authors have reported that female patients tended to postpone treatment or delay in referring to specialists, which lengthen symptom duration and may influence the subjective HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430309">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511430309">34</xref></sup> We observed similar findings in this study in female patients, with longer symptom duration (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and higher initial pain intensity (<italic>P</italic> = .004). Surgeons should be aware of this sex difference when planning operations or evaluating surgical results.</p>
<p>For the postoperative physical HRQOL, only age, sex, DM, and level of sports activity were found to be independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. In general, the older population has the tendency of decreased muscle power and decreased range of shoulder motion as well as increased chance of other medical comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511430309">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511430309">37</xref></sup> These changes due to aging can be a component of disability and may cause decreased HRQOL. Han et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430309">23</xref></sup> demonstrated a significantly negative correlation between age and SF-36 scores. In addition, the relationship between DM and HRQOL has also been well documented in the previous literature. Katz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511430309">28</xref></sup> suggested an association of chronic insulin use and obesity with lower HRQOL in patients with DM, and Hill-Briggs et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511430309">24</xref></sup> showed that impaired renal functions from DM and related complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, are related to perceived health status and HRQOL. Similarly, previous studies have consistently reported a negative correlation between medical comorbidities such as DM and HRQOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430309">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0363546511430309">53</xref></sup> In addition, the negative effect of comorbidities on HRQOL could also be seen in shoulder diseases, such as glenohumeral degenerative arthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546511430309">52</xref></sup> idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0363546511430309">59</xref></sup> or rotator cuff tear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546511430309">55</xref></sup> These results coincide with ours, which showed that the presence of DM independently decreased HRQOL after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Moreover, the level of sports activity was related to physical HRQOL at the final follow-up in this study. It is interesting that patients who enjoyed sports activities had a greater chance for more enhanced HRQOL postoperatively than those who rarely joined sports activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the relationship between sports activity level and HRQOL after rotator cuff repair. Sports activities play an important role in both the prevention and treatment of overweight, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions, and physical inactivity is responsible for increased disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430309">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430309">25</xref></sup> Conversely, these comorbidities may also inhibit higher sports activity. There is strong evidence that higher levels of sports and physical activity improve HRQOL, and patients reaching recommended physical activity levels are more likely to have a better overall HRQOL and perceived health status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430309">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511430309">13</xref></sup> We consider that individuals with higher sports activity are prone to better physical and mental health, resulting in a higher HRQOL, even after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery.</p>
<p>The current study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, although the data were collected prospectively; hence, there could be potential biases of a retrospective study. Although we tried to include every possible potential prognostic factor for HRQOL, we could not evaluate all factors, such as medical comorbidities other than DM and hypertension, or educational level, which might act as potential confounders. Second, not all patients who underwent rotator cuff repair completed the self-reported SF-36 questionnaire. The drop-out rate from the cohort (62/482, 12.9%) might increase the risk of selection bias of which we were not aware. Third, the follow-up period of more than 1 year (mean, 26.3 months) was relatively short. It is possible that SF-36 scores may further improve or decline in the long term. Further well-designed prospective controlled trials with much longer follow-up periods may be necessary. Finally, although the SF-36 is generally regarded as the gold standard for HRQOL, mobility items, such as walking or climbing stairs, form a greater part than upper limb items, which could cause the SF-36 to be less sensitive in most shoulder patients. However, currently, other outcome instruments for HRQOL, including a sufficient number of items for shoulder function, are not available. In addition, we wanted to focus on the general health status after rotator cuff repair, not on the disease- or region-specific functional evaluation.</p>
<p>Despite the potential limitations described above, the current study has a major strength in the evaluation of the effect of rotator cuff repair and prognostic factors on postoperative HRQOL, in a homogeneous group of patients who underwent only arthroscopic repair by one senior author, with a large number of cases (309 patients), including various potential prognostic factors, especially the status of rotator cuff healing. We consider that this strength makes our results quite convincing, and these results can contribute to the prediction of the prognosis regarding HRQOL following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for each patient.</p>
<p>In conclusion, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a successful procedure for the improvement of patients’ HRQOL, both physically and mentally, and was measured using the SF-36. In addition, HRQOL after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was affected by demographic factors, including age and sex, combined with medical comorbidities, such as DM, and level of sports activity, not by the size of the rotator cuff tear, fatty infiltration of rotator cuff muscles, symptom duration, or repair integrity, which were known to be prognostic factors for functional outcomes following rotator cuff repair. The effect of these clinical factors on postoperative HRQOL should be considered when rotator cuff repair surgery is planned, and this can contribute to the preparation of individualized protocols for surgery and rehabilitation and to prognosis evaluation.</p>
