<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The treatment of chondral lesions is still an important challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon. Attempts have been made to restore cartilage lesions by filling the defects with a temporary biocompatible matrix.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The authors present their midterm experience with the implantation of alginate beads containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A biodegradable, alginate-based biocompatible scaffold containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes was used for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. Twenty-one patients were clinically prospectively evaluated with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and a visual analog scale (VAS). The mean follow-up time was 6.3 years (range, 5-8 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed based on the MOCART (Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue) system, allowing morphologic assessment of the repair tissue. Magnetic resonance images were taken at 1 year of follow-up and at a mean follow-up of 6.1 years (range, 5-7 years).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During the follow-up period, the WOMAC and VAS scores improved significantly. No signs of clinical deterioration or adverse reactions to the alginate beads/allogenic chondrocyte implantation were observed. Four failures occurred during the follow-up period in this study (19.05%). The MOCART scores were moderate and remained stable in time.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This investigation provided useful information on the efficacy of the implantation of alginate beads containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee. The midterm clinical outcome of the presented technique was satisfactory. However, these results were not confirmed by the MRI findings.</p>

<p>Articular cartilage lesions have become of major interest to orthopaedic surgeons because most lesions do not heal spontaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511423013">16</xref></sup> This poor repair capacity of cartilage has led to the development of various surgical techniques. The effectiveness of microfracture has been evaluated in human subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423013">31</xref></sup> Patients treated with this technique often experience short-term pain relief and develop progressive symptoms because of repair tissue failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423013">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511423013">25</xref></sup> It is now over 20 years since the first patient was operated on with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423013">6</xref></sup> This technique has gained wide scientific and clinical support for use in the repair of focal articular lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423013">29</xref></sup> However, during in vitro propagation of the chondrocytes, dedifferentiation of the cells can occur, and afterward these fibroblast-like chondrocytes show different biosynthetic properties than the original cartilage cells in the knee joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511423013">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this way, characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) has been developed to improve the results of articular regeneration with chondrocyte cell therapy through the use of a cell population capable of making stable hyaline-like cartilage in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423013">30</xref></sup> Characterized chondrocytes are an expanded population of chondrocytes that expresses a marker profile (a gene score) predictive of the capacity to form hyaline-like cartilage in vivo in a consistent and reproducible manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511423013">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Another way to avoid the issue of dedifferentiation during in vitro propagation of chondrocytes could be the use of instantaneously delivered allogenic chondrocytes. Previous research has shown that human chondrocytes keep their phenotype in alginate with neosynthesis of an extracellular matrix and that this chondrocyte/alginate culture setup can be biologically frozen without any impairment in the total of overall aggrecan synthesis rates or its cartilage-specific aggrecan subtypes once thawed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423013">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511423013">3</xref></sup> Ideally, this could lead to the construction of a chondrocyte donor bank with cell batches ready for use in large numbers of patients.</p>
<p>A pilot study was started to evaluate the use of a biodegradable, alginate-based biocompatible scaffold containing human allogenic chondrocytes for the treatment of cartilage lesions in the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> This technique was developed in 2002 and the procedure has been performed in 21 patients. The short-term results of this pilot study showed that the proposed procedure was feasible and safe for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. The described technique provided clinical and histologic outcomes that were equal to those of other cartilage repair techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref></sup> However, the promising short-term clinical outcome of the allogenic chondrocytes/alginate beads implantation was not confirmed by the short-term MRI findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> The goals of this study were to assess whether the clinical improvements observed in the pilot study at 2 years continued at midterm follow-up and to reevaluate the initial moderate MRI findings at midterm follow-up.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Patients with focal cartilage defects involving the femoral condyles, patella, and trochlea, and with clinical symptoms (pain, swelling, locking, and “giving away”) were eligible for treatment. Exclusion criteria were an age under 10 and above 60 years, untreatable tibiofemoral or patellofemoral malalignment or instability, diffuse osteoarthritis or bipolar “kissing” lesions, major meniscal deficiency, and other general medical conditions such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical experimentation was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and informed consent to participate in the study and to comply with the postoperative regimen was obtained from all patients.</p>
<p>Twenty-one patients (13 males, 8 females) were treated consecutively since October 2002 as published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> The mean follow-up time was 6.3 years (range, 5-8 years). Briefly, the right/left (R/L) ratio was 12/9. In all these cases, the lesions were focal. Fifteen chondral defects were located on the medial femoral condyle (MFC), 4 on the lateral femoral condyle (LFC), 1 on the patella, and 1 on the trochlea. All lesions were ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) grade III or IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423013">14</xref></sup> and had a mean size of 2.6 cm<sup>2</sup> (range, 1-9.25 cm<sup>2</sup>). The origin was traumatic in 12 cases and focal degenerative in 9 cases. The mean age of the patients was 33 years (range, 12-47 years). The mean duration of symptoms prior to surgery was 33.20 months (range, 6-73 months).</p>
<p>Previous surgery in 10 of the patients (47.62%) included 6 partial meniscectomies, 2 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions, 1 meniscal suture, and 5 cartilage repair operations, such as shaving (1), debridement (2), and microfracturing (2) of chondral lesions. In 5 patients, associated procedures were performed: 1 ACL reconstruction, 1 Fulkerson osteotomy, 1 high tibial osteotomy, and 1 lateral and 1 medial allogenic meniscal transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423013">33</xref></sup> Detailed individual patient characteristics were published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of this study, the patient cohort consisted of 21 individuals. The patients were followed prospectively and evaluated yearly. At 3 years of follow-up, 2 of the 21 patients (9.52%) were lost to follow-up, another 2 (9.52%) at 4 years of follow-up when they changed their addresses. Clinical data of 18 patients were available at 3 years of follow-up, of 15 patients at 4 years, of 14 patients at 5 years, of 9 patients at 6 years, of 7 patients at 7 years, and 1 patient achieved 8 years of follow-up.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546511423013">
<title>Chondrocyte Harvesting and Culture</title>
<p>Human articular chondrocytes were isolated as described before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> All allogenic cartilage cells used were obtained from the Ghent Tissue Retrieval Programme following the restrictions imposed by the European/Belgian requests for tissue banks. Human articular cartilage was obtained from the femoral condyles of different donors within 24 hours of death. All donors had died after a short illness and were under 40 years of age. None of them had received corticosteroids or cytostatic drugs. Visually intact cartilage was harvested from the femoral condyles and diced into small fragments. The chondrocytes were isolated by sequential enzymatic digestion of the extracellular matrix. Chondrocyte cultures in alginate beads were then prepared as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> The chondrocytes in the alginate beads were cultured for 2 weeks in a 6-well plate in an incubator at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Three milliliters of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL, Grand Island, New York) supplemented with 10% acceptor serum and 50 μg freshly dissolved ascorbate per milliliter were then added and replaced 3 times weekly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511423013">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>A mini-arthrotomy was performed to properly reach the defect. After the carefully performed debridement of the defect back to stable walls of healthy cartilage, the lesion was measured. Once the defect was cleaned and ready to accept the alginate beads, it was sealed with a periosteal flap with the cambium layer facing the defect. Before the defect was sealed completely, a small opening was left unsutured for implantation of the alginate beads. The alginate beads were inserted manually. Subsequently, the open edge of the flap was sutured to the remaining borders of the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511423013">Figure 1</xref>), which was then easily sealed watertight with fibrin glue (Baxter, Deerfield, Illinois). The periosteal flap was sutured with single resorbable Vicryl 6/0 stitches (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey). The periosteal flap was harvested from the proximal tibia. The postoperative regimen consisted of non-weightbearing for 3 weeks and the immediate institution of continuous passive motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> Achieving a normal gait pattern was advised at 10 weeks postoperatively. Maximum active flexion did not exceed 90° for the first 4 weeks of rehabilitation. Full range of motion was allowed 8 weeks postoperatively. Isometric quadriceps training, straight-leg raising, and hamstrings isometrics were advised after the first 2 weeks. Return to low-impact sports was allowed 12 months after surgery. All patients were compliant to these guidelines.</p>

<title>Clinical Evaluation</title>
<p>All 21 patients were clinically prospectively evaluated with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain preoperatively and yearly after the procedure. The WOMAC is a valid, reliable, and sensitive instrument for the detection of clinically important changes in health status. It has already been used for the clinical evaluation of cartilage repair techniques in different studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423013">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423013">22</xref></sup> The VAS for pain is a simple, reliable,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423013">5</xref></sup> and valid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423013">12</xref></sup> measurement instrument that measures the amount of pain a patient feels, ranging across a continuum from none to extremely severe.</p>

<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technique</title>
<p>All MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T or a 3-T MRI unit (either a MAGNETOM Avanto, a MAGNETOM Symphony Tim, or MAGNETOM Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Of the 21 patients, 12 (57%) had consented to undergo MRI evaluation protocol at 1 year of follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> and 9 of these 12 patients (75%) at a mean follow-up of 6.1 years (range, 5-7 years). We performed a standard knee MRI protocol including proton-density and T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisitions using a dedicated send-receive 8-channel knee coil.

A delamination of the repair tissue because of trauma was observed in the first case. A progressive deterioration of the clinical status was observed in the latter 2 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging data were available of the last failure showing a thinning of the repair tissue and the formation of several subchondral cysts. These 2 patients elected to undergo joint arthroplasty. No correlation could be found between the failures and size of the lesion.</p>

Hypertrophy of the repair tissue was seen in 4 cases (25.0%) at 1 year. Only 1 case of hypertrophy was observed at the midterm follow-up period (11.1%). Twelve months after the procedure, a complete integration of the border zone with the adjacent cartilage was detected in 5 patients (41.7%). This finding was seen only once, at a mean follow-up of 72 months (11.1%). The surface of the repair tissue was intact in 2 patients (16.7%) and had a homogeneous structure also in 2 (16.7%) patients at 1-year follow-up. The midterm MRI evaluation of the repair tissue showed a damaged surface of the repair tissue in all cases and a homogeneous structure in only 1 case (11.1%). Adhesions were present in 1 patient at 1-year follow-up (16.7%), but not observed later on. Four patients (25%) showed an effusion 1 year after the procedure and 6 patients at the midterm evaluation point (66.7%). Concerning the signal intensities of the repair tissue, the numbers of markedly hypointense or hyperintense observations increased over time. The subchondral lamina was damaged in all cases at both observation periods. Finally, an intact subchondral bone was seen in 7 patients (58.3%) 1 year after the operation. However, the midterm MRI findings showed in all cases subchondral bone changes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The treatment of chondral lesions is still an important challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon because of the difficulty in restoring the damaged areas with hyaline cartilage. Several techniques have been used in the operative treatment of cartilage lesions: marrow stimulation techniques, osteochondral graft transplantation, ACI, and new procedures based on acellular scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423013">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511423013">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref></sup> In the present study, alginate beads containing human allogenic chondrocytes were used for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee. This procedure is a novel cellular-based technique that obviates the need for harvesting and culturing autologous chondrocytes and is performed in a single-step procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> The patients who participated in this study showed a strong clinical improvement after surgery, as shown by the significantly improved WOMAC and VAS pain scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423013">Figures 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546511423013">5</xref>). This improvement remained quite stable over time. No signs of clinical deterioration were observed during the midterm evaluation period. Most of the cartilage repair techniques report favorable clinical outcome at different follow-up times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423013">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423013">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423013">31</xref></sup> As described in the Results, 4 failures were observed during the follow-up period in this study (19.05%) and 4 patients were lost to follow-up (19.05%). Peterson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423013">27</xref></sup> reported a failure rate of 6.93% in their midterm results of ACI. Minas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423013">24</xref></sup> published a failure rate of ACI between 8% and 26% depending on whether the patients were treated previously with microfracture or not. The 19.05% failure rate observed in this study is quite high compared with those published by others. However, one must take into account the high number of previous and associated surgeries performed in these patients, making them a challenging patient cohort.</p>
<p>In the literature, most of the studies report the clinical outcome at different follow-up times. However, a systematic evaluation of the repair tissue has only been done in a few studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511423013">20</xref></sup> The gold-standard method for the imaging evaluation of cartilage lesions is MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423013">28</xref></sup> We opted for the MOCART system because it was found to be a valid, accurate, and reproducible MRI grading and scoring method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423013">21</xref></sup> In the present study, both the original and modified MOCART system were used in a longitudinal fashion to evaluate the repair tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546511423013">Figure 6</xref>). The scores were presented as a percentage of the maximum scores, as published before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511423013">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> In this way, a comparison between both MOCART systems was possible. The modified MOCART system was developed by giving more weight to certain variables in an attempt to increase the prognostic value of the scoring system and should be considered as an incentive for further research to develop a true prognostic and valid MRI scoring system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423013">10</xref></sup> Both original and modified MOCART scores were moderate and remained stable over time. Remarkably, the modified MOCART scores were lower compared with the original MOCART scores. This is probably because of the increased weight given to the subchondral lamina and bone changes.</p>
<p>Based on the original MOCART system published by Marlovits et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423013">21</xref></sup> we analyzed the MRI data at 1 year postoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 6.1 years (see Appendix 1, available online). At midterm, we observed a complete filling of the defect or hypertrophy in 33.3% of the cases. Kon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref></sup> reported, in their series of patients treated with second-generation ACI, a complete filling of the defect in 65.0% at a minimum follow-up of 5 years.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the subchondral lamina was not intact in any of the cases treated with the allogenic chondrocyte technique presented in this study and this was observed at both follow-up times. Moreover, the aspect of the subchondral bone worsened over time. This is a quite troublesome finding compared with the results published by Kon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref></sup> concerning the second-generation ACI. They observed an intact subchondral lamina in 45.0% and an intact subchondral bone in 50.0% of the cases. The number of patients with effusion increased over time from 25.0% to 66.7% in the presented patient cohort. At 5 years of follow-up, patients treated with second-generation ACI showed effusion in only 37.5% of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref></sup> Taken all together, the results of the evaluation of the MRI data with the original MOCART system concerning the allogenic chondrocyte implantation are inferior to those published by Kon et al concerning second-generation ACI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423013">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In general, in this study there is a remarkable difference between the favorable clinical outcome and the moderate to poor MRI findings. Clinical scores give a subjective momentary image of the patient’s status and cannot predict the long-term durability of the good outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423013">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423013">32</xref></sup> A possible explanation for the discrepancy between the clinical outcome and MRI findings could be that patients treated for a cartilage lesion adapt their expectations in time and are more satisfied with less knee function as time passes. However, the true natural history of cartilage defects remains unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423013">29</xref></sup> Mandelbaum et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511423013">19</xref></sup> noted that well-contained, isolated defects smaller than 2 cm<sup>2</sup> may be asymptomatic and nondegenerative. This might also be an explanation for the discrepancy between imaging and clinical outcome. It is clear that only further longer follow-ups and larger high-level MRI studies can solve this issue.</p>
<p>Tissue-engineered cartilage by chondrocytes cultured in alginate has been reported by several authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423013">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423013">26</xref></sup> These studies confirmed the biocompatibility of alginate as a temporary carrier. In this study, as expected in a nonvascularized tissue such as cartilage, no serious adverse reactions to the alginate matrix seeded with allogenic chondrocytes were observed. We have chosen alginate as a scaffold for cell seeding because of its ability to stabilize the chondrocytic phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511423013">3</xref></sup> Alginate enabled us to deliver the cells easily and homogeneously without the risk of leakage. The use of allogenic chondrocytes obviates the need for harvesting and culturing autologous chondrocytes. In this way, the problem of dedifferentiation during in vitro propagation of autologous chondrocytes was avoided. It was calculated from our donor data that approximately 10 to 20 patients could theoretically benefit from a single donor. In the future, this technique could be optimized by using a synthetic membrane instead of the periosteal flap; by selecting the donors on certain ideal characteristics such as age, donor site, and physical condition; and by enhancing the chondrogenic capacity of the alginate matrix by changing its chemical structure and characteristics or by adding growth factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423013">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, the surgical procedure presented in this study is a novel technique. The midterm clinical outcome is satisfactory. No signs of severe clinical deterioration were observed. However, the clinical outcome was not confirmed by the MRI findings. In general, the MRI data were moderate and remained stable in time. The weaknesses of this study were the nonrandom selection of the patient population, the lack of a control group, and the limited number of patients treated. However, this investigation provided useful information on the efficacy of this new treatment in chondral lesions of the knee and inspires us to search for further improvements of this technique. These improvements are mandatory to allow the setup of large-scale, long-term, randomized controlled trials to confirm the reliability of this procedure.</p>
