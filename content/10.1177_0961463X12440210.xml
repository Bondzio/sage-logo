<sec id="sec1-0961463X12440210"><title>Bradford Vivian, <italic>Public Forgetting</italic>: <italic>The Rhetoric and Politics of Beginning Again</italic>. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2010. ISBN 9780271036656</title>
<p>Forgetting has hardly ever had a good press. With the exception of Friedrich Nietzsche, philosophers, social theorists and writers of fiction have tended to equate forgetting with oblivion, loss and failure – with something to be decried rather than cherished. In the past 30 years or so, the preoccupation with memory, both in public debate and in scholarly discourse, has been underpinned by the assumption that societies and individuals <italic>ought to</italic> remember, and that forgetfulness is an unfortunate affliction if not a devious ploy to sweep unpalatable pasts under the proverbial carpet. It has been widely acknowledged, often with reference to the research of Aleksandr Luria and to Jorge Luis Borges’s tragic character Funes, that individuals may remember too much; societies, however, supposedly need to remember their pasts, warts and all.</p>
<p>Bradford Vivian’s book <italic>Public Forgetting</italic> questions such assumptions. Unlike Nietzsche, however, Vivian’s point of departure is not a perceived surfeit of memory, but the insight that remembering and forgetting work in tandem – that one is not possible without the other: ‘The claim that public bodies require healthy measures of forgetting <italic>and</italic> remembering in order to nurture efficacious symbolic bonds with their shared past is not paradoxical. Forgetting can be a necessary spur to remembrance, provoking us to recognize the inherent selectivity of normative public memories and imagine anew, with each passing generation, what our objects of memory should be’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>Vivian critically surveys the genealogy of present-day affirmations of remembering over forgetting: from Plato via Augustine and Locke to Freud and Heidegger. He is similarly critical of those who try to imagine or sketch an <italic>ars oblivionis</italic> as a counterweight to an <italic>ars memoriae</italic>. He argues that they tend to make two false assumptions: that forgetting represents irreversible effacement, and that forgetting and remembering are mutually exclusive. He is interested in a strategic, productive and public forgetting, which complements rather than negates acts of memory – which, in fact, ‘stirs a community to remember its past anew’ (p. 178): ‘Public forgetting constitutes a mode of public judgment whereby communities articulate in speech, language, or other symbolic forms the advent of a radically new set of attitudes, beliefs, or customs concerning the meaning of their own past’ (p. 171). Such a mode of judgment is inherently critical: ‘Public forgetting provides a language and rationale for abdicating traditional modes of historical narrative and communal remembrance in order to expose the arbitrariness of the past as we presently conceive it, thereby illuminating unacknowledged ways it could assume a radically different character’ (p. 51). In my view, such an approach could prove valuable, not least because it would subvert a Whiggish reading of the past: one in which what was inevitably leads to what is. By strategically and publicly forgetting aspects of our collective past, we learn to become more self-conscious about and critical of our attempts at remembering.</p>
<p>Bradford Vivian manages to accomplish what scholars often dream of doing: he breaks new ground and makes a genuine conceptual advance. While a select few have made related arguments (perhaps the most notable ones are Andreas Huyssen with his little-known 2005 paper ‘Resistance to Memory: The Uses and Abuses of Public Forgetting’, and David Rieff’s 2011 essay ‘Against Remembrance’), Vivian’s book is the most incisive, far-reaching and elegant (and, at times, poetic) engagement with the issue of forgetting I am aware of.</p>
<p>‘Favorable instances of forgetting’, Vivian explains, ‘consist in public speech acts or symbolic gestures designed to interrupt customary patterns of communal memory, strategically amending or even redacting its contents in order to denaturalize the normative authority of burdensome, seemingly unalterable historical obligations’ (p. 50). But what exactly do such instances look like? Vivian’s book is divided into two parts: a longish essay (two chapters that constitute Part I, plus a 13-page conclusion) that argues for a revaluation of public forgetting, and four case studies (about the commemorative politics of 11 September 2001; about John Draper’s <italic>History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science</italic>; about ‘Gypsy’ practices of remembering and forgetting; and about Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Gettysburg Address and his second Inaugural, delivered in 1865).</p>
<p>While three of the case studies are excellent essays in their own right, only one of the four chapters of part II of Vivian’s <italic>Public Forgetting</italic>, namely the one about Lincoln, is convincing as an illustration of the argument he makes in part I. That may have something to do with the genealogy of the overall text and of Vivian’s ideas, because while the book was published in 2010, three of the case study chapters appeared much earlier as journal articles and as a book chapter: in 1999, 2004 and 2006, respectively. Part I and the Lincoln chapter thus appear to have been written as a supporting frame for three previously published pieces of writing.</p>
<p>The chapter in which Vivian contrasts ‘Western’ and ‘Gypsy’ (Roma) forms of remembering and forgetting, however, is also problematic as an essay in its own right. It appears to romanticize ‘communal’ notions of the past, which are ascribed to a timeless cultural tradition, rather than understood as the result of a particular historical and political context. Drawing on Isabel Fonseca’s 1995 bestseller <italic>Bury Me Standing</italic>, Vivian contrasts Jewish remembrance of the Holocaust with ‘Gypsy’ memories of the genocide suffered by Roma and Sinti at the same time: ‘unlike the epic relationship that Jewish Holocaust survivors have established with that past … little more than diaphanous recollections connect the Gypsies to the same harrowing events’ (p. 122). This analysis does not take into account the deliberate forgetting of those events in post-war Europe by non-Roma and non-Sinti, and the fact that the persecution of Roma and Sinti did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>In the context of Vivian’s book, however, the flaws of this particular chapter should matter little. The originality and persuasiveness of Part I of <italic>Public Forgetting</italic> more than make up for any shortfalls of Part II. The book deserves a wide readership and is hopefully going to inspire scholars to explore other cases that could test or illuminate his argument.</p>
