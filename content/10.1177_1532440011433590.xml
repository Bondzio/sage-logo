<abstract>
<p>This study creates and empirically tests an integrated model of trial court decision making to explore the hypothesis that jury verdicts reflect the social, political, and economic attributes of the community in which the court resides. In addition, the analyses examine the influence of attorneys, litigants, case facts, and judges on trial outcomes. Using an original data set comprising all reported civil trial verdicts decided in the state of Alabama from 2002 to 2008, we uncover strong evidence that community composition influences both the dispute resolution and resource allocation functions of trial courts. This research improves our knowledge of trial court decision making and contributes to our theoretical understanding of the effect of extralegal factors on the performance of political institutions.</p>

<p>During the ratification debates, the Federalists and Anti-Federalists contested the merits of the civil jury. The Anti-Federalists, preferring strong local government, argued that civil juries empowered communities to settle disputes themselves based on local standards.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Juries are constantly and frequently drawn from the body of the people, and freemen of the country; and by holding the jury’s right to return a general verdict in all cases sacred, we secure to the people at large, their rightful control in the judicial department. (Federal Farmer XV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532440011433590">Storing 1981</xref>, 320)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the Federalists maintained that civil juries were outmoded and produced inconsistent applications of the law from one jurisdiction to another, jeopardizing the rule of law. Hamilton argued that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the best judges of the matter [civil juries] will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial [civil juries] currently prevails. (Federalist 83, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440011433590">Goldman 2008</xref>, 416)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the Framers ultimately included the Seventh Amendment, guaranteeing the right to a jury trial in all disputes involving claims greater than $20, the disagreement between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists closely mirrors the current debate between advocates and opponents of tort reform. Those seeking to limit the discretion available to jurors argue that trial outcomes fail to achieve rational, consistent analyses of the conflicts at bar, and this variability negatively affects businesses and individuals involved in litigation. The president of the America Tort Reform Association (ATRA) asserts that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some astonishing decisions come out of the courts these days. Hundreds of millions in punitive damages piled on top of relatively minor actual damages. Meritless cases settled because defendants fear the outcome of an emotion-filled jury trial or a lawless court. That’s why the ATRA leads the fight for a better civil justice system—one that’s fair, efficient and predictable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532440011433590">Joyce 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, those who trust the constitutional mandate of trial by jury assert that jurors are capable of equitable resolutions. The American Association for Justice, a professional trial lawyers association, argues that “special interests like big tobacco, the insurance industry, HMOs, and drug companies have mounted multimillion dollar campaigns against the civil justice system and Constitutional right to trial by jury. As part of those campaigns, companies and corporate lobbyists hype bogus numbers and questionable studies, make exaggerated and untrue claims about so-called, frivolous lawsuits, and fall back on age-old stereotypes about trial lawyers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440011433590">American Association for Justice 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The persistent normative tensions regarding the role of civil juries in American society give rise to two empirical questions that this article seeks to explore. First, are there observable differences in the way that civil juries resolve disputes and allocate resources from one community to another? Second, if we observe variation across communities, what factors explain and predict those divergences? We hypothesize that the participants in the litigation process generally emerge from the local community and that the composition of the population directly affects trial court outcomes by shaping the participants’ evaluation of the conflict.</p>
<p>Civil trial courts rely on judges and juries to settle disputes and prescribe (typically) monetary retribution for injuries. In addition, civil litigation performs the important functions of resolving disputes, allocating resources, and modifying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532440011433590">Shapiro 1981</xref>). In civil cases, participants convert damages to dollars and require jurors to determine both the winner and the appropriate compensation. Although the vast majority of litigation occurs at the trial court level, the dispute resolution and resource allocation processes of trial courts remain underdeveloped theoretically, and previous research produced mixed findings.</p>
<p>Most studies of state trial court decision making rely on experimental designs to predict jury decisions. While experimental designs have improved our understanding of civil litigation, the use of experimental methods prevents the exploration of actual trials. Other studies use data collected by the Civil Trial Network that reports annual verdicts handed down by civil trial courts in the 45 most populous counties in the United States. However, the data only provide information on the verdict and the case type. The Jury Verdict Research project (1988–1997) provides additional information regarding the alleged injuries in each case but focuses exclusively on the largest awards and has not been updated. Available data sources prevent researchers from examining the effects of the specific claims, the attorneys, the judges, or litigant characteristics. In addition, examining the largest awards or verdicts from only the most populous counties obscures the major variation in outcomes and political and social features in suburban and rural areas that we seek to explore.</p>
<p>We estimate the courts’ dispute resolution and resource allocation functions by examining both a plaintiff’s likelihood of success and the amount awarded to successful plaintiffs. To test the hypothesis that civil trial outcomes vary across communities, we use an original data set comprising all reported jury verdicts decided in the Alabama Circuit Courts between 2002 and 2008. The data allow us to examine a greater number of issues and alleged injuries than previous studies and enable us to control for litigant, judge, and attorney characteristics. This research improves our knowledge of trial court decision making and contributes to our theoretical understanding of the effects of extralegal factors on the performance of judicial institutions. Furthermore, this study contributes much-needed information concerning the effects of the local context on public institutions.</p>

<title>An Integrated Model of Litigation Outcomes in Trial Courts</title>
<p>Brace and Hall’s early research sought to develop and test integrated models of state supreme court decision making. Brace and Hall build an integrated model based on four categories of variables, “justices’ personal preferences, case characteristics, institutional arrangements, and environmental characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440011433590">1993</xref>, 917). Brace and Hall go on to note that although not relevant for their study of death penalty appeals, litigant resources and litigant status might influence outcomes in other contexts. We adapt Brace and Hall’s conceptual framework to create an integrated model of decision making in civil trial courts. Theoretically, judicial ideology, institutional arrangements, environmental factors, litigant resources, and case facts should interact to shape litigation outcomes in trial courts. In particular, we argue that the composition of the local community influences the participants who populate the legal process.</p>
<p>Trials characteristically emerge from disputes that originate in the local community. Disputing litigants hire attorneys, usually from the immediate vicinity, to bring their disagreement before a jury also drawn from the area. Furthermore, the judge, elected from the district in Alabama, presides over the case. Although the judge, lawyers, disputants, and jurors possess a variety of goals in each individual case, all of the participants exist in the same local context. We hypothesize that local social, political, and economic conditions influence the participants’ evaluation of litigants’ claims and influence the monetary value the community deems fair compensation for an injury.</p>
<sec id="section2-1532440011433590">
<title>Local Context and Trial Court Outcomes: Social, Political, and Economic Influences</title>
<p>Jury trials require local citizens to settle disputes between litigants, directly involving members of the community in trial court decision making. Ideally, any study of jury verdicts would include demographic information for each juror; unfortunately, trial courts keep jurors’ identities confidential and do not record jurors’ background information, making such an analysis impossible. Previous research investigating the effect of individual juror traits has produced mixed results and considerable debate over the substantive influence of juror characteristics on jury decision making. Some find significant effects of race, gender, education, income, and attitudes on trial verdicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440011433590">Bornstein and Rajki 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532440011433590">Denove and Imwinkelreid 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532440011433590">Diamond, Saks, and Landsman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532440011433590">Hans 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532440011433590">Hastie, Schkade, and Payne 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532440011433590">Overland 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532440011433590">Vidmar and Rice 1993</xref>). Conversely, other scholars detect no or inconsistent effects for juror’s incomes, education, partisanship, race, poverty, and urbanization on judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532440011433590">Eisenberg and Wells 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532440011433590">Goodman, Loftus, and Greene 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532440011433590">Kassin and Wrightsman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532440011433590">Vidmar 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532440011433590">Visher 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Most examinations of juror demographics use mock jury scenarios to predict juror preferences. A second approach, the one adopted here, uses the demographic composition of the community surrounding the court to predict jury verdicts. We acknowledge that circuit demographics might not adequately represent the jury pool because not all demographic groups receive equal representation on juries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532440011433590">Saks 2002</xref>). In addition, attorneys might attempt to prevent minorities from serving on juries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440011433590">Benokraitis and Griffin-Keene 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532440011433590">Ramirez 1993</xref>). Although circuit-level demographics admittedly provide a weak test of the hypothesis that individual juror traits affect trial outcomes, circuit composition allows us to test our hypothesis that jury verdicts reflect the larger social, political, and economic conditions in the community, regardless of the composition of any particular jury.</p>
<p>Previous research provides evidence that county-level demographics predict liberal/conservative voting patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440011433590">Ardoin and Garand 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532440011433590">Koetzle 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532440011433590">Levendusky, Pope, and Jackman 2008</xref>), suggesting that the demographic makeup of a community might also influence other decision-making patterns. In addition, a wealth of literature demonstrates that economic downturns affect election outcomes; the public blames the incumbent party for poor economic performance and punishes incumbents electorally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532440011433590">Abramowitz, Lanoue, and Ramesh 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532440011433590">Feldman 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532440011433590">Key 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532440011433590">Kramer 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532440011433590">Lau and Sears 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532440011433590">Nadeau and Lewis-Beck 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532440011433590">Rudolph 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1532440011433590">Rudolph and Grant 2002</xref>). Prior studies supply preliminary evidence that economic conditions affect court outcomes. In his analysis of federal district courts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532440011433590">Heydebrand (1976)</xref> concludes that federal government economic activity stimulates litigation and influences how judges decide cases. Other research finds that jury awards in tort cases appear to increase as county poverty rates increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532440011433590">Helland and Tabarrock 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532440011433590">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532440011433590">Tabarrock and Helland 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532440011433590">Koetzle (1998)</xref>, communities characterized by larger minority populations, lower incomes, lower education levels, and greater percentages of urban dwellers tend to vote more liberally. Like Koetzle, we hypothesize that certain demographic combinations within a circuit should produce solidly liberal communities, which in turn should generate stronger support for plaintiffs.</p>

<title>Resources and Litigant Status</title>
<p>Since Galanter’s seminal theory predicting the success of wealthy, repeat players in trial courts, scholars have dedicated considerable attention to the influence of litigant resources on court decisions. In the United States, parties with greater resources appear to incur considerable advantages when pursuing litigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532440011433590">Farole 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532440011433590">Songer and Sheehan 1992</xref>; Songer, Sheehan, Haire 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532440011433590">Wheeler, Cartwright, Kagan, and Friedman 1987</xref>). Furthermore, possessing an advantaged status also seems to improve a litigant’s chances of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532440011433590">Kinsey and Stalans 1999</xref>). The government, in particular, achieves success rates in the courts above that of any other litigant class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532440011433590">Farole 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532440011433590">Kritzer and Silbey 2003</xref>). Extant scholarly research also maintains that legal representation shapes litigation outcomes. Litigants represented by more experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532440011433590">Haire, Lindquist, and Hartley 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532440011433590">McGuire 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532440011433590">1998</xref>) and more capable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532440011433590">Haynie and Sill 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532440011433590">Johnson, Wahlbeck, and Spriggs 2006</xref>) attorneys achieve higher success rates.</p>
<p>Trial court studies also provide insight into the effects of individual litigant characteristics on outcomes. Most of the trial court research examining the effect of litigant status explores the “deep pockets” effect—the idea that civil juries hold wealthy defendants liable more often and assess larger damage awards against the wealthy when compared with other types of litigants. Yet, explorations of the deep pockets hypothesis produce mixed results. Some scholars maintain that civil juries judge corporate defendants more harshly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532440011433590">Hans and Ermann 1989</xref>) and assess large damage awards against corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440011433590">Chin and Peterson 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532440011433590">Hans and Ermann 1989</xref>). Using an experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440011433590">Bornstein and Rajki (1994)</xref> observe that mock jurors judged a chemical company more harshly than a pharmaceutical company or a manufacturer for the same alleged injury. In another experiment varying defendant characteristics and wealth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440011433590">MacCoun (1996)</xref> discovers that jurors treat corporations differently than other types of defendants, but the difference is not attributable to wealth because individuals with identical resources received less severe treatment. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532440011433590">Vidmar (1995)</xref> detects no evidence that medical malpractice awards increase with perceived ability to pay. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440011433590">Eisenberg et al. (1997)</xref> caution that if award amounts serve to correct behavior, then the assessment of large awards against wealthy defendants does not necessarily indicate bias because differential amounts produce varying degrees of punishment or deterrence based on defendants’ wealth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532440011433590">
<title>Judicial Ideology</title>
<p>Research conducted at the appellate court level strongly supports the theory that judicial ideology influences judges’ decision making. Scholars of the U.S. Supreme Court maintain that judges seek to create policy that mirrors their own preferences as closely as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532440011433590">Schubert 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532440011433590">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532440011433590">Rohde and Spaeth 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532440011433590">Segal et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532440011433590">Segal and Spaeth 2002</xref>). At the state supreme court level, research demonstrates that judges’ preferences reflect their partisan affiliations and the ideology of their states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440011433590">Brace and Hall 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532440011433590">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532440011433590">Brace, Langer, and Hall 2000</xref>). The overwhelming impact of judicial ideology on appellate court judges’ behavior suggests that a relationship might exist between judicial ideology and trial court outcomes. Trial judges directly rule on numbers of pretrial motions, suggesting considerable room for trial judges to express their ideological preferences during the pretrial phase of the litigation and settlement process. Unfortunately, we cannot assess judges’ pretrial influence using posttrial data. Furthermore, whereas appellate court judges directly render decisions, trial judges only deliver verdicts in bench trials. Our data include only jury verdicts that rely on juries to deliver the final verdict. Jurors’ preferences might influence jury trial outcomes to a greater degree than judges’ dispositions, perhaps limiting judges’ influence.</p>
<p>Yet, trial judges’ ideological dispositions might shape civil trial outcomes. In addition to articulating the final juror instructions, trial judges make numerous rulings about procedure, evidence, and testimony during the trial, all of which affect juries’ decision parameters. In addition, judges presumably serve as important authority figures and information filters during the trial process, potentially allowing trial judges to transmit their preferences to jurors. Unfortunately, scholars have devoted little attention to the relationship between judicial ideology and outcomes in civil trial courts and provide little guidance. Admittedly, only an indirect relationship between judicial ideology and jury verdicts exists, if at all. However, given the exploratory nature of this research, we investigate the hypothesis that a relationship between judicial ideology and litigation outcomes exists at the trial court level. If trial court judges transmit their ideological perspectives to jurors through their rulings and courtroom demeanor, we anticipate that plaintiffs should win more often and receive larger awards in courts presided over by Democratic judges who presumably possess more pro-underdog policy preferences like their liberal counterparts on appellate courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440011433590">Brace and Hall 2001</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532440011433590">Saks (2002)</xref> argues that the mix of cases coming before a court plays a critical role in determining the initial likelihood that the plaintiff wins because the mix of cases varies substantially from one jurisdiction to the next.

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>We seek to investigate whether jury verdicts vary considerably from one trial locale to another. Are jury verdicts as inconsistent as Federalists and proponents of tort reform suggest? Furthermore, if communities differ in their evaluation of litigants’ claims, does the composition of the community predict differences in winners and losers and awards? The principal data source for this project is the <italic>Alabama Jury Verdict Reporter</italic> (AJVR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532440011433590">Miller 2002–2008</xref>), an independent publication primarily used by attorneys in Alabama that provides a summary of each civil case tried in Alabama in a given year. The AJVR is the most systematic, comprehensive reporter of trial verdicts available and includes all cases for which a jury verdict is reported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532440011433590">1</xref></sup> The Alabama Circuit Courts encompass 41 circuits and decide an average of 284 civil cases a year with jurisdiction over cases involving damage claims of $3,000 or more. We examine both civil trial courts’ dispute resolution and resource allocation processes through the use of two dependent variables to model the likelihood of plaintiffs’ success and the amount of the award on success.</p>
<p>Among our key independent variables is a measure of community composition. We maintain that the demographic composition of a circuit reflects the social, political, and economic conditions of the community in which a court resides and predicts communities’ preferences regarding civil litigation. Admittedly, circuit-level demographics cannot adequately predict the composition of any particular jury. However, if jury verdicts reflect community preferences, the socioeconomic and political composition of a circuit should influence communities’ preferences regardless of the composition of any particular jury. We collected data for a number of social, political, and economic indicators for the circuit. In Alabama, most circuits encompass one county, although rural circuits often include multiple counties. For circuits including multiple counties, we generate average scores for each indicator.</p>
<p>To capture community composition, we adapt a measure of congressional district diversity used by Koetzle to predict district partisanship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532440011433590">Koetzle 1998</xref>). Koetzle’s original measure sums the percentage point deviations of a district’s population from the national median on five variables (the percentage white, black, household income above $50,000, college educated, and farmers). The final index is then scaled so that higher values represent more Democratic constituencies.</p>
<p>We replicate Koetzle’s index using the percentage of the population that is black, white, and college educated obtained using the 2005 U.S. Census.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532440011433590">2</xref></sup> The percentage farming employed in each circuit captures the rural/urban character of the circuit. To capture the effects of economic change, we collect the annual unemployment rate in each circuit instead of household income. We obtain data for the percentage of the population employed in agriculture and for unemployment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The community composition index is scaled so that higher values should indicate more pro-plaintiff jurisdictions. Thus, we expect circuits with larger minority populations, greater unemployment, lower levels of education, and fewer farmers and college graduates to vote in favor of plaintiffs more often and give more generous awards when they do. At the middle ranges of Koetzle’s index, where the demographic mix favors neither party, Koetzle predicts high partisan competition and variability in election outcomes. Paralleling Koetzle, we predict that middle ranges on the index should produce high variability in trial outcomes.</p>
<p>Although Koetzle and subsequent scholars use the original measure to predict district partisanship, we maintain that a number of parallels exist between a community’s partisan leanings and a community’s preferences for the dispute resolution and resource allocation processes that occur in courts. First, strong partisan preferences likely shape the public’s perceptions of litigation in a given community. Of the 1,983 trials in Alabama, individuals participated as plaintiffs in 88%, demonstrating that individuals overwhelmingly initiate litigation, while business and government typically fill defendant roles. Accordingly, conservative and business groups, like the ATRA, often hold negative views of the civil litigation process and support tort reform initiatives. Conversely, liberal organizations and trial lawyers’ associations tend to view civil litigation more positively. Arguably, conservative communities should hold more negative views of civil trials than their liberal counterparts. In addition, liberal and conservative ideological dispositions typically reflect preferences toward resource distribution that presumably shape the awards juries deliver.</p>
<p>While the index cannot account for the specific background of any particular juror, if community composition affects trial outcomes, the measure should predict patterns of decision making across circuits. Furthermore, this measure should help explicate some of the mixed findings of previous studies because it provides a community-level measure and permits us to examine the combination of demographic variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532440011433590">Table 1</xref> provides the state median values on each composite variable in the community composition index as well as circuit minimum and maximum values. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532440011433590">Table 1</xref> shows considerable variation across circuits for each of the variables in the index.</p>

<p>Galanter’s influential article on the advantages enjoyed by the “haves” in litigation suggests that the ability to hire superior legal counsel is a considerable benefit possessed by better-resourced parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532440011433590">Galanter 1974</xref>). Theoretically, the number of attorneys representing each side could provide at least two measures of resources. First, the mere listing of additional counsel indicates that the attorney arguing the case belongs to a larger firm with multiple attorneys or has engaged other lawyers or firms for assistance. Second, the number of attorneys working on a case represents a measure of the resources the firm invests in the case, especially for cases taken on a contingency fee basis. Thus, the number of attorneys representing each side provides information regarding the size of the firm the attorney belongs to and approximates the human capital the firm invests in each claim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532440011433590">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the number of attorneys cannot explicitly measure the quality of counsel, we argue that the party listing more attorneys possesses a resource advantage over a party with fewer attorneys as legal counsel. To measure representational advantages, we code the number of attorneys representing the plaintiff and the number of attorneys representing the defendant in each case as listed in the reporter. Plaintiffs and defendants who represent themselves, <italic>pro se</italic>, receive a score of 0 for the number of attorneys. To capture the <italic>relative</italic> resource advantage of the plaintiff versus the defendant, we subtract the number of defense attorneys from the number of plaintiff attorneys. Higher values on the attorney advantage variable should indicate greater resources for the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s advocacy advantage variable currently ranges from −4 to 3. A score of 0 indicates equally matched parties.</p>
<p>In addition, we seek to capture the influence of litigant status. Consistent with prior studies, we code each plaintiff and defendant as an individual, business, or government to capture the relative resources of each party. Remaining classes of litigants are coded as “other.” We recognize that such coding provides only an indirect measure of the plaintiff and the defendant’s resources. Yet, previous research has consistently applied such a coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532440011433590">Haynie 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532440011433590">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532440011433590">Songer and Sheehan 1992</xref>; Songer, Sheehan and Haire 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532440011433590">Songer, Kuersten, and Kaheny 2000</xref>), and in general, individuals possess fewer resources than do either businesses or the government.</p>
<p>If jury verdicts are influenced by judges’ ideological dispositions, we expect to observe the relationship most apparently on elected benches. We obtained the partisan identification for each judge from state election returns available through the Alabama Secretary of State. Like other areas of trial court research, the effect of judicial ideology on outcomes in civil litigation has received little attention, but if judges are able to filter information or otherwise affect the decision parameters of trial courts, plaintiffs should win more often in courts presided over by Democratic judges who typically possess more liberal policy preferences.</p>
<p>In addition, we code each case for case type and the alleged injury. Case types are aggregated into eight issue areas, including medical negligence, general negligence, premises liability, uninsured or underinsured motorist, breach of contract, fraud, premises liability, product liability, and other issues (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1532440011433590">appendix</xref>). Automobile negligence cases account for 45% of the trials adjudicated in Alabama during the seven-year time period, suggesting that auto negligence cases are a routine occurrence in Alabama circuits. The models compare all less-frequent case types with the base category of auto negligence claim; thus, automobile negligence serves as the excluded category. Our analysis incorporates a larger number of issues than previous studies, allowing us to examine plaintiff success rates and awards across a variety of case types. We also code for eight injury categories (soft tissue, property loss or damage, monetary loss, broken bones, slip and fall, emotional injuries, injuries resulting in surgery, and injuries resulting in death—see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1532440011433590">appendix</xref>). Previous research maintains that plaintiffs alleging soft tissue injuries (scratches, bruises, whiplash injuries, etc.) face significant difficulties at trial due to the ambiguous nature of the injury, jurors’ lack of familiarity with the term, and jurors’ perceptions of soft tissue injuries as bogus claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532440011433590">Hans 2008</xref>). We hypothesize that the more serious and demonstrable the injury, the more likely the plaintiff is to win and to receive a larger award (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440011433590">Bornstein 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440011433590">Bovbjerg et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440011433590">Chin and Peterson 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532440011433590">Greene and Bornstein 2003</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we compare all injury categories to soft tissue injuries. The models also include a variable that measures the number of decisions in each circuit each year. The number of decision variables serves as a control for the workload of the circuit.</p>
<p>The dependent variable in the plaintiff success model is whether or not the jury found in favor of the plaintiff, coded 1 if the plaintiff wins and 0 otherwise. Due to the categorical nature of the dependent variable, we use logistic regression. If the plaintiff wins in the first model, we then examine the variables associated with the size of the award. The dependent variable in the award model is the logged dollar amount of the award on success. We log the dependent variable in the award model due to the highly skewed nature of awards (awards range from $0 to $180,000,000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532440011433590">4</xref></sup> We use a linear regression model to explore jury awards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532440011433590">5</xref></sup> To capture any remaining differences between the circuits, the models include dichotomous variables for each of the circuits, minus one excluded circuit to control for fixed effects. In models using cross-sectional data, fixed effects correct for potentially omitted variables by holding constant the average effect of each circuit.</p>

<title>Empirical Results</title>
<p>The analysis includes 1,983 civil cases decided in the state of Alabama between 2002 and 2008. Of the 1,983 cases, plaintiffs won 1,031 or 52%. Although the data contain minimum awards of only a dollar or less and large awards of multiple millions, the median award is $30,000. During the seven-year period, Alabama juries awarded $1,617,185,387 in total awards. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532440011433590">Figure 1</xref> graphically portrays the percentage of pro-plaintiff verdicts in each of Alabama’s circuits. Although we must note that some circuits hear considerably more cases than others, the wide disparities in plaintiff success rates across circuits provides descriptive support that substantial differences exist across communities.</p>

<p>Both the plaintiff success and the award models provide compelling support for the hypothesis that community composition influences litigation outcomes in terms of winners and losers as well as awards. We hypothesized that the social, political, and economic context of a community influences the decision making of juries drawn from that community. Specifically, we created an index that should predict demographic features that favor plaintiffs and produce larger awards in each circuit. The model predicts that higher values on the community composition index significantly increase the likelihood that plaintiffs win and predicts larger awards on success. The results provide strong confirmation that, similar to electoral outcomes, community composition considerably shapes the disposition of civil cases.</p>
<p>The attorney advantage variable is positive and highly significant in the plaintiff success model but insignificant in the award model, indicating that an attorney advantage helps plaintiffs win cases but produces little affect on the amount of the award. We also find that litigant status influences winners and losers and awards. When compared with challenging a business defendant, the excluded category, individual plaintiffs appear less likely to prevail than when challenging the government. This result supports previous studies indicating that the government is in fact the “gorilla” in the courtroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532440011433590">Kritzer and Silbey 2003</xref>). No other combination of litigants achieves statistical significance in the plaintiff success model. However, juries deliver significantly lower awards when individuals challenge other individuals, the government, and all other classes of defendants than when individuals challenge businesses. This finding reinforces extant literature demonstrating that juries deliver larger damage awards against business defendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440011433590">Chin and Peterson 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532440011433590">Hans and Ermann 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440011433590">MacCoun 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>However, we detect no evidence that judges’ partisan identifications affect jury verdicts. This result could imply that juries are truly the decision makers in trial courts or that judges influence the settlement processes more than the actual trial outcome. The variable denoting the number of decisions per year in each circuit also fails to achieve statistical significance in either model.</p>
<p>Turning to case issues, plaintiffs are more likely to win uninsured or underinsured motorist cases and less likely to win medical malpractice cases than cases involving automobile accidents. The model implies that plaintiffs may achieve greater success in fraud and breach of contract cases. The results demonstrate that plaintiffs face special difficulties winning medical malpractice cases; however, the award model shows that when plaintiffs win medical malpractice cases, they receive substantially larger awards. The model also predicts that despite the fact that plaintiffs making product liability claims appear no more or less likely to win than those involved in automobile claims, juries give successful plaintiffs greater compensation. Finally, the premises liability variable hints that juries give significantly lower awards in that issue area, although the variable is only significant at the .10 level. Overall, both models confirm results from previous studies that the type of case before the court predicts the likelihood of plaintiff success and the amount of the award on success.</p>
<p>Next, the model compares alleged injuries with the excluded category of soft tissue injuries (scratches, bruises, whiplash injuries, etc). The results show that the alleged injury in a case also influences the plaintiff’s likelihood of success and the amount of compensation the jury gives. However, the impact of the alleged injury appears to produce differential effects on the liability decision and the award. When compared with soft tissue injuries, plaintiffs appear more likely to prevail in cases in which the alleged injury involves a property loss and less likely to win when seeking compensation for a slip and fall or death. On the other hand, plaintiffs asserting more severe physical injuries, broken bones, death, and injuries requiring surgical correction, receive greater compensation when they win. Successful plaintiffs alleging a slip and fall or monetary loss also appear to receive larger awards.</p>
<p>To help substantively interpret the results, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532440011433590">Table 3</xref> provides predicted probabilities of plaintiff success and predicted logged awards, holding all other values in the models constant at the means. At the minimum, community composition index score plaintiffs win about 43.2% of the time. At the maximum index value, circuits with pro-plaintiff demographic compositions demonstrate high predicted plaintiff success rates. The model predicts that plaintiffs win 66.3% of the time, an increase in plaintiff success of 23.1%. At the average index, the predicted plaintiff success rate is near 50% at 53%. Although plaintiffs appear to have a slight advantage at the average index, success rates at the mean index, as predicted, demonstrate the greatest variability. For the plaintiff’s attorney advantage, we find that moving from the most advantaged plaintiff (plaintiff advantage of 3 and a predicted success rate of 67.2%) to the least advantaged (plaintiff advantage of −4 and a predicted success rate of 33.5%) produces the largest substantive impact on plaintiff success rates (an increase in predicted success of 33.7%). When both parties are equally matched, plaintiffs win about 47% of the time, suggesting that when similarly represented, plaintiffs suffer a slight disadvantage. Finally, compared with challenging a business, individuals win against the government about 40% of the time.</p>

<p>Although we cannot directly interpret logged awards as dollars, the predicted log awards reflect variables’ substantive influence on the size of awards. Logged awards range from 0 to 20.51 with an average award of 10.99. The predicted awards show that case issues and injuries produce the largest relative influence on award amounts. Successful plaintiffs receive the largest awards in cases involving a death, followed by medical malpractice claims. Issues and injuries appear to have the strongest effect on awards, and moving from the minimum to the maximum index does increase the predicted award. The model also suggests that individuals receive smaller awards when challenging the government and other defendants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although scholars of voting behavior have long acknowledged that the demographic composition of a district predicts citizens’ partisan preferences, few studies have explored the relationship between community composition and the courts. Through the use of a new measure of community composition, we show that circuits with demographic compositions likely to favor plaintiffs demonstrate consistent pro-plaintiff verdicts and distribute larger awards. The findings demonstrate that jury verdicts reflect community preferences, indicating that, like other political institutions, civil trial courts respond to social, political, and economic conditions. Furthermore, while previous research debates the influence of individual juror traits on trial outcomes, our results reveal that jury verdicts reflect the broader socioeconomic conditions in a community, regardless of the composition of any particular jury. This research provides empirical support and a theoretical framework for studying trial courts as political institutions that operate both within legal and extralegal constraints.</p>
<p>Although we feel confident in drawing the conclusion that the local community influences trial courts’ dispute resolution and resource allocation processes, we must acknowledge some limitations. First, although the data provide significant variation at the substate level, this is a single-state study, and we do not claim that Alabama is necessarily representative of the other 49 states. Future research can further adapt this theory to other social, political, and economic contexts to ensure that our results are generalizable. Second, we would ideally model the demographic composition of each jury; unfortunately, trial courts keep jurors’ identities confidential and do not record jurors’ demographic statistics, making such an analysis impossible. However, if community composition exerts an influence on litigation outcomes, patterns of jury behavior should and do emerge across circuits, regardless of the composition of any particular jury. In addition, Alabama civil procedure allows plaintiffs to file cases in either the circuit in which the alleged incident occurred or the circuit in which the plaintiff resides when the two locales differ. In that instance, procedural rules allow plaintiffs to choose between two venues, permitting plaintiffs to select the more favorable circuit. Although Alabama civil procedure largely limits “forum shopping,” plaintiffs possess a slight advantage in limited circumstances. Although restricted, plaintiffs occasionally posses an upper hand in selecting trial venues, which could possibly result in a slight overestimation of the pro-plaintiff tendencies in the circuits. Furthermore, previous studies maintain that, because attorneys strategically determine which cases to settle prior to trial, the cases that reach trial tend to be those with the least predictable outcomes or the most at stake for the parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532440011433590">Priest and Klein 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532440011433590">Waldfogel 1995</xref>). Due to attorney strategy, trial courts adjudicate only the most contentious and unpredictable cases. Unfortunately, we are unable to compare settled cases with cases concluding in trial with these data, and we acknowledge that community composition might affect litigation differently at the pretrial stage. Despite these limitations, this study provides considerable insight regarding the factors that influence outcomes in civil litigation.</p>
<p>We also create a new measure of litigant resources by measuring the plaintiff’s relative advantage in legal representation. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532440011433590">Galanter’s (1974)</xref> original thesis predicted that better-resourced parties would prevail more often in trial courts, few scholars have examined the role of such advantages at the trial court level. This analysis provides considerable support for Galanter’s theory; parties with a resource advantage, in terms of representation, win more often. Conversely, the model indicates that a representational advantage produces no effect on awards, implying that a resource advantage helps plaintiffs win cases, while other factors more strongly predict compensation. In addition, the number of attorneys participating in a case may also serve as a proxy for case salience. Attorneys likely devote greater time and resources to cases involving more serious injuries with greater potential for larger awards. However, the results show that juries assess larger damage awards against business defendants than any other class of defendant, implying that while those with greater resources may win more often, wealthier defendants pay more when they lose.</p>
<p>Conversely, our results indicate that judges’ partisan identifications produce no significant influence on jury verdicts. Although previous research provides little guidance for interpreting these results, the findings imply that trial judges possess little influence on juries’ verdicts. If judges shape the pretrial and settlement process more than the trial, we might uncover a relationship between judicial ideology and litigation outcomes by examining judges’ rulings on pretrial motions. However, the results might also signify that measures originally intended to capture appellate judges’ ideological preferences, such as partisanship, are not sufficiently robust to capture trial judges’ ideological leanings. On the other hand, the state supreme court literature maintains that judges’ preferences reflect the constituents they represent, suggesting that juries and judges in the same community might approach civil litigation with similar perspectives.</p>
<p>We also uncover interesting relationships between case facts and outcomes and awards that confirm previous research. Through the use of jury simulations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532440011433590">Hans (2008)</xref> observes that the term “soft tissue injury” is often ambiguous to jurors, and jurors perceive whiplash and other soft tissue injuries as quintessentially phony claims. Like Hans and other researchers, we observe that when compared with soft tissue injuries, plaintiffs alleging more severe and concrete injuries receive greater compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440011433590">Bornstein 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440011433590">Bovbjerg et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440011433590">Chin and Peterson 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532440011433590">Greene and Bornstein 2003</xref>). In addition, while plaintiffs appear especially unsuccessful in garnering jury support in medical malpractice cases, once plaintiffs cross the liability threshold, juries hand down considerably larger awards.</p>
<p>Our results contribute to our theoretical understanding of trial court outcomes and also provide insight into the ongoing tort reform debate. As tort reformers suggest, the results show that business defendants suffer a disadvantage in certain contexts; however, other contexts strongly favor defendants. Yet, the models demonstrate that better-resourced parties, such as businesses, achieve higher success rates. On the other hand, even after controlling for case facts, Alabama juries assess larger damage awards against business defendants than other litigant classes. The findings also validate Anti-Federalists’ assertions that resolutions rendered by civil juries reflect attributes of the local community. In addition, our analyses confirm Federalists’ apprehensions that civil juries’ decisions can lead to variability in outcomes across trial venues. Whether one is comforted by the results or frustrated by them, depends, as it did with the Framers, on one’s perspective on the foundations that underpin the rule of law.</p>

<p>Attorneys at large firms may list multiple participants in a case when only one or two lawyers actually perform the bulk of the work. Yet, an attorney belonging to a large firm with multiple attorneys or working in accordance with another lawyer or lawyers arguably possess greater resources than any individual attorney working alone. In addition, the measure provides greater information concerning litigants’ resources than simply relying on the litigant status, thereby providing a better measure of litigant resources and improving our understanding of the role resource advantages play in litigation outcomes.</p>

<p>A zero-dollar award occurs when the plaintiff wins but is not awarded damages. The data set records the jury’s initial award in each case. Although jury awards are often reduced posttrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532440011433590">Greene and Bornstein 2003</xref>), we do not adjust awards for posttrial amendments. We seek to capture the effect of community differences on jury decision making, so we choose to focus on the jury’s award.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that juries only award damages to successful plaintiffs, making awards a selected sample. Although selection models attempt to test and correct for potential selection bias in selected samples, selection models require that the selection model (winners and losers) differ on at least one key independent variable from the outcome model (awards). We lack a strong theoretical justification to guide which variables affect plaintiff success and not awards; therefore, we cannot correctly specify a selection model. We model both stages separately to obtain the best estimates because misspecified selection models can produce more biased results than Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440011433590">Cameron and Trivedi 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532440011433590">Green 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532440011433590">Melenberg and Soest 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532440011433590">Nawata 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532440011433590">Nawata and Nagase 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532440011433590">Puhani 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532440011433590">Winship and Mare 1992</xref>). However, we have modeled both stages using a Heckman Sample Selection Model and awards using a Tobit model with similar results.</p>
