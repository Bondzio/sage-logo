<abstract>
<p>The study aims to present framework and technology solutions for collaborative product innovation based on the status review. Companies are facing challenges including increasing product complexity, shorter product lifecycle, higher cost of research and development, and so on. To deal with these challenges, firms adopted practice of innovation network to co-innovate with suppliers, customers, and other external partners. However, in the past, segmental researches were mainly focused at the strategy level rather than at the project level, which provides specific guidance for product innovation. Thus, in this work, the authors propose a framework of collaborative product innovation network at the project level based on the review of innovation network. Technology solutions for collaborative product innovation network (modular product innovation network development and ontology-based knowledge integration) have also been proposed. Finally, an application in electric water heater development is also given to demonstrate the implementation and potentials of the framework.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Companies today are facing great challenges more than ever in the radical-changing environment. These challenges include the increasing complexity of products, shorter product lifecycle, higher cost of research and development (R&amp;D), rapid changing market, geographically dispersed innovation teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X12468457">Dutra et al., 2010</xref>), and so on. In order to manipulate those challenges and increase innovation capacity, some firms have built innovation networks (INs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063293X12468457">Pyka and Küppers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063293X12468457">Valk et al., 2011</xref>) to co-innovate with suppliers, customers, and other potential partners. It has been widely acknowledged that the opportunity of involving external innovation sources (e.g. suppliers and customers) in the new product development (NPD) process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12468457">Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12468457">Ghazawneh, 2011</xref>). Integration of proper participants in NPD furthers the generation of really innovative conceptual designs, products, and services by incorporating specific knowledge and/or experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12468457">Kain et al., 2009</xref>). The INs can accelerate knowledge sharing, reduce the time and cost for getting information, and leading to final success of innovation.</p>
<p>Although research under the headline of INs covers a larger area and more domains, there are few studies on how to reduce the complexity of INs under collaborative innovation environment. Besides, the current researches are mainly focused at the firm strategy level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063293X12468457">Platonov and Bergman, 2011</xref>) rather than at the NPD project level providing specific guidance on implementation of the IN. Furthermore, how to facilitate innovation knowledge reuse and integration among the network members are still major problems to be solved. In order to solve those problems existing in the research of IN, in this work, the authors review the research progress of IN, and propose a framework of collaborative product IN (CPIN) at NPD project level based on the modularization technology and ontology technology. It is expected that this work will probably present both theoretical and practical implications for collaborative product innovation in network context.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows: a recent state of the art review for INs is depicted in the “Status review” section; in the “A framework for CPIN” section, a framework of CPIN is proposed followed by technology solutions in the “Technology solutions for CPIN” section; a case of electric water heater is provided to demonstrate the implementation and potentials of the framework in the “Case study” section; and finally, conclusions and future research directions are made in the “Conclusion and suggestions” section.</p>

<title>Status review</title>
<p>Product IN refers to the mechanism and process of integrating resources and knowledge distributed among a network of partnering firms to achieve product innovation, and it is a logical result of the increasing complexity, shorter product lifecycle, higher cost of R&amp;D, and rapid changing market of innovative products. Knowledge and resources across organizational boundaries are increasingly necessary for the success of the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X12468457">Chen and Lin, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X12468457">Mowery and Rosenberg (1998)</xref> also argue that it is increasingly common for product innovation to be a cross-organizational phenomenon. The product innovation study suggests that the integration of marketing, R&amp;D, engineering, and manufacturing functions is critical for new product performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X12468457">Clark and Fujimoto, 1991</xref>).The product IN introduces new challenges in manufacturing including communication, the sharing of knowledge, competencies and risks, collaboration, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063293X12468457">Zaletelj et al., 2008</xref>). Although managing product IN is far more complex than managing product innovation within a company, most of the past researches are still silent on the management of product IN. There are also few studies focusing on the specific collaborative level of IN. How to implement this potential strategy at a NPD project level is still not solved.</p>
<p>The most common product INs are networks with suppliers and customers. Companies can significantly benefit with supplier involvement in innovation and the innovation performance could be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12468457">Dyer and Singh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12468457">Hagedoorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X12468457">Lindquist et al., 2008</xref>). Besides supplier, customer as an important innovation source has been widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X12468457">Bonner and Walker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063293X12468457">Von Hippel, 1986</xref>). Such vertical collaborative innovation (with suppliers and customers) allows company to obtain much knowledge about new technologies, markets, and process improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063293X12468457">Whitley, 2002</xref>), and has a more significant impact on both product and process innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12468457">Miotti and Sachwald, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12468457">Liker et al. (1999)</xref> propose that listening to customers and suppliers at early stages of product development could deliver innovative results more quickly. Although many researches have proved the benefits of product INs with suppliers and customers, they do not focus much on the innovation task partitioning, the basic of co-innovation. Furthermore, specific technology solutions for product knowledge sharing and reuse among the INs are often ignored due to intangibility of the innovative knowledge. Product innovation in nature is a knowledge-intensive activity, but effective knowledge integration methods for the IN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063293X12468457">Lin and Chen, 2006</xref>) are found to be lacking. Co-innovation with external partners may lead to leakage of innovation knowhow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12468457">Enkel et al., 2005</xref>), which is not solved in the past researches. More importantly, the past researches provide few solutions on manipulating the complexity of the product IN.</p>
<p>Besides the common INs with supplier and customer, networks with innovation intermediaries (innovation brokers) and the public are booming collaborative innovation forms. Innovation intermediaries always play as knowledge brokers between a pool of specialized experts and innovating firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X12468457">Diener and Piller, 2009</xref>). They do not just play a linking role, but provide solutions such as new ideas and knowledge to their clients. Members of the public are also important external collaborative innovation partners. Collaboration with the public is called using the “Wisdom of Crowds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063293X12468457">Surowiecki, 2004</xref>). Introducing crowd intelligence in product innovation process could help to stimulate the generation of new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12468457">Berthon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063293X12468457">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). However, this kind of IN needs strong information communication technology (ICT)-supported tools to involve the public in the innovation process. Furthermore, selecting the proper co-innovator and managing the public in the innovation process are not easy.</p>
<p>In summary, the current researches of IN mainly focus on the interfirm strategy level and explore its potential benefits. However, there are few studies on how to implement this potential strategy in specific product innovation projects. Considering the complex and knowledge-intensive nature of the co-innovation activities, this work tries to explore the product IN from the perspective of knowledge. Moreover, the work not only provides a framework of interfirm collaborative innovation but also provides specific technology solutions for knowledge sharing, reuse, and integration among the INs that are often ignored in the current and past IN researches.</p>

<sec id="section3-1063293X12468457">
<title>A framework for CPIN</title>
<p>In order to help to better understand the product IN with engineering application perspective and to lay a sound basis for the future development of innovation network, in this section, we develop a systematic framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12468457">Figure 1</xref>) called CPIN. This proposed IN framework takes into account both the internal innovation actors and external innovation partners (e.g. customers and suppliers) in an open environment. The CPIN mainly includes four aspects: product innovation task partition, product innovation knowledge mapping, matching of innovation knowledge and innovation actors, and integration of product innovation knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section4-1063293X12468457">
<title>Main components of the proposed framework</title>
<p>The first part is partitioning the collaborative innovation task in the light of the product innovation objective, such as product architecture, function, attribute, parameter, and so on. Each innovation task may consist of several different subtasks. The innovation firm could adopt modularization technology that we would explain in the next section to complete the task partition. In general, the objective of task decomposition is to make the complex collaborative innovation simplified and transparent. The decomposition granularity should not be too small, because it will cause knowledge crossing or overlapping between subtasks, which hinders the efficiency of product innovation.</p>
<p>The second part is mapping the product innovation task with knowledge. Different knowledge in various innovation stages is needed to complete each innovation task and subtask. For example, in the design stage, innovation knowledge including design standard, design experience, customer requirement, and the past design failure are all necessary to the final success of product innovation. In fact, the product innovation knowledge has a wide variety of sources. Some are from the customers and suppliers, whereas others may be from the internal firm’s domain principles, design experience, product specifications, and so on. Furthermore, the innovation knowledge is complex due to the links and overlapping between them. Thus, it is necessary to map the product innovation task with the right knowledge at the right time.</p>
<p>The third part matches innovation knowledge and innovation actors. The innovation actors are the core of product innovation. They consist of internal innovation actors and external partners. The internal product innovation source mainly includes employee and functions with different knowledge and skills, such as marketing, product design, manufacturing, service, and so on. The external innovation partners consist of the company’s customers, suppliers, innovation brokers, and the public. Both internal and external innovation actors are not only knowledge providers, but also the knowledge users and innovators. Some of them grasp much tacit knowledge that is important to the product innovation. Therefore, the innovation actor is an important element in the CPIN.</p>
<p>The fourth part is integrating product innovation knowledge from different sources. Innovation knowledge integration is a process of combining two or more product knowledge modules with different structures and attributes into a more complete product. This kind of integration of knowledge could help the innovation firm use and manage the distributed product knowledge from both internal innovators and external partners. Furthermore, it could also help to simplify and organize the innovation knowledge to facilitate the rapid reuse and sharing of product innovation knowledge among the INs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1063293X12468457">
<title>Knowledge characteristics of the CPIN</title>
<p>In general, collaborative innovation in the network is quite similar to an internal innovation performed within a single company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063293X12468457">Cooper, 2008</xref>). However, in a network environment, the product innovation can no longer be understood as being linear, passing one stage after another, it is necessary to understand the innovation process from an open and collaborative perspective due to the major involvement of many independent actors. In this respect, how to effectively manipulate the innovation knowledge among the INs is an important problem to be solved.</p>
<p>The CPIN is a concept that is closely related to the flow of knowledge. It provides product innovation knowledge service for the organization by integrating and sharing of distributed knowledge resources both inside and outside the organization. Thus, in this respect, the CPIN could also be seen as a collaborative knowledge network. In the innovation network, knowledge resources have always been the core of innovation collaboration and management. How to effectively utilize the knowledge to maximize the benefit of product innovation still needs to be explored. Besides, the CPIN is inseparable from the technology of the computer network, knowledge base, and ontology-supported technologies, which are the foundation of collaborative IN implementations.</p>
<p>The collaborative innovation network is complex in nature. The ever-increasing complexity of the product, geographically dispersed design teams, and mass product customization present difficulties of collaborative task allocation, time to market, knowledge acquisition and integration, and R&amp;D cost control in the CPIN process. Therefore, appropriate technology solutions for CPIN are imperative to facilitate the implementation and deployment of CPINs to benefit industrial applications.</p>

<title>Technology solutions for CPIN</title>
<sec id="section7-1063293X12468457">
<title>Modularization of CPIN</title>
<p>Modularization refers to the breaking down of complex entities (products structures or knowledge) into simpler components (modules).These modules can be developed relatively independently by specialists and can still be composed into a functioning whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12468457">Baldwin and Clark, 1997</xref>). Modularization reduces the need for knowledge transfer between innovation actors and organizations. Modular product development (MPD) has become a promising and effective way to develop new products. This modularization solution can also be adapted and extended in collaborative product innovation under network context. Considering the situation of collaborative innovation network, there should be three types of modularization in CPIN, that is, product modularization, organization modularization, and knowledge modularization.</p>
<p>Product modularization is about grouping many components into modules and defining interfaces between them. Different innovation actors can focus on areas of their expertise, because design decisions in one module are not related to those in other modules. There is loose coupling between the product modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12468457">Benassi, 1998</xref>) that minimize the interactions between a module and the rest of the product. Thus, product modularization would reduce task complexity and increase the ability to complete tasks in parallel and synergistically.</p>
<p>Organization modularization discusses how to build organization modules (e.g. professional collaborative team or community) in which the selected innovation actors (internal R&amp;D, customers, suppliers, etc.) interact by each making a clearly defined knowledge-based task that is a component of the larger whole. The activities within the structure modules do not have much direct effects on the other structure modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X12468457">Grunwald and Kieser, 2007</xref>). Working in a modular team, individuals can absorb knowledge and experience that a single person cannot possess. Furthermore, the organization modularization would enhance cross-learning among different individuals in the modular team, and the intensive cross-learning between specialists is expected to solve the problem of implicit knowledge capturing, innovation knowledge creation, and integration.</p>
<p>Knowledge modularization interprets the product modules into knowledge modules. The complex knowledge system is decomposed into relatively simple knowledge modules that are linked with the established rules, and the module itself can also be broken down into simpler modules again. Then, the process of collaborative product innovation will be much simpler. A series of rules would be designed in the CPIN system to determine the regulations of collaborative innovation. The rules do not have to present the specific content of each knowledge module, but they define the sphere of every knowledge module and the interface for sharing the knowledge. Therefore, the modules’ conflicts would be reduced due to coordination of those designed rules of modularization. Meanwhile, the hidden rules inside the knowledge modules would also help to reduce the cost of knowledge sharing and transfer, because the modules interact with each other through interfaces instead of specific content in modules.</p>
<p>As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12468457">Figure 2</xref>, the product modules, organization module, and knowledge module are three basic and complementary elements of collaborative IN. The organizational module is the subject of collaborative innovation, and the product module is the object of collaborative innovation. Distributed knowledge modules are required by the organizational module to support the changes of attributes and parameters of the product module.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section8-1063293X12468457">
<title>Ontology-based knowledge integration</title>
<p>The knowledge and information among the collaborative innovation network should not only be found (retrieval), but correlations should be pointed out and knowledge integration should be finished. But it is hard to integrate different domain knowledge of actors together, because the actors come from different disciplines and use different knowledge with different expressions. The knowledge integration has claimed to be one of or perhaps even the main challenge in achieving innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12468457">Nonaka and Teece, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, ontology could be used as the main technique to fulfill the requirement of collaborative knowledge integration. Ontology can be used to describe both the information source semantics and knowledge explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063293X12468457">Stuckenschmidt and Van Harmelen, 2005</xref>). More than any of the earlier concept systems, ontology allows semantic annotation of documents to put them into wider knowledge contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12468457">Handschuh and Staab, 2003</xref>). However, there are few researches on applying the ontology into INs. Ontology in terms of knowledge representation is a systems of concepts, defining sets of individuals and their relations within a defined domain of knowledge. They can clearly define domain semantics making use of the rules and axioms supported by ontology languages, which enables computers to reason about the depicted knowledge. Therefore, the problem of knowledge management and integration could be addressed.</p>
<p>The knowledge module ontology could be integrated with structure, semantics, and features in the light of correlation rules, which facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse in the innovation network context and product knowledge services to provide users with better and more accurate results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1063293X12468457">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the integration of the knowledge ontology module. The structural correlation rules help to achieve integration of the parent concept and subconcepts structurally. The semantic correlation rules ensure the consistency of semantic representation in the knowledge module. The feature correlation rules help to realize the integration of specific domain knowledge modules, such as design knowledge, manufacturing knowledge, service knowledge, and so on.</p>

<title>Implementation of the proposed framework</title>
<p>In this section, the authors use a case of electric water heater development in company H to show implementation and potential of the proposed CPIN framework. The company H is a well-known electric water-heater manufacturer in Eastern China who has strengths in electricity isolation using attenuation of water resistance, the core technology for the reliability and safety of the product. The industry of electric water heaters in China is facing great challenges such as shorter design cycles, fierce competition, customization, and so on. However, the company H cannot respond quickly to the market since 2010 due to the longer design cycle. This is mainly because the valuable distributed innovation knowledge is scattered around the company (e.g. patent database, drawing database, design function, marketing department, etc.) according to the survey. Furthermore, a network or platform for product knowledge sharing and reusing is found to be lacking. Product knowledge acquisition and sharing are very difficult. Besides, the cooperation with external actors (suppliers with strengths in antimicrobial porcelain enamel coating liner) turned out to be a failure in 2010 because the necessary mechanism protecting the core knowledge was found lacking. Therefore, the company H implemented the CPIN last year (2011) to solve the problems mentioned above.</p>
<p>Implementation of the CPIN requires appropriate supports of software and hardware systems. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1063293X12468457">Figure 4</xref> shows the architecture of the CPIN system, which consists of unified portal, web services layer, system functions layer, core knowledge database, operation and maintenance management platform, and so on. The CPIN system would provide a collaborative product innovation platform for different users. The unified portal is mainly for different innovation actors who input their requirements for knowledge, share different areas of knowledge, and develop the product collaboratively. The main task of the web services layer is to register, package, bind, and release the product innovation knowledge. System functional layer is the core of the CPIN system. It consists of three main functions: product innovation module partition, product knowledge ontology modeling, and data management. The core knowledge database provides resource supports for the construction of the knowledge module ontology database. The operation and maintenance management platform provides base supports for the CPIN system, such as safety management, log management, cache management, and so on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12468457">Figure 5</xref> shows a prototype tool developed for knowledge query and integration for the electric water heater.</p>

<p>The distributed knowledge modules from different innovation actors are integrated together for product innovation. The necessary functions of CPIN are packaged in the form of web services in the web service wrapper and released in the service registrar. Different innovation actors, both internal R&amp;D and external partners, could put forward their innovation knowledge requirements. Then, the search engine queries the service directory and calls the related knowledge for the application system. The returned innovation knowledge is bound with the innovation partners’ knowledge database. In this way, the innovation knowledge could be shared and reused efficiently.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the proposed framework and technology solutions</title>
<p>The proposed framework’s performance is validated via interviews with six academic and industrial experts. The selected interviewees have different backgrounds: four respondents from the company H are familiar with electric water heater design, manufacturing technology of electric water heater, and product knowledge management, while two other academic experts are familiar with product modular design and development and knowledge ontology. According to the result of the interviews, all experts stated that the CPIN framework was very useful to improve innovative designs for electric water heaters. The experts also appreciated the solution of the knowledge module ontology as it offers a consistent understanding of domain concepts and knowledge reuse, which are very important for sharing knowledge interfirm and intrafirm. Besides, they also consider that the proposed IN could help reduce the training cost (nearly 35% according to the survey) because it provides flat, flexible, and open collaborative environments.</p>
<p>The four experts (from electric water heater design, manufacturing technology, and product knowledge management backgrounds) felt that the CPIN and the prototype based on the framework are most feasible in terms of water-heater design, while further study was suggested for lifecycle support of product innovation in order to enhance knowledge sharing and reuse all through the electric water-heater development phases. The two experts (from modular design and development and knowledge ontology backgrounds) stated that the modular solution could reduce the innovation task complexity and realize the collaborative innovation, but much modularization may lower the innovativeness of the product. This suggestion has been taken into account for the further balance of modularization and innovation in the framework.</p>

<title>Conclusion and suggestions</title>
<p>This work examines the existing literature related to innovation network, and analyzes the merits and demerits of the current product IN. Also, a new framework of the CPIN with technology solutions is proposed in this article. Finally, a case of the electric water heater shows the implementation and potential of the proposed framework. The framework is also validated through expert interviews. The results of the case study and interview result proved that the developed framework and its technology are applicable for effective product innovation in practice. In summary, the proposed framework has revealed the following features.</p>
<p>The proposed framework considers both internal and external innovation sources systematically, and provides specific guidance at the project level to reuse and integrate knowledge internally and externally, which is ignored by previous researches.</p>
<p>The modularization theory–based technology solution reduces the innovation task complexity and increases the ability to complete innovation tasks in parallel and synergistically.</p>
<p>Ontology-based knowledge integration enhances the efficiency of knowledge integration and reuse among different innovation actors and avoids unnecessary leakage of intellectual assets.</p>
<p>Although the proposed framework demonstrates potentials in collaborative innovation, it still has some research points to be solved in future. Modularization can reduce the complexity in the network, but too much modularization would affect the novelty of the product. Thus, it is necessary to balance the modularization and innovation in future. Besides, IN lifecycle would be taken into account to solve the problems in different stages of product innovation in future and a prototype system for the CPIN will also be considered. Finally, more testing work is necessary to gain external validity.</p>
