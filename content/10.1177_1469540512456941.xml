<sec id="sec1-1469540512456941"><title>Yi-Chieh Jessica Lin, <italic>Fake Stuff: China and the Rise of Counterfeit Goods</italic>: London: Routledge, 2011. 92 pp. £14.99 (pbk). ISBN 9 780 415 883 030; £90.00 (hbk). ISBN 9 780 415 883 023</title>
<p>I am teaching in a college in New York State. Two weeks before I wrote this review on the book about the counterfeit goods phenomenon in China, one of my colleagues waved his Rolex watch on his wrist, and proudly said to me that his son bought that watch for him as a gift. Then, he added that the watch cost only US$50, and admitted it was a fake. He was smiling and happy with his gift. I interpreted the message behind his smile as appreciation for the thoughtfulness of his son. Similar incidents are reported in the book by stating: ‘Another type of counterfeit consumer consists of business travelers who buy fake products as gifts for family members at home’ (p. 53).</p>
<p>Lin is interested in investigating the ‘juicy’ stories behind this widespread global phenomenon as a business practice (manufacturing faked brand name products) and as consumer behaviors (the mentality of why people buy and love them). This book is one of the very first publications in the Routledge Series for Creative Teaching and Learning in Anthropology. The series is dedicated to innovative, unconventional ways of connecting undergraduate students and their everyday concerns about our social world to the power of social science ideas and evidence with an anthropological approach, as stated on the publisher website.</p>
<p>Considering the publisher’s intention and the presentation of the book, I would argue that this book about the rise of counterfeit goods made and sold in China serves the stated purpose and should be well-received in the curriculum of undergraduate classrooms. Unlike most of typical textbook material, this book, and the others in the series, are ‘mini text[books]’ with 100 pages in range, an extremely accessible writing style, and good visual materials that include tables and photos. I must add that the size of the font and the layout of the book results in very comfortable reading. These are very important features of the books for many social sciences courses in undergraduate schools. Many of the students are still becoming accustomed to reading academic materials.</p>
<p>The introduction to the book lays out the framework in which ‘the diversity and nuances of China’s contemporary counterfeit culture’ (p. 10) is studied. This framework starts with some very intriguing narrative about the operation of counterfeit markets in China, the role of <italic>shanzhai</italic> (family-run factories that make counterfeit products for sale) as an important integral part of the contemporary Chinese economic development, and the widespread counterfeit goods production and consumption in the global economy. Then, the text proceeds to present the ways these counterfeit goods violate the intellectual property rights. Lin argues that this counterfeit goods phenomenon goes beyond both the legal aspects of the debate and the symbolic meaning of the consumption of brand names. It can be understood as ‘the desire to create a shared sense of cultural intimacy, at both regional and national levels’ and the copy culture in general that ‘emerge[s] as a way for consumers to resist and reclaim control of meanings from a changing economic system’ (p. 7). The research methods and fieldwork are also presented. The analysis and arguments are supported by meaningful statistical data and rich ethnographic field investigation. The following chapters are basically an elaboration of the key points presented in the introduction.</p>
<p>Overall, the topic of the book is timely in the context that the Chinese economy is showing unprecedented growth in a relatively short period of time. The mass production of counterfeit goods and the large volume of sales of these goods in China and overseas are indeed fascinating research areas. We have to admire Lin’s ethnographic research skills and rich network allowing her to conduct in-depth investigations into this ‘underground’ economy in China. One of the intriguing findings in the counterfeit goods production is that this business not only generates huge revenue gain, but also leads to innovative creations that find a niche in the Chinese market. Surprisingly, these <italic>shanzhai</italic> products, sold at an unbelievably low price, are not necessarily inferior to the real ones (see p. 18).</p>
<p>Lin’s writing is sensitive in that she does not portray this segment of China’s economy in a stereotypical manner. She points out that China is neither the originator nor the sole producer and sole consumer of these counterfeit goods. Lin’s research places the Chinese case in a historical comparative approach by stating that other nations and cultures have engaged in and are still engaging in this business. She cites examples of other Asian and Latin American countries. In addition, she emphasizes that consumption of these counterfeit goods occurs in both developing and developed countries.</p>
<p>The research has been expanded beyond brand name counterfeit goods to other ‘counterfeit cultural media products’ that include television programs in China. Lin compares this rising phenomenon in China with different types of culture jamming and resistance in other parts of the globe as a way to protest and rebel against corporate and government wrongdoing (p. 58). These <italic>shanzahi</italic> media productions provide the people with unconventional channels to express themselves in an authoritarian state through which the people at the grassroots level create a sense of cultural intimacy at both regional and national levels. Other types of copy culture found in theme park businesses and architecture reproduction are discussed in the last chapter. Lin concludes: ‘Counterfeiters are not simply aping high society; they become producers of meaning and cultural innovators. Perhaps human culture has always been characterized by an endless series of imitations.’</p>
<p>The book should be praised because it provides many eye-opening findings and generates many stimulating thoughts. However, there are many weaknesses. Perhaps, the limited length of the series prevents Lin from elaborating on links among the many points. As a consequence, the reading gives a feeling of ‘touch and go’. Although the copy culture in brand names, media and even architecture shares the concept of imitations, the motivations and mentality behind production and consumption of these counterfeit goods can be very different. Those who make and consume counterfeit brand name goods do not necessarily carry the voice of rebellion against transnational corporate entities and the state. The complex mentality of the copy culture could be investigated more thoroughly and deserves much more in-depth interpretation. In other words, the topic of this dissertation-like book merits a work of more substantial depth and length.</p>
