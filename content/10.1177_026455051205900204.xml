Or to give them their full title, circles of Support and Accountability. The book methodically introduces the concept of circles, tracing the historical development of the approach from its early beginnings in Canada right up to the time of publication when 64 circles were in operation in the UK. Such is the rapid growth of the project that by the time you are reading this that figure could even have doubled.</p><p>The authors explain how circles are designed for former sex offenders following a prison sentence or serving a community order; a group of human beings who may be ‘probably the most despised group in society’ (p. 14). Such individuals are likely to live in fear of being ‘named and shamed’, even in fear of their lives; they may well be estranged from any family or former friends; they will probably have various restrictions on their movements; and they will face repeated rejection and contempt when trying to re-enter the world of work.</p><p>The principles underlying the Circle project are clearly set out, the aim being to reduce sexual reoffending by those known to be of high risk, by providing both support and accountability. ‘No more victims’ is their motto. However a circle is also designed to fill ‘the worrying vacuum of help for offenders on release’, and to combat the ‘two commonalities most prevalent among ex-offenders after treatment – the continued existence of high levels of isolation and emotional loneliness’ (p. 59), two of the predisposing factors for reoffending.</p><p>The text outlines how each circle comprises a small group of volunteers and the ex-offender who is referred to as the core member, and who will have joined the group voluntarily. In each area there will likely be a circles co-ordinator who may attend some of the meetings and will be available to support and guide the volunteers and provide training. In phase one they meet regularly (weekly at first) for an hour or so, providing companionship, showing an interest in the core member’s life, modelling appropriate adult relationships, demonstrating humanity and care, and helping to reintegrate him back into the community. However, they will also be holding him accountable for his movements and for the use of his time. The core member knows that any concerns or risks will be reported to the relevant probation or police service usually via the circle co-ordinator. After approximately one year the circle moves on to phase two in which less formal and less frequent contact is maintained. There may be occasional telephone calls, and some of the volunteers might meet up with the core member for a meal or to go and see a film. Dependence on the group is discouraged, though support is not suddenly withdrawn but is phased out as the core member will, hopefully, be forming his own network of relationships and developing his interests.</p><p>The book explores the varying motivations of circles volunteers. Some emphasize the public protection role, helping to keep society safer. Others are motivated by their faith, or their belief in the intrinsic goodness or potential in everyone. All desire to make a positive difference. Interviews with four different volunteers are reproduced in the book, giving a moving insight into volunteers’ own stories and their very personal experiences of working in a circle. One said, ‘…all offenders are just people, aren’t they?’ (p. 130), and another asserts ‘they weren’t born sex offenders’ (p. 142).</p><p>Another chapter covers evaluation and evidence in support of circles. Several pieces of research are cited, providing considerable evidence that they really do work. As one example of circles’ worth the text notes that ‘after eight years of growing circles’ partnerships in over 20 police and probation areas [in England and Wales], not one partner agency has withdrawn citing a lack of confidence in the model and its effectiveness’ (p. 159). Even more compelling, though, are the stories of four core members themselves, testifying to the benefits of circles. One reported, ‘…they’re not doing it to get paid, it’s something that they wanna do. [Without circles] I think, to be honest, I would probably have committed suicide…the people out there believe in me, like the circle…I feel so happy that I don’t have to make my life up’ (pp. 105–107). Others said, ‘…they haven’t judged me’ (p. 113) and ‘Without circles, I wouldn’t have had anyone to talk to’ (p. 114).</p><p>Seeing that one of the core principles of the circles movement is community involvement, I was left wondering how the wider community might be better represented within a circle, instead of the volunteers representing such a small ‘enlightened’ minority. Perhaps these are the subjects of another book.</p><p>No one is better qualified to report on circles than the authors: Stephen Hanvey is Chief Executive of Circles UK; Chris Wilson is National Development Manager of Circles UK; and Terry Philpot is a journalist and writer and works voluntarily with long-term prisoners.</p><p>As a circles volunteer myself, I would say that this book provides an accurate account of the work of circles, as seen from a number of viewpoints. What I read in the book matches precisely my own experience! I would see it as essential reading for those working in statutory agencies considering or already involved in a circle, and for potential circles volunteers. Would-be core members themselves, if they were to read the book, might already start to see themselves differently.</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Stephen Hitchcock</bold><break/><italic>Circle Volunteer, Cumbria Circles of Support and Accountability</italic></sig></sig-block></body></article>
