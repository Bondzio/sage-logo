<abstract>
<p>Monozygotic twins, 27 years old, with primary anti-phospholipid syndrome have been described. The first of the twins had obstetric morbidities (one miscarriage at 12 weeks and premature birth of a growth-restricted fetus at 27 weeks secondary to pre-eclampsia) and the second had venous thrombosis. Lupus anticoagulant was present in both and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were present in high titres when re-tested at appropriate intervals. Development of clinical features of APS in monozygotic twins points to an underlying genetic basis in the pathogenesis of anti-phospholipid syndrome.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312467393" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Also known as Hughes syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by venous or arterial thromboses, fetal losses and thrombocytopenia, in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, namely lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) or antibodies directed to various proteins, mainly beta 2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI), or in the presence of all three.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312467393">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312467393">2</xref></sup> It occurs in isolation (primary APS) in more than 50% of the patients, but it can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) being the most common with up to 35% of patients developing secondary APS. Familial associations of primary APS have been rarely been reported. We describe monozygotic twins with primary APS, which to our knowledge is the first such report.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312467393" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>In April 2011 twin A, a 27-year-old woman, developed pre-eclampsia with thrombocytopenia (platelets 46 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µl) at 26 weeks of gestation, resulting in premature birth of a severely growth-restricted female fetus which did not survive. Earlier, during routine antenatal check-up at 16 weeks, she was noted to be hypertensive and at 24 weeks of gestation persistent abnormal diastolic notching of bilateral uterine arteries was documented on ultrasound Doppler. Her previous pregnancy with a morphologically normal fetus ended in miscarriage at 12 weeks’ gestation. She had no other pregnancies. Apart from a history of migraines and hypothyroidism she had otherwise enjoyed good health. The presence of LA was investigated by screening tests (dilute partial thromboplastin time and dilute Russell viper venom time) and confirmed by mixture and confirmatory tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312467393">3</xref></sup> IgG and IgM aCL were measured by standardized ELISA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312467393">4</xref></sup> LA was present and aCL were present in high titres when tested twice 12 weeks apart (IgG, 184.6 and 180.7 GPL/ml, respectively; IgM, 50.4 and 42.1 MPL/ml, respectively). There were no clinical and serological features (negative ANA, double stranded DNA and extractable nuclear antigens, normal levels of serum complements) of either SLE or any other autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Around the same time, her identical twin, B, after travelling overnight for six hours on a bus developed left leg oedema and pain and was admitted to a different institution. Venous Doppler study confirmed presence of extensive thrombus involving external iliac vein, superficial femoral vein, popliteal vein and calf vein. She had never been pregnant. She was not on any medication such as contraceptive pills. As in her sister there were no clinical and serological features of either SLE or any other autoimmune diseases. Previously she had enjoyed good health. LA and aCL were tested using the aforementioned methods. LA was present and aCL were present in high titres (IgG, 194.6 GPL/ml; IgM, 56.7 MPL/ml) before anticoagulation with warfarin was started. Six months later she decided to get married and at that time, at her request, anti-coagulation was discontinued. Repeat testing at this stage confirmed the presence of LA and again aCL were present in high titres (IgG, 244.4 GPL/ml; IgM, 49.5 MPL/ml).</p>
<p>The monozygotic twins thus fulfilled the classification criteria for APS syndrome and based on the above clinical profile were deemed to have primary APS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312467393">2</xref></sup> The affected twins did not have any other siblings. Their father and mother had no clinical features of any autoimmune diseases and tested negative for both SLE and APS. Existence of auto-immune diseases including APS among all 18 members of three generations of the twins’ family was ascertained by questionnaire, clinical examination and, where relevant, laboratory investigations. No members were affected by the primary APS or other autoimmune rheumatological diseases; however, other autoimmune disorders were present (primary hypothyroidism in one aunt and type 1 diabetes in one female cousin).</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312467393" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe monozygotic twins with primary APS, which to our knowledge is the first such report. While the first of the twins had obstetric morbidities, the second had venous thrombosis. Both fulfilled the laboratory criteria for the classification of APS.</p>
<p>A genetic basis for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been suggested based on several reports of familial clustering. In these reports higher incidence of aCL was found in first-degree relatives of patients with SLE or primary APS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312467393">5</xref></sup> In another report nine out of 24 members of four generations of the family of a woman with stroke and aPL were found to be LA and/or aCL positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312467393">6</xref></sup> However, clinical manifestations of APS were absent in the majority of them and only LA was present in several of them. Study of this pedigree suggested a familial form of APS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312467393">6</xref></sup> In another analysis of familial APS, segregation studies rejected environment and autosomal recessive models, and the data were found to be fitted best with a dominant or codominant model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312467393">7</xref></sup> However, linkage analysis has shown independent segregation of APS and several candidate genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312467393">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this context twin studies may provide an opportunity to study the genetic factors responsible for specific disease manifestations. Besides our present report there are two more reports on monozygotic twins. In the first, severe spongiform aortic stenosis in monozygotic twins with secondary APS related to SLE has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312467393">8</xref></sup> Though the surviving second twin and their mother shared HLA haplotypes DRB1 11041 and DQ B1 0301 (DQ7), the mother had positive LA but negative aCL and normal heart valves, suggesting that the pathological contribution of these alleles was insufficient in the mother to produce the target organ damage. In the second, an 18-year-old woman with primary APS has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312467393">9</xref></sup> Her asymptomatic monozygotic twin sister was a carrier of LA, aCL and β2GPI. HLA association was with DR7 and DR53. Some studies specifically looking at the HLA associations of primary APS have reported DR53, DR4 and DQ7 associations. These support the theory that a genetic predisposition may influence the appearance of aPL. In contrast to the aforementioned reports both of our patients had clinical manifestations of primary APS.</p>
<p>In summary, presence of aPL is linked to genetic predisposition, which may be associated, at least in part, with genes of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA system). Exposure to one or more environmental agents, such as infections, in a genetically susceptible individual, through a molecular mimicry, can result in the production of pathogenic aPL, which can induce thrombosis and pregnancy loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312467393">10</xref></sup> The genes involved in APS have not been identified because antigen specificity of aPL and the pathophysiology of APS are highly heterogeneous and multifactorial. It has been suggested that genome-wide linkage analysis and larger cohort studies would lead to better understanding of the genes that might be involved in APS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312467393">10</xref></sup></p>
