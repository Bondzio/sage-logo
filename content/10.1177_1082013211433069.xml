<abstract>
<p>Microbiological quality of cuttlefish (<italic>Sepia pharaonis</italic>) fillets stored in three different ice conditions was studied. Fillets stored in wet ice at a ratio of 1:1 (package III) were sensorially acceptable for only 18 h, while that stored in dry ice at 1:1 (package I) and combination of dry ice and wet ice at 1:0.2:0.5 (package II) were in acceptable condition up to 24 h without re-icing and thus there was an extension of shelf life by about 33%. Total bacterial load was 7 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g at the end of the storage period. Total psychrophilic population increased from zero to 7 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g while total lactic acid bacteria from zero to 5 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g. H<sub>2</sub>S producers were detected only at 18 h, with a count of 1 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g. Sulphite-reducing Clostridia increased gradually from zero to 110 most probable number count/g. Fresh cuttlefish fillets carried a bacterial flora of <italic>Micrococcus, Planococcus, Streptococcus, Moraxella, Proteus</italic> and<italic> Aeromonas</italic>. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was dominant in wet ice pack, while <italic>Aeromonas</italic> was dominant in both the dry ice and combination pack. Immediately after packing, the temperatures recorded in packages I, II and III were 10.5, 1.2 and 3.0 °C, respectively, which drastically decreased in 1 h and then maintained and finally increased gradually. The results indicate that use of combination of dry ice and wet ice is economical and very much useful to seafood industries, as this package considerably reduced the cost of air freight, as well as improved the quality and shelf life of cuttlefish.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211433069" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Cuttlefish, being highly perishable, deteriorate rapidly at tropical temperatures. Cephalopods undergo very rapid protein degradation after death due to endogenous and bacterial enzymes, which favor proliferation of degenerative flora and rapid decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211433069">Vaz-Pires and Barbosa, 2004</xref>). Since cephalopods undergo rapid spoilage due to the action of microorganisms and enzymes resulting in short shelf life, there is a need for extending the shelf life of this species. Proper icing keeps the product in acceptable condition for reasonable periods. Direct icing is not considered a suitable method even for the short-term preservation of cephalopods, as it resulted in decrease of total water extractable nitrogen (WEN) and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211433069">Raghunath, 1984</xref>). Melting of ice and leaching is quite high under tropical conditions that are prevailing in India. Hence, alternative method of preservation is essential to overcome these problems, so as to improve the quality of fresh fish, which can retain their original flavor, color and texture for long period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211433069">Prafulla et al. (2000)</xref> studied the effect of indirect icing on the quality of squid and cuttlefish in comparison with direct icing method.</p>
<p>Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) has recently gained popularity in India as a novel-chilling medium for the rapid transportation of fresh fish by air, as the application of dry ice in fresh fish preservation is new. However, a significant number of seafood exporters use dry ice in combination with wet ice unscientifically for fresh fish transportation. In this regard, application of dry ice along with wet ice at the ratio of 1:0.2:0.5 is found to be effective for preserving fresh fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran et al., 2004</xref>) by reducing the temperature rapidly and also more economical. Dry ice has certain advantages viz., it has bacteriostatic effect and it acts as an insulant enveloping the fish upon evaporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211433069">Putro, 1989</xref>). It is also used as coolant in the present trends of shipping of fresh seafood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211433069">Schoemaker, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran et al. (2010)</xref> reported the quality changes in squid (<italic>Loligo duvaucelli</italic>) tubes chilled with dry ice and water ice. Since the impact of different iced storage conditions on the microbiological quality of cephalopods has not been thoroughly explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211433069">Lapa-Guimaraes et al., 2002</xref>) and cuttlefish is one of the important fish varieties exported from India in chilled condition, the present study was conducted to find out the influence of preservative effect of dry and wet ice on the microbiological quality of cuttlefish (<italic>Sepia pharaonis</italic>) fillets in relation to their storage life.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1082013211433069"><title>Sampling</title>
<p>Cuttlefish (<italic>Sepia pharaonis</italic>) were procured from fish landing center of Tuticorin, India. Time interval between harvesting and the arrival of fish at the landing center was 6–8 h and during this period they were iced. They were immediately brought to the laboratory in insulated containers. Fillets were prepared by removing their head, shell, gut and ink sac and washed in tap water. Fillets had an average length of 11 cm and weight of 100 g. They were divided into three lots; each had a weight of about 14 kg and the number of packs in each lot was seven. First lot was packed with dry ice (Thermosafe Dry ice Machine, USA) at the ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt), second lot with a combination of dry ice and wet ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211433069">Sasi et al., 2000</xref>) at a ratio of 1:0.2:0.5 and the third lot with wet ice (Ziegra Flake ice Maker, Germany) at a ratio of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211433069">Lima dos Santos et al., 1981</xref>), which served as control and were designated as packages I, II and III, respectively. The fillets were packed separately in bags before being stored in ice. Gloves were worn during handling of ice and fillets. Care was taken to avoid direct contact of fillets with wet ice and dry ice. Re-icing was not done during the course of experiment. Packages were wrapped in Polypropylene bags (200 gauge), placed in conical shaped styrofoam boxes and sealed with cellophane tape. Styrofoam boxes were stored at room temperature (33 ± 2 °C). One pack from each lot was periodically analyzed in triplicate for sensory, bacteriological and physical quality until they were organoleptically unacceptable.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1082013211433069"><title>Sensory evaluation</title>
<p>Sensory characteristics and overall acceptability of cuttlefish fillets were assessed by a panel of six experienced members of the Faculty of Fish Processing Technology of Fisheries College and Research Institute on the basis of ten point scale on each sampling. The sensory characteristics studied included appearance (inclusive of color), odor and texture. The scores were given in the decreasing order scale with 10-9 for excellent, 8-7 for good, 6-5 for fair and acceptable, 4-3 for poor and 2-1 for very poor. The scoring system adopted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211433069">Table 1</xref>) in this study was a modification of the systems given in the FAO document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211433069">Kreuzer, 1984</xref>) following the guidelines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211433069">Stroud (1978)</xref>. The mean of the scores given by the panel represented the overall sensory quality and a score of ≤4 constituted unacceptable and shelf life failure.

<sec id="sec6-1082013211433069"><title>Bacteriological analysis</title>
<p>Bacteriological analyses carried out in this study included total bacterial load, total psychrophilic count, total lactic acid bacteria, total H<sub>2</sub>S producers, total coliforms and total sulphite-reducing Clostridia. All the media used in this study were obtained from Hi-Media Laboratories, Mumbai, India. Muscle from different regions of cuttlefish fillet was cut into small pieces using sterile knife and forceps and 25 g was taken from this mixed pool for analysis. The sample was homogenized using 225 mL sterile physiological saline (0.85%) and serial decimal dilutions of each homogenate were carried out with the same diluent for the respective bacteriological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433069">APHA, 2001</xref>). Appropriate dilutions were spread plated onto Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) for the enumeration of total bacterial load and total psychrophilic count. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for the enumeration of total bacterial load, whereas they were incubated under refrigerated condition (5 °C) for 7 days for the enumeration of psychrophiles. The colonies from total plate count plates (&lt;300 colonies) of packages I, II and III at each storage time were isolated and identified by various biochemical tests (Balows et al., 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211433069">LeChevallier et al., 1980</xref>). Representative colonies were chosen from each treatment for the identification. Double-layer pour plate technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211433069">USFDA, 2001</xref>) was followed for the enumeration of total lactic acid bacteria and simple pour plate technique was carried out for total H<sub>2</sub>S producers using deMan Ragosa Sharpe (MRS) Lactobacillus Agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211433069">deMan et al., 1960</xref>) and Peptone Iron Agar (PIA), respectively. The plates were incubated under microaerophilic condition for 48 h at room temperature for lactic acid bacteria and only at room temperature for 48 h for H<sub>2</sub>S producers. The numbers of typical colonies appearing on the plates were counted and expressed as cfu/g. Most probable number (MPN) technique was followed for the enumeration of total coliforms and total sulphite-reducing Clostridia using Lauryl Sulphate Tryptose Broth and Differential Reinforced Clostridial Medium (DRCM), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211433069">Surendran et al., 2003</xref>). For the enumeration of total sulphite-reducing clostridia, the inoculated tubes were overlaid with sterile liquid paraffin and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 4 days. The tubes exhibiting black precipitate were counted as positive and expressed as MPN count/g. For total coliforms, the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the tubes showing acid and gas production was counted as positive and expressed as MPN count/g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211433069">APHA, 2001</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211433069"><title>Physical evaluation</title>
<p>Physical parameters studied included pH, temperature and gas composition. The pH was determined by using pH meter (Digisun Electronics Digital pH Meter 707, India) by taking 10 g of homogenized sample in 100 mL of distilled water. Changes in cold spot temperature of different ice packages were recorded by using Ultrafreezer temperature probe (Consort Model T 852, Belgium) by placing the thermocouple in the hottest inner part of the fillets. Gas composition of different packaging environment was measured by gas analyzer (PBI Dansensor CheckMate 9900, Denmark), as gases inside the package affect the quality and shelf life of products.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211433069"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using standard statistical package (SPSS 10.0) to examine whether any significant difference exists between different treatments, with respect to the different fish quality characteristics at 5% level.</p></sec></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec10-1082013211433069"><title>Sensory evaluation</title>
<p>The changes in the sensory scores of cuttlefish fillets stored in three different packaging conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211433069">Figure 1</xref>. Raw cuttlefish fillets exhibited fresh shellfish odor, were white in color with elastic firm texture and was considered as excellent with the overall score of 9.8. No remarkable change was observed in package III, while the dry ice contacted fish surface became frozen in package II in 1 hour, whereas the cuttlefish in package I was completely frozen due to drastic fall in temperature. No characteristic change was noticed up to 12 h of storage in all the three packages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211433069">Ke et al. (1991)</xref> found that the fresh squid could be stored for longer in non-contact ice than in contact storage in chilled seawater (CSW). At 18 h, package III exhibited slight musty odor, color became milky white and slightly lost its texture with a sensory score of 5.7, whereas, packages I and II exhibited slight cooked meat odor, but, the texture and color was similar to that of fresh fillets. At 24 h, package III was sensorially spoiled with strong ammoniacal and faecal odor and the meat color became slight yellowish, while the same sensory characteristics was observed in packages I and II only at 30 h. It has been earlier reported that the appearance of an offensive putrid smell, change in color and soft or flabby texture, are critical parameters used to determine the sensory quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211433069">Lakshmanan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211433069">Ohashi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211433069">Yamanaka et al., 1987</xref>). A negative relationship was observed between the sensory scores and the various bacterial counts in this dry and wet ice storage studies on cuttlefish fillets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran et al.

<p>The changes in total bacterial load of cuttlefish fillets stored in three different packaging conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211433069">Figure 2</xref>. Initial total bacterial load of fresh fillets was 5 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g, which reduced by a log in package III and two logs in packages I and II at 1 h. At 6 h, the load further reduced by a log in packages I and III, whereas, it remained 3 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g in package II. The drastic reduction in bacterial load might be due to cold shock. On further storage, the count increased gradually and reached a level of 7 log<sub>10</sub> cfu/g in all the three packages at the end of storage. Similar bacterial count was also observed by earlier workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211433069">Jeyasekaran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211433069">Paarup et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211433069">Prafulla et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211433069">Huss et al.

<sec id="sec21-1082013211433069"><title>Changes in temperature</title>
<p>Immediately after packaging, the temperatures recorded in packages I, II and III were 10.5, 1.2 and 3.0 °C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211433069">Figure 6</xref>). At that time, room temperature was 33.5 °C. The temperature became subzero at 1 h, which was maintained up to 8 and 4 h in packages I and II, respectively. However, the lowest temperature recorded in package III was 0.2 °C at 1 h. After that, it increased gradually throughout the storage period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211433069">Sivertsvik et al.

</fig></p>
<p>It can be concluded that both dry ice (at the ratio of 1:1) as well as a combination of dry ice and wet ice (in the ratio of 1:0.2:0.5) improved the quality and increased the shelf life of cuttlefish fillets by about 33%, when compared to wet ice alone (in the ratio of 1:1). Since the combination of dry ice and wet ice was more economical than dry ice alone and even the quality of fillets in both the storage conditions was similar, fresh fillets could be chilled in the combined dry ice and wet ice package and transported more effectively by air through out the World to meet the demand of fresh cuttlefish. About 15 to 25% reduction in the cost of air transport of chilled cuttlefish fillets packed with a combination of dry ice and wet ice at the ratio of 1:0.2:0.5 was possible when compared to transport in wet ice, in addition to the elimination of melt ice problem encountered while using flake ice during air shipment.</p></sec></sec></sec>
