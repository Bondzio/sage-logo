<abstract>
<p>Rural health care has achieved a new focus of attention with the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This article argues that nurse practitioners may be an important resource to help rural hospitals, especially critical access hospitals (CAH), achieve their mission of community service while protecting their always-delicate financial sustainability. Nurse practitioners’ scope of practice is well suited to the needs of rural patients, and their ability to participate in expanding preventive services is especially essential in remote areas. Barriers to nurse practitioner practice include restrictive state laws and federal and state policies.</p>

<p>The general public, health care professionals, economists, government agency personnel, and elected policy makers understand that the U.S. health care system must go through a fundamental transformation. Although no one knows the exact trajectory of the reforms, strong leadership on the part of all stakeholder groups is a fundamental requirement for successful change. Because nursing is central to high-quality care, effective leadership from the nursing profession is essential. In October 2010, the Committee on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative on the Future of Nursing at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a significant report. The charge of the committee was to examine the capacity of the nursing workforce to meet the demands of the health care and public health systems and develop a set of “bold” national recommendations regarding the delivery of nursing services in a provider shortage environment.</p>
<p>The report identified four foundational ideas linking changes in nursing to the necessary improvements in health care:</p>
<list id="list1-1527154412472710" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nurses should achieve higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nurses should be full partners, with physicians and other health professionals, in redesigning health care in the United States.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effective workforce planning and policy making require better data collection and an improved information infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527154412472710">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2010</xref>, p. 4).</p></list-item></list>
<p>A key component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 is the expansion of insurance coverage for an additional 32 million Americans by 2014. This planned expansion is problematic for the health care delivery system for two reasons. First, there are already health professional shortage areas (HPSAs), so adding more users may overburden the system and create access difficulties. Second, adding more consumers may exacerbate the already unacceptable acceleration of health care costs. These issues are especially salient for small and rural “critical access” hospitals (CAHs).This article explores the potential expansion of advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) utilization in delivering primary care at CAHs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1527154412472710">
<title>Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs)</title>
<p>Following the end of World War II in 1945, there was an acute hospital bed shortage. The shortage prompted a political response, with Senators Lister Hill (Democrat-Alabama) and Harold Burton (Republican-Ohio) sponsoring the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946. The Hill–Burton Act appropriated US$75 million in annual funding for the construction of new and replacement hospitals in underserved areas. Its initial 5-year commitment of funding was extended into the 1970s, eventually funding an estimated 349,318 hospital beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527154412472710">Schulte, 2009</xref>). As a condition for receiving Hill–Burton funding, participating hospitals were required to provide charity care. The program funded hospitals in hundreds of small towns, many of which had never before had a hospital. The new facilities quickly became centers of civic pride and identity. However, by the 1960s many of the Hill–Burton-funded hospitals found that the extent of charity care was greater than anticipated and, in fact, charity care was threatening their financial viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527154412472710">Schulte, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The financial discomforts of rural hospitals helped provide political support for the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527154412472710">Schulte, 2009</xref>). In the first years after passage of this legislation, Medicare and Medicaid provided a financial windfall for rural hospitals because the programs paid all costs for enrolled patients including a 2% “profit.” Not surprisingly, the cost of Medicare and Medicaid escalated quickly, prompting a number of major initiatives designed to reduce the rate of increase. These early initiatives were ineffective, which led Congress to enact the Social Security Amendments of 1983. This radically changed the method of hospital payment, moving from cost-based reimbursement to a prospective payment system (PPS) based on fixed per-case payment rates for diagnosis-related groups (DRGs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154412472710">Svahn &amp; Ross, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The PPS approach created growing financial stress on both urban and rural hospitals, resulting in an upsurge in hospital closings. Between 1989 and 1997 there was a 7.8% decrease in the total number of General Community Hospitals, with a 3.7% decrease in urban hospitals. Rural hospitals were hit particularly hard, with a 13.2% decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527154412472710">American Hospital Association, 2011</xref>). The stress on hospitals did not go unnoticed: Congress addressed the issue as part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. The legislation stabilized urban hospitals, which then saw a 5.2% increase between 1997 and 2009. Rural hospitals continued to decline, losing an additional 10.4% between 1997 and 2009.</p>
<p>One component of the BBA was the creation of the CAH designation as part of the State Hospital Flexibility programs. Characteristics of a CAH included:</p>
<list id="list2-1527154412472710" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Furnish 24-hr ER care services, using either on-site or on-call staff</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide no more than 25 inpatient beds used for either inpatient or swing-bed services</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have an average annual length of stay of 96 hr or less</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be located either more than 35 miles from the nearest hospital, more than 15 miles in areas with mountainous terrain or only secondary roads, or where state certified as a necessary provider prior to January 1, 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154412472710">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid [CMS], 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527154412472710">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527154412472710">2011c</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The hospitals that quickly converted to CAH were among the most financially at-risk hospitals in rural America, with 89% of CAH converters reporting negative operating margins during 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527154412472710">Dalton, Slifkin, &amp; Fruhbeis, 2003</xref>). For the entire hospital industry total hospital margin in 1998 was fractionally below 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527154412472710">Santerre, 2007</xref>). Some rural hospitals chose not to convert to CAH status because they were profitable under PPS, were too large, or had average lengths of stay that exceeded CAH requirements. Compared with the nonconverting rural hospitals, CAHs were generally smaller, had higher unit cost, had worse financial conditions, and were located in counties with low population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527154412472710">Li, Ward, &amp; Schneider, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The incentive for attaining CAH designation was the favorable reimbursement formula that allowed these hospitals to receive Medicare-defined costs rather than PPS reimbursement. Low-volume rural hospitals responded enthusiastically, with 102 facilities achieving CAH designation within the first year. The impact on hospital bottom lines was immediate; the hospitals converting in 1999 saw profit margins rise from a negative 2.8% in the base period of financial year 1996-1998 to a positive 2.3% in financial year 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527154412472710">Stensland, Davidson, &amp; Moscovice, 2004</xref>). The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act made CAH conversion even more attractive by increasing payments from 100% of costs to 101% of costs. By November 2003, a total of 834 hospitals were designated as CAH. The period of rapid growth ended in 2006 when the CMS tightened the enrollment standards. By September 2010, a total of 1,320 hospitals had achieved CAH status. The states with the most CAHs included: Kansas (83), Iowa (82), Minnesota (79), Texas (76), and Nebraska (65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527154412472710">Flex Monitoring Team, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a variety of factors influence the financial circumstances of rural hospitals, it is clear that government policy is one of the most important determinants of the profitability of rural hospitals. Thus, CAHs were interested participants in the health care debates that culminated in the passage of the ACA of 2009.</p>

<sec id="section2-1527154412472710">
<title>The ACA: Rural Aspects</title>
<p>The ACA has numerous provisions impacting all hospitals: a move from fee for services toward value-based purchasing (VBP), evidence-based medicine, electronic health records, expanded insurance coverage, and penalties for health care–acquired conditions and readmissions. Like previous health care legislation, the ACA recognizes that rural hospitals face a different operating environment and includes a number of provisions directed specifically to small and rural hospitals. Highlights of the rural provisions include:<disp-quote>
<p>Rural Physician Payments: Medicare will provide a 10 percent bonus payment to primary care practitioners. The bonus will apply for five years beginning Jan. 1, 2011. Qualifying practitioners providing care in a health professional shortage area will receive a 10 percent bonus on hospital CPT visit codes that are typical of primary care. General surgeons providing care in shortage areas also will receive a 10 percent bonus on major CPT-coded procedures over the same period.</p>
<p>Protections for Rural, Low-volume Hospitals: The law provides $300 million over 10 years in payment adjustments for low-volume hospitals.</p>
<p>Low-cost Counties: The law allots $200 million over two years for hospitals located in counties that rank in the lowest quartile of Medicare beneficiary spending adjusted by age, sex and race. For FY 2011 and FY 2012, each hospital will receive funding in an amount that is proportional to the Medicare inpatient hospital payments.</p>
<p>Critical Access Hospital Payments: The law requires that CAHs are paid 101 percent of eligible costs for all patient services and for qualifying ambulance services.</p>
<p>Home Health Payments: The law reinstates a 3 percent add-on payment for home health providers serving rural areas for episodes ending after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2016.</p>
<p>Laboratory Service Payments: The law reinstates the reasonable cost payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory services for qualifying rural hospitals with 50 beds or fewer in certain states with low-density rural areas for cost reporting periods beginning July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Workforce Initiatives: The law creates a National Health Workforce Commission to analyze the supply, distribution, diversity and skill needs of the workforce of the future. The law establishes a grant program through the Health Resources and Services Administration providing $4 million for each of FYs 2010-2013 to assist schools of allopathic or osteopathic medicine in: recruiting students most likely to practice medicine in underserved rural communities; providing rural-focused training and experience; and increasing the number of recent medical school graduates who practice in underserved rural communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The eventual level of funding for these various rural initiatives is unknown because each new Congress, through the annual appropriations process, will decide how much money is allocated to the various discretionary portions of the ACA. Nationally, the ACA appropriates an estimated US$100 billion over federal fiscal years 2010-2019 in mandatory funding and authorizes another US$100 billion in discretionary funding, subject to the annual appropriations process (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010).</p>
<p>The ACA also includes a number of programs specifically targeting nursing, including programs to recruit new nurses into the profession, promote career advancement in nursing, and improve the quality of care. Highlights include the establishment of a federally funded student loan repayment program (LRP) for nurses with outstanding debt who pursue careers in nurse education; support for midwifery programs accredited by the American College of Nurse-Midwives Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education that have as their objective the education of midwives; funding the establishment of traineeships for individuals preparing for advanced education nursing degrees in geriatric nursing, long-term care, gero-psychiatric nursing, or other nursing fields; and raising the cap on the maximum annual and aggregate total loan amount each nursing student may receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527154412472710">American Nurses Association, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Of particular interest to APRNs is the ACA establishment of a new grant program to fund the cost of operations of nurse-managed health clinics (NMHC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154412472710">Health Resources and Services Administration, 2010</xref>). For eligibility, the entity must use APRNs as the primary providers of service, must provide primary health care or wellness services without regard to income or insurance status, and must create a community advisory committee within 90 days of receiving grant funds. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527154412472710">Wakefield (2010)</xref>, the potential impact of the NMHCs is substantial, with an eventual patient base of as many as 40 million people.</p>
<p>A central feature of the ACA is the creation of mechanisms to decrease the number of uninsured Americans. The extension of coverage to the previously uninsured should ultimately have a substantial and positive impact on rural residents and CAHs. With incomes generally lower than urbanites, millions of rural residents will qualify for the various levels of subsidies to help purchase insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154412472710">NRHA, 2011</xref>). The creation of health insurance exchanges will have the greatest positive impact in those areas that currently have the least competition among insurers. Although there are national and local insurance companies, the actual market for health insurance is a local market defined by the provider networks in place. A fundamental tenet of economics would hold that regions with few competing insurance companies face higher costs than regions with more competition. Elimination of the Medicare pharmaceutical “doughnut hole” will help the older-than-average rural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527154412472710">Mullen, Frank, &amp; Rosenthal, 2010</xref>). For rural hospitals, CAHs or not, the decrease in the number of uninsured will prove financially beneficial because it will reduce bad debt and charity care (Coburn, 2010).</p>
<p>Beginning with financial year 2013, CMS will move to a VBP approach, which ties payments to each hospital’s performance on identified quality measures. CMS will develop these measures with input from external stakeholders. The initial focus is on common and high-cost conditions such as cardiac, surgical, diabetes, and pneumonia care.</p>
<p>For rural CAHs, as for the entire health care industry, the ACA not only has beneficial aspects but also presents substantial challenges. Although the decrease in the number of uninsured is positive, the expansion of the insured by 32 million creates concerns about access to high-quality care in rural areas, particularly in existing designated health care provider shortage areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1527154412472710">
<title>Health Professional Shortage Issues</title>
<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration Shortage Designation Branch has developed criteria to identify areas as HPSAs or as medically underserved areas/populations (MUPs). MUPs may include people facing economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to appropriate health care. The current criteria for designation attempt to optimize the allocation of health care resources. The Emergency Health Personnel Act of 1970 set a criterion of one full-time-equivalent (FTE) PCP (primary care physician) per 4,000 people as the threshold for identifying a critical health manpower shortage area. The ratio was changed to 1:3500 by the Health Professions Education Act of 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154412472710">OTA Health Advisory Committee, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2009, there were 6,204 primary care HPSAs, with a total affected population of 65 million. If a ratio of 3,500 people per PCP is used as a benchmark, these areas would require an additional 12,367 practitioners. In addition, there are 3,291 mental health HPSAs, with 80 million residents. With a benchmark of 10,000 people per mental health practitioner, these areas would require an additional 5,340 active practitioners.</p>
<p>Given current demographic trends and the pattern of the production of PCPs the shortage issue will worsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527154412472710">Krupa, 2010</xref>). The Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS) estimates that in the next decade nearly one quarter of practicing physicians will retire while physician supply increases by only 7%. The American Medical Association (AMA) identifies 37% of currently active physicians as above the age 55 and predicts that most of these practitioners will retire by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154412472710">AMA, 2009</xref>). Nationally the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is predicting a physician shortage of 91,500 by 2020. Specifically regarding primary care physicians, the anticipated shortage is estimated at 45,000. The shortage is expected to continue to increase, reaching a shortage of 124,400 by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527154412472710">AAMC, 2008</xref>). Exacerbating the future shortages, most medical students are moving away from primary care. There are now approximately 350,000 PCPs, accounting for only one third of all MDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527154412472710">Sataline &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>). However, only 17% of recent medical school graduates indicated any of the primary care specialties as their first practice choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527154412472710">Council on Graduate Medical Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527154412472710">
<title>Rural Health Landscape and Providers</title>
<p>The demographic and economic circumstances of the rural population create a challenging health care environment. In a foundational article from 1989, DeFriese and Ricketts noted that relative to urbanites, rural residents tend to be older, poorer, less likely to have employer-provided health insurance, less likely to have any health insurance, more dependent on food stamps and Medicare, have higher suicide and accidental death rates, and more likely to live in a health professional shortage area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527154412472710">DeFriese &amp; Ricketts, 1989</xref>). Later studies have supported this seminal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154412472710">NRHA, 2011</xref>). HPSAs are generally defined as areas with a population to primary care physician ratio of 3,500:1. Nonphysician providers like APRNs are not considered in the HPSA designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527154412472710">Health Resources and Services Administration, 1992</xref>). The diverse circumstances of the rural population have always presented a substantial challenge to effective public policy.</p>
<p>Projections indicate that rural areas, particularly the most isolated small towns, will suffer a disproportionate share of physician shortage. This in turn will have a negative impact on access and quality of care in rural areas. Although nearly one fourth of the population lives in rural areas, only 10% of practicing physicians are located there. When a motor vehicle accident occurs, the national average response time for arrival of an EMS (emergency medical services) provider was 18 min in rural areas, 8 min longer than the average in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154412472710">National Rural Health Association, 2011</xref>). Certain aspects of rural life are inherently dangerous.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The rural environment, especially where agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing are important or dominant parts of the economy presents extraordinary threats to health. . . . A review of the causes for visits to a single rural emergency department found that work-related injuries accounted for 12.5% of more than 12,000 injuries. . . . The mechanisms of injury that most commonly resulted in hospitalization included strikes by objects (21%), transportation related accidents (19%), falls (20%), accidents involving crushing mechanisms (10%) and machinery (15%). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527154412472710">Ricketts, 2000</xref>, p. 641)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The dangers of rural life are reflected in the annual injury and fatality statistics collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Important rural economic activities such as crop production (2.7 significant injuries per 100 FTE), animal production (3.6 per 100 FTE), and animal slaughtering and processing (4.6 per 100 FTE) are all noticeably high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154412472710">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Data for occupation-linked fatalities show a similar picture—farmers and ranchers, with a work- related fatality rate of 38.5 per 100,000 FTE workers, have the fourth highest occupational fatality rate. For comparison, the all worker fatal rate is 3.3 per 100,000 FTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154412472710">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Children in farming communities often start operating farm machinery and automobiles as young teenagers. The combination of heavy machinery and inexperience leads to situations where access to emergency services is essential.</p>
<p>The challenge of providing appropriate care in rural areas is exasperated by the recruitment and retention of PCPs. This difficulty is well recognized, and the recruitment and retention of PCPs in rural areas has drawn considerable policy attention. State and local governments have created a variety of incentives, including direct financial incentives, resident support, scholarships, and LRPs. Even with substantial financial incentives, recruitment and retention of health care professionals are problematic, particularly for the most isolated rural communities. In a study of the effectiveness of Colorado’s LRP for PCPs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154412472710">Renner, Westfall, Wilroy, and Ginde (2010)</xref> found that LRPs generally enrolled providers who would have worked in a rural area anyway. Furthermore, family preference and professional dissatisfaction were more influential in retaining rural providers than financial concerns.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1527154412472710">Rabinowitz, Diamond, Markham, and Wortman (2008)</xref> found that 10 medical schools with targeted rural health programs were successful in increasing the number of PCPs willing to locate and remain in rural areas. The authors argue that the general approach of these programs—reserving medical school slots for applicants willing to work in rural areas—could be successfully replicated in a larger number of medical schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527154412472710">Hancock, Steinbach, Nesbitt, Adler, and Auerswald (2009)</xref> identified four major motivations for physicians who had chosen to practice in a rural setting: desire for familiarity, sense of place, community involvement, and self-actualization.</p>
<p>With the expected shortfall of PCPs in rural areas, health care policy must create other avenues for access to quality care. APRNs, with a broader scope of practice, offer a robust alternative. The special qualifications and advantages of the APRN are particularly suited to providing primary care in CAH in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527154412472710">Wakefield, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527154412472710">
<title>Nurse Practitioners</title>
<p>The emergence of APRNs, including nurse practitioners, since 1965 has created a new health care resource that has the potential to both improve health care outcomes and decrease cost. In the 2008 Health Resources and Services survey, 250,527 registered nurses (RNs) reported that they were prepared as an APRN in one or more advanced specialties or fields. This accounts for 8.3% of the 3,063,162 licensed RNs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154412472710">Health Resources and Services Administration, 2010</xref>). The importance of this workforce is apparent when viewed against the total number of primary care physicians (PCP)—just above 350,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527154412472710">Sataline &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>). Regarding access issues, early research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527154412472710">Weston (1980)</xref> found that nearly one third of APRNs were located in underserved areas. In 2009, according to the AANP, 18% of APRNs practiced in rural or frontier areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154412472710">American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, 2010</xref>). The employment of APRNs in rural health clinics (RHC) is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154412472710">Ortiz, Wan, Meemon, Chun, &amp; Agiro, 2010</xref>). The increase is facilitated by the support of the Rural Health Clinic Act, which promotes the use of nurse practitioners in the treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients.</p>
<p>Categorizing the degree of independent practice by APRNs is complicated because each state has its own rules regarding the issue of collaboration or supervision by a physician. The Pearson Report approaches this issue by categorizing states into those with relatively few regulatory barriers versus those that are more limiting. The 2012 Person Report lists 25 states plus the District of Columbia as providing good-to-excellent patient access to APRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527154412472710">Pearson, 2012</xref>). Fifteen states are rated poor to restricted because of continued regulatory barriers, with the 10 remaining states offering modest access. The continued expansion of independent practice opportunities has allowed researchers to examine outcomes in states with different rules for APRNs. More important, the existing variance in scope of practice does not translate into differences in patient outcomes. There is no evidence that APRNs in states that mandate greater restrictions on practice deliver safer or better care than those in less restrictive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527154412472710">Fairman, Rowe, Hassmiller, &amp; Shalala, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As illustrated by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527154412472710">Table 1</xref>, there are substantial numbers of CAHs in most of the states with good-to-excellent access to APRNs. Although the Eastern states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, and New Jersey have no CAHs, Western and prairie states have a substantial CAH presence. Obviously, a state that allows independent practice and has a large percentage of CAHs provides the most fertile opportunity for using APRNs to effectively and efficiently deliver care.</p>

<p>Even with the potential for enhanced use of APRNs, there are still impediments. The reimbursement of APRNs has always been problematic. Medicare policy allows physician practices to bill Medicare for NP-provided services as “incident-to” the physician. When APRNs bill Medicare directly, they are reimbursed at 85% of the physician rate. The same care, provided by the same APRN, is reimbursed 100% of the physician rate when billing Medicare “incident-to.” The cost savings of using the less expensive provider are then captured by the facility or physician, not the patient or the payer. This creates perverse incentives for the health care facility to bill for NP care through a physician. The reimbursement differential creates a disincentive for hospital or clinics to hire APRNs, particularly if the salary differential between APRNs and physicians is less than the overall reimbursement level. Medicare and Medicaid rules regarding the services of APRNs remain complex. APRNs must have physician collaboration in the care of hospitalized patients as the result of federal hospital regulations requiring that every patient be under the care of a physician.</p>
<p>The diversity of APRN tasks compounds the reimbursement complexity. Many APRN procedures are actually nursing services, including nasogastric tube placement, performed by 53% of surveyed APRNs; adjusting feedings (52%); and instituting blood therapy (69%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527154412472710">Kleinpell, 2005</xref>). None of these actions have a CPT (current procedural terminology) code, which means none are reimbursable services.1 Wound management is another common APRN task, performed by 70% of those surveyed, yet reimbursement is available only if the service meets the additional criteria necessary for evaluation and management and is not covered under a global surgical fee.</p>
<p>The BBA (of 1997) expanded reimbursement opportunities for APRNs by removing geographical and practice site restrictions for Medicare Part B reimbursement. The BBA encouraged states to use primary care case managers as gatekeepers to care and granted the states the option to recognize pediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives as primary care case managers. Although this recognized role was positive for APRNs, the BBA also gave states the option to refuse these providers and precluded the states from recognizing any other type of APRN as a primary care case manager. In effect, the BBA permitted APRNs to be excluded as Medicaid providers in primary care cases. Current federal law requires fee-for-service Medicaid to cover health care services provided by some APRNs (pediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154412472710">American Nurses Association (2011)</xref>, some states have opted to cover the services of certified RN anesthetists and clinical nurse specialists where these practitioners are willing to provide needed services in physician shortage areas.</p>
<p>With 40 years of experience, research results are consistently positive for APRNs. On the central issue of quality of care, a substantial series of studies have found that APRN outcomes were as good as PCP outcomes, often with higher scores on patient satisfaction metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527154412472710">Hughes, Clarke, Sampson, Fairman, &amp; Sullivan-Marx, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154412472710">Lenz, Mundinger, Kane, Hopkins, &amp; Lin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527154412472710">O’Grady, 2008</xref>). More recent research has consistently supported the earlier findings. Multiple studies found that access to quality care can be greatly expanded by increasing the use of RNs and APRNs in primary, chronic, and transitional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154412472710">Craven &amp; Ober, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527154412472710">Safreit, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The IOM study further endorses the idea of an enhanced role for APRNs in the first recommendation made in the report: “Recommendation 1: Remove scope-of-practice barriers. APRNs should be able to practice to the full extent of their education and training” (IOM/RWJF, S-8, 2010). The report then proposes a set of policy recommendations for Congress, for involved agencies, and for the states to meet this recommendation.</p>
<p>Note the importance of the wording of the recommendation above: It does not reference <italic>licensure</italic>, which has been the focus of statewide political work, even to creating “scope (of practice) fatigue” in legislatures (Safreit, 2010). The IOM report and the ACA recognize that in addition to direct service, a reformed health care delivery system would need to provide much more continuity of care, more focus on chronic disease management as self management, and more care coordination among providers and agencies. None of these requires a license and none of them has a CPT billing code either.</p>

<title>How Rural Practice Works</title>
<p>The demographic and economic circumstances of the rural population create a challenging health care environment. The diverse circumstances of the rural population have always presented a substantial challenge to effective public policy. As DeFriese and Ricketts note in a 1989 article:<disp-quote>
<p>A complex web of social, cultural, and economic values can have enormous influence on the way in which health care needs are expressed as expectations (or as patterns of health services use) by persons in different communities. Furthermore, there is far more diversity among rural areas (from the low-income rural areas of the Southeast, to the large farms of the Midwest, for example) than is often acknowledged in crude classifications of places on the basis of population density. In no area of health planning is this more evident than in planning for primary care services, for it is these services that one needs most often and with which one most closely identifies as a health services consumer.

<title>An Illustrative Case Study</title>
<p>There are many possible ways APRNs can assist CAHs in meeting their sustainability and quality goals. Because CAHs often operate on a thin financial margin, even small cost savings can have an important impact on the long-term financial viability of a hospital. Hospital administrators are continually searching for opportunities to improve operating margins without compromising quality. In this case, we demonstrate how the increased use APRNs in a rural ED (emergency department) setting leads to a potential improvement in financial metrics. This enhanced use of APRNs is possible in the rural ED because it functions primarily as a gateway into health services. The actual volume of severe trauma and emergencies in a rural hospital is low, which allows for a staffing pattern geared toward primary care. In a large urban setting with a heavy volume of life-threatening cases, staffing is driven by the skills required to meet critically emergent situations.</p>
<p>Recognizing that there is no one model for rural health care this article now takes an introductory look at one specific example of a rural CAH. To protect any nonpublic information, the individual hospital providing the actual medical data cannot be directly identified. For this study, it will be referred to as open prairie hospital (OPH). Originally constructed in the mid-1970s, OPH has the expected menu of services for a rural hospital—emergency care, general surgery, and medical surgical care. It also offers specialty clinics in cardiology, neurology, ENT, obstetrics and gynecology, pulmonology, oncology, endocrinology, orthopedics, and podiatry. Home Health Care services were added in 1994, offering coverage to homebound patients within a 45-mile radius of the hospital. In fiscal year 2010, OPH had a total staff of 154 FTE, with 6.65 FTE per adjusted average daily census.</p>
<p>For coverage of the ED, OPH maintains a contract with the sole physician group in the community. The contract provisions include an hourly rate of pay for on-call services in addition to reimbursement of 90% of charges if encounters occur during normal clinic operating hours. The current arrangement is somewhat disadvantageous to the hospital because while the on-call portion of the contract is payable at cost plus 1% the physician component requires that, regardless of collection or reimbursement rates using the physician fee schedule, OPH pays the attending physician 90% of all charges billed. Not only does this guarantee payment to the physician even if the patient is unable to pay for services but the arrangement also forces the hospital to absorb all associated overhead costs.</p>
<p>The current arrangement creates a perverse incentive because it actually encourages the clinic to send someone to the ED during normal operating hours if that person is uninsured or may have difficulty paying the bill. This situation exists because the clinic can require proof of payment before services are rendered whereas the hospital is governed by the EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act), which requires treatment for all patients presenting to the ED, regardless of ability to pay. The current arrangement results in a physician payment of approximately US$800,000 per year. To put this in perspective the total cost of physician services related to the ED is roughly 10% of the total salary and operating costs for the hospital.</p>
<p>OPH received CAH designation in December 2005. Using the 2008 calendar year data presented in the 2010 Flex Monitoring report, OPH was relatively successful. Total margin and operating margin were both above the state and national medians. However, illustrating the rapidity with which financial circumstances can change for a CAH, OPH went from a 10.5% total profit margin in fiscal year 2008 to a negative 1.7% in fiscal year 2010. This variability in margins requires an evaluation of possible strategies to return OPH to financial viability. One possible strategy is the enhanced use of APRNs to reduce ED operating costs. This a particularly attractive target because rural hospitals often struggle with physician staffing of EDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527154412472710">American College of Emergency Physicians, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, with patient safety and quality care as the most important criteria for the hospital, this strategy is only feasible if evidence indicates that the enhanced use of APRNs will not have a harmful impact on outcomes. With 40 years of experience in APRN-directed care, research results are consistently positive for APRNs. On the central issue of quality of care, studies have found that APRN outcomes were as good to PCP outcomes, often with higher scores on patient satisfaction metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527154412472710">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154412472710">Lenz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527154412472710">O’Grady, 2008</xref>). Multiple studies found that access to quality care can be greatly expanded by increasing the use of RNs and APRNs in primary, chronic, and transitional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154412472710">Craven &amp; Ober, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527154412472710">Safreit, 2011</xref>). APRNs have been used in EDs since the 1970s, with evidence that they provide high-quality, cost-effective care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527154412472710">Corker &amp; Kellepourey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, OPH has used only contracted physician coverage of the ED. This is not an unusual pattern for a rural hospital. A policy brief produced by the Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center identified approximately one third of rural hospitals using only contracted physician coverage, with one third using physician on staff and the other third using some combination of contracted physicians, staff physicians, and PAs (physician assistants) or APRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527154412472710">Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center, 2007</xref>). According to this report, PAs or APRNs account for approximately 13% of rural hospital ED staff. This does not include the situation where the PA or APRN works directly under a physician on the hospital staff.</p>
<p>In determining the appropriate role for APRNs, a central issue is the number of ED visits that fall within the APRN scope of services. According to national statistics, there were 128,885,040 ED visits in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154412472710">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2009</xref>). Only 15.2% of these visits resulted in admission to the hospital, with 2.8% of these patients dying in the hospital and only 0.2% dying in the ED. From these numbers, it is clear that the vast majority of ED visits are not immediately life-threatening. The data suggest that most ED visits will fall within an APRN’s scope of practice. ED statistics for rural areas exhibit a similar pattern. In Nebraska 13.5% of ED visits were admitted to the hospital, Iowa’s hospital admissions dropped to 11.8%, and Minnesota reported 14.7% hospital admissions. Death rates for the three states for those admitted to the hospital via ED were 2.8% (New England), 2.6% (Iowa), and 2.1% (Minnesota). Deaths vin the ED were only 0.2% in Iowa, 0.1% in Minnesota, and 0.2% New England.</p>
<p>With the evidence of effective, high-quality care delivered by APRNs, the management team at OPH could consider their enhanced use in the ED. An important criterion for moving from contracted physician services to APRNs is the potential for significant cost savings for the hospital. Staffing the ED with an APRN would immediately save the hospital approximately US$300,000 per year relative to the existing circumstances. This would occur because the cost of the three salaried APRNs, including benefits, would total approximately 400,000 whereas the cost of contracted physicians has averaged US$800,000 per year. There would still be circumstances where a physician is called to the ED, but the rarity of this will allow a substantial decrease in physician payments. Using information from the past 2 years a physician would have been required less than 5% of the time. The second major savings arises because the ED is already staffed by an RN who would not be required with an APRN-staffed ED. On average, the existing ED RNs are paid US$70,000 per year. Benefits amount to another US$20,000 per RN. On average, 300 patients present to the ED monthly. Obviously, there are times when the APRN services are not immediately needed in the ED. This will allow the APRN to engage in other hospital activities, some of which may either increase existing revenue streams or create new ones. For example, the APRN could provide specialty clinics like diabetes management and school-based programs as well as other access and revenue enhancers like telehealth services.</p>
<p>The enhanced use of APRNs would improve the overall financial performance of the organization. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, the hospital saw a loss of US$459,000. Thus, the savings from the enhanced use of APRNs would have been sufficient to flip the year-end financials from a negative to a positive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1527154412472710">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>APRNs will play an increasingly important role in health care delivery. Think of the gains that would immediately accrue if we adopted a new mindset toward the appropriate use of APRNs. Imagine the impact of a national policy allowing all APRNs to practice to the full extent of their licensure—better access, higher-quality care, and all at a lower cost. The adoption of value-based medicine has already begun, and it is clear that the future reimbursement model will shift from piece-work CPT billing to a more targeted payment for effective treatment and outcomes. APRNs, with an emphasis on relationship-based care, are well positioned to coordinate efforts at reducing the financial and health impacts of high-cost chronic conditions. Health care in a cost-conscious environment will begin to look at supplemental sources of revenue through business-like activities such as school-based clinics. Changes in public policy, tax laws, and APRN independent practice and reimbursement models are needed to create powerful incentives to move health care toward a sustainable level of expenditures.</p>
<p>A Price Waterhouse Cooper report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527154412472710">Price Waterhouse Cooper, 2008</xref>) identifies half of all medical expenditures as waste; we could cut spending by more than US$1 trillion without any negative impact on outcomes. These wastes exist because they are institutionalized; each dollar of waste is income for someone in health care. The 2009 Economic Report of the President pegs the wasteful spending at 30%—about 800 billion dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154412472710">Council of Economic Advisors, 2009</xref>). Regardless of whether the waste is US$1 trillion or 800 billion, there is considerable room for improvement without adversely impacting quality of care. The 30% to 50% of wasted expenditures provides room for improvement through enlightened policy. Allowing APRNs to practice to the full extent of their licensure would directly improve the use of scarce resources.</p>
