<abstract>
<p>This study examines the roles of psychological capital (PsyCap) in job performance and quality of work life (QWL) of marketers in a transitioning market, Vietnam. It also investigates the impacts of marketers’ QWL on their job performance and quality of life (QoL). A test based upon a sample of 364 marketers in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City reveals that PsyCap has positive impacts on both job performance and QWL of marketers. In addition, QWL underlies both job performance and QoL of marketers. These findings confirm the importance of PsyCap in marketers’ work and lives in a transitioning market.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>People play a key role in economic productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711422065">Gavin and Mason 2004</xref>) and the “flat world” competition has allowed or forced people around the world to cooperate and to compete with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711422065">Friedman 2007</xref>). Such a new business environment requires firms to have a new approach to human resource management in order to survive and to create sustainable growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>). Regarding people in the workplace, there are two areas, among others, that have received much attention by researchers in the last few years. The first is the positive organizational behavior and its derivative psychological capital, which is defined as an individual’s psychological state of development (PsyCap; Luthans et al. 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>). The second is quality of work life (QWL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711422065">Sirgy 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146711422065">Wright and Cropanzano 2004</xref>) and the relationship between work and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711422065">Harrington and Ladge 2009</xref>). Research shows that there is a relationship between PsyCap and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>), and a relationship between QWL and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711422065">Koonmee et al. 2010</xref>). However, little empirical evidence exists on the nature of or relationships among PsyCap, QWL and quality of life (QoL), especially in transitioning markets. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid to the role of PsyCap in QWL and QoL of marketers in transitioning markets such as Vietnam. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the roles of PsyCap in job performance and QWL, and subsequently, in QoL of marketers in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Vietnam provides a good case for the study of PsyCap and QWL of marketers. In 1986, the Vietnamese government initiated a new economic reform program, aiming to transform from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented economy under socialist guidance. Under the centrally planned system, business activities of Vietnamese firms focused primarily on production. These firms lacked knowledge about market economics and marketing management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146711422065">Nguyen and Nguyen 2010</xref>). The movement toward a market economy, together with entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO), has forced Vietnamese firms to change business practices. Instead of focusing on production and relying primarily on the government planning system for distribution and other functions typically associated with marketing management, firms now are required to make products, to develop brands, and to find markets for their products/brands. They are also required to produce higher quality and more competitive brands and are required to effectively market their brands to compete successfully with international brands in their home markets, and, when possible, in export markets. In so doing, they are confronted with several difficulties, one of which is a shortage of qualified marketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711422065">Nguyen and Nguyen 2011</xref>). Thus, research in the area will assist firms in understanding the role of PsyCap in QWL of marketers in order to stimulate them to effectively and efficiently work for firms, which in turn may enhance worker well-being and Vietnam’s socioeconomic development. Below, the authors provide a literature review and hypotheses; articulate the research method, data analysis, and results; offer a discussion and implications; and conclude with limitations and directions for future research.</p>

<title>QoL and QWL</title>
<p>Employees’ work–life integration is a critical issue for several organizations because it is associated with employees’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711422065">Harrington and Ladge 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711422065">Gavin and Mason (2004)</xref> observe that work is an important source of the QoL for people and that people’s general happiness in life is closely related to their happiness at work. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence for this relationship in Vietnam. In this study, the authors propose a positive relationship between marketers’ QWL and QoL.</p>
<p>QWL is about the well-being of employees (Sirgy et al. 2001) and there are several different definitions of QWL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711422065">Martel and Dupuis 2006</xref>). In the context of this study, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711422065">Sirgy et al. (2001)</xref>, the authors define QWL as marketers’ satisfaction with a set of human needs when participating in the workplace. The set of human needs includes health and safety needs, economic and family needs, social needs, esteem needs, actualization needs, knowledge needs and aesthetics needs.</p>
<p>Similar to QWL, QoL is complex and the concept has been measured in a variety of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146711422065">Lee et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711422065">Vaez, Kristenson, and Laflamme 2004</xref>). It can be defined as the overall satisfaction with life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711422065">Vaez, Kristenson, and Laflamme 2004</xref>). Based on the satisfaction approach to QoL, there is a link between job satisfaction and life satisfaction because life satisfaction is influenced by satisfaction with life domains, including work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711422065">Sirgy 2006</xref>). Thus, QoL is affected by QWL. In addition, QWL is important for firms because it relates to employee performance productivity and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711422065">Korunka, Hoonakker, and Carayon 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711422065">Rego and Cunha 2008</xref>). To reiterate, marketers’ QWL is expected to have a positive impact on their performance. Therefore, the authors propose the following hypotheses:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> QWL has a positive impact on QoL.</p>

<title>Psychological Capital</title>
<p>Concern about trait-like personality and state-like psychological capacities of employees has received little attention by organizational behavior researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2005</xref>). Trait-like personality is not specific to any task or situation and tends to be stable over time, whereas state-like psychological capacities are more specific to certain situations or tasks and tend to be more malleable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711422065">Chen et al. 2000</xref>). Several related concepts that describe state-like psychological capacities of employees can be found in the literature on positive organizational behavior such as psychological ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711422065">Avey et al. 2009</xref>), PsyCap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>). This study focuses on PsyCap of marketers.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711422065">Luthans, Youssef, and Avolio (2007)</xref> propose four components of PsyCap: self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resiliency. They define PsyCap as:<disp-quote>
<p>an individual’s positive psychological state of development that is characterized by: (1) having confidence (self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now and in the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary, redirecting paths to goals (hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity, sustaining and bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency) to attain success. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711422065">Luthans, Youssef, and Avolio 2007</xref>, 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. (2008)</xref> note that PsyCap has both conceptual and empirical support.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy refers to “people judgments about their capability to perform particular tasks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711422065">Parker 1998</xref>, 835). Applied to the marketing professional level, self-efficacy helps marketers to be confident about their knowledge and skills in performing their assigned marketing tasks. Optimism is broadly defined as “the tendency to maintain a positive outlook” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146711422065">Schneider 2001</xref>, 253). Positive organizational behavior focuses on realistic optimism, which “involves enhancing and focusing on the favorable aspects of our experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146711422065">Schneider 2001</xref>, 253). Applied to the marketing professional, optimistic marketers are characterized by having positive expectations of outcomes in a changing work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>). Hope reflects “the belief that one can find pathways to desired goals and become motivated to use those pathways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711422065">Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2002</xref>, 257). Hope comprises two dimensions: pathways (way power) and agency (will power). Pathways refer to one’s capability of generating workable routes to the desired goal and agency relates to one’s perceived capacity to use the pathways to reach the desired goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711422065">Snyder et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711422065">Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2002</xref>). Applying hope to the marketing professional level in a firm, pathways facilitate marketers to recognize the goals set by the firm and to translate those goals into their own actions to achieve the goals. Agency assists marketers in controlling their actions to achieve the desired goals and especially, in applying the requisite motivation to the best alternative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711422065">Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2002</xref>). Finally, resiliency refers to “positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711422065">Masten and Reed 2002</xref>, 75). Applying resiliency to the marketing professional, resiliency can be characterized by coping responses to both adverse and extreme positive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146711422065">Luthans 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research shows that these four components (self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resiliency) of PsyCap have positive relationships with performance, happiness, well-being, and satisfaction of workers. For example, self-efficacy has been found to have a positive impact on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711422065">Stajkovic and Luthans 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711422065">Legal and Meyer 2009</xref>). Employees’ optimism is related to their performance, satisfaction, and happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711422065">Youssef and Luthans 2007</xref>). Hope is related to employees’ performance, satisfaction, happiness, and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711422065">Youssef and Luthans 2007</xref>). Resiliency has a positive relationship with employee performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2005</xref>) and happiness and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711422065">Youssef and Luthans 2007</xref>). In sum, self-efficacy, optimism, hope and resiliency are related to the performance and QWL of employees.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711422065">Luthans, Youssef, and Avolio (2007)</xref> found that PsyCap overall is a better predictor of employee performance than are its individual components. For that reason, in this study, the authors focus on the predictive power of overall PsyCap rather than its individual components. And, the authors propose that overall PsyCap will have positive impacts on both QWL and performance of marketers. Thus,<list list-type="simple">

<title>Design and Sample</title>
<p>Two phases comprised the research, a pilot and a main survey, and was undertaken in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City, the principal business center of Vietnam. Respondents were marketers working for firms in HCM City. The pilot study consisted of two steps: qualitative and quantitative. First, the authors conducted a series of in-depth interviews with eighteen marketers in HCM City to modify the measures by examining how consumers described their PsyCap and QWL. Although most of the measures of constructs were available in the literature, this step is important to make them appropriate for the context of this study (a transitioning market). The quantitative pilot study was undertaken by face-to-face interviews with 125 marketers to refine the scales. Cronbach’s alpha reliability and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to preliminarily assess the scales. The main survey was also undertaken by using face-to-face interviews. A convenience sample of 364 marketers working for various types of firms in HCM City was interviewed in this survey. The purpose of this main survey was to validate the measures and to test the structural model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was utilized to assess the measures and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to test the theoretical model and hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0276146711422065">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>Constructs examined included PsyCap, QWL, and job performance. QoL, PsyCap, and QWL were second-order constructs and job performance and QoL were first-order constructs. PsyCap was comprised of four components: hope, optimism, resiliency, and self-efficacy. Hope was measured by 4 items borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711422065">Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon (2002)</xref>. Note that hope used in this study is state hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711422065">Snyder, Rand, and Sigmon 2002</xref>). Optimism was measured by 3 items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711422065">Carver and Scheier (2002)</xref>. Resiliency was measured by 4 items, adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711422065">Block and Kremen (1996)</xref>. Self-efficacy was measured by 4 items, borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711422065">Parker (1998)</xref>. QWL was measured by 9 items addressing need satisfaction of marketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711422065">Sirgy et al. 2001</xref>). Job performance was measured based on marketers’ self-assessment. Although self-assessment has been criticized for being less accurate compared to objective criterion measures, it is valuable when anonymity is guaranteed and/or individuals perceive no need to present themselves favorably for career, performance appraisal, and/social acceptance purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146711422065">van der Heijden and Nijhof 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711422065">Rego and Cunha 2008</xref>) as in the case of this study. The scale included 4 items, adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711422065">Staples, Hulland, and Higgins (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711422065">Rego and Cunha (2008)</xref>. Finally, QoL was measured by 3 items, adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711422065">Peterson, Ekici, and Hunt (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Seven-point Likert-type scale, anchored by 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) and 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) was used for all items in this study. The questionnaire was initially prepared in English and then translated into Vietnamese by an academic fluent in both languages. This procedure was undertaken because English is not well understood by all marketers in Vietnam. Back translation was undertaken to ensure the equivalence of meanings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0276146711422065">
<title>Measurement Refinement</title>
<p>The measures were refined via Cronbach’s alpha reliability and EFA, using the data collected from 125 marketers in the pilot study. Specifically, EFA (principal components with varimax rotation) extracted four factors from the items measuring PsyCap with 66.38 percent of variance extracted: self-efficacy (Eigenvalue = 4.38); optimism (Eigenvalue = 1.62); resiliency (Eigenvalue = 1.34); and hope (Eigenvalue = 1.18). The Cronbach’s alphas for these scales were .66 (hope), .72 (optimism), .68 (resiliency), and .87 (self-efficacy). Note that 1 item measuring optimism (<italic>I’m always optimistic about my future</italic>) and 1 item measuring hope (<italic>At this time, I am meeting the goals that I have set for myself</italic>) were deleted due to their low item-total correlations (&lt;.30) in the reliability analysis.</p>
<p>EFA extracted three factors from 9 items measuring QWL with 70.44 percent of variance extracted. The first factor (eigenvalue = 4.04) covered items measuring marketer’s satisfaction with health and pay, termed survival needs. The second factor (eigenvalue = 1.27) included items measuring marketer’s satisfaction with social and esteem needs, termed belonging needs, and the third factor (eigenvalue = 1.03) comprised items measuring marketer’s satisfaction with actualization, knowledge, and aesthetics needs, termed knowledge needs. The Cronbach’s alpha scores for these scales were .75 (survival needs), .70 (belonging needs), and .84 (knowledge needs). Finally, for the items measuring the two first-order constructs, EFA attracted two factors with 71.31 percent variance extracted: job performance (eigenvalue = 3.38) and QoL (eigen-value = 1.82). The Cronbach’s alpha for job performance was .86; for QoL it was .85. In addition, all factor loadings were high (≥.50). In sum, the results of the preliminary assessment indicated that all scales satisfied the requirement for reliability. Accordingly, these measures were used in the main survey.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>The sample included 167 (45.9%) male and 197 (54.1%) female marketers. There were 181 (49.7%) marketers working in the service industry and 183 (50.3%) working in the manufacturing industry. In terms of firm ownership, 46 (12.6%) marketers worked for state-owned companies, 165 (45.3%) worked for joint-stock companies, 15(4.1%) worked for joint-venture companies, 96 (26.4%) worked for limited proprietary companies, and 42 (11.6%) worked for private firms. In terms of firm size, 148 (40.6%) marketers worked for firms that had less than or equal to 100 employees, 85 (23.4%) worked for firms that had 100 to 300 employees, and 131 (36.0%) worked for firms that had more than 300 employees.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>As discussed previously, CFA was used to validate the scales, and then SEM followed to test the theoretical model and hypotheses. The screening process shows that the data exhibited slight deviations from normal. Nonetheless, most of the univariate kurtoses and skewnesses were within the range of [−1, 1]. Therefore, maximum likelihood estimation was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711422065">Muthen and Kaplan 1985</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-0276146711422065">
<title>Measurement Validation</title>
<p>Four constructs were investigated: PsyCap, QWL, job performance, and QoL. The scales measuring these constructs were refined via Cronbach’s alpha and EFA using the data set (<italic>n</italic> = 125) collected in the pilot study. These scales were then assessed via CFA using the data set (<italic>n</italic> = 364) collected in the main survey. The authors used two steps in validating measures. First, the authors used two CFA models to assess the two second-order constructs: PsyCap and QWL. We then incorporated the two first-order constructs (job performance and QoL) into the first two CFA models to form a saturated model (final measurement model).</p>

<sec id="section13-0276146711422065">
<title>Psychological Capital</title>
<p>PsyCap was comprised of four components: hope, optimism, resiliency, and, self-efficacy. The CFA results indicate that the measurement model of PsyCap received an acceptable fit to the data: χ<sup>2</sup>(62) = 166.28 (<italic>p</italic> = .000); Goodness-of-fit Index (GFI) = .936; CFI = .935; and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .068.

<title>Saturated Model</title>
<p>The saturated model (final measurement model) was formed by incorporating the CFA model of the two first-order constructs (job performance and QoL) into the two CFA models of the two second-order constructs (PsyCap and QWL). Because the measures of the components of PsyCap and QWL were unidimensional, summates were used to test the structural models. The use of summates helps decrease the number of free parameters considerably, which makes the estimation more reliable without increasing the sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711422065">Bagozzi and Edwards 1998</xref>). Consequently, four summates (indicators) were formed for PsyCap (hope, optimism, resiliency, and self-efficacy), and three summates were formed for QWL (survival needs, belonging needs, and knowledge needs).</p>
<p>The final CFA model received an acceptable fit to the data: χ<sup>2</sup>(71) = 167.41 (<italic>p</italic> = .000); GFI = .938; CFI = .957; and RMSEA = .061. The factor loadings of all items measuring the two first-order constructs (job performance and QoL) were high (≥ .61) and significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). These findings indicate that the scales measuring these two first-order constructs used in this study were unidimensional and the within-method convergent validity was achieved. The correlations between constructs, together with their standard errors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0276146711422065">Table 2</xref>
), indicate that they were significantly different from unity, thus supporting the construct discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711422065">Steenkamp and van Trijp 1991</xref>).

<title>Hypothesis Testing</title>
<p>Consistent with Hypothesis 1, a positive relationship between QWL and QoL was found (β =.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Hypothesis 2 proposes a positive relationship between QWL and job performance. The estimated structural path between QWL and job performance was significant (β =.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), thus Hypothesis 2 was supported. Finally, Hypotheses 3 and 4 propose that PsyCap has positive impacts on both QWL and job performance. The results reveal that these two hypotheses also received support from the data (Hypothesis 3: γ = .67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and Hypothesis 4: γ = .47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711422065">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Realizing the role of PsyCap in the QWL and QoL for marketers, this study examines the impacts of PsyCap on both QWL and job performance, and subsequently, on QoL of marketers in a transitioning market, Vietnam. The results of this study offer a number of implications for theory and practice.</p>
<p>First, QWL has positive impacts on both QoL and job performance of marketers. These findings confirm the benefit of work–life integration, which is one of the most important business issues in the twenty-first century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711422065">Harrington and Ladge 2009</xref>) in a transitioning market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711422065">Gavin and Mason (2004</xref>, 381) argue:<disp-quote>
<p>[w]hen a workplace is designed and managed to create meaning for its workers they tend to be more healthy and happy. Healthy and happy employees tend to be more productive over the long run, generating better goods and more fulfilling services for their customers and the others with whom they interact and do business.</p>
</disp-quote>Firms establishing an appropriate human resources management system that enhances QWL for marketers will benefit from their performance. In so doing, firms not only attend to pay and promotions but also create a working environment that enhance marketers’ satisfaction with their needs, including survival, belonging and knowledge needs, as found in this study. Improving QWL for marketers will also make their lives more meaningful and thus may be a motive for qualified marketers to continue working for the firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711422065">Rego and Cunha 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, the results show that PsyCap underlies QWL and job performance of marketers. The findings of this study signal firms to recruit, develop, and manage marketers who are generally higher in PsyCap. Research shows that PsyCap is a more state-like factor than personality traits, that is, it is more open to be developed and managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711422065">Luthans et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, recruiting marketers with high levels of PsyCap and establishing appropriate human resource policies and practice to further develop marketers’ PsyCap (i.e., self-efficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience) are desirable for Vietnamese firms. And, in so doing, Vietnamese firms could enhance the performance of their marketers, leading to an increase in firm performance. This also improves marketers’ QWL, which is a critical factor for productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146711422065">Wright and Cropanzano 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, research has explored the role of marketing in the well-being or QoL of consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146711422065">Peterson and Ekici 2007</xref>) and of nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711422065">Pan, Zinkhan, and Sheng 2007</xref>). However, little attention has been paid to the QoL of marketers, who contribute in part to the QoL of consumers and nations at large. An indirect relationship between PsyCap and QoL of marketers found in this study indicates that PsyCap also plays an indirect role in improving QoL of marketers. Therefore, employing marketers with higher levels of PsyCap will not only benefit firms but also play a part in enhancing the well-being of nations.</p>

<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. First, the model was tested with a convenience sample of marketers working for companies in HCM City, Vietnam. The model should be tested with marketers in other cities and provinces in Vietnam, such as Can Tho, Da Nang, and Hanoi with a probability sample to enhance the generalizability of the results. In addition, the model needs further replication, extension, and critical evaluation in other transitioning markets, such as China, to provide useful insights. Second, the model only examined the roles of human resources at the marketing professional level. Testing the model with other business functions within firms, such as accounting, finance, and so on, will enhance our understanding of the relationships between PsyCap, QWL, and QoL of employees. This is another direction for future research. Finally, the authors focus on the state-like components of psychological factors of people, that is, PsyCap of marketers. Incorporating trait-like components such as psychological hardiness, personality of marketers will provide further insights into the role of psychological aspects of people in their work and lives. This is also an appropriate area for future research.</p>
