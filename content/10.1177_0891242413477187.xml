<abstract>
<p>In recent years, local officials throughout the United States have attempted to retool workforce development programs that have historically been tied to federal antipoverty efforts to address the needs of employers in industries considered important for local economic development. But are these old and new goals for workforce development reconcilable? Does a more employer- and industry-focused approach affects the ability of policymakers and practitioners to address the problems of low-wage labor markets? This article examines a recent initiative in Chicago to establish sector-based workforce centers in the manufacturing and service industries. This case study finds that efforts to “rework” the public workforce development system to meet the needs of employers can be at odds with efforts to meet the needs of disadvantaged populations. But greater proximity to employers can also enhance the system’s capacity to promote more progressive human resource practices and equitable labor market outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction: Growth, Equity, and Urban Workforce Development</title>
<p>Elected officials, planners, and policymakers in U.S. cities are continually faced with the twin challenges of promoting economic growth and vitality on the one hand while ensuring broad-based access to well-paying jobs and career opportunities on the other. Although central cities have experienced a marked renaissance in the past two decades, mayors and other local officials continue to seek out new resources—and redeploy existing ones—to help them incent the creation of new jobs, retain and revitalize businesses and industries, and prepare their workforce for current and future skill needs. Indeed, the Great Recession renewed the debate about how cities can refuel the nation’s economy while at the same time addressing the disturbing problem of long-term unemployment. But the challenges are regional in scope. Poverty is increasingly a suburban phenomenon, whereas firms and industries that drive regional economic fortunes operate within the context of local labor markets that do not adhere to political boundaries.</p>
<p>Workforce development systems sit at the heart of this challenge. Employment and job training programs that have historically served as a central front on the federal War on Poverty, helping disadvantaged populations improve their options and opportunities in the labor market, are being retooled to address the ongoing challenges of urban economic development. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242413477187">Giloth (2000)</xref> notes, the term “workforce development” emerged in the 1990s in an effort to integrate the fields of employment and job training, regional economic development, welfare reform, and community development (p. 342). This has resulted in an ongoing process of experimentation with new models and approaches to workforce development practice, in which shifting alliances of public officials, community-based organizations, educators, business and industry groups, foundations, and in some places, organized labor, come together to test new approaches that, at times, push the limits of existing programmatic models.</p>
<p>This article discusses one such experiment from this past decade in Chicago, a city that has for decades been a center of innovation in connecting workforce and economic development practice. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chicago’s experience of industrial restructuring and community organizing gave rise to a vibrant community economic development movement that culminated in the administration of Mayor Harold Washington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242413477187">Clavel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242413477187">Clavel &amp; Wiewel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242413477187">Giloth &amp; Moe, 1999</xref>), who sought new ways to use existing federal workforce programs to support industrial revitalization as well as more equitable growth. In the 1990s, as the city struggled to reconcile its industrial past with its global future, an innovative network of community-based organizations, researchers, and funders emerged to pioneer new approaches, such as sector- and intermediary-based models for connecting industrial retention, community economic development, and workforce training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242413477187">Fitzgerald &amp; Leigh, 2002</xref>). By the 2000s, this spirit of innovation had worked its way back into city hall, where in 2005 local officials developed a novel strategy to reorganize the city’s federally funded workforce development infrastructure to more effectively support the vitality and competitiveness of two of the city’s industry sectors—manufacturing and hospitality. Chicago’s initiative to create Sectoral Workforce Centers, or “Sector Centers,” represents an important example of local innovation in workforce development, in part because it is paradigmatic of the longer-term evolution that those systems have undergone.</p>
<p>But how well do these “new” workforce development goals of promoting economic development and business success fit with the system’s “old” goals of social equity and poverty reduction? Are these goals at odds with one another? Or can they be reconciled? In particular, how do efforts to rework the workforce development system to get closer to the needs of employers affect the capacity of policymakers and practitioners to affect progressive, systemic changes in the operation of low-wage labor markets?</p>
<p>The case study that follows uses primary and secondary data collected through a program evaluation project that was conducted between September 2007 and February 2009 by the University of Illinois-Chicago Center for Urban Economic Development for the Chicago Workforce Board (CWB), with funding support from the Joyce Foundation. This project yielded three types of data used here. First, semistructured interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 87) were conducted with individuals and organizations involved with the Sector Center initiative. These included city-level officials overseeing the initiative, staff of the contractors operating the two centers, subcontractors and other industry or community partners, and a representative sample of 38 businesses receiving services from the centers. The second source is administrative data and documents produced by the two Sector Center operators and the city agency overseeing them. These include data on employers served, the types of services rendered (e.g., job orders), and individual jobseekers placed into employment. This also includes summary reports produced by the operators and programmatic documents (e.g., contracts) made available by agency staff. Finally, information was gathered through attendance by the author at public meetings of the CWB’s Sector Planning Committee from late 2007 through early 2009.</p>
<p>The rest of the article follows in three sections. The first briefly reviews the recent history of workforce development policy and practice in the United States and emphasizes how the field has evolved in the past quarter century in response to challenges in meeting its historical goals of poverty reduction and individual advancement, and new goals of local economic prosperity through the development of new models such as sector-based workforce development. The second section presents an extensive case study of Chicago’s Sectoral Workforce Center initiative, discussing the initiative’s inception, goals, implementation, and impacts. The article concludes by reflecting on the broader lessons of the Sector Center initiative for both scholars and practitioners of urban economic and workforce development, in particular for the capacity of local workforce development systems to support more equitable modes of urban growth.</p>

<title>Old Goals, New Goals, and Changing Models of Workforce Development Practice</title>
<p>Workforce development refers to the system of programs, policies, and institutions that help labor market actors—that is, workers and employers—connect to one another and make investments in workforce skills and human capital toward the goals of household economic self-sufficiency, business success, and place prosperity. Although a substantial amount of workforce development activity occurs within organizations (e.g., on-the-job training functions) and through market-based relationships, public policy has played an important role over the years. Dating back to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, the federal government took the lead in helping dislocated and unemployed workers find jobs and employment through publicly sponsored job banks known as the Employment Service, which have mirrored the market trend in recent years toward self-service and online job matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242413477187">Eberts &amp; Holzer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891242413477187">Ridley &amp; Tracy, 2004</xref>). Although the first comprehensive federal effort in the area of job training—the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962—was primarily concerned with mitigating the effects of dislocation resulting from industrial automation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242413477187">Barnow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891242413477187">Kremen, 1974</xref>), programmatic efforts turned in the 1960s toward the problem of inner-city poverty. Federal initiatives such as Job Corps, which provided intensive occupational skills training to disadvantaged youth, and Model Cities, which combined job training with urban renewal and comprehensive community planning efforts, formed central elements in the Johnson Administration’s War on Poverty in the 1960s. The shift toward “New Federalism” since the 1970s has resulted in significant devolution of workforce programs to the state and local levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242413477187">Barnow, 1993</xref>), beginning with the 1973 federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which established local governance of employment and training programs, continuing through the 1982 federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) and, most recently, the 1998 federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Even as governance of workforce programs has progressively shifted toward the local level, funding continues to flow primarily from the federal level.</p>
<p>Two factors have been instrumental in driving changes in workforce development policy and practice in the United States over the past quarter century. The first has been an ongoing pursuit of “best practice” models of workforce development that more effectively achieve the system’s traditional goals of reducing poverty and increased earnings for low-income workers. This search intensified in the late 1980s and early 1990s when large-scale evaluation evidence from the federal JTPA program found that occupational job training programs provided only modest earnings gains for most disadvantaged populations, and for some groups, none at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242413477187">Orr et al., 1996</xref>). Although some have attributed these disappointing outcomes to the small scale of training interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891242413477187">Grubb, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242413477187">Holzer, 2008</xref>), or the structural erosion of working-class earnings power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242413477187">Lafer, 2002</xref>), many pointed to the need to build on established, successful models for preparing and connecting jobseekers to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242413477187">Blair, 2002</xref>). The success of the San Jose-based Center for Employment Training model was widely studied and replicated, emphasizing Center for Employment Training’s blending of basic and occupational skills training, but more important, its adoption of a “dual customer” or “intermediary” approach that balanced strong ties with jobseekers with a close attention to the needs and direct involvement of employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242413477187">Melendez &amp; Harrison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891242413477187">U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Chief Economist, 1995</xref>). Although some funders and practitioners argued that generating robust and sustained earnings growth required deeper, targeted connections between communities of need, education and training programs, and employers and industry partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242413477187">Giloth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242413477187">Poppe, Strawn, &amp; Martinson, 2004</xref>), federal policy went in the opposite direction in the 1990s. Inspired by “work first” welfare-to-work programs that prioritized work attachment over skills training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242413477187">Brown, 1997</xref>), the federal WIA of 1998 created “One Stop” workforce centers to connect jobseekers and employers, shifted the emphasis of service delivery toward job matching, and instituted a voucher-based, “customer-driven” system for job training to replace the Job Training Partnership Act’s system of local contracts with training vendors. Although evaluations of WIA programs have shown somewhat better impacts on earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242413477187">Hollenbeck, Schroeder, King, &amp; Huang, 2005</xref>), there is an ongoing concern for how public workforce development programs can more effectively accomplish their core objective of promoting economic advancement of disadvantaged populations.</p>
<p>The other driver has been the redirection of workforce development programs toward new goals—in particular, toward employers and economic development goals. This trend reflects both a growing recognition of the connection between human capital and economic development outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242413477187">Clarke &amp; Gaile, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891242413477187">Mathur, 1999</xref>) and also the impact of corporate restructuring on the skill formation systems within firms and industries overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242413477187">Cappelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891242413477187">Salzman, 1998</xref>). Paradoxically, employers’ need for a skilled, adaptable workforce has increased, while their incentives to provide for it through internal skills development activities, both formal and informal, have eroded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242413477187">Cappelli, 2008</xref>). In the 1980s, many states initiated or expanded programs for Incumbent Worker Training, which provided subsidies to partnerships between private employers and training organizations—usually community and technical colleges—to underwrite workplace-oriented training activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242413477187">Duchsa &amp; Graves, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242413477187">Osterman &amp; Batt, 1993</xref>), particularly for businesses in export-oriented sectors like manufacturing and as part of a broader package of state and local economic development incentives. WIA further expanded the role of businesses as customers in the workforce development system by granting state and local authorities more flexibility to develop services targeted at employers, such as workshops, job fairs, customized assessment and job analysis, and incumbent worker training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242413477187">Dunham, Salzman, &amp; Koller, 2004</xref>). Although a number of states and localities since the 1980s have merged their agencies administering economic and workforce development programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242413477187">Agia, Anderson, Cheney, &amp; Troppe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242413477187">MacManus, 1986</xref>), local partnerships linking the two fields have been highly variable in nature, featuring differential mixes of private sector actors such as industry trade associations and chambers of commerce, public sector agency and elected officials, and community-based and nonprofit organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242413477187">Berry, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242413477187">Eberts &amp; Erickcek, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Sectoral models of workforce development connect both of these trends. Although vocational job training programs had long targeted particular industries or occupations and developed training curricula based on employer input and credentials, sectoral models were designed with the more ambitious goal of “becoming a valued actor” to an industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242413477187">Clark &amp; Dawson, 1995</xref>, p. 7) by developing deep and systemic relationships among employers, education and training institutions, unions, community organizations, and other relevant institutions. Interest in sectoral workforce approaches dovetailed in the 1990s with the explosion of industry cluster approaches to economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242413477187">Cortright, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242413477187">Porter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891242413477187">Rosenfeld, 1997</xref>), which sought to foster cooperative relationships among employers toward the establishment and strengthening of collective, place-based institutions to support competitive advantage, from innovation systems to workforce training. Although advocates for sectoral strategies frame the approach primarily in terms of benefiting low-income workers rather than supporting local and regional economic development outcomes broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242413477187">Conway, Blair, Dawson, &amp; Dworak-Munoz, 2007</xref>), sector strategies have become an important basis for connecting economic development and workforce development actors and institutions at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242413477187">Harper-Anderson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>But does this new focus on employers and economic development enhance, or instead limit, the capacity of the public workforce development system to pursue its “legacy” goals of helping disadvantaged workers? Are these goals reconcilable? Do the models of workforce development that attempt to bridge these goals, such as sectoral models, provide a way for achieving old goals in new ways?</p>
<p>I argue that the adoption of sector-based approaches into public workforce development systems actually implies a more effective route for local officials to intervene in low-wage labor markets. Through deep, long-term engagement with employers in a particular industry, workforce development practitioners can develop the knowledge and capabilities to shape the labor market dynamics of those industries. Case studies of sectoral workforce initiatives have shown that they are capable of affecting which groups of workers employers hire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242413477187">Lowe, 2007</xref>), inducing changes to work organization in response to skill shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242413477187">Glasmeier, Nelson, &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242413477187">Lautsch &amp; Osterman, 1998</xref>), and helping rebuild systems of internal and external career advancement within industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242413477187">Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>). In doing so, they swim against the tide of federal workforce development policy, which reflects a “market meeting” character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242413477187">Benner, Leete, &amp; Pastor, 2007</xref>) in which identifying the skill needs of employers and the broader labor market is considered the central objective.</p>
<p>In the following section, this article examines these issues through a case study of the City of Chicago’s Sectoral Workforce Center initiative. It begins with an examination of the initiative’s background and the goals that it was intended to accomplish. From there, it describes the background and activities of the two Sector Centers and analyzes whether they were able to reconcile the needs of employers and disadvantaged populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0891242413477187">
<title>Chicago’s Sectoral Workforce Center Initiative</title>
<p>In 2005, the CWB and the City of Chicago Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development (MOWD), which administered WIA programs in the city, experimented with a new approach to the delivery of workforce development services. To complement their network (called WorkNet Chicago) of comprehensive, One Stop workforce centers, which provide job search and matching assistance to all types of workers and employers, and more than 20 community-based organizations that work with specific workforce populations (e.g., ex-offenders, youth), CWB and MOWD established two industry sector-focused workforce centers—one in manufacturing and the other in low-wage services (hotels, restaurants, and retail). Funding for the two Sectoral Workforce Centers, which totaled $1.6 million in Program Year 2006, came primarily by redirecting approximately 6% of MOWD’s budget for WIA adult services away from One Stops and community affiliates for “core” job search and “intensive” case management services, which was achieved by eliminating one of the city’s One Stops and consolidating affiliate funding. A smaller share, roughly 15% of the budget, came from city general fund sources.</p>
<p>Two aspects of Chicago’s approach were novel within the workforce development field. The first was its integration of the Sectoral Workforce model directly into the city’s federally funded WIA service delivery infrastructure. Although many local workforce boards, including Chicago, were using a sectoral approach to inform and target their training programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242413477187">Harper-Anderson, 2008</xref>), hardly any had taken funds earmarked for core and intensive services and redirected them toward a sector-specific service delivery infrastructure. Sectoral initiatives were typically smaller in scale, operating with a mix of public and foundation funding, and often less directly associated with the WIA service delivery system. To the extent that WIA funds were supporting sectoral initiatives, it was typically through statewide discretionary funds. Through the Sector Centers, city officials hoped to infuse the WorkNet Chicago system with a greater orientation toward the needs of industries and occupations that it considered strategically important.</p>
<p>The second notable design feature of the Sector Centers was their connection to employers. In contrast with the One Stops and community affiliates, which were intended to have a “dual” customer (employer and jobseeker) orientation, the Sector Centers were designed with employers as their primary customer. The primary task of the centers was to provide employers in their targeted industry sector with recruitment assistance, training resources, labor market information, and other types of value-added services. Although they would screen and refer jobseekers on behalf of employer customers, they would not work as intensively with jobseekers or maintain their own pool of WIA-registered jobseekers. In theory, this would allow the Sector Centers to better serve the employers by letting them identify the best candidates for a job, not just the candidates that it was responsible for getting placed.</p>
<sec id="section4-0891242413477187">
<title>Goals</title>
<p>Chicago’s workforce development officials articulated multiple goals for the Sector Center initiative. The first was to more effectively serve the needs of employers within industries considered strategically important to the local economy. In the early 2000s, the CWB identified six industry sectors—Manufacturing; Finance and Insurance; Health Care; Information Technology; Transportation, Distribution, and Logistics (TDL); and Hospitality—as important drivers of the Chicago economy. In conjunction with other workforce boards in the Chicago metropolitan region, the CWB convened a series of workforce “summits” for each sector to bring together officials from industry, labor, education and training, and government to discuss important issues facing the industry, and the role that public workforce development systems could play in addressing those issues. A consistent theme that emerged from those summits was that the existing WIA-based workforce development system could be better organized to meet the needs of those industries. In several industries, especially manufacturing and health care, persistent shortages of semiskilled workers led local officials to look for new ways to augment and align existing workforce training resources with employer demand.</p>
<p>A second goal was to promote more integrated service delivery within the WorkNet Chicago system. Like many large cities, Chicago’s WIA-funded workforce development infrastructure was composed of a wide array of public, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations that competed with one another for contracts to provide services to particular populations and/or particular neighborhoods. Although the shift to comprehensive One Stops in the 1990s resulted in significant consolidation of the service delivery system, Chicago maintained a greater role for community-based organizations as providers of frontline job search and readiness assistance under WIA than most U.S. cities. However, because of WIA’s heavy emphasis on performance metrics—which helped local officials to determine those organizations that would receive contracts from year to year—cooperation among providers was minimal. This was especially true with respect to employers; WIA providers closely guarded their employer contacts to maximize the likelihood of placing their jobseekers and achieving favorable job placement outcomes. Although this made sense for individual providers, it was less than optimal for the system as a whole. By generating sector-specific job leads that would be broadcast throughout the WorkNet system, the Sector Centers were intended to provide employers with access to a wider pool of jobseekers and, conversely, provide jobseekers with access to a wider array of job opportunities.</p>
<p>Finally, increased access to good jobs for low-income and disadvantaged jobseekers was a central goal of the Sector Center initiative. Nearly a decade after welfare reform and the passage of WIA in 1998, local workforce officials and policy advocates were convinced that the system’s “work first” orientation effectively relegated less-skilled jobseekers to “dead end” jobs without much prospect of upward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891242413477187">Jenkins, 1999</xref>). A central objective for these groups was to reassert the importance of occupational skills training linked to career “ladders” or “pathways”; however, access to good jobs and employers offering opportunities for skills development and self-sufficiency was a critical part of this equation. By bringing high-quality employers into the WorkNet system, the Sector Centers would complement the efforts of preemployment job training providers to build a pipeline of qualified candidates for entry-level job opportunities that offered such a career ladder. Responding to concerns on the part of local advocacy groups, MOWD included job quality standards in the contracts for the two Sector Center operators. They stipulated that each center was expected to target employers offering career opportunities providing a “self-sufficiency wage”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242413477187">1</xref></sup> and benefits, and career ladders and opportunities for advancement within the company and/or sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242413477187">2</xref></sup> If employers did not offer such job opportunities, the Sector Centers were supposed to work with employers to identify external career ladders to self-sufficiency. Although the language was relatively broad, the inclusion of job quality standards was an important indicator of the intention of local officials to use the Sector Centers to promote progressive labor market outcomes for disadvantaged jobseekers.</p>
<p>The idea that workforce development programs that were more employer-oriented could actually allow the system to serve disadvantaged jobseekers better was something that workforce advocates and practitioners in Chicago had come to believe. In describing the efforts of the Chicago Workforce Development Partnership in the late 1990s to get local officials to adopt industry sectors as a strategic framework for the city’s workforce development efforts, the head of a local advocacy organization offered this pragmatic assessment:<disp-quote>
<p>We were searching for overarching, unifying ideas that you can sell. . . . What was powerful about sectors was that it allowed the creation of a coherent way of thinking about the dual customer and bridged the gap between the customers, that is, the jobseekers and the employers. This is much more effective than the traditional way of doing things, where people went into charity mode and had more of a “please hire these people” approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242413477187">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, although workforce development advocacy groups such as the Chicago Jobs Council expressed some concern that MOWD’s redirection of WIA funds away from One Stops and community-based affiliates would negatively affect access to services on the part of disadvantaged populations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891242413477187">4</xref></sup> there was broad recognition that the Sector Center initiative had the potential to improve opportunities for low-wage workers in the two industries—manufacturing and hospitality—in which they were to operate.</p>

<title>ManufacturingWorks</title>
<p>Manufacturing was an obvious choice for one of the Sector Centers. Despite the fact that the city had lost more than half (58%) of its manufacturing employment base between 1979 and 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891242413477187">Illinois Department of Employment Security, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891242413477187">1999</xref>), the sector still represented 86,000 jobs in the city as of 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891242413477187">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>) and was an important part of Chicago’s economic legacy. High-profile plant closings of the 1980s had given way to an ongoing process of restructuring in the manufacturing sector in the 1990s, one that placed new demands for adaptation and change on small- and medium-sized companies in industries like metalworking. As a result, many companies found themselves in a vicious cycle where cost pressures pushed them into a reliance on low-wage labor and deskilled work processes that resulted in low-quality products and an inability to compete for better, higher value supply opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891242413477187">Theodore &amp; Weber, 2001</xref>). Since the 1980s, Chicago had developed a dense and diverse web of community-based, citywide, and regional organizations focused on helping manufacturers adjust through technical assistance and consulting, job training for both new and incumbent workers, and public policy advocacy.</p>
<p>The establishment of the ManufacturingWorks (MW) Center to serve the workforce needs of local manufacturers was motivated by concerns that there was too much fragmentation among these myriad organizations, especially with respect to training systems and resources, making it difficult for businesses to navigate. Several previous initiatives to bring more coherence and coordination to the workforce development activities of community-based organizations, community colleges, trade associations, and labor unions—including a U.S. Department of Labor-funded initiative in the early 2000s to establish a manufacturing “career path” system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242413477187">Fitzgerald, 2006</xref>)—had failed to achieve meaningful changes. In 2005, an initiative called the Chicago Manufacturing Renaissance Council (CMRC) was launched in an effort to bring together high-level officials from business, labor, education, and government around a vision of “high road manufacturing,” which its founders defined in terms of competitive strategies based on innovation, high wages, high productivity, and workplace democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891242413477187">Swinney, 2000</xref>). Although the enthusiasm of Mayor Richard M. Daley’s administration for industrial retention had waned considerably since the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891242413477187">Rast, 2005</xref>), MOWD officials were strongly supportive of CMRC’s efforts and sought to align the MW center with them. They awarded the contract to operate MW to a consortium of organizations led by Instituto del Progresso Latino (Instituto), a nonprofit based in the Pilsen neighborhood on the near Southwest side, which had been active in workforce development since the 1980s and in manufacturing training since the 1990s. MW opened in late 2005, operating out of a nearby technical college training facility, within close proximity to the city’s industrial corridors on the West and Southwest sides.</p>
<p>Despite being a workforce center, MW offered businesses a broad suite of services, reflecting the center’s relationships to industrial retention and training organizations. Although the majority (57%) of the 166 businesses it served in 2007 placed job orders, one quarter (25%) took part in free “Lean Simulation” trainings offered in conjunction with the Chicago Manufacturing Center, the region’s manufacturing extension affiliate, whereas a similar share (23%) received one-on-one consultation to identify skill gaps and process improvements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242413477187">Table 1</xref>). A smaller share worked with MW’s training partner, Truman College, to identify potential incumbent worker training projects.</p>

<p>Although MW’s primary goal was to help both employers and jobseekers in the city of Chicago, it worked with companies throughout the Chicago region and did not necessarily restrict its job placements to Chicago residents. Nearly half of the companies MW served in 2007 were located in the suburbs and one quarter (25%) of the job placements it made were outside the city. One in five (20%) of the jobseekers that it placed were suburban residents, mostly from the blue-collar, inner-ring suburbs to the city’s south and west. Although some stakeholders expressed concern that city resources were being used to help businesses and jobseekers in the suburbs, both MW and MOWD officials considered it important to take a more regional view of the sector. Employers located within the city needed to tap regional labor pools, especially for more skilled, specialized positions, whereas jobseekers from the city needed access to the employment opportunities that suburban manufacturers had to offer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891242413477187">
<title>ServiceWorks</title>
<p>The creation of a Sector Center, called ServiceWorks (SW), to serve employers in the hospitality and retail industries was somewhat more controversial. On the one hand, there could be little doubt as to the strategic importance of the hotel, restaurant, and retail industries in Chicago’s transformation toward a “global city” in the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242413477187">Sassen, 2004</xref>). Employment in the hotel industry grew by 29% in the city between 1991 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891242413477187">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>), reflecting Chicago’s burgeoning role as a global financial center and also the intentional efforts of local officials to maintain the city’s primacy as a convention locale and tourist destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891242413477187">Spirou, 2006</xref>). And, beyond the well-known State Street and Michigan Avenue shopping corridors, rapid growth of “big box” retail in the Near North and South Loop areas adjacent to downtown in the late 1990s and early 2000s—reversing years of suburbanization-fueled decline—was part of the city’s strategy to support reinvestment in inner-city neighborhoods. Of even greater interest was the city’s bid for the 2016 summer Olympic Games, which would have catalyzed billions of dollars of new public and private investment in and around downtown Chicago. City officials viewed SW as a potential asset for this ultimately unsuccessful bid, to the extent that it could unify hospitality industry and labor officials around workforce training issues in a way that would demonstrate Chicago’s commitment to developing the human infrastructure to support such an event.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some questioned the need to rework the public workforce development infrastructure to support the industry. Service sector employers were already among the prime targets of One Stops and CBOs helping to connect jobseekers to entry-level jobs; retailers, in particular, maintained close relationships with youth-serving organizations like Jobs For Youth, especially around seasonal hiring needs. Another concern was the issue of job quality. The opening of SW coincided with a contentious local debate around a proposed “Big Box ordinance” that would have required large retailers like WalMart and Target to raise their wage levels to at least $10 per hour, plus $3 in benefits. Although the Big Box ordinance proposal ultimately died at the hands of a mayoral veto in September 2006, it helped to spur officials from MOWD and CWB, as well as industry sponsors, to address the issue of job quality, albeit in terms of career ladders and not necessarily wage levels. Still, MOWD officials added “customer service” to the list of sectors that the SW center would serve, motivated in part because the higher average wages for jobs in customer service occupations helped to deflect criticism about the job quality issue.</p>
<p>MOWD awarded the contract to operate SW to a local organization, Pyramid Partnership Inc., which had been active as a WorkNet Chicago service provider since the 1990s, specializing in training for customer service–oriented positions (e.g., customer service representatives) in a wide range of industries, from financial services to telecommunications. But groups like the National Retail Federation Foundation, which had developed a model for retail workforce centers in the early 2000s, played an important role in driving the vision for SW and recruiting employers to participate on the center’s advisory board. The center opened in late 2005, operating in commercial office space in the River North area within blocks of the city’s key tourism and hospitality centers—Michigan Avenue, State Street, and Navy Pier. As with MW, local officials viewed the establishment of a separate physical space—one that was physically proximate to employers—as a way of differentiating SW from other workforce centers that were located primarily within low-income neighborhoods throughout the city.</p>
<p>Unlike MW, SW’s business service activities were almost exclusively recruitment related. Out of 117 companies that worked directly with SW during program year 2007 (July 2007-June 2008), 90% placed a “job order,” in which the business identified a specific job opening for which SW provided recruitment assistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242413477187">Table 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891242413477187">5</xref></sup> Only 10 companies obtained services other than recruitment assistance; 9 received assistance obtaining tax credits from the city’s Business Hiring Incentive Program, which rewarded businesses for hiring specified groups of disadvantaged workers, whereas one company worked with SW toward the development of an incumbent worker training program. This heavy emphasis on recruitment and job placement was not the initial vision for SW; in 2006, it hosted a series of workshops for businesses on subjects such as promoting diversity in the workplace. Although the workshops were considered successful, they were not continued.</p>

By the following year, hotels became the largest focus of placements (42%), followed by customer service (33%). Occupationally, office and administrative support jobs, a category that includes customer service representatives, was the largest in 2006 (45%) but had a much smaller share in 2007 (28%), as building, cleaning, and maintenance occupations grew to an equivalent share (28%).</p>

<p>The primary rationale for the Sector Centers was that they would allow the WorkNet Chicago system to connect more effectively with employers in two sectors that officials considered strategically important to the Chicago economy. On this front, the performance of the centers was mixed.</p>
<p>Most of the manufacturing companies interviewed felt that MW was offering a distinctive service relative to other types of organizations, including other public or nonprofit workforce development organizations and for-profit temporary staffing agencies, against which they contrasted MW’s approach favorably:<disp-quote>
<p>They’re not just trying to bring a bunch of people in. Here’s a whole bunch of applicants, you know, and then you have to go through. They actually are trying to find qualified candidates and they want people that you hire to stick and stay with you. (Vice President, metalworking company)</p>
<p>For a temp agency, it’s just a body. I think ManufacturingWorks takes more time with the people that they send over and there’s more focus on finding the right person as opposed to a pulse. (HR Generalist, auto parts company)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The majority of the companies interviewed—especially smaller ones with 50 workers or less—relied primarily on informal mechanisms, such as referrals from existing workers, to recruit for entry-level positions. Although these sources were generally sufficient for unskilled and semiskilled positions, companies tended to experience difficulty finding workers in more skilled occupations, such as computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine operators and setup workers, welders, machinists, and maintenance mechanics. Smaller companies, in particular, often lacked the internal capacity to upgrade the skills of their own workers and were heavily dependent on the external labor market to find scarce, skilled workers—a factor that worked in MW’s favor.</p>
<p>One reason that MW was successful in making connections with employers was because its staff used the MW “brand” to communicate the center’s commitment to the industry, presenting itself as a mission-driven organization to help revitalize the manufacturing industry in Chicago. This resonated especially strongly with small, independent manufacturing companies who appreciated that the city was committing resources to support the industry. Although this was helpful for MW in getting in the door with companies, it ultimately had to demonstrate that it could deliver qualified candidates and help them solve the immediate problems they faced.</p>
<p>Employer satisfaction with SW was more mixed. Although many of the interviewees commented favorably on the quality of SW’s staff and the recruitment services it provided, they found relatively little that was unique or distinctive about the center’s approach. Indeed, most indicated that they continued to work with other organizations and agencies to meet their recruitment needs and did not consider SW their preferred provider. To some extent, this reflected the greater volume of recruitment that service-sector companies required, due to their higher rates of turnover and seasonal hiring patterns. As a consequence, many of these companies maintained more robust human resources functions, with staff capable of cultivating and managing relationships with organizations that could supply them with a steady stream of job-ready applicants.</p>
<p>Efforts to connect the Sector Centers to local economic development activities had mixed results. The original vision for MW was that it would serve as a bridge between the various industrial retention and workforce development efforts occurring throughout Chicago and the region. But this was mostly unsuccessful. This was due, on one hand, to a lack of organizational capacity on MW’s part to effectively manage relationships with the wide range of manufacturing organizations who were supposed to be its partners. Interviews with these organizations found that many were frustrated by a lack of clarity about roles and objectives in working with businesses, but it also reflected a broader institutional chasm that existed between the city’s workforce and economic development agencies. The city’s Department of Planning and Development (DPD) oversaw the Local Industrial Retention Initiative program, but its leadership was largely disengaged from MOWD’s efforts and showed little interest in the Sector Centers. Frustrated by the lack of connection, MOWD officials engaged a consultant in 2008 to help them identify how the agency could work more effectively with DPD officials.</p>
<p>Another area where Chicago officials hoped that the Sector Centers could help connect with economic development was as a recruitment resource for new businesses, especially in the hospitality and retail sector. MOWD’s Workforce Solutions unit had been doing customized recruitment projects with companies in tax increment financing districts since the late 1990s, but officials hoped that the Sector Centers—and SW in particular—would help them develop more specialized capacity to work with companies in the city that were increasing staff. After a series of smaller hiring projects in 2005 and 2006, SW was asked by city officials to work with the hotel management firm Sage Hospitality in late 2007 on a large hiring event for the reopening of the Blackstone Hotel in the South Loop after a multiyear remodeling process. In exchange for tax increment financing resources to help underwrite the project, Sage agreed to work with MOWD to fill many of the 160 projected permanent positions at the hotel. Although SW ultimately only filled 40 of the positions, officials considered the effort successful, and later in 2008, SW conducted hiring projects for two large hotel openings in the city.</p>
<p>For both MOWD officials and Sector Center staff, the true test of whether the centers were delivering a valued service to businesses was whether they would be willing to pay for it. Given that publicly funded workforce services had historically served employers for free, this represented a significant departure, but one that “best practice” sectoral workforce programs around the country considered an important indicator of employer commitment and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242413477187">Dworak-Munoz, 2004</xref>). The vast majority of the MW customers interviewed expressed at least some willingness to pay for services, especially if it would render the center more financially sustainable, but many noted that their expectations for quality would increase. Ironically, smaller companies tended to be more open to fee-based services than larger companies, who indicated that they were capable of accessing other free, publicly funded workforce services; but also, as one manufacturing HR manager put it, they were “doing a service to the community” by offering good jobs within the city and should be rewarded for that. MW attempted to roll out a sliding-scale fee schedule in early 2008, but the onset of the recession caused it to pull back. In contrast, employer customers of SW expressed little interest in fee-based services, citing the broad-based availability of free public workforce services for entry-level positions.</p>

<sec id="section8-0891242413477187">
<title>Systems Integration: Connecting Good Jobs to Disadvantaged Populations Is a Challenge</title>
<p>There were similar bumps along the road for the Sector Centers in achieving the goals of promoting a more integrated approach to connecting businesses, jobseekers, workforce service providers, and training programs. MOWD anticipated that the Sector Centers would augment the job development capacity of its existing WIA providers, especially smaller community-based organizations, but in practice there were multiple barriers to integration.</p>
<p>There were two major tensions that emerged. The first was that the Sector Centers’ objective of getting new, “better” employers into the WorkNet system gave them strong incentives to “cream” the best candidates from their jobseeker pools, regardless of whether they were WIA registrants. Indeed, center staff recognized that sending employers more highly qualified candidates than what prevailed in the WorkNet system was an important inducement to attract employers into the system. For this reason, MOWD staff initially deemphasized outcomes related to systems integration, in particular the share of job placements from registrants of WIA adult disadvantaged or dislocated worker programs, or youth programs, in comparison with evidence of employer satisfaction. Although job orders that the Sector Centers received were transmitted to dozens of workforce providers throughout the city, both SW and MW cultivated their own pools of job candidates who came through their doors. MW, in particular, attracted thousands of jobseekers from around the region, many of whom had extensive work experience in the manufacturing sector. As a result, MW’s staff was initially disinclined to take chances on disadvantaged jobseekers that lacked manufacturing skills and experience when more highly qualified candidates were readily available—especially when MW was just establishing the relationship with an employer. In 2006, MW’s first full year of operation, only 18% of its job placements were WIA registrants, with more than three fourths of those being dislocated workers, many of whom were skilled workers laid off from the manufacturing sector. SW fared much better, with nearly half (48%) of its 2006 placements being WIA registrants, roughly evenly divided between adult disadvantaged, dislocated, and youth jobseekers. But this also reflected the fact that SW’s employment opportunities were lower wage positions that more closely resembled the kinds of jobs that the WIA system had historically filled.</p>
<p>The other tension related to the Sector Centers’ adaption of the “dual customer” model of workforce intermediation, focusing it more intentionally on employers. WorkNet providers felt that the jobseekers they referred for job orders were at an inherent disadvantage because the Sector Center staff did not know the candidates well enough to advocate for them with the employer. As one interviewee put it:<disp-quote>
<p>Often we work with employers and based on what we know about the individual, we are able to sell him or her to the employer. In this case we have to sell people to the (Sector Centers), and then they have to sell the person to the employer. So it’s a little harder. (Site manager, One Stop)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether it was the role of the Sector Centers to “sell” employers on WIA-registered jobseekers with limited work histories or other types of barriers such as a criminal background was a source of tension among center staff and stakeholders. Some felt that this defied the business-first approach that the Sector Centers were supposed to take; others recognized that although it was essential to provide employers with highly qualified candidates, the use of WIA funding for the centers made it critical to maximize the benefits to jobseekers and providers that were already within the system.</p>
<p>In 2007, city officials asked the Sector Centers, especially MW, to improve their WIA placement shares. Through a more concerted effort to work collaboratively with WorkNet providers on hiring events, MW nearly doubled its WIA placement share to 31% in 2007. Although much of this increase came through placements of workers dislocated from other manufacturing companies, MW also strengthened its relationships with established training organizations like the Jane Addams Resource Corporation and the Wilbur Wright College’s Humboldt Park Vocational Education Center to help build a pipeline of skilled workers from disadvantaged and underrepresented populations for the manufacturing jobs that they were cultivating. To support this, MOWD dedicated a portion of its WIA training monies toward manufacturing skills programs, whose share of overall training funds had largely evaporated over the 2000s in favor of health care, transportation, and construction skills training. SW’s WIA placement shares actually declined in 2007 as it took on large-scale hiring projects in the hotel industry that attracted large numbers of job candidates from outside of the WIA system.</p>

<sec id="section9-0891242413477187">
<title>Promoting Good Jobs: Selling Job Quality Requires Credibility and Criticality</title>
<p>Despite the importance of business satisfaction, job quality remained an important issue to both city officials and especially the initiatives’ external stakeholders. On this front, the Sector Centers demonstrated not only some promises but also some challenges.</p>
<p>MW, in particular, made job quality a central part of its organizational mission, which was “to become the preferred source of employee talent for high road manufacturing companies.” Its emphasis on “high road” companies reflected both a normative belief that public funding should not only benefit businesses whose employment conditions did not meet minimum standards, but also a working hypothesis that “low road” competitive strategies based on low wages and poor working conditions were not sustainable for the businesses themselves, much less for workers and communities. As one MW official put it,<disp-quote>
<p>We will help a low road employer move to the high road. But he or she has to be engaged in that journey before we’re going to devote public resources. It’s support the high road, block the low road. (MW Business Services Manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But defining a “high road” company was not as easy in practice. Recognizing that the distinction was less of a binary than a matter of degrees, MW staff developed a tier system based on job quality, which guided both the extent and the nature of the center’s relationship to the business. As one of MW’s staff described the system,<disp-quote>
<p>It’s subjective, but it gives us a range for understanding where they’re at. So Tier 0 . . . minimum wage usually, we don’t want to work with them. Tier 1 . . . they’re probably around $9 an hour, but no career path. Companies like that, we give them a “talking to.” We’ll give them some consultation, some labor market information, but we avoid doing more than that. Tier 2 . . . with a little help from (our skills analysis subcontractor) or (our training partner), we can get them up to speed. We try to get them to build a career path. Tier 3 . . . they’re almost there—maybe need a little bit of Lean (manufacturing training). They have a training structure and understand what they need, which is usually an additional update to their training. And Tier 4 . . . they’re the ideals. (MW Account Executive)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In practice, MW faced pressure at the outset to work with businesses offering large volumes of job placements, regardless of the quality. In the first 2 years of operation, MW devoted considerable staff time toward large hiring projects that netted as many as 200 placements at a time but scarcely paid above the state minimum wage. By 2007, in response to both internal and external concerns about the quality of its job placements, MW became much more selective with the companies it served. As a consequence, the average wage for its job placements increased from $8.21 in 2005 to $11.23 in 2006 and $12.49 in 2007, and the share of placements with an hourly wage less than $10.00 declined from 80% in 2005 to only 12% in 2007. At the same time, the quantity of job placements decreased from 585 in 2005 to 456 in 2007. In a few cases, this meant severing relationships with businesses that it had previously worked with, or restricting its efforts to a smaller set of higher-wage positions.</p>
<p>As the quotes above indicate, MW’s account executives viewed themselves as consultants whose task was often to nudge their business clients toward more progressive practices. For example, they used public labor market information and their own experience from other companies in an effort to persuade employers to increase starting wage levels for positions they asked MW to fill, using efficiency wage arguments to make the case that low wages would make it harder to attract—and especially retain—highly qualified candidates. Where companies experienced difficulty finding external candidates for skilled positions such as CNC setters and operators, they proposed “one up, one in” arrangements where they helped the company identify and upgrade training for one of its incumbent workers from a semiskilled position, and backfilled the subsequent opening for the company as a way of encouraging companies to promote internal career ladders. Where they encountered shop floors without any racial diversity—often the accumulated result of informal hiring practices—they counseled businesses to seek out new sources, especially African Americans, whose share of the Cook County manufacturing workforce had dwindled to only 11% by 2007, compared with 18% of the total employed workforce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0891242413477187">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not all businesses followed MW’s advice, even though it was invariably framed in terms of the business’ self-interest rather than the social benefit. Even where companies adopted their advice, the gains were sometimes fleeting and contingent on the presence of enlightened human resources officials who could make the case for job quality with other officials inside the company. For example, MW worked extensively with a midsized manufacturer of material handling equipment in late 2007 and early 2008 to help it develop an internal training and development program, only to watch the company lay off nearly two thirds of its workforce—including the HR official it worked with—in the 2008 recession.</p>
<p>Selling job quality to employers depended on the ability of MW’s frontline staff to establish credibility with the employer by demonstrating that they could understand and meet the employer’s immediate needs. As they developed a track record with companies, they were able to use testimonials from other manufacturers to gain credibility from the outset. But almost as important as credibility was the willingness of MW staff to be critical about the myopic and regressive character of employer responses to cost-based competition. In this regard, the fact that MW recruited account executives directly from the temporary staffing industry was highly important, because they were more inclined to recognize the capacity that they had to shape employer practices. As one account executive described it, working at MW allowed him to “use his power for good and not evil.”</p>
<p>Job quality was a much thornier issue for SW. Although SW worked with several retailers and restaurants around store openings and seasonal hiring events, its contractor expressed little enthusiasm for the task of recruiting for entry-level, minimum wage jobs. Instead, SW sought out higher wage jobs outside of the retail and hospitality industries around customer service representative occupations, which regularly paid more than $10 per hour. As one SW manager commented:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t necessarily feel like retail is a good match for what we’re trying to do at the Sector Center. Most jobs here aren’t good or sustainable—they’re mainly part-time or seasonal. And, frankly, you don’t need a lot of training to get one of these jobs—most anyone can walk in and get hired. . . . We really like the focus on customer service because it’s universal, in the fact that it’s found in most industries. It also provides good skill development for the clients, which is something that can help them move up their career ladders later. (SW manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But in stark contrast with MW’s “high road” mission, SW was more ambivalent about the kind of employers it worked with. As another of its managers commented,<disp-quote>
<p>We provide services for everyone who submits a job order. Would we want to work with the Congress Hotel [which had been picketed by hotel unions since 2003] or WalMart? I may have a personal opinion about the company but I don’t think it is my place to pass judgment on these employers. It’s such a subjective thing. . . . We want to see jobseekers advance. We want to promote best practices on the part of employers. (SW manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But there was little evidence that SW made much progress in promoting such practices, in particular, the career ladders that its MOWD service contract requested it develop with employers. Because it was often just one of several recruitment sources that its clients used, SW was not well positioned to push employers to change their practices. To a far greater extent than its counterparts at MW, SW was dealing with large corporations whose human resource practices were highly formalized and rationalized. Although it continued to make placements with low-wage food service and retail employers, SW focused those recruitment efforts increasingly around youth for whom minimum wage jobs were considered less problematic.</p>
<p>The CWB’s Sector Planning Committee played an important institutional role in promoting job quality in the Sector Center initiative. The committee, which was cochaired by the executive directors of World Business Chicago, a not-for-profit economic development organization, and Women Employed Institute, a local workforce policy advocacy organization, was a monthly forum where MOWD officials and Sector Center operators would present metrics and case studies of the centers’ progress around the initiative’s goals. The job quality issue was a central concern for several of the stakeholders who participated in the committee and provided a key source of external accountability for city officials around this issue. Indeed, feedback from this committee about low wage levels for SW’s placements was among the reasons that MOWD and CWB decided in early 2008 to shift the center’s focus away from retail and customer service and toward better paid positions in the hotel industry, where city officials were working with industry and union representatives to develop an industry training partnership modeled after the Nevada Partners initiative in Las Vegas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242413477187">Bernhardt, Dresser, &amp; Hatton, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Postscripts</title>
<p>Chicago’s Sector Center initiative continues to operate but has undergone several shifts since 2008. The contract to operate SW shifted to Educational Data Systems Inc., a Michigan-based operator of workforce centers throughout the United States and an early subcontractor in the MW center. SW became more closely affiliated with the Chicago Leading Economic Advancement, Development, and Sustainability (LEADS) initiative that Mayor Daley launched in late 2007, which convened industry, education, government, and labor stakeholders in the health care, hospitality, transportation, and technology sectors.</p>
<p>Other shifts at the city level have affected the centers. In particular, the decision by city officials in late 2008 to eliminate MOWD as a top-level agency and split its programs between the city’s economic development and human services agencies has been a cause for some concern. Initially, oversight for WIA adult programs, including the Sector Centers, moved into the newly created Department of Community Development (DCD),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0891242413477187">7</xref></sup> which also oversaw the city’s economic development and industrial retention programs. Later in 2009, however, concerns about fragmentation of WIA oversight led officials to move adult programs into the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS), which had operated WIA youth services since 2005 and inherited MOWD’s Community Development Block Grant–funded programs with the initial restructuring. Although city officials continued to support the Sector Centers, several key MOWD officials who had driven the initiative did not ultimately stay with the new DCD, and DFSS officials have attempted to focus the centers around more traditional WIA job placement goals. Some interpreted the move to DFSS oversight as a regression from the city’s commitment to linking economic and workforce development and reversion toward a more social service–oriented approach to workforce services.</p>
<p>Still, other U.S. cities have adopted the sectoral approach in recent years. Beginning in 2008, New York City’s Department of Small Business Services, which operates the city’s WIA adult programs, launched sector-based workforce centers in three areas: Transportation, Distribution, and Logistics; Manufacturing; and Health Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242413477187">Fuchs, Hare, &amp; Nudell, 2008</xref>). And in 2009, the city of Los Angeles began encouraging its WIA-funded One Stops and community-based affiliates to develop sectoral partnerships and specialize their outreach and placement efforts around particular industry sectors. At the federal level, early legislative drafts for the reauthorization of the WIA indicate a greater emphasis on sector partnerships and flexibility for local officials to develop new approaches to service delivery, such as sector-based approaches.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Toward a Reworked Workforce Development?</title>
<p>Across the United States, local officials are looking to workforce development programs and systems to help them reconcile the imperatives of economic growth and social equity. In Chicago’s case, this meant using the existing resources of federally funded workforce programs in new ways to target employers in two industries that were strategically important to local economic vitality but also represented sources of good jobs and economic opportunity for their residents.</p>
<p>A central question that this article has attempted to answer is whether approaches like Chicago’s Sectoral Workforce Centers are capable of reconciling workforce development’s “old” goals of poverty reduction and jobseeker advancement with the “new” goals of business success and local economic competitiveness. The examples of MW and SW suggest that there are clear tensions at work. Attracting new employers to use the public workforce development system pushed the centers to “cream” the most talented workers from within—and often outside—the existing pool of jobseekers within the WIA system. This was especially the case where employers sought to fill positions requiring somewhat higher levels of skills and education, such as precision manufacturing occupations. But with intentional, system-building efforts to develop a training pipeline so that disadvantaged and underrepresented populations could gain the skills and connections to fill the high-quality jobs that the Sector Centers were cultivating, these issues were beginning to be addressed. By funding the centers through WIA formula funds, Chicago officials actually created stronger incentives for the centers to build connections on behalf of disadvantaged populations than if they were funded through other sources, as many sectoral workforce initiatives are. However, redirecting increasingly scarce public funds toward employer-based services at the expense of jobseeker-based services is a difficult proposition for local officials.</p>
<p>This article also poses the question of whether this approach allows the workforce development system to address different types of problems, in particular, shaping the dynamics of low-wage labor markets in ways that “make bad jobs good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242413477187">Osterman, 2005</xref>). As policymakers and practitioners devote public resources to meet employers’ workforce needs, will they leverage those relationships to mold employers’ behavior in ways that improve job quality and career mobility and promote more inclusive hiring and more democratic workplaces? Chicago’s Sector Center initiative is suggestive of both the potential and limitations of this approach. The example of MW, which adopted an explicit stance toward promoting “high road” employment practices, suggests that such a model is possible. By using frontline staff from the private sector that could relate to companies’ needs, but were critical of their practices, MW attempted to build trust and credibility with employers to prescribe changes in the workplace that would generate mutual gains for employers and workers. Yet whether MW’s demand-shaping approach is viable in different industry sectors, different local labor markets, and under different labor market conditions is an open question. Long-term erosion of skill formation systems in the manufacturing sector gave MW an opening to engage employers in ways that its counterpart, SW, could not. Although their efforts are unlikely to reverse long-term trends toward eroding job quality for less-skilled workers, the Sector Centers reflect a recognition that public workforce development programs can play a complementary role alongside regulatory approaches (e.g., increased minimum wages) in this regard. Whether or not other cities and regions adopt Chicago’s particular approach, local officials will continue to feel the imperative to use their workforce development infrastructure to reconcile the imperatives of economic growth and social equity.</p>
