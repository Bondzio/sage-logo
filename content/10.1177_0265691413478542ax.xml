<p>Erik Zürcher’s book is a retrospective collection of articles spanning his thirty-year-long academic career. The articles, which mainly cover the late Ottoman and the early history of the Turkish Republic periods, are organized in four thematic and chronological sections. The first one on ‘Sources and Literature’ provides a critical review of the evolution of the historiography of the period, focusing more particularly on the importance of the memoirs of the central actors, problems of periodization, and new interpretations in the field in the wake of the waning of the modernization paradigm. The second section on the ‘Imperial Twilight’ challenges the conventional narrative that contrasts the decline and failure of the late Ottoman empire with the might and success of the early Turkish republic. It emphasizes instead the complex set of issues that confronted the leaders whose careers spanned both periods and whose forceful policies in the early republican era can only be understood in terms of their life experiences and of their previous frustrating attempts to deal with the same set of vexing issues. The third section on the ‘Great War’ deals with the pivotal and under-studied World War I period, highlighting more particularly the various challenges faced by the Ottoman army during the war and the harrowing experiences of the Ottoman soldiers. It also tackles the persecution and massacre of the Armenian population in Anatolia during the war, the complicity of leaders of the early republic and their continued reluctance to come to terms with this infamous and traumatic episode. The last section, ‘Towards the Nation-State’, grapples with some fraught issues, including: the ideological and nationalist orientations of the Young Turk leaders; the interpretation and periodization of the shift from Ottomanism to Turkish nationalism; the ambivalent relationship between religion and state in Turkey; and nation-building and identity formation in the new Turkish republic.</p>
<p>On the whole, the articles revisit and develop themes that have dominated Zürcher’s scholarly life. Some chapters recapitulate topics developed in his earlier books <italic>The Unionist Factor</italic> (1984) and <italic>Oppostion in the Early Republic</italic> (1994) which debunked the conventional narrative on the formation of modern Turkey, which postulates a clear break between the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic and attributes a central role to Atatürk in the Turkish independence movement and the establishment of the republic. In contrast, as Zürcher reasserts in his articles on Atatürk’s thought and policies, there was a clear continuity in leadership between the Young Turk and the early Turkish nationalist periods, and the conventional historiography of this period was mostly based on Atatürk’s own retrospective account which aimed at discrediting his former rivals in the nationalist movement. At the same time, other chapters in the book reflect some of Zürcher’s more recent concerns, including the significance of the prosopography of the leaders of the Young Turk movement for an understanding of their political views and choices. Zürcher reveals in a series of engaging articles on the topic that most of leaders of the early republic, confined to the Anatolian heartland, hailed from the Balkans, the Aegean and Istanbul, and that their early life experiences, not least the loss of their lands of origin, influenced their determination to launch the war of independence with a view to securing at all costs the Anatolian provinces as a homogeneous Turkish homeland. In the same vein, Zürcher stresses the importance of the crucial and formative World War I period, and its devastating human cost, including the deportation and elimination of the Armenian and Greek communities, for the future of the Turkish republic. However, Zürcher’s attempt to shed some clarity on the various shifts in the nationalist orientations of the Young Turk leadership in the period under study is more questionable. His representation of these shifts in neat and exclusivist stages, as well as the vaguely defined Muslim nationalist and Islamist terms, feels somewhat contrived and anachronistic. Finally, despite the author’s endeavour to edit and collapse several of his previous articles for this volume, the book, perhaps unavoidably, still includes many repetitions and reiterations.</p>
