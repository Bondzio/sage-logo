<abstract>
<p>Seventy years ago, General Motors’ Highways and Horizons exhibit at the World’s Fair, designed by Norman Bel Geddes and Eero Saarinen, promoted demand for cars and federal highways without any concern for environmental sustainability, the theme of our 2010 conference. The main exhibit included a sequence of four parts (entrance ramps, map lobby, Futurama ride, and “intersection of 1960”) where the viewer’s perception of spatial scale was manipulated. Setha M. Low’s theory of “embodied space” helps decode why movement through these diverse spaces influenced millions of Americans’ views of transportation and urban form, a promotional success yet to be equaled by advocates of environmental sustainability.</p>

<body>
<p>In the summer of 2010, I drove past rolling pastures in Amherst, Virginia, a small town of twenty-two hundred people. Road builders had poured concrete for two divided four-lane highways running north-south, another highway running east-west, three high overpasses, and three interchanges with looping on-ramps and off-ramps. Why so many highways? You might call a place like this a failed Tomorrowland, a real estate speculation gone wrong—with an empty big box car dealership for sale, a few new strip malls less than fully leased, and an old Main Street with gaps between buildings. Lou’s Antiques looked like a yard sale gone indoors—broken sets of Sunday china, a scratched Hoosier, beat-up board games, and campaign banners for FDR and Ike. Here, I paid $7.50 for a button that said <italic>I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211420635">Figure 1</xref>). It is a souvenir from General Motors’ Highways and Horizons pavilion at the 1939 World’s Fair that evokes the trajectory from 1939 to the 2009 bailout, when American taxpayers paid about fifty billion dollars to rescue GM.</p>

<p>One theme of the 2010 UHA conference is “Sustainable Cities?” The button marks a key moment in the promotion of an unsustainable United States, a moment when GM persuaded Americans to imagine unending demand for cars, petroleum, and roads. The publicity generated by GM’s exhibit helped the highway lobby push the federal government to create an interstate highway system that transformed American transportation, energy consumption, and land use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420635">1</xref></sup> As someone who writes about the history of American landscapes, I want to build on the work of many scholars who write about highways as well as historians of industrial design, advertising, architecture, and theater in order to explore the selling of unsustainable landscapes dominated by cars and automobile-oriented buildings. My talk tonight, seventy years after the closing of GM’s Highways and Horizons, probes how four parts of the exhibition organized a sequence of bodily movements to support the idea of a nation of drivers in a landscape of federal highways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420635">2</xref></sup> I will ask how anthropologists’ theories of “embodied space” might illuminate the spatial persuasion of 1939 and explore how contemporary highways have constrained our ability to imagine alternatives. Advocates of sustainable cities in the twenty-first century have yet to represent their plans for environmental transformation as effectively as GM did in 1939.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144211420635">
<title>Highways and Horizons</title>
<p>The sponsor of Highways and Horizons, General Motors, maintained an ambitious sales agenda throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, Alfred E. Sloan Jr., chairman of GM, hired Harley J. Earl to head GM’s new Art and Color division. Earl, who had first made his name designing custom cars for Hollywood stars, styled sleek, streamlined models with many technical innovations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420635">3</xref></sup> To increase annual sales, Earl and Sloan promoted planned stylistic obsolescence to encourage customers to buy a new car every year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420635">4</xref></sup> They calculated that more cars on the road would require more highways in urban as well as suburban and rural areas. By 1932 Sloan had formed a major highway lobby, the National Highway Users Conference (NHUC), combining automotive, trucking, petroleum, and construction interests. It included three thousand smaller groups dominated by GM, and led to a larger coalition of lobbyists nicknamed the Road Gang.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420635">5</xref></sup> Members debated toll roads and free roads, rural roads and urban ones. Thomas H. MacDonald, head of the federal Public Roads Administration, drafted maps and reports for an expanded national system. President Roosevelt spent heavily on road building as job creation between 1933 and 1940, and he put federal money into the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the late 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420635">6</xref></sup> GM wanted to push harder.</p>
<p>The industrial designer credited with the concept of “Highways and Horizons,” Norman Bel Geddes, was kicked out of high school in Ohio for drawing an unflattering caricature of the principal. He never earned a degree in architecture, planning or engineering. His knowledge of perspective and lighting came from work in the theater and in advertising. Geddes designed streamlined cars, buses, trains, gas stations, and appliances, and published a book of futuristic images called <italic>Horizons</italic> in 1932.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420635">7</xref></sup> His time as a pitchman for roads began with Shell Oil in 1937, when he created Shell ads showing a “Future City” of 1957 laced with highways. A tabletop model of a city center (with the tallest building about 15 inches high) was lit, a smoke bomb simulated clouds, and the model was photographed as if seen from an airplane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420635">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Geddes floated the idea of a bigger model for the 1939 World’s Fair to Goodyear, the tire maker. When Goodyear said no, Geddes persisted and sold the idea to General Motors. Only fifteen months ahead of opening day, GM jettisoned a pavilion featuring a model of an assembly line<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420635">9</xref></sup> in favor of Geddes’ “Highways and Horizons” design, where selling cars was less important than a public relations campaign advocating transformation of the American landscape. This transformation would require cars and trucks for everyday living in urban, suburban, and rural areas. GM wanted to generate positive, free publicity to make the idea of expensive federal highways seem natural and inevitable. (Public relations pioneer Edward Bernays was a member of the Fair’s organizing committee.) Opening on April 30, 1939, the pavilion was wrapped in a painted silver-gray windowless façade designed by a talented twenty-nine-year-old Yale architect, Eero Saarinen, who was working for Geddes temporarily.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420635">10</xref></sup> (Saarinen was later to design Harley Earl’s new Style and Color headquarters building at GM.) The pavilion presented the visitor with a sequence of four experiences—the entrance ramps, the Map Lobby, the Futurama, and a full-scale street intersection of 1960.</p>
<sec id="section2-0096144211420635">
<title>Entrance Ramps</title>
<p>Publicity began when the two long, sinuous entrance ramps filled with people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144211420635">Figure 2</xref>). S. Charles Lee, the art deco movie-theater architect, was known for saying, “The show starts on the sidewalk.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420635">11</xref></sup> Depression-era Americans did a lot of waiting at soup kitchens and unemployment offices. At the pavilion, people were in line to see a more positive version of America, and Geddes boasted about lines often over a mile long, “5,000 to 15,000 men, women and children,” “never before had there been a line as long as this.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420635">12</xref></sup>
<italic>Life</italic> did a seven-page photographic essay on the pavilion emphasizing the lines, and a decade later, <italic>Life</italic> photographs of consumers standing in lines would become a cliché as they were used to promote automobile subdivisions such as Levittown and Lakewood.</p>

<sec id="section3-0096144211420635">
<title>The Map Lobby</title>
<p>After standing for an hour or two on the ramps, people entered a space “in subdued twilight” of a “gray blue tone” with a huge illuminated overhead map, sixty by 110 feet, positioned “as if the map were set in the sky.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420635">13</xref></sup> First the map showed existing roads in the United States in 1939 with about thirty million cars, buses, and trucks. Then it projected traffic congestion on those same roads, and finally, it showed a lit-up grid of future motorways in 1960 with no traffic problems. Geddes called this the “Map Lobby,” but it was the highway lobby’s map. The space was dedicated to road builders: “General Motors salutes the United States Bureau of Public Roads—the highway officials of our states, the traffic administrators of our cities and the individuals and organizations everywhere who are contributing so importantly to highway progress of the future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420635">14</xref></sup> Perhaps fatigue on the ramps resonated with the illuminated map of delays on the existing roads. Geddes argued (somewhat paradoxically, given the fulsome dedication to road builders) that people came to his exhibit because they experienced traffic congestion: “Automobiles are in no way responsible for our traffic problems. The entire responsibility lies in the faulty roads which are behind the times.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420635">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0096144211420635">
<title>The Futurama</title>
<p>As visitors walked underneath the illuminated map in the “Map Lobby,” weariness gave way to movement. They boarded an escalator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144211420635">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144211420635">4</xref>), down to reach the “Futurama,” a sixteen-minute conveyor belt ride that simulated a trip in an airplane across the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420635">16</xref></sup> Futurama processed 2,150 persons per hour, and twenty-eight thousand persons per day, for an estimated fifteen million viewers in 1939 and 1940.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420635">17</xref></sup> Often referred to as the “City of 1960,” the model represented many parts of the American landscape—rural, suburban, and urban—from Yosemite to Saint Louis. The builders worked with aerial photographs by Sherman Fairchild, who had made a successful business out of supplying aerial images to developers and planners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420635">18</xref></sup> The model included over 35,780 square feet, with mountains, hills, and plains adorned with a million trees and half a million buildings representing different kinds of housing, a farm, a steel mill, an amusement park, an airport, a monastery, a resort, and a dam with hydroelectric plant, as well as stores and office buildings. The scale varied (from one inch to ten feet, to one inch to three hundred feet). The skyscrapers were almost as tall as the workers who hefted them into place.</p>

<p>Futurama was budgeted at two million dollars but cost seven to eight million dollars before it was finished—the equivalent of perhaps $100 million today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420635">19</xref></sup> Much of the additional cost was deployed to control the bodies of spectators on a conveyor belt called a “magic carry-go-round”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420635">20</xref></sup> combining the qualities of a train and an escalator. People sat in 552 glass-fronted, upholstered, high-backed loveseats with side panels (like wing chairs), which limited their peripheral vision. A synchronized sound system fed narration into each pair of moving chairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420635">21</xref></sup> The riders were positioned above the model, looking down through glass as if from an airplane window. They moved at 103 feet per minute in a simulation of the speed of a plane travelling two hundred miles an hour while the landscape filled with fifty thousand cars, trucks, and buses. (Ten thousand of the vehicles moved.) The ride was one-third of a mile long and traversed three levels, changing scale, shifting angles, showing realistic detail as well as strategic clouds, shadows, and haze used to promote the illusion of aerial perspective.</p>
<p>As the visitors were carried around the landscape, night faded to morning, morning progressed to evening, and then another day dawned. Rural landscapes and farms gave way to denser areas, and finally a “River City” of skyscrapers, with two smaller “companion cities,” appeared. The constant was “Magic Motorways” connecting diverse places. The widest was fourteen lanes but the region was laced with many smaller highways with overpasses and cloverleafs—for a total of some twenty thousand feet of motorways. Speeds were said to be high—fifty, seventy-five, even a hundred miles an hour—in the city as well as in the country through lanes divided by concrete barriers, continuous roadway lighting, and radio-controlled cars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420635">22</xref></sup> Urban arterials of six lanes and “express boulevards” of up to twenty lanes ran between the downtown skyscrapers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420635">23</xref></sup> of cities with no urban problems—residential, commercial, and industrial areas were separated. Parking was banished underground. The announcer praised extensive demolition as the process of removing obstacles to the new motorway-oriented world.</p>

<sec id="section5-0096144211420635">
<title>The Intersection of 1960</title>
<p>Near the end of the ride, participants looked down on six city blocks where pedestrian sidewalks were raised one level so that twice as many cars could be put on the streets. In a dramatic climax, participants exiting the ride found themselves in a full-scale intersection of the same design. It appeared to be a real place in 1960 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144211420635">Figure 5</xref>). They were handed buttons reading “I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE” and color postcards of the intersection with messages already written on the back: “This General Motors Exhibit certainly shows a bright future for the Motorist of Tomorrow”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420635">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144211420635">Figure 6</xref>). Postcards were a popular medium for Chamber of Commerce and other booster groups promoting urban design, and fifteen million of these GM cards were distributed as well as the buttons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420635">25</xref></sup> The buildings around the life-sized intersection included showrooms for Frigidaire appliances (a GM division) and cars—Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, La Salle, and Cadillac. You could buy a car, but what had really been sold was the idea of public funding for a vast national highway system.</p>

<sec id="section6-0096144211420635">
<title>Embodied Space</title>
<p>Anthropologist Setha Low’s theory of “embodied space” suggests how Geddes aimed to embed his proposed landscape of 1960 in the minds and bodies of visitors. Because places exist “simultaneously in the land, people’s minds, customs, and bodily practices,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420635">26</xref></sup> Low suggests that we “theorize and imagine the body as a moving, speaking cultural space in and of itself.” Fifteen million bodies experienced Geddes’s highway landscape by their physical participation in scene after scene—the stoic wait, the lit-up map in the night sky, the airplane ride, and the life-sized intersection. The body of a visitor was affected by the fatigue of standing on the ramps to the building, the alternation of light and dark spaces, the design of the wing chair limiting vision, the intimate aural connection to the sound system, the swooping of the “carry-go-round,” and the exit to the sidewalk. Space was experienced as first crowded (the lines) and then ambiguous (the map in the sky); people went up (the ramps) and then down (the escalator). It was high (the airplane ride) and then low (the sidewalk).</p>
<p>As space shifted, time was manipulated. In sixteen minutes, there were two nights and two days, ending in late afternoon, disorienting viewers and making them more susceptible to representations of future space: the huge two-dimensional highway map, the vast three-dimensional landscape model, and the surprising full-scale street intersection. Especially in the Futurama, the accurate, studied representations of the geography of various regions of the nation underneath the proposed motorways convinced those who knew the places that they were flying over them.</p>
<p>The final move onto the full-scale street suggested all of the previous images might have been equally real—or as Geddes boasted, visitors had not only seen the future, they had actually “walked around it it!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420635">27</xref></sup> In Edgar Doctorow’s autobiographical novel, <italic>World’s Fair</italic>, young Edgar says:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>You were standing on precisely the corner you had just seen, the future was right where you were standing and what was small had become big, the scale had enlarged and you were no longer looking down at it, but standing on it, on this corner of the future . . . I actually wobbled on my feet. I had the feeling that I too had changed size, and it only lasted a moment but it was quite strange.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420635">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Low’s theory of embodied space provides a way to explain how, as they wore the buttons that marked them as citizens of the future and mailed the postcards, visitors from around the United States carried the mix of realistic and imagined spaces out of the fair and back to their own neighborhoods, where they anticipated a national program of highway construction and told their friends and neighbors about it.</p>
<p>Geographers often argue that landscape has the power to make seem inevitable what is really contested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420635">29</xref></sup> Geddes was careful to construct a model of landscape with what he defined as “a future which retains enough of 1939 to keep it from being fantastic,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420635">30</xref></sup> while he left out any contestation. In 1939 automobile technology excluded those too old, too young, too poor, or those unable to see well enough to drive. The majority of Americans who held drivers’ licenses were white men. Women were often ridiculed as bad drivers and most cars were bought by men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420635">31</xref></sup> The small minority of African Americans who did own cars were discriminated against by segregated gas stations and motels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420635">32</xref></sup> Americans knew gritty streets and cluttered arterials, they drove through slums, on “buyways” (roads lined with billboards), and through ribbon development (strip malls).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420635">33</xref></sup> They passed tire dumps, auto graveyards, and hot-dog trails, but Geddes encouraged them to imagine that by 1960, on a “Magic Motorway,” a man could speed between skyscrapers with God, progress, and government on his side.</p>
<p>Radio and newsreel coverage expanded the publicity for public highways, reaching many millions who could not attend the fair. They carried snatches of the exhibit’s text—slogans such as “a world which will always grow forward,” and pronouncements such as “Over space man has begun to win victory, space for living, space for working, space for play all available for more people than ever before.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420635">34</xref></sup> Theater critics, architecture columnists, and urban reporters discussed the exhibit in dozens of newspapers and magazines with a total circulation of hundreds of millions. Road builders’ journals debated the technical details. Real estate journals lauded the idea of endless growth. Indeed, as historian Mark Rose notes in <italic>Interstate</italic>, even the federal government considered the potential of speculating on roadsides at a private stag dinner, hosted by Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. On March 22, 1939, “The West Hall was set aside . . . for a model of Geddes’ exhibit, and guests discussed creation of a Federal Land Authority empowered to take extra wide rights of way for roads and other public works,” and possibly resell some of them later. Roosevelt did not take this up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211420635">35</xref></sup> But Geddes was not discouraged—he later doctored a photo of people riding on the Futurama and inserted the heads of political leaders he wanted to impress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420635">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the fair closed in 1940, Geddes tried to keep the Futurama intact and active. He proposed to relocate it in a New York skyscraper, to load it on forty trucks as a roving exhibit, or to fly it around in a dirigible he designed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211420635">37</xref></sup> He had to settle for publishing his book, <italic>Magic Motorways</italic>, with Random House in 1940. Here he compared road building to educating one’s children, noting that “Federal road building might be considered as part of the Federal government’s obligation to develop the country,” and he enthused, “where the highways of a national system go, commerce and higher land values and free movement will go,” predicting constant speculative building around highway off-ramps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211420635">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interstate highway system was first authorized by Congress in 1944. Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, the Road Gang lobby headed by GM continued to push for federal funding for the program. GM board member Lucius Clay headed a national advisory committee negotiating the Interstate highway legislation that Eisenhower finally signed in 1956. (Later Ike claimed he had not understood that interstates would require extensive demolition in cities.) It was the biggest public works project the world had ever seen, 42,500 miles first estimated at twenty-six billion dollars, rapidly rising to a final cost of 128.9 billion dollars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420635">39</xref></sup> Across the nation, 90 percent federal funding encouraged states to build quickly. By 1970, after protests mounted against widespread demolition for the system in both cities and countryside, Helen Leavitt’s <italic>Superhighway, Superhoax</italic> attacked the highways that entrenched the “Road Gang” at the federal level and in every state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420635">40</xref></sup> Owen Gutfreund has defined this as “highway federalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420635">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the construction of the system was complete, congestion meant that road building of all kinds—federal, state, and local—continued, and so did workers’ dependence on automobile-related employment. In 2008 researchers estimated one in ten Americans had jobs selling cars, trucks, buses, asphalt, concrete, and paving equipment, or building highways, parking garages, truck stops, and gas stations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420635">42</xref></sup> In 2009, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, DOT gave states twenty-seven billion dollars in stimulus money for twelve thousand road projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420635">43</xref></sup> An economically shaky GM was considered “too big to fail.” In 2009, GM declared bankruptcy and reorganized with about fifty billion dollars in federal bailout money, acquiring the nickname, “Government Motors,” when the federal government held 61 percent of GM stock.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420635">44</xref></sup> United Auto Workers contracts were renegotiated after the bankruptcy, halving the hourly pay for many of the new workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420635">45</xref></sup> The Treasury Department sold some of its stock in 2010 and planned to sell the rest in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420635">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once the landscape had been reshaped, highways constrained future generations. Without a coherent national policy for both transportation and land use, federal highways supported scattered speculative development—for example, the three suburban patterns I analyze in <italic>Building Suburbia</italic> as sitcom suburbs, edge nodes, and rural fringes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420635">47</xref></sup> Scatteration requires new roads for every raw site developed, and then anyone living or working at a new development needs a car. The United States today includes about 310 million people and 252 million passenger vehicles. Since 1975 there have been more vehicles than licensed drivers, now about 1.2 vehicles for every driver.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420635">48</xref></sup> Americans have become inured to highways—historian Cotten Seiler calls this “compulsory automobility.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420635">49</xref></sup> In 2009, when the <italic>New York Times</italic> asked me to discuss a “car-free” country, I and five other urbanists struggled to imagine the United States without road building, automobiles, trucks, and ever-higher consumption of land and energy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420635">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many urban historians have documented and critiqued highway history. But could we create a more effective public history of highways and their role as part of unsustainable land-use patterns? Digital mapping could allow us to exhibit highways on models of metropolitan places, with a price tag attached for every mile of road, every on-ramp, every off-ramp, tying the history of each local stretch of highway to the national story much the way Geddes used Fairchild’s local aerial maps to ground his national vision in 1939. Letting visitors of all ages examine the costs of building highways and unbuilding them could animate the process physically. Think of the on-line physics game, “Demolition City”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420635">51</xref></sup> but imagine the script as critical of cars, roads, and sprawl. The costs of road building could be tied to recent events. How would you have budgeted the Big Dig in Boston? Would you have spent seventy-seven billion dollars in stimulus and bailout money on transportation in 2009? Do you favor demolishing the Sheridan Expressway in New York in 2011? Perhaps innovations such as the 2010 Chinese design for a solar-powered “straddling bus” might be used to show a possible way to modify existing highways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420635">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Making the case for sustainable metropolitan regions with fewer highways will not be easy as long as the automotive landscape dominates current thinking, as one last example demonstrates. President Obama deployed an automotive metaphor for stump speeches before the 2010 elections. He likened the US economy to a car driven into a ditch by George W. Bush. Obama identified himself as a more capable driver, and members of his administration were pushing the car out of the ditch. But the Republicans wanted the car keys back. (D stood for Drive, and Democrats; R for Reverse, and Republicans.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420635">53</xref></sup> When the entire country is a car and progress is a road, Americans are back in Highways and Horizons, spinning through the dark on the Futurama.</p>

It is worth noting that architects and planners (such as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra, Harvey Wiley Corbett, and Hugh Ferriss) who relied on a combination of drawings, renderings, books, and presentation models to promote their designs used no equivalent theatrical or multimedia tools. Documentary photographers of the 1930s, such as Berenice Abbott, who gave her attention to “Changing New York,” emphasized scale in the built environment with low aerial views taken from skyscrapers, but had no corporate agenda.</p>
