<abstract>
<p>With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) equipped with mobile browsers, the possibilities to administer surveys via mobile devices have expanded. To investigate the possible mode effect on answer behavior, results are compared between a mobile device–assisted web survey and a computer-assisted web survey. First, a premeasurement in the CentERpanel is conducted to analyze the user group of mobile devices. Second, the users are randomly allocated one of the three conditions: (1) conventional computer-assisted web survey, (2) hybrid version: a computer-assisted web survey with a layout similar to mobile web survey, and (3) mobile web survey. Special attention is given to the design of the mobile web questionnaire, taking small screen size, and typical functionalities for touchscreens into account. The findings suggest that survey completion on mobile devices need not lead to different results than on computers, but one should be prepared for a lower response rate and longer survey completion time. Further, the study offers considerations for researchers on survey satisfaction, location during survey completion, and preferred device to access Internet. With adaptations, surveys can be conducted on the newest mobile devices, although new challenges are emerging and further research is called for.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Since mobile phones became part of our daily lives, survey researchers have been looking into ways to engage them for research purposes. First, mobile phone connections were included in traditional, interviewer-assisted surveys. This was seen as a complementary and more costly way to reach respondents, next to the fixed-line interviews. But as mobile phones gained in popularity, sampling and interviewing by mobile phones became a necessary element for telephone surveys in order to acquire valid, reliable, and representative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439313483976">Link, Battaglia, Frankel, Osborn, &amp; Mokdad, 2007</xref>). Another mobile service, text messaging, appeared successful for prenotification purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439313483976">Bosnjak, Neubarth, Couper, Bandilla, &amp; Kaczmirek, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For self-administered surveys, however, it has taken longer before the technology or the people were ready to embrace mobile devices. As early as in 1996, the first devices with mobile access to the real Internet were introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439313483976">Nokia, 1996</xref>). Around the turn of the millennium, mobile phones with a wireless application protocol browser were introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439313483976">Nokia, 1999</xref>), but these services fell short of expectations and never really broke through. Only in recent years, with the arrival of devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs (tablets) running special mobile browsers and with screens large enough for adequate page viewing, a serious new alternative has emerged for web-based self-administered surveys.</p>
<p>While studies have already been conducted on addiction to mobile phone usage among early adopters such as adolescents and students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439313483976">Hong, Chiu, &amp; Huang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439313483976">Pawlowska &amp; Potembska, 2012</xref>), the overall population is still finding its way to the newer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Only a couple of years ago, researchers thought it was too early to use mobile web surveys as a mode of data collection for the general population, with the average mobile Internet penetration rate in Europe estimated at 31% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439313483976">Fuchs &amp; Busse, 2009</xref>). In the Netherlands, approximately 27% of all 12- to 75-year-old Dutch citizens used the Internet via a mobile phone in 2012 and 11% via a tablet. These estimates are based on a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439313483976">Statistics Netherlands (2012)</xref> and exclude information on the frequency of mobile Internet usage. The share of total mobile Internet usage, including laptops according to the report, has tripled since 2007.</p>
<p>Globally, the use of mobile browsers is reported to be growing, representing almost 13% of all browser usage based on page views in November 2012, counted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439313483976">StatCounter GlobalStats (2012)</xref>. Eventually, the mobile Internet penetration is expected to reach similar usage rates as regular mobile phone usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439313483976">Fuchs &amp; Busse, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As mobile Internet continues to gain market share, in the future it may become not only an alternative way to reach respondents but perhaps even an indispensable one. People start to expect that Internet applications, including surveys, are adopted for and will work adequately on mobile devices. Nevertheless, only limited research has been carried out investigating mobile surveys. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439313483976">2010</xref>, Bosnjak, Metzger, and Gräf looked into the factors that could influence the intention to participate in mobile surveys. They found that perceived enjoyment, perceived trustworthiness, behavioral attitudes, and self-congruity were the most important predictors of the willingness to complete mobile surveys. Perceived usefulness, perceived costs, or perceived social pressure did not appear to have a significant, direct influence on participation intentions. According to another study, by Verkasalo, López-Nicolás, Molina-Castillo, and Bouwman in 2010, the intention to use mobile applications in general is driven by perceived enjoyment and usefulness, both among users and nonusers of smartphones. The common influential factor in these studies, perceived enjoyment, appears to play an important role for mobile users.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are associated with a low-threshold access, but can also easily be turned down. As has been seen in other modes, as a questionnaire progresses respondents may become increasingly fatigued and distracted, which is when their desire to expend less energy in the task involved may win from their desire to provide high-quality data, resulting in satisfactory answers instead of the most accurate answers, or even arbitrarily selected answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439313483976">Krosnick, 1999</xref>). This process is likely to apply to mobile surveys, too. Moreover, due to the low-threshold aspect working in both directions, one might expect the respondents’ commitment to continue to be lower rather than higher, compared to more traditional modes. Maximum user-friendliness of the survey interface seems, in this regard, essential for mobile surveys, not just to stimulate a willingness to participate but also to motivate respondents to provide valid data throughout the questionnaire.</p>
<p>This represents a major challenge for the designers of mobile web surveys. In 2010, Peytchev and Hill conducted several experiments with surveys on smartphones. They pointed out that the small screen size of smartphones limits the possibilities for text and visualizations. Further, while the screen navigation and data entry (e.g., touchscreens) work differently than on traditional computers, programming functionality and application choices are still often limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>). It is, then, not surprising that the first experiments often reported more difficulties on small screens, resulting in less effective task completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439313483976">Jones, Marsden, Mohd-Nasir, Boone, &amp; Buchanan, 1999</xref>), lower user performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439313483976">Jones, Buchanan, &amp; Thimbleby, 2003</xref>), less effective and efficient task performance for simple tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439313483976">Watters, Duffy, &amp; Duffy, 2003</xref>), and greater perceived difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While touchscreens are rapidly becoming the “de facto” standard on the newer mobile devices, navigation remains an important factor to consider in mobile surveys. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev and Hill (2010)</xref> found that when listing response options horizontally, some devices may only allow moving the cursor over the first response option. When requiring navigation such as scrolling to the right, a small proportion of their respondents did not receive this information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>). Here, it should be noted that on mobile web screens it is not always possible to scroll horizontally.</p>
<p>One might expect that the possibility to complete questionnaires in different situations and locations using mobile devices will affect the cognitive processing or that the small displays will affect the way surveys are comprehended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>). However, despite the indications on difficulties in survey completion, on the whole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev and Hill (2010)</xref> concluded that the cognitive processing between computer-administered web surveys and mobile web surveys appears similar.</p>
<p>The functionality of mobile questionnaires is in many ways similar to that of computer-assisted self-interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>). The measurement advantages of computer-administered surveys, such as higher concurrent validity, less survey satisficing, less random measurement error, and more reports of socially undesirable attitudes and behavior, in comparison to surveys including interviewer interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439313483976">Yeager et al., 2011</xref>), could in this regard be expected to apply to mobile device–assisted surveys as well.</p>
<p>However, mode differences can occur and should be investigated. Methodological research on the effects of self-administered responding via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, compared to computer-assisted surveys, is still very scarce. This applies even more to surveys completed on people’s own mobile devices and thus on a great variety of user interfaces. Surveys among native mobile device users also create a challenge for sampling, as this group includes only a selective part of the population. This should be taken into account in the experimental design.</p>
<p>In the early experiments on mobile devices, respondents were often provided with a mobile device by the researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439313483976">Sweeney &amp; Crestani, 2006</xref>). This has the advantage of a controlled user interface, but also the disadvantage of producing only a limited amount of information on the user experiences in the real population, where there is a great variety of types and models of mobile devices. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether a regular survey could be conducted using users’ own mobile devices, given that the layout would need to be adapted for small screens and special mobile browsers. How would a survey with a mobile layout be experienced in comparison to a conventional web version, and perhaps most importantly, would the results differ from those of surveys completed via a computer? Furthermore, we wanted to learn about differences in perceived and objective duration between the survey modes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0894439313483976">
<title>Design and Implementation</title>
<p>In our experiment, we wanted to compare answering behavior between a survey completed using a mobile device and a survey completed using a computer. We administered the survey to the CentERpanel, composed of over 2,000 Dutch households completing online questionnaires at home every week. The panel forms an appropriate representation of the Dutch-speaking population. Its original sample was drawn by Statistics Netherlands and the sample is annually supplemented through a stratified recruitment. Since not all Dutch people have computers with Internet access and to keep the sample representative, households without a computer or Internet access are provided with one.</p>
<p>The panel members were accustomed to completing surveys on a computer. To enable the questionnaire for mobile browsers, it was necessary to alter the standard layout and functionality. Since the differences in answers could thus be due simply to a different layout of the questionnaire instead of a mode variation, we included a third, hybrid version of the questionnaire. In this condition, the respondent completed the questionnaire on the computer, but the layout was kept as identical as possible to that of the mobile version.</p>
<p>The problems with mobile surveys often relate to the presentation of questions on small screens, which is why surveys for mobile devices should be designed deliberately for that purpose. For our experiment, we developed a mobile version of the questionnaire, which was compatible with the most common mobile browsers. For this, we used the C-Moto stylesheet. C-Moto is a mobile touchscreen interface for Blaise IS questionnaires, based on jQuery Mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439313483976">Amin &amp; Wijnant, 2012</xref>). We limited our sample to users of smartphones and tablets, which are mostly equipped with touchscreen navigation and operate on mobile operating system (e.g., iOS, Android, or Windows 8 phone). Simple mobile phones not only lack the interface, that is, a screen with large enough resolution, but also the possibility to access Internet pages via a browser. In this article, we will refer to these two types of devices, smartphones and tablets, when talking about mobile devices.</p>
<p>As we expected the users of smartphones and tablets to differ from the rest of the population, we could not simply present the mobile version of the questionnaire to those in possession of a mobile device. Nor was it within the means of this experiment to provide all nonusers with a smartphone. Instead, we decided to target smartphone and tablet users only. We designed a two-step selection procedure: We first investigated which panel members owned a smartphone or tablet with Internet access. This group of people would then form the experimental target group, and be further randomly divided into three subgroups, each receiving either a survey in mobile, computer, or hybrid design.</p>
<sec id="section3-0894439313483976">
<title>Premeasurement</title>
<p>In June 2012, we carried out a premeasurement in the CentERpanel to gather knowledge on the usage of smartphones and other devices. Among panel members of 14 years of age and older, we asked whether they use smartphones or tablets to connect to the Internet. Of the 2,722 active panel members, 2,029 respondents answered these questions; 28.7% of the respondents reported using smartphones and 19.1% reported using tablets.</p>
<p>We expected the use of mobile devices to be biased toward certain subgroups of the general population, the early adopters of mobile phones being typically young well-educated men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439313483976">Fuchs &amp; Busse, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the usage of both devices was significantly higher among younger panel members, Smartphones: χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 322.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Tablets: χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 67.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The age distribution is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439313483976">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Looking at gender differences, the respondents appeared to be more emancipated in terms of mobile device usage than we had expected. Although men used smartphones somewhat more (30.6%) than women (26.4%), this result was not very strong, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 4.36, <italic>p</italic> = .037, and for tablet usage we could find no significant difference between genders, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = .880. Further, smartphones were used more by the highly educated, χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 29.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but again for tablet users this difference was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 10.18, <italic>p</italic> = .07.</p>
<p>We also asked the smartphone and tablet owners whether they currently complete questionnaires in the CentERpanel on these devices. The usage of smartphones for this purpose appeared to be very low (0.9%), but there were more people (13.5%) who reported accessing their questionnaires using tablets. In addition, there was a small group (0.8%) who said they use both smartphones and tablets for filling out surveys.</p>

<title>Selection, Invitation Procedure, and Response</title>
<p>In July 2012, we fielded the main study in the CentERpanel. Within the target group of smartphone and tablet users, we randomly assigned people to one of the three conditions<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0894439313483976">1</xref>

<p>Some of the respondents who had been selected excluded themselves from participation at the moment of the experiment (e.g., due to vacation). This resulted in a final selection of 661 panel members aged 14 years and older.

<p>Normally, the panel households receive an e-mail notification on Friday afternoon when new questionnaires are posted online. For this experiment, the respondents in Condition 3 received a special invitation per e-mail, in which we pointed out that they should fill out this specific survey via smartphone or tablet. On the panel website, the link to the questionnaire also included the notification to use one of the two mobile devices. At the start of the questionnaire, the respondents were once again asked to use a smartphone or tablet. If in possession of both, they were asked to use the smartphone. For other groups, the invitation procedure was carried out normally, except for a special notification at the beginning of the questionnaire reminding the respondent that he or she should complete the questionnaire on a computer or laptop and no other device.</p>
<p>Some of the respondents ignored this instruction. At the end of the questionnaire, we asked each group which device they had used to answer the questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894439313483976">Table 3</xref>). In Conditions 1 and 2, where the respondent was asked to use a computer, 11.6% and 13.9% of the respondents had nevertheless completed the questions on a tablet. In Condition 3, in which a mobile device was to be used, 9.9% had used a computer instead.</p>

<p>We checked the self-reported mode against the browser log files which captured the type of browser the respondent had used. In case of several browsers being used, we used the information on the browser that was used last by the respondent. This revealed another six persons, five of which in Condition 3, who had completed the survey using a different mode than requested. All panel members who completed the questionnaire using a different channel than requested were excluded from the data. After correcting for the mode, our data contained a total of 379 people in the target sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894439313483976">Table 4</xref>). There were 10 respondents in all who started the questionnaire and completed at least the first question, but who dropped out in the course of the questionnaire.

<p>The above leads us to suggest that although most people do follow given instructions, one should make a specific effort to monitor the mode actually used, as there is a sizable group of those who do not. Especially tablet owners seem to have a clear preference for using the tablet instead of a computer, possibly because they consider a tablet similar to the computer and might not see the point of changing the mode. It is possible, however, that web panel members who are subsequently contacted via e-mail to complete surveys, may take less notice of details about the survey presentation, limiting the effects of differences in survey presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439313483976">Tourangeau, Groves, Kennedy, &amp; Yan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The response in the mobile condition was remarkably low compared to the other conditions. It appears that using the mobile mode, different from the usual surveys in the panel, posed too much of an obstacle to many people. Assuming that many respondents either directly logged in or viewed their invitational e-mail on a computer, the task would be more demanding for them if they needed to switch to another device. The general login view that people received before entering the questionnaire was also not very attractive to view on mobile browsers.</p>
<p>Moreover, owning an advanced mobile device such as smartphone does not automatically mean that people use all the available services (Verkasalo, López-Nicolás, Molina-Castillo, &amp; Bouwman, 2010). Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439313483976">Fuchs and Busse (2009)</xref> point out, not all respondents who have access to the mobile Internet are able and willing to use it to complete a survey. This might be, among other reasons, due to lack of technological sophistication or to expensive subscriptions.</p>

<title>Questionnaire Layout and Functionality</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev and Hill (2010)</xref> point out, mobile web surveys have much in common with computer-administered web surveys and it is likely that many design decisions can be derived from this or other modes of data collection. Research has shown that web survey results can be influenced by design and visual aspects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439313483976">Couper, Traugott, &amp; Lamias, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439313483976">Toepoel &amp; Dillman, 2011</xref>). Respondents are likely to interpret visual features of questionnaires such as the location of an answer on the scale, the visual midpoint of the scale, physical proximity to other answers, or the way of spreading response options on the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439313483976">Toepoel &amp; Dillman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439313483976">Tourangeau, Couper, &amp; Conrad, 2004</xref>). Also, numerical values that are used as part of a rating scale may influence respondents’ interpretation of end point labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439313483976">Schwarz, Knäuper, Hippler, Noelle-Neumann, &amp; Clark, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of visual features appears especially strong when the task at hand is not clearly worded. For example, if respondents feel unsure about the meaning of the scale points, they take advantage of whatever cues they can, starting with the verbal labels and continuing with secondary cues, such as color, to interpret the scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439313483976">Tourangeau, Couper, &amp; Conrad, 2007</xref>). The context effects can be diminished by clear question and answer wording and limited numerical and visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439313483976">Toepoel &amp; Dillman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the discussion on the optimum number of rating scale points is long-standing, the 7-point scale (±2) is often seen as one the most recommended and reliable options, providing the respondent with enough possibilities to discriminate between scale values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439313483976">Cox, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439313483976">Preston &amp; Colman, 2000</xref>; Schwarz et al., 1991). Although higher scales, such as 10-point Likert-type scales, are sometimes also recommended, they deliver little further pretest reliability (stability) or increase in internal consistency reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439313483976">Preston &amp; Colman, 2000</xref>), and require more space on the screen. Therefore, we presented most of our answer scales, including 21 attitude items on social engagement, on a 7-point Likert-type scale. To briefly test also other commonly used scale types, we included an attitude item on European unification on a 5-point Likert-type scale, three attitude items on trust and control over one’s life using a 10-point Likert-type scale, as well as a question on general happiness presented on an 11-point Likert-type scale.</p>
<p>For the conventional web surveys in the CentERpanel, the layout of the questionnaires is standardized, including background color, font, and so on. We used these layout features for Conditions 1 and 2 of our experiment. Considering the possible influence of visual features of the questionnaire, we kept the layout of the mobile version as similar as possible to the regular layout. However, due to the small screen of smartphones, some changes in the question presentation were required. An effort was made to make the questionnaire easy to manage on touchscreens, as these are becoming the default on smartphones. Instead of using radio buttons, each answer category of an answer scale was embedded in a wide button to tap on. Initially, the respondent was able to “swipe” to the next question, but because we noticed during the testing period that swiping might lead to unintended answers or confusion of the given answer on some smartphones, we concluded that separate research on using this functionality is needed first, and we discarded this possibility from the final questionnaire.</p>
<p>Fitting several question items with Likert-type scales on a single mobile screen did not seem feasible, especially regarding the fingertip handling of touchscreens. This would have led to such a small area on the screen per answer category that choosing the right category by tapping with a finger would have demanded extraordinary precision. Therefore, each question item was presented on a separate screen. This was correspondingly applied to Condition 2. Further, the answer scales needed to be presented vertically to Group 3 since longer scales, such as 7-point Likert-type scales, did not properly fit on a smartphone screen when laid out horizontally. This could be helped by turning the mobile on its side, which on many models automatically switches the portrait orientation to a landscape one, but this does not apply to all models. Also, on some mobile phone models horizontal navigation through answer options can be very difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483976">Peytchev &amp; Hill, 2010</xref>). In Condition 2, the answer scales were presented vertically, similar to Group 3. The different layout choices are given below in an overview (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0894439313483976">Table 5</xref>). Screenshots of different question types are included in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894439313483976">Appendix</xref>.</p>

<p>Research on vertical versus horizontal scale orientation in web surveys suggest no significant difference in response means and little or no effect on response distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439313483976">Couper, 2008</xref>). There is little to no evidence on the effects of placing multiple items per screen versus a single item per screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439313483976">Couper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439313483976">Toepoel, Das, &amp; van Soest, 2008</xref>), except for multiple-item screens possibly resulting in less survey completion time and less `don't know' and `not available' answers (Couper at al., 2001). Nevertheless, by implementing the hybrid version of the questionnaire, we wanted to exclude the possibility of finding differences in response between the computer and mobile conditions, which would actually be due to the presentational differences between a table (multiple items per screen, horizontal scales) versus a single (vertical) question per screen. Also, since tables are very commonly used in web surveys, we did not find it satisfactory to compare only the hybrid and mobile versions.</p>

<sec id="section6-0894439313483976">
<title>Results</title>
<p>On account of the small screen of mobile devices and possibly higher experienced difficulty in completing the survey on a mobile device, we expected that we might find differences in the response mean and variation. Earlier research has found evidence that visible answer options in web surveys are endorsed more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439313483976">Couper, Tourangeau, &amp; Conrad, 2004</xref>). Response scales, on some mobile devices perhaps not fully visible, could therefore lead to a stronger primacy effect; in other words, to respondents choosing relatively often for the early answers on the scale, resulting in lower mean scores. Difficulties in survey completion could lead to satisficing or more random answers and therefore more within-group difference, revealed by a higher standard error.</p>
<p>Our null hypothesis was therefore that the means among the Conditions 1 to 3 would be equal, that is, that completing a survey using a mobile device and an altered questionnaire design would not significantly affect the response behavior. When comparing the means between the three conditions, we diagnosed very little differences between groups. The difference in means between Conditions 3 and 2, as well as between Conditions 3 and 1, was, with one exception, less than 0.5 points for each item.</p>
<p>A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the possibility of significant differences between the different conditions. When tested on <italic>p</italic> = .01 level of accuracy, the results revealed no statistically significant differences among the condition means (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0894439313483976">Table 6</xref>). Even on <italic>p</italic> = .05 accuracy, only 4 of the 26 items showed significant differences of means. Nor could we detect any structural differences in the standard errors. Splitting the mobile group into smartphone users and tablet users did not alter this picture, although differences here might also remain undetected due to small subgroup sizes. While more research needs to be conducted with larger samples, we found no indication that using a mobile device for completing surveys would, as such, generate significantly different outcomes than if using a computer.</p>

<title>Subjective and Objective Length of Survey</title>
<p>At the end of the survey, we asked the respondents to rate the length of the questionnaire. They were requested to estimate the length on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>very short</italic> to 7 = <italic>very long</italic>. We expected the mobile device users to estimate the survey as shorter than those who completed the survey on a computer, as we imagined smartphones and tablets to enable quick task handling. On the other hand, the respondents were accustomed to completing surveys on a computer, while the mobile interface was new to them. Completing the questions might also be more time-consuming due to smaller screens and the need to scroll. Also, it is possible that mobile device users had low connection speeds or that the page loading was slower.</p>
<p>A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the three target groups in relation to subjective questionnaire length, <italic>F</italic> (2, 375) = 15.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Interestingly, based on a post hoc Scheffe, the respondents in Condition 3 (<italic>M</italic> = 4.19, <italic>SD</italic> = .525) reported a significantly longer survey than respondents in Conditions 1 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.76, <italic>SD</italic> = .674) and 2 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.89, <italic>SD</italic> = .613). There were no significant differences between Groups 1 and 2. Respondents who completed the survey on a mobile device estimated the survey to be longer than respondents who completed the survey on a computer, regardless of which layout of the computer version was used. An overview of these results is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0894439313483976">Table 7</xref>. When splitting the mobile device group into smartphone and tablet users, the general outcome prevailed, <italic>F</italic> (3, 374) = 10.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The post hoc test showed significant differences between the Condition 1 and smartphones (<italic>M</italic> = 4.23, <italic>SD</italic> = .505), Condition 1 and tablets (<italic>M</italic> = 4.16, <italic>SD</italic> = .548), and Condition 2 and smartphones, but not between smartphones and tablets or between Condition 2 and tablets. This suggests a longer survey completion time on smartphones than on tablets, but in our experiment this difference did not prove significant.</p>

<p>Based on automatic time stamps that were logged at the beginning and at the end of the questionnaire, we were able to measure the actual time of completing the questionnaire. Since it was possible for the respondents to revisit the questionnaire and complete it during several sessions, we excluded outlier cases for which the starting and finishing date differed and for which the completion time exceeded 1 hr. When comparing the measured completion time between groups, we found that these results supported the conclusion based on the self-reported survey length. There was a significant difference between groups, <italic>F</italic> (2, 354) = 25.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and since the variances were not homogeneous, we used the Games–Howell post hoc test to reveal that again it was Group 3 with the significantly longest survey time (<italic>M</italic> = 542.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 287.85). Again, we could find no significant difference between Group 1 (<italic>M</italic> = 338.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 308.15) and 2 (<italic>M</italic> = 320.84, <italic>SD</italic> = 111.10). Likewise, the median values for completion time suggested that the survey clearly required more time to finish on a mobile device than on a computer (Group 1 median = 276.39, interquartile range (IQR) 211.41–370.67; Group 2 median = 303.14, IQR 239.97–381.63; and Group 3 median = 478.39, IQR 359.78–607.41). To what extent this disturbs the mobile respondent needs to be investigated. On one hand, people often have more and easier access to mobile devices than to computers, which might make longer completion time acceptable, yet on the other hand the typical sessions are likely to be shorter than on computers.</p>

<title>Survey Experience and Questionnaire Evaluation</title>
<p>Respondents in the mobile device condition evaluated the questionnaire similarly to the respondents with the computer versions. At the end of the questionnaire, the respondents were presented with 5-point evaluation scales, which they normally face after each questionnaire in the CentERpanel. The respondents could express how difficult, clear, interesting, and enjoyable they found the questions and whether the questions made them think about things. While some aspects, such as questionnaire difficulty and enjoyment, were rated less positively by mobile device users, these differences were not significant. The survey experience appears not to be burdened by the mobile interface to such a degree that this would result in a clearly different survey satisfaction. Of course, the evaluation only covers the respondents who completed the questionnaire to the end, and therefore gives just a partial picture of the respondent experience. Analyzing nonresponse remains an important topic for future research. The findings of the evaluation are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0894439313483976">Table 8</xref>.</p>

<p>At the end of the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to report where they were when they completed the questionnaire, and whether they were alone or with someone. Although there were a little less people in the mobile condition who completed the survey at home, these differences in the location of the respondent at the time of survey completion were not significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0894439313483976">Table 9</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.69, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = .123). While mobile devices would enable location-independent survey completion, the vast majority of respondents still responded at home, probably in part because they were accustomed to completing the CentERpanel questionnaires on a computer.</p>

<p>Only one third (32.7%) of the respondents were alone when completing the questionnaire. Most of the respondents answered the questions in family settings, with their partner, children, or other family members present. The mobile device group showed similar behavior to the respondents in the two computer conditions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when the respondents were asked which device—a computer or laptop, smartphone or tablet—they use most in everyday life to access the Internet, we encountered a clear difference between the mobile condition and the two other groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 69.10, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000) on the usage rate of different devices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0894439313483976">Table 10</xref>).

<p>
<sup>a</sup>Some of the respondents reported to have completed the question using tablets (9.5%) or smartphones (1.6%), but we did not exclude these respondents as the survey situation was similar to the normal panel setting.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>To control for the possibility that the response mode affected the answering behavior on this question, we repeated this question a few weeks later (Week 34 in 2012) to the same respondents, but this time to be filled out only on a computer as the respondents are accustomed to doing. And indeed, when these respondents were afterward allocated to their original conditional groups (<italic>n</italic> = 254), the effect disappeared and we could no longer find significant differences between Groups 1, 2, and 3 (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.18, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .739).</p>
<p>The respondents estimated their mobile device use to be higher when the reporting itself was done using the mobile device in question. These results imply that the survey completion mode affects answering behavior when the content of the survey question is related to the mode. One should therefore pay attention to such effects when including mode-related questions.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>In our experiment, we conducted a survey among smartphone and tablet users. We randomly allocated this group to three questionnaire versions: One with a conventional computer-assisted layout, to be completed on a computer; one with a layout adapted for the mobile browsers and to be completed using mobile devices; and a version with a layout similar to that of the mobile version but to be completed on a computer.</p>
<p>The premeasurement showed that usage of mobile devices was highest among younger respondents, supporting earlier research. While the use of smartphones was also related to education and gender, for tablet users these differences were less clear.</p>
<p>When analyzing the response, we found evidence on respondents ignoring the request to complete the survey using a specific mode. Some respondents in the mobile condition had completed the survey using a computer, and some respondents in the computer condition had completed the survey using a mobile device, mainly a tablet. Researchers should therefore take into account that not all respondents are likely to follow the instructions and to use the requested mode to complete the questionnaire, if alternatives are available.</p>
<p>Based on the results on question items on 7-point Likert-type scales, and to a lesser extent 11-, 10-, and 5-point scales, we could find no evidence that completing the survey via the used mobile devices, smartphones, and tablets would lead to differences compared to survey completion via a computer. More experiments on response behavior on larger samples are needed to verify this outcome.</p>
<p>The response rate via mobile devices was lower in our experiment than via the computer, possibly partly due to the fact that the respondents were accustomed to completing surveys on a computer and that the invitation was sent by e-mail, assumingly often read on a computer. The vast majority of the mobile respondents completed the survey at home, and also here were likely to be influenced by the respondents’ habitual survey completion on the computer. Mobile web surveys on nontrained samples and research on the effect of invitations via mobile-only channels, such as SMS to guarantee the delivery of the message on a mobile device, would give a better picture of the readiness of the general population to participate in mobile surveys.</p>
<p>We found that respondents using a mobile device evaluated the survey to last longer than respondents using a computer. The objective survey completion time, based on time stamps, supported these results. This implies that the mobile survey still requires more effort from the respondent, which could be due to lower page loading speed, slower Internet connection, or more difficult task handling. When the respondents evaluated the questionnaire on aspects such as difficulty, clarity, and enjoyment, however, the mobile survey group did not report significantly different satisfaction than the computer-assisted groups. As this evaluation covered only the respondents who had completed the survey, more research on the motivation of nonrespondents and on reasons not to participate in a mobile survey is needed.</p>
<p>When the respondents were asked which device they use most to access the Internet, the usage of mobile Internet initially appeared to be higher among the mobile survey group. When controlling this result by repeating the question later on a computer, this difference disappeared, implying that self-reported mobile Internet use can be affected by the mode used by respondents to complete the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Almost all experiments on the challenges of mobile web surveys emphasize the difficulties due to small screen sizes. However, the average screen sizes are increasing and as earlier research has demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439313483976">Sweeney &amp; Crestani, 2006</xref>), short texts are most effective not only on small screens but on all screen sizes. Accordingly, when the layout was adjusted to suit mobile browsers and the length of the question text was deliberately restricted, no major difficulties on the newer mobile devices were experienced in this respect. In fact, the challenges posed by the limited screen capacity of the newer mobile devices have a lot in common with those of the beginning of the web survey era, when computer screens were of much less quality than today.</p>
<p>Yet, mobile surveys do bring other new problems. As our findings indicate, people like to use their own preferred device to complete an online survey, possibly related to the device on which they read the invitation, which is why limiting surveys to a single type of device may feel unnatural to the savvy Internet user. The heterogeneity of online survey environments keeps increasing through the ongoing development of new devices and the fading distinction between different devices, making it important for researchers to clearly define the term mobile devices in their research. Challenges in controlling the online survey environment in real-world experiments expand. More research is needed to describe how general mobile web usage and mobile survey completion in particular are related, as well as how the general and survey-specific device preferences are related.</p>
<p>When considering research using mobile devices, one should realize that the user group is still limited and does not reflect the whole population. A mobile web survey seems to demand more from the respondent than a computer-assisted survey and is likely to result in lower response rates. The effects of different types of mobile devices and technical parameters such as screen sizes should be investigated in detail, as these might explain some of the results. Finally, we want to point out the need for research on questionnaires using touchscreen interfaces, as these enable new ways to interact with a questionnaire, and may have a strong impact on the respondent experience in self-assisted surveys in the future.</p>
<p>It is possible that the rapid development of the functionalities of mobile devices will affect some of the current problems with mobile web surveys, or is already doing so. As new challenges arise, the evolving mobile Internet clearly prompts an urgent need for much more research on the possible effects of the many choices one needs to make when designing and carrying out a mobile web survey.</p>
