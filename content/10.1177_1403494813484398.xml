<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Nursing home residents represent a frail and multimorbid group of patients. The rationality of the hospitalisation of nursing home patients has therefore been questioned. <italic>Objective</italic>: To investigate hospital referrals of nursing home patients in the municipality of Stavanger, Norway and identify the number of inappropriate referrals and costs. <italic>Methods</italic>: The number of referrals was retrospectively identified by the emergency dispatch centre in the 18 municipalities of South Rogaland in 2011. For the municipality of Stavanger, referring instance, reason for referral, purpose of referral, the existence of an advance care plan, and appropriateness were assessed. Total costs and costs for inappropriate referrals were estimated. <italic>Results</italic>: In Stavanger there were 0.38 hospital referrals per nursing home bed per year as compared to 0.60 in the surrounding municipalities. Of 359 referrals, 78.6% resulted in an in-hospital stay, in-hospital mortality rate was 7.8%, and 7% were assessed as being inappropriate. The costs per referral were estimated to be €6198. <bold><italic>Conclusion</italic>: Stavanger had a lower referral rate than the surrounding municipalities. The results also show that the in-hospital mortality rate and the share of inappropriate referrals were low compared to other studies in the field. Further research is needed in order to evaluate which interventions are effective in improving medical care at nursing homes and thus reduce referral rates.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nursing homes constitute the highest level of long-term care in Norway. Residents in nursing homes often suffer from several medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484398">1</xref>], and about 80% have dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484398">2</xref>]. When primary health care is insufficient to cure or palliate disease symptoms, secondary health care might be required. The purpose of referral to a hospital might be to prolong life, offer palliative treatment, or examine unclear health conditions in order to plan further care management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484398">3</xref>]. However, a hospital referral may also be a result of lack of medical attention, lack of care resources, or the inability to deal with certain conditions like aggression or terminally ill residents in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484398">4</xref>]. In these cases, hospital admissions will not necessarily benefit the patient and can be interpreted as medically inappropriate.</p>
<p>It is an ongoing discussion to what degree nursing home residents should be transferred to a hospital, arguing that hospital admissions represent a burden to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484398">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484398">6</xref>], and also a misuse of resources in a strained healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484398">7</xref>]. In the literature the rate of “avoidable” or “inappropriate” referrals varies between 3.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484398">8</xref>] and up to 59% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484398">9</xref>], and one US study estimates a saving potential of up to 17.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484398">7</xref>]. This significant variance is partly due to the fact that there is no common definition of “inappropriate” cases, and no medical (or ethical) guidelines that facilitate the distinction between “appropriate” and “inappropriate”. In addition, there are important structural differences in the various healthcare systems. In most countries, medical care to nursing home residents is given by primary care doctors, but it is delivered on varying premises, ranging from permanently assigned doctors such as in the Netherlands and Norway to the solution that every resident is followed by his own general practitioner like in Denmark and Germany. Further, contrary to the USA or central European countries where private care is more common, long-term care in Scandinavia is organised and financed by the municipalities, there are few private actors, and out-of pocket contributions are comparatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484398">10</xref>]. This might significantly affect the composition of patient groups in nursing homes and the medical care that is delivered, and thus create different patterns for hospital referrals and also different referral rates.</p>
<p>Two studies from the municipality of Bergen Norway, have recently reported hospitalisation rates of 0.62 and 0.57 per nursing home patient per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484398">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484398">12</xref>], while studies from the USA, Canada, and the UK report much lower rates, from 0.09 to 0.59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484398">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484398"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813484398">15</xref>]. This might be due to Norwegian nursing homes offering a relatively lower level of acute and palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484398">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to investigate the incidence of hospital referrals of nursing home patients from the municipality of Stavanger as compared to the surrounding area and to evaluate referrals in Stavanger with a special focus on the purpose of referrals, the reasons, appropriateness, and costs.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494813484398">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The catchment area of Stavanger University Hospital (SUH) comprises the county of South Rogaland with 18 municipalities and a total of 46 nursing homes. As part of this study, we performed a registration of all 46 nursing homes with the number of nursing home beds and the doctor positions assigned to them. Stavanger is the biggest municipality with 125,000 inhabitants, 17 nursing homes, and a total of 935 beds: 745 long-term beds (permanent residency) and 190 beds for short-term stay and rehabilitation (2–4-week stay of otherwise home-dwelling persons). There is a total of 968 beds in the other 17 municipalities. According to our registration, the average number of doctor positions per nursing home patient is 0.012 in the region outside of Stavanger, while there are 0.016 doctors per nursing home patient in Stavanger.</p>
<p>In Norway, primary medical attention to nursing home residents is delivered by permanently assigned doctors and general practitioners in part time positions. Community-based emergency departments are responsible for delivering medical services outside office hours. In case of the need for secondary care services, nursing home residents can be referred to the emergency room at the hospital, where they either are treated as outpatients or are admitted for an in-hospital stay. Emergent needs for medical attention are channelled by the emergency dispatch centre to either community-based emergency departments or to the ambulance service, which will take the patient to the hospital.</p>
<p>To improve medical care in nursing homes, the municipality of Stavanger has during the last years upgraded nursing home medicine. Since 2005 the number of nursing home doctors has been increased according to recommendations from the Norwegian Medical Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813484398">16</xref>], resulting in less turnover of doctors and a more stable follow up of residents. To further increase the competence among the staff, the municipality offers teaching in nursing home medicine with a special focus on the intensity of treatment and palliative care. A community-based nursing home emergency service offering telephone and ambulatory services 3 hours every evening has also been established (personal communication, Aart Huurnink, 9 September 2012).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813484398">
<title>Case identification</title>
<p>In 2011, all acute referrals of nursing home patients to the emergency department at SUH were included. Cases were identified through the Acute Medical Information System (AMIS) where all transports carried out by the emergency dispatch centre are registered, and personal identification, address, and contact time was provided. Transport by taxi is not captured by this approach. In order to evaluate the incidence of referrals in Stavanger as compared to the rest of the catchment area, we also registered the total number of acute transfers to SUH from all nursing homes in the county of South Rogaland, but without personal identification.</p>
<p>Cases from Stavanger were investigated further by collecting information from the municipal medical file and registration system for care services, CosDoc. Administrative data about the stay at SUH was collected from Nirvaco Medical Systems (NIMES). If the examination of the medical files in CosDoc revealed acute hospital admissions not registered in AMIS (transports not carried out by the emergency dispatch centre), these cases were added (16 cases), and if the files revealed that the person was not a nursing home resident, the case was eliminated (17 cases).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813484398">
<title>Reasons for referral, referring instance, therapeutic purpose, advanced care planning, and appropriateness of referrals</title>
<p>For each referral, the resident’s medical file at the nursing home was investigated by the first author, who has 11 years of clinical experience in hospital and 4 years in a nursing home. The following information was registered: instance of referral, reason for referral, therapeutic purpose, eventual date of death, and whether there existed advanced care planning (ACP) at the time of referral. The ACP is part of the patient’s medical file and states the patient’s wishes according to treatment intensity, like no cardiopulmonary resuscitation (stating “Do not resuscitate”, DNR) or no treatment in the hospital (“Do not hospitalise”, DNH). However, even in case of “DNH”, a patient might still be referred to the hospital for the palliation of symptoms like bone fractures or severe pain. Details about classifications can be found in Tables I and II. We also classified the referrals according to their appropriateness, dividing them retrospectively into appropriate cases, intermediate cases, and inappropriate cases. To our knowledge there are very few studies that define appropriateness of hospital referrals in this patient group in a reproducible way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484398">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813484398">17</xref>]. As we considered that these approaches would not summarise our data in a meaningful way, we chose an approach based on the reason for referral, its purpose, and the existence of an ACP, that categorises the referrals in appropriate cases, intermediate cases, and inappropriate cases, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813484398">Box 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Costs</title>
<p>Information about length of stay (LOS), discharge diagnosis according to the classification of diseases version 10 (ICD-10), and diagnosis-related groups (DRG) was collected from NIMES Costs for in-hospital stay and treatment in the outpatient department were estimated according to the DRG refunding system. As the DRG system does not apply for stays at the mental ward, we estimated these costs based on average cost per in-hospital day which constituted €843 per day (SAMDATA 2012). If the only procedure performed was an X-ray without any further treatment in the outpatient department, costs were estimated to be €33 for normal X-ray and €54 for CT scans (Norsk Lovtidend, HOD). Costs for transport by ambulance were estimated to €202 [18]. Costs are calculated in 2011 prices and expressed in Euro with an exchange rate of 1€ = 7.78 Norwegian kroner (3 January 2011).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The software program PASW 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, USA) was used for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The incidence of hospital referrals was expressed in referrals per nursing home bed per year. The relation between categorical variables like long-term versus short-term beds or different municipalities was explored by the chi-squared test. The relation between continuous and categorical variables was explored by Mann–Whitney U-test to evaluate factors predicting mortality. 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cost data were obtained by bootstrap analysis. Two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the regional committees for medical and health research ethics, Western Norway (registration number 2012/99).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494813484398" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 940 cases were identified, 359 from Stavanger and 581 from the surrounding areas. In the municipality of Stavanger there were 0.38 referrals per nursing home bed per year, while there were 0.60 referrals per bed per year in the surrounding municipalities (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000). The results also show that 282 (76.6%) referrals from Stavanger resulted in an in-hospital stay for a mean of 6.4 days (median 3 days, interquartile range 1–6 days). Hence, the admission rate in Stavanger was 282 admissions per 935 beds, resulting in an admission rate of 0.30 per bed per year.</p>
<p>There was a difference between long-term and short-term care residents, with the latter being referred to hospital more frequently with 0.34 versus 0.55 referrals per bed per year (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000).</p>
<p>Patient characteristics, referring instance, and reason for referral are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813484398">Table I</xref>, while purpose of referral and ACP are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484398">Table II</xref>. Falls were the most frequent reason for referral (81/359; 22.6%), followed by infections (56/359; 15.6%). Of the 56 referrals due to infection, 41 (73.2%) were treated with antibiotics prior to the referral. The majority of cases (57.7%) was referred and treated in order to cure the actual disease. Thirteen cases (3.6%) were referred for terminal care, and in eight cases (2.2%) we evaluated that the referral to the hospital had no benefit for the patient.</p>

<p>An ACP existed for 92 (25.6%) cases, 33.9% of long-term and 5.7% of short-term care residents. In 28 cases (7.9%), the ACP stated DNH. Eleven of these referrals were due to fall-related injuries and four to severe abdominal pain. However, in at least 13 cases, referral to hospital was in contradiction to the ACP, and two died at the hospital. One resident was resuscitated despite of an ACP stating DNR.</p>
<p>There were 28 patients who died at the hospital, 7.8% of all 359 referrals, respectively 11.0% of the 282 admissions. In 10 cases, we evaluated the purpose of these referrals to be terminal care.</p>
<p>Of the 331 patients surviving to discharge, 66 (19.9%) died within 1 month and additional 34 (10.3 %) within 3 months after discharge. The only predicting factor for death within 3 months after discharge was higher age (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.000), while we could not find any correlation to sex, reason for referral, admitting instance, appropriateness, or short-term versus long-term care.</p>
<p>The total costs of acute referrals to SUH from nursing homes in Stavanger amounted to €2,225,128 in 2011, with a mean cost of €6198 per referral (95% CI = €5646 – €6800). About 6% of the total costs were due to patient transport with ambulance. The average cost per nursing home bed per year amounted to €2230 or about 2% of the total yearly costs for one long-term nursing home stay, which according to national numbers amounts to €125,780 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813484398">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Of 359 referrals, 284 (79.1%) were classified as appropriate, 48 (13.8%) as intermediate, and 25 (7.0%) as inappropriate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813484398">Table III</xref> shows the dissemination of costs according to appropriateness.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Stavanger had a lower rate of referrals than the surrounding municipalities with 0.38 versus 0.60 referrals per nursing home bed per year. The mortality rate was 7.8% of all referrals, and 11.0% when only referrals resulting in an admissions were considered. An ACP existed for one-quarter of the residents. Referrals to hospital generated costs of €2230 per nursing home bed per year. Seven percent of all referrals were classified as inappropriate, and these caused 5.9% of the total costs for hospital referrals of nursing home patients. In addition, certain referrals (the intermediate cases) might be prevented by targeted interventions.</p>
<p>This is a population-based study covering one of the biggest municipalities in Norway including detailed information about the referrals of nursing home patients to hospital. The study also assesses the costs of hospital care in this population, and by means of a classification of appropriateness of referrals, the cost-saving potential by preventing inappropriate admissions is estimated. However, one weakness of the study might be that the assessment of appropriateness was performed by one single rater and thus is prone to bias. As there are no official guidelines for defining whether a referral is appropriate or not, we minimised the impact of personal preferences by defining clear criteria for the three levels of appropriateness. Still, three-quarters of the residents had no ACP. This might affect the rate of appropriate versus inappropriate referrals, as referrals in contradiction to the ACP was one criterion for inappropriateness. In addition, cases were identified by the records of the emergency dispatch centre, capturing only transports by ambulance. Sixteen additional cases were identified during the investigation of the patients’ files, indicating that our case identification was not entirely complete. This might lead to underestimation of the referral rate and the total costs.</p>
<p>The referral rate and the admission rate at SUH from nursing homes in Stavanger was significantly lower than the referral rate from the surrounding areas, which have a referral rate more in line with findings from previous Norwegian studies ranging from 0.57 to 0.62 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484398">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484398">12</xref>]. Studies from Northern America reported even lower referral rates, from 0.16 to 0.26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484398">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484398"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813484398">15</xref>]. Comparing healthcare systems in different countries is always challenging, as admission criteria and financial and organisational models vary substantially. However, in this study we found that the hospital referral rate varied significantly in municipalities from the same geographical area. In addition, we found that the in-hospital mortality rate of nursing home residents was lower in Stavanger than reported in previous studies from Norway, Australia, and Spain: 11.0% versus about 16% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484398">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484398">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813484398">21</xref>]. A study from the USA even reports a rate of 27.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813484398">22</xref>]. These diverging findings indicate that referral routines differ substantially not only between countries, but also within the same country and even within the same region. Unfortunately, we had no access to data that allowed a detailed analysis of these findings. We assume that the reasons are complex. External factors like the size of the municipality and the distance from the hospital as well as internal factors like staffing of the nursing homes and the attitude towards hospital referrals might contribute.</p>
<p>As nursing home residents already receive a high level of care, there is an ongoing discussion whether hospital referrals benefit these patients and hence are medical appropriate. Studies discussing this subject report significantly varying shares of inappropriate or avoidable referrals between 3.8% and 59% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484398">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484398">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813484398">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813484398"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813484398">25</xref>]. In the current study, we classified 7.0% of the referrals as inappropriate, which is on the lower end of the scale, probably partly due to a rather conservative criterion for defining inappropriate.</p>
<p>Based on the classification of appropriateness and the cost calculations of hospital referrals, it is possible to estimate the cost-saving potential if some referrals could be avoided. Using a conservative approach including only cases that were assessed inappropriate, saving potentials were calculated to be €130,000 (5.9% of total costs for referrals of nursing home patients), while the saving potentials amount to €355,000 (16.0% of total costs) if we also included the intermediate cases. The latter is in line with a US study that found saving potentials of 17.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484398">7</xref>]. However, some cases might have caused extra costs at the nursing home if they were to be treated there and not at the hospital. This might, for instance, be connected to more advanced diagnostic means, more staff, and also more staff training to perform new procedures or assessments. Further, the intermediate group comprises cases were the given information was insufficient to retrospectively assess appropriateness, for example in cases where there might be ethical dilemmas like respiratory distress or general decline. We would therefore assume that the intermediate category represents a saving potential significantly below 16%.</p>
<p>We could show that the referral rate of nursing home residents to hospital varies within the same region, along with other indicators like in-hospital mortality. The evaluation of the reasons for this finding is beyond the scope of this study. However, our results indicate that the rate of hospital referrals from nursing home is modifiable. According to results from earlier studies the accessibility of nursing home doctors outside regular working hours is effective in reducing the number of referrals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813484398">26</xref>]. Likewise, the existence of an Advance Health Care Directive has proven to decrease referrals due to lower respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813484398">27</xref>]. Future research is necessary to identify effective measures to improve medical care in nursing homes. However, the focus should not be restricted to avoiding inappropriate referrals, but rather be on the special needs of this patient group. Palliative care initiatives like the National Gold Standard Framework in the UK are examples of a systematic and evidence based approach to optimising the care of this patient group, and are suited to form the basis of the targeted education of healthcare staff towards frail elderly residents in nursing homes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings show that Stavanger had a lower referral rate than the surrounding municipalities, and that the in-hospital mortality rate and the share of inappropriate referrals were low. In order to evaluate which interventions are effective in improving medical care at nursing homes and thus to reduce hospitalisation rates, further research is needed.</p>
