<abstract>
<p>Clinical laboratories need to test patient samples precisely, accurately, and efficiently. The latest member of the Roche cobas modular platform family, the cobas 8000 modular analyzer series allows compact and convenient consolidation of clinical chemistry and immunochemistry assays in high-workload laboratories with a throughput of 3 to 15 million tests annually. Here we present the results of studies designed to test the overall system performance under routine-like conditions that were conducted at 14 laboratories over 2 y. Experiments that test analytical performance of the new module were integrated with overall system functionality testing of all modules in different configurations. More than two million results were generated and evaluated for ~100 applications using serum/plasma, urine, or EDTA blood samples. During the workflow studies, eight configurations of the possible 38 combinations were used, covering all available analytical modules. The versatility of the module combinations makes the system customizable to fit the needs of diverse laboratories, allowing precise and accurate analysis of a broad spectrum of clinical chemistry and immunochemistry parameters with short turnaround times. This new system will contribute to the ability of clinical laboratories to offer better service to their customers and support vital clinical decision making.</p>

<body>
<p>By providing essential information to diagnostics and monitoring, clinical laboratories are vital in clinical decision making both in the hospital and out-patient setting. To reliably fulfill these tasks laboratory tests need to be performed precisely, accurately and efficiently. Cost pressure as well as constraints in space and qualified technical personnel continuously increases the need for automation and consolidation of clinical chemistry (CC) tests and immunochemistry (IC) tests in high-throughput serum work areas. By integrating CC and IC, new generation analyzers should also allow shortened turnaround times and the use of smaller sample volumes.</p>
<p>The cobas 8000 modular analyzer series, hereafter referred to as cobas 8000, is a new member of the Roche cobas modular platform family. This high-speed platform is designed to significantly improve overall workflow processes while maintaining excellence in quality and reliability well known from the established Roche MODULAR <italic>ANALYTICS</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2211068212472183">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2211068212472183"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2211068212472183">3</xref></sup> and cobas 6000 platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2211068212472183">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new platform allows the compact and convenient consolidation of CC assays (ion-selective electrode [ISE], spectrophotometry, immunoturbidimetry) and heterogeneous IC assays in high-workload laboratories with a throughput of 3 to 15 million tests per year.</p>
<p>One cobas 8000 configuration consists of up to four analytical modules and is built with a fast rack transport unit, an optional ISE unit (cobas ISE module), two high-throughput CC modules (cobas c 702 and cobas c 701 module), a midvolume throughput CC module (cobas c 502 module), and the IC module (cobas e 602 module). Combinations of those modules offer more than 38 configurations with many choices to tailor solutions to individual laboratory needs. The reagent cassette concept is optimized for high-workload laboratories, using concentrated solutions in compact containers. The high volume of produced data is handled by the integrated Data Manager software.</p>
<p>Here we present the results of five studies conducted to test the overall system performance at 14 laboratories. Almost all analytical performance data including those for method comparisons were generated by using site-specific routine request profiles, allowing us to test the analytical performance as well as the functionality of the whole system under real intended use conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2211068212472183">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Free rack traffic flow throughout the system is supported by independent transportation and return lines. The independent processing line in the ISE and each analytical module as well as the unique MSBs and switch gates at each module further optimize efficient sample routing. Each module can dynamically manage 25 sample racks, including five quality control (QC) racks in an environmentally controlled area in the MSB. Another feature relevant for the high throughput of the cobas c 701 and cobas c 702 modules is the parallel processing of two sample probes, each with a cycle time of 3.6 s, resulting in an effective cycle time of 1.8 s. This is combined with parallel pipetting of four reagent probes, two from each of the cooled reagent storage compartments referred to as “reagent disks” with a capacity for 35 reagent cassettes each. Different from the cobas c 701 module, the cobas c 702 module allows continuous reagent cassette loading during operation via a reagent manager with a capacity of 10 reagent cassettes, integrated on top of the MSB.</p>
<p>All processes within the analytical system are managed by the control unit software, whereas data and workflow management is handled by the integrated Data Manager software. In addition, the Data Manager provides an interface between the instrument, the Lab Information System (LIS), and the Roche TeleService-Net enabling access to, and routing of, remote information and functionality to and from Roche.</p>

<title>Repeatability and Intermediate Precision</title>
<p>The testing protocol was designed to allow comparison of the precision when a test is processed using a single reagent disk (Repeatability) with that when using both reagent disks within a module (Intermediate<sub>Module</sub>) or when using two modules within a dual-module configuration with four reagent disks (Intermediate<sub>System</sub>).</p>
<p>Note that each cobas c 701 module reagent disk is coupled with one sample and two reagent probes, thus generating a disk-specific calibration per test allocation. This experiment was performed during study phase I only with the 11 so-called “core assays” (assays processed per reagent disk on cobas c 701 at all sites in phases I to IIII), AST, Ca, CHOL, CREAJ, CRP, GGT, GLUC, UREA, on cobas c 701 and ISE (Na, K, Cl).</p>
<p>Sample materials were two serum pools for CRP and pools of the normal and pathological controls for the general chemistry analytes, 21 replicates per run, 3 d. Additional repeatability data were obtained by all sites for all assays allocated to one reagent disk during the reference run of the routine simulation precision experiments (see the “Reproducibility in a Simulated Routine Run” section).</p>

<sec id="section6-2211068212472183">
<title>Within-Lab, between-Lab Precision</title>
<p>To capture routine-like precision over a period of 21 d, the daily QC processing in singleton at two or more analytical concentration levels was used. The QC runs were repeated once to simulate two-fold analysis. Within-lab coefficients of variation (CVs) per assigned reagent disk and control material were calculated from the 42 results generated for each assay. Corresponding to the above described Intermediate precision, the 11 selected core assays were tested on all cobas c 701 reagent disks (2–6 units, depending on study site) and on the ISE units over 21 d at nine study sites.</p>
<p>Except for some tests on cobas c 502 requiring assay-specific controls, all assays were tested in this experiment. Site 8 could not perform this experiment because of time and capacity limitations.</p>
<p>For the core assays, the total CV per assay and material was calculated per disk (Within-Lab<sub>Disk</sub>), per module (Within-Lab<sub>Module</sub>), per system (Within-Lab<sub>System</sub>, over two to four disks per system for single and dual cobas c 701 configurations, respectively), as well as over up to nine labs (Between-Lab).

<p>The three materials, calibrator for automated systems (Cfas), Precinorm U (PNU), and PrecipathU (PPU), with different analyte concentration levels were analyzed over 8 h for the following assay groups: electrolytes, Ions (Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, PHOS), substrates (ALB, BIL-D, BIL-T, CHOL, CREA, GLUC, TP, TRIG, UA, UREA), and enzymes (ALP, ALT, AMYL, AST, CK, GGT, LDH, LIP).</p>
<p>At hour 0, the base value was determined in triplicates, followed by single determinations every 30 min over 8 h. The pooled materials were stored at 2 to 8 °C, and 500 µL portions were transferred into Hitachi standard cups 10 min before each measurement series. Each assay was measured on one reagent disk (or ISE unit) only.</p>

<p>A slightly varied version of the Broughton model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2211068212472183">7</xref></sup> was used for this experiment. Three aliquots of a high-concentration sample (h1 . . . h3) were followed by measurements of five aliquots of a low-concentration sample (l1 . . . l5). The sequence was repeated five times. The sample-related carryover median (l<sub>1</sub> – l<sub>5</sub>) is compared with the imprecision of the low-concentration sample for the analyte in question. In addition, the clinical relevance at the diagnostic decision level is assessed.</p>
<p>Analytes with expected high concentration differences as follows were tested on the cobas c 701 analytical module and the ISE unit: CK (~10 000 U/L → ~50 U/L), urinary CREA (~3 g/L) → serum CREA (&lt;1 mg/dL), serum ALB (~40 000 mg/L) → urinary ALB(~20 mg/L), and urinary K (~80 mmol/L) → serum K (~4 mmol/L).</p>

<title>Sample Carryover</title>
<p>Sample related carryover data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 7</bold></xref>. No effects were seen from serum to urinary albumin, from urinary to serum creatinine, and from high to low concentrated CK. An increase of serum potassium results exceeding the acceptance limits was observed after processing urine samples on one of the two installed ISE units, at two of the four sites. Neither the sample itself nor the sample probe was contaminated. The effect was caused by splashing during the sample-aliquot dilution process in the respective ISE units mixing vessel. This phenomenon was corrected in the meantime by sample dispensation optimization with appropriate hardware adjustments and a software update (see postmodification results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 7</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>QC data</title>
<p>Roche quality controls were measured for each assay before every experiment during the whole study period. More than 81 000 QC results were generated during the first three studies over time periods between 3 and 4 mo each. The precision of these measurements is reported in the “Precision: Repeatability, Intermediate, within Lab, and between Lab” section.

Data from 13 of the 14 assays tested are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>. Although uric acid was measured in SRM 909b I and II, the results are not included in this article. In a certificate revision for SRM 909B issued in March 2010, the uric acid values are noted only as guidance and are no longer declared. Median recoveries were as expected for all analytes in SRM materials. The deviations outside the target range of ±5% in the ring trial experiment for Cl is caused by a matrix-related effect due to the low nonphysiological bicarbonate level in SRM 909b I.</p>

<p>In the case of CRP, Roche is using two different CRP reagents (Gen 3 on cobas systems and Gen 2 on COBAS Integra systems). The Gen 2 reagent is standardized based on ERM 472. The Gen 3 reagent is standardized to Gen 2 via a method comparison using patient samples with analyte concentrations over the entire measuring range. This approach results in a close agreement (slope of 1.0) between both reagents in patient sera, whereas recoveries in the reference material differ.</p>

<title>General remarks</title>
<p>Eight different module combinations were used for these experiments incorporating all available analytical modules (cobas c 701, cobas c 702, cobas c 502 and cobas e 602 with ISE 1800 or ISE 900). We present here the workflow aspects analyzed for 14 representative workloads processed on these systems at 12 sites. The key workflow parameters discussed below are request throughput (cumulative requests ordered over time) and sample processing time (SPT; time from request order to final result). Request ordering is initiated when the sample passes the barcode reader just after entering the transportation line (see system schema in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The optimal sample routing within the system is determined by the system software, and the sample is transported accordingly. The sample turnaround time (TAT; time from sample placement on the sample loader to final result) was calculated for some workloads. In this case, manual documentation of the sample load time by the operator was required, whereas all other mentioned time stamps for SPT calculation are captured electronically by the system.</p>
<p>The request patterns represented varied commercial and hospital laboratory needs, including medium- to high-level assay consolidation as well as integration of STAT samples, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 8</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>Four workloads (1, 3, 4, and 9) combine general chemistry plus homogeneous immunoassay (CC) testing with heterogeneous immunochemistry (IC) testing, each on different hardware configurations. CC-only workloads (5, 6, 7, and 8) of ~1000 samples for 29 to 50 applications were processed on three different hardware configurations. Two further CC-only routine workloads were run on dual cobas c 702 configurations with (11) and without (10) automatic reagent loading during operation at the respective sites. One lower-volume workload (2) for general chemistries and specific proteins including EDTA blood challenged the performance when the maximum test volume is assigned to the medium-volume cobas c 502 module in combination with a cobas c 701 module. The integration of STAT samples was investigated on CC-only and CC/IC–combined configurations (STAT 1, STAT 2, STAT 3).</p>
<p>The systems were continually fed with samples while processing the respective workloads. Adherence to a standardized stringent procedure was not specified across all sites, so small feeding breaks resulting in variations between labs and workloads were taken into consideration and deemed acceptable for the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section29-2211068212472183">
<title>CC-only workloads</title>
<p>Despite the varied degree of assay consolidation ranging between 29 and 50 methods, as well as the differing site-specific request patterns (5 and 7 represent hospital laboratories in Australia and Europe, 6 and 8 commercial laboratories in Germany and the United States), we see that the time required to process the requests for the four workloads on dual cobas c 701 or cobas c 702 configurations is quite similar, between 2 and 2½ h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 8</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref>, after 2 h, ~8000 requests were registered for three (5, 6, and 7) of four workloads on dual configurations and about 9000 requests for workload 8. Prior to starting the studies at site 11, the routine workloads were analyzed using the cobas 8000 simulator, a tool that serves as an aid to research and development (RD) staff in identifying the module combinations most suitable to meet the specific laboratory’s needs. Being equipped with the same workflow engine that is embedded in cobas 8000, this simulator allows a real-world laboratory workload analysis, thus supporting the identification of the best fit solution for the lab.</p>

<p>The median SPT for the four ~1000 sample volume workloads was between 14 and 21 min, with &gt;96% processed within 40 min and all samples processed within 1 h. Sample TATs, time from loading on the sample input buffer to final results, are shown for workloads 7 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 6a</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2211068212472183"><bold>b</bold></xref>. All but four of workload 7 samples were ready within 40 min; 95% of samples in workload 8 were completed within 60 min, with reruns included in both cases. The median TATs were 25 min and 37 min, respectively. Although the SPT remains quite stable and reproducible throughout similar workloads (see the median sample processing time for workloads 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 9</bold></xref>), the dwell time on the sample loader prior to sample registration, which is the time added to SPT for sample TAT calculation, depends largely on the sample loading or feeding habits practiced in the laboratory.</p>

<p>If the operator ensures that every empty 75-position tray is immediately replaced with a new one, thus continually using the maximum loading capacity of 300 samples, the higher TATs observed for workload 8 apply. The feeding pattern for workload 7 does ensure continual feeding of samples to the system but without exhausting the buffer capacity of 300 samples in the loader. For processing, the system automatically feeds the samples onto the tracks in the chronological placement order of the trays with up to 75 samples each. Labs can apply the loading practices best suited to their working environment.</p>
<p>For workload 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 8</bold></xref>), the request patterns were modified to simulate maximum utilization of the medium-volume cobas c 502 module in combination with a high-volume cobas c 701 module. The rule of thumb to maintain the efficiency of the cobas c 701 within this combination is allow for maximum 10% of all wet chemistry requests to process on the cobas c 502. For workload 2, it was 11% (438 on cobas c 502, 3845 on cobas c 701, and 629 on ISE). In addition, a sample predilution or pretreatment step was needed for 186 of the 438 specific protein requests. These, however, were balanced out by a similar number (~200) of automatic sample predilutions required for urine chemistries on the cobas c 701 module. The median SPT is 25 min, and all requests were processed within 40 min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 9</bold></xref>). The overall operation time of the cobas c 502 module (2 h 28 min) exceeded that of the cobas c 701 module by 9 min, an idle nonproductive time. Nonetheless, after 1 h, ~2500 requests were registered on this hardware configuration.</p>

<sec id="section30-2211068212472183">
<title>Consolidation of CC and IC</title>
<p>Workloads 1, 3, 4, and 9 are each processed on different hardware configurations and vary in degree of consolidation, with requests for between 2 and 19 ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2211068212472183"><bold>Fig. 5b</bold></xref>). As expected, the processing speed is driven by the number of CC modules. After 1 h, ~3000 requests are ordered on both configurations including one cobas c 701 or cobas c 702 module (3, 4), ~3500 requests on the configuration that also includes a cobas c 502 module (1), and ~4100 requests on the dual cobas c 701 configuration (9). Similarly, the SPTs differ on configurations using a single versus dual high-throughput CC modules for similar workloads (SPT of 18 min for workload 9 using dual cobas c 701 modules versus 28 min for workload 3 using a single cobas c 701). With an increasing number of IC assays being processed, the SPT rises accordingly (median SPT of 37 and 42 min for 4 and 1, respectively). The distribution of CC and IC requests for these four workloads is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 10</bold></xref>. It is interesting to note that 29% of the samples from workloads 1, 4, and 9 have requests for CC plus IC despite the big difference in number of ICs installed at the respective sites. With 19 ICs on the dual cobas e 602 modules used to process workload 4, there is room for further menu expansion on these IC modules, which were both in operation for 20 min less than the cobas c 702.</p>

<title>Application of special features</title>
<p>Automatic reagent loading during operation (“on the fly”) and corresponding automated analysis of QCs stored on board the system, including two hourly auto QCs of all assays throughout a main shift, were investigated during workload 11 on a dual cobas c 702 configuration.</p>
<p>Over the ~6 h operation time, three loading events were automatically triggered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2211068212472183"><bold>Fig. 5c</bold></xref>). The trigger that initiates such a loading event is a user-definable “remaining test count” setting. Various rules are applied to balance the need to sustain maximum system productivity while avoiding unnecessary reduction of the c-pack on-board stability by opening the pack hours before its first use. Workload 10, which is quite similar in size and request pattern to workload 11, was also processed on a dual cobas c 702 but without loading reagents during operation. The comparison of request ordering for the ~2000 samples in both workloads is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 5c</bold></xref>. With three loading events of 7 min each, the resulting module idle time of 21 min is equivalent to ~700 skipped pipetting steps during workload 11. The graph shows that at 4 h, 13 319 requests are registered for workload 11 and 14 137 for workload 10. This delta of 816 requests is very close to the theoretical 700 considering that the workloads are not identical and sample feeding by the operators was not standardized between the sites. The lag phases after 4 h for workload 11 are driven by delayed sample feeding and unloading, not by system inefficiency. Processing of nearly all (99%) samples was complete within 40 min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 9</bold></xref>) for workload 11.</p>
<p>To simulate the impact of a potential longer module maintenance or service action during routine operation on the &lt;701 | 701| 502&gt; configuration, one of the two cobas c 701 modules was masked and workload 8 reprocessed. Because the 26 high-volume assays were mirrored on both installed cobas c 701 modules, it was possible to complete the workload (9019 requests for 50 methods and 1064 samples) with one module masked in ~4 h.</p>
<p>STAT samples were integrated within typical routine workloads at three sites (labs 1, 7, and 12). The time to results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 11</bold></xref>. During the CC-only workloads processed on two different hardware configurations, the median SPTs for STATs were 13 min and 20 min during combined CC and IC workloads.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 13</bold></xref>, a total of &gt;184 000 results using serum, urine, and EDTA blood were generated during these experiments. With the goal to check that the system reproduces results within our acceptance limits regardless of interaction or workload pattern used, all data were visually checked for large deviations using the graphical presentation form as displayed for one example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>. Each obvious deviation was analyzed for potential random or systematic errors. Typical experimental design-related phenomena such as analyte instability or sample evaporation during longer lab bench stand times in combination with use of 0.5 mL volume sample per cup are not considered system-related systematic errors. Of particular interest was to check that, with high consolidation of assays and different sample types (serum/plasma, urine, and EDTA blood), there was no impairment of result quality due to interactions between chemistries, sample types, or concentration ranges.</p>

<p>In addition, the behavior of the system was monitored as to whether or not it reacted to provocations as expected by the operator and if the required guidance to remedy a situation was offered.</p>
<p>Here we present a few examples of identified functionality errors, all resolved by appropriate measures before study close out and system launch. During the group I experiments (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>), unstable communication between the Data Manager and the instrument control unit that led to run interruptions was resolved by a software update tested during the third experiment at each site. Similarly, some provoked sample-related data flags were not transmitted correctly to WinCAEv, and this error was corrected with a software update.</p>
<p>In lab 2, the root cause of one deviant IgM result was identified as interference due to Teflon debris on the cell walls from a misaligned laundry unit. In lab 9, the source of an erroneous cup sensor alarm indicating that a sample carrier was invalid or missing was finally identified as signal interference caused by friction between the sensor wiring and the rack transport belt. Both issues, not encountered at any other sites, were resolved by adjustment to specification by RD service.</p>
<p>Provocations were handled as expected, and routine operation was not negatively influenced by, for example, loading of samples, calibrators, or controls via the STAT port. These samples were integrated in the sample flow quickly without any interruption to the ongoing processes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the system reacts correctly to provoked reagent depletion by a seamless switch to standby reagent packs on cobas c 701, cobas c 502, or cobas e 602 modules or by automatic loading of reagents on the cobas c 702 module. To simulate a potential rack transportation breakdown, the so-called backup port located on each MSB to allow direct rack feeding to the analytical modules was tested by group II. Although system speed is obviously limited in this backup mode, the possibility to analyze all assays is maintained.</p>

Similarly to the previously discussed experiment, the main objective was to test for potential random errors, in this case using fresh human leftover material as samples.</p>
<p>The comparability between modules at all sites was excellent, with minimum scatter, slopes close to 1.0, and negligible intercepts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Practicability</title>
<p>A questionnaire was used for practicability assessment of the new system compared with that used in the routine labs at the first 11 sites. The outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-2211068212472183"><bold>Fig. 9</bold></xref>) shows that cobas 8000 was rated to meet or exceed the evaluators’ expectations in 97% of the total ~2550 completed questions. There was no trend observed for the poorer ratings, but rather individual perceptions on single attributes. Of the few shortcomings reported by more than one site in phases 1 and 2, some were already appropriately modified by software updates before phase 3, such as, for example, a modification that reduced the operator hands-on time for monthly water bath cleaning or implementation of additional QC management features in the Data Manager. The high-speed, well-structured software; compact reagent concept; and excellent analytical performance were the feature clusters best rated by all sites.</p>

<title>Analytical Performance</title>
<p>Despite the high pipetting speed and low sample volumes (e.g., 2 µL in case of the glucose assay), the new instrument produced remarkably reproducible results with only a minor increase of CVs for results processed from four versus one reagent disk.</p>
<p>There was a similarly low impact of reagent disk variations on the 21-day within-lab precision CVs. Even when pooling the data from all sites for calculation of the between-lab precision, an obvious increase of CVs was observed in only few cases.</p>
<p>The method comparison results represent a real-world comparison of the new platform with the established Roche routine instrumentation over about 2 y. A close agreement of results was obtained in the vast majority of assays tested, which is quite remarkable keeping in mind that the samples tested were taken from the daily routine without any preselection and that analysis on cobas 8000 was usually done 1 d later than in the routine.</p>
<p>Only 3 of 40 slope data were slightly outside the strict ±5% or ±10% limits, which can be explained by small but systematic bias effects from different calibrator lots in the case of AST without Pyp (slope: 1.06, median x and y: 23.0 and 24.1 U/L, respectively) and the enzymatic creatinine method (slope: 1.06, median x and y: 77 and 83 µmol/L, respectively) and by the narrow distribution of results in case of the serum Mg data. The median Mg data were in close agreement (0.84 [x] vs. 0.86 [y] mmol/L).</p>
<p>Comparison data from cobas c 502 and cobas e 602 are not listed in this article because the reagents and the analytical properties of these analyzers are identical to cobas 6000 c 501 and cobas e 601, respective MODULAR E 170, tested in earlier studies.</p>
<p>Equally as important as systematic slope data is the reliability of single results. Every data pair was checked for obvious deviations by using the relative difference plots; whenever such deviations were detected, if available, the samples were retested in triplicate on both analyzers. This procedure also allowed identification of the root cause for a larger deviation in almost all cases. Typical reasons for larger deviations were instability of analytes due to preanalytical variations (e.g., K related to hemolysis; glucose, when tested in serum) and systematic deviations of single samples in the case of different methods (identified by reproducible deviations). The method comparison results were obtained during random access conditions corresponding to the various request patterns of the different sites.</p>
<p>No result deviations indicating reagent or sample-related carryover were observed throughout the study, indicating that all measures taken by the manufacturer to avoid such interferences are sufficient to ensure result integrity in a routine environment.</p>

<title>Functionality Testing under Routine-like Conditions</title>
<p>The more features and consolidation power offered by a system, the greater the number of possible interactions the system is exposed to in routine use. With the holistic approach taken to design these studies, a key focus is on testing the overall system functionality in stressed simulated routine conditions. The previously discussed method comparison download experiments were used to compare the results produced on the new system under intended use conditions with the routine results. In addition, ~258 000 results were analyzed from further routine simulation experiments aimed at testing the result reproducibility within the new system itself. Such experiments offer the unique opportunity to identify potential malfunctions that would likely remain undetected using standard protocols.</p>
<p>For any observed systematic errors, such as, for example, the sporadic communication interruptions between the analyzer and data manager, root causes were identified and appropriate countermeasures were taken by the manufacturer. Similarly, the few individual observed random errors were tracked to hardware misalignment and can as a result be avoided in routine operation.</p>
<p>In the presented module-module comparisons, we see the result consistency between modules with fresh sample leftovers tested under random routine conditions. This is consistent with the results reported earlier from the precision experiments using QC material.</p>
<sec id="section39-2211068212472183">
<title>Workflow Analysis</title>
<p>Although the requirements are similar within the different types of laboratories, such as hospital institutes or commercial organizations, all labs are unique. Although cobas 8000 is designed to be customizable to meet all high-volume lab needs, we do have a limited scope, even within such a large study, to test the wide range of variables and their potential impact on workflow.</p>
<p>The primary goal, therefore, was to capture evaluators’ feedback on the key features through which cobas 8000 is designed to bring major benefits to the laboratory, such as speed and compactness, consolidation capabilities, and practicability. The speed of the new high-throughput modules cobas c 701 or cobas c 702 was rated very high by all sites. This high pipetting speed is combined with optimized sample routing determined at the entry point to the system. For every individual sample and rack, the most effective routing is calculated based on the workload situation of each module and the entire unit. As seen in the workload examples presented, this process ensures an optimized testing and traveling time for the transit through the configuration. Similar workload volumes but with varying request patterns are actually completed in about the same time, but the processing curves shown, for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2211068212472183"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref> do differ.</p>
<p>As the time for processing samples is reduced, the samples are released quickly and the overall sample availability is significantly improved. We see (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2211068212472183"><bold>Table 9</bold></xref>) that &gt;95% of samples on CC-only configurations are processed, including reruns, within 40 min. Processing time on combined CC/IC configurations is of course affected by the longer measuring time for ICs, but the advantages of parallel processing on a single platform, like no sample split with reduced waste or less blood draw for the patients, certainly outweigh the slightly higher SPTs, having all results available at same time. Seamless STAT integration is supported by the MSBs and the optimized sample routing.</p>
<p>A further option to consolidate even more assays on a single CC module without needing slots reserved for standby packs is offered by the automated reagent-loading throughout operation on the cobas c 702 module. The low impact of loading on the fly was demonstrated in workload 11, in which 99% of samples were processed within 40 min. By offering user-definable settings to trigger the reagent loading events, this feature can be used to manage either partially or completely the reagent handling on the system. Similarly, the reagent-replenishing throughout operation is available on the medium-volume CC module, cobas c 502.</p>
<p>Combined with auto QC processing at reagent loading or switch, the system can manage all functions and maintain complete control of the quality assurance aspects while reducing hands-on time and increasing walk-away time.</p>
<p>During the workflow studies, 8 configurations of the possible 38 combinations were used, covering all available analytical modules and ~100 different applications for serum/plasma, urine, or EDTA blood. To find the optimal solution that meets the individual needs of a routine laboratory in a real-life setting, the cobas 8000 simulator is applied. This not only helps to identify the best fit module combinations but also supports customization within the module configurations to achieve optimal efficiency within the platform, as demonstrated by the results from laboratory 11.</p>
<p>Equally as important as the fast sample processing with consequent production of a high number of results within a short time is the ability of a system to efficiently manage the large volume of data. The cobas 8000 Data Manager has a complete package with data validation functionalities including rerun and reflex testing and offers various data-filtering and -sorting functions that support efficient data handling. It also offers traceability of all data to corresponding calibrations, QCs, and reagent lots. The comprehensive QC package including graphical presentation of QC results supports the option to block patient results being uploaded to the LIS if QC recoveries are out of range.</p>

<title>Practicability</title>
<p>High pipetting speed, combined with the flexibility for processing all general chemistry and homogenous immunochemistry, makes the new cobas c 701 and cobas c 702 modules true and superior successors to the manufacturer’s predecessor high-throughput MODULAR platform dispensing (D) and pipetting (P) modules. Alone, the freed-up space gain by possible replacement of current instrumentation with the cobas 8000 platform was rated very highly by all sites. Not only the savings in floor space but also the further bonus of reduced reagent storage space requirements plus ease of handling of the newly introduced compact reagent packs with up to 3000 tests each were among the favorite features.</p>
<p>A benefit of the stepwise study approach is no doubt the potential to timely countermeasure some possible disliked features. In this respect, a few shortcomings identified and poorly rated during the routine simulation experiments in phase I were appropriately modified prior to the following phases. Examples are the handling of a rack barcode read error that initially brought the system to an emergency stop or results for standby reagent pack controls not being plotted on the data manager QC charts.</p>
<p>Although the stability of the on-board QC was demonstrated in part I of the study, the associated convenience in combination with automated reagent loading was experienced during the studies using cobas c 702 module combinations. During this study, the manufacturer’s new bilevel multicontrol Precicontrol Clinical Chemistry I and II for all CC methods, including specific proteins, was also used and appreciated as a further step in the reduction of operator hands-on time.</p>
<p>Further features that free up staff for more valued responsibilities in the laboratory are the automated maintenance functions that allow the user-definable combination of instrument maintenance task to be executed automatically at defined times or upon manual initiation.</p>
<p>With the Data Manager, system monitoring becomes more convenient and at the same time offering more transparency, such as traceability information, sample status, and workflow statistics.</p>
<p>The data manager screen is basically a command and control center providing real-time status information from all system components, cobas 8000 modular analyzer instrument, Data Manager, and e-services.</p>
<p>Both the Data Manager and control unit software were rated as being well structured, easy to use, and fast.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this multicenter evaluation, cobas 8000 proved to be a reliable and fast high-throughput platform. The versatility of the module combinations makes the system customizable to fit the needs of diverse laboratories, allowing precise and accurate analysis of a broad spectrum of CC and IC parameters with short turnaround times. Very good agreement between the test results of cobas 8000 and previous established platform generations facilitates the introduction of this new system that will contribute to the ability of clinical laboratories to offer better service to their customers and support vital clinical decision making.</p>
