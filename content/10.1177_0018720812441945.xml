<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low-back pain (LBP) is prevalent in modern society. In the general population, 70% to 85% of all people experience LBP at least once in their lifetime, and it accounts for 12% of all sick days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812441945">Andersson, 1999</xref>). LBP is also one of the most costly musculoskeletal problems. The estimated cost of occupational LBP was $8,321 in 1989 and $8.8 billion in total in 1995 in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812441945">Murphy &amp; Volinn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720812441945">Webster &amp; Snook, 1994</xref>). The total cost of back pain reached $90.7 billion in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720812441945">Luo, Pietrobon, Sun, Liu, &amp; Hey, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Lifting and manual materials handling (MMH) tasks are considered to be associated with LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812441945">Da Costa &amp; Vieira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812441945">Hoogendoorn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812441945">Kuiper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812441945">Schaffer, 1982</xref>). In a study involving 900 back injury cases, lifting and MMH were considered the causes of injury for 567 of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812441945">Bigos et al., 1986</xref>). Different studies estimated that 19% to 66% of all back injuries are related to lifting tasks or MMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812441945">National Research Council &amp; Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>). From the perspective of biomechanics, low-back injury happens when the load applied on a tissue exceeds the failure tolerance of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812441945">McGill, 1997</xref>). Thus, some biomechanical models were proposed to estimate the joint loadings applied on the L5/S1 joint during lifting tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812441945">Arjmand &amp; Shirazi-Adl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812441945">Chaffin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812441945">Cheng &amp; Kumar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812441945">Freivalds, Chaffin, Garg, &amp; Lee, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812441945">Genaidy, Waly, Khalil, &amp; Hidalgo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812441945">McGill, Norman, &amp; Cholewicki, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>A widely adopted measure used to identify the risk of a lifting task and MMH is L5/S1 joint net moment. A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812441945">Marras, Fine, Ferguson, &amp; Waters, 1999</xref>) showed that the moment of external load during a lifting task has the highest odds ratio between high-risk and low-risk MMH jobs. For those studies calculating L5/S1 moment of a lifting task or MMH, some focused on the peak value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812441945">Jiang, Shin, Freeman, Reid, &amp; Mirka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812441945">Lavender, Andersson, Schipplein, &amp; Fuentes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720812441945">Shin &amp; Mirka, 2004</xref>), assuming the injury occurs as soon as the load exceeds the tolerance. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812441945">Callaghan, Salewytsch, &amp; Andrews, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812441945">de Looze, Kingma, Bussmann, &amp; Toussaint, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812441945">Hakkanen, Viikari-Juntura, &amp; Takala, 1997</xref>) calculated the average and/or cumulative L5/S1 joint moment across the entire job, indicating that the cumulative exposure was also considered to be a risk factor of LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812441945">Kumar, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>As L5/S1 joint moment is an important risk factor of LBP, it is necessary to have a valid and reliable method for measuring it. In a laboratory, dynamic L5/S1 joint moments are frequently calculated from the kinematics and body mass of each body segment and the external moment and force at each time instant. These data are usually obtained with the use of complicated equipment, such as opto-electronic or electromagnetic field-based motion tracking systems and force plates. The internal validity and the sensitivity of the laboratory equipment-based L5/S1 joint moments are found to be reasonably good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812441945">Kingma, de Looze, Toussaint, Klijnsma, &amp; Bruijnen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812441945">Lariviere &amp; Gagnon, 1998</xref>). However, since the use of laboratory equipment is not practical for field surveys, dynamic L5/S1 joint moments can be hard to examine for lifting tasks and MMH during field surveys. As a consequence, some studies have started focusing on other portable devices for measuring body movement, such as inertial measurement units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812441945">Faber, Kingma, &amp; van Dieen, 2010</xref>) and ultrasound orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812441945">Marras et al., 2010</xref>), and have compared the L5/S1 moments estimated from those novel technologies with the ones estimated from the laboratory equipment. The applications of those technologies are still limited in many industrial settings, however.</p>
<p>A method that can be used to estimate L5/S1 joint loading during symmetric lifting tasks without depending on laboratory equipment or interfering with the tasks is a video coding system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812441945">Chang, Hsiang, Dempsey, &amp; McGorry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812441945">Hsiang, Brogmus, Martin, &amp; Bezverkhny, 1998</xref>). The main idea is that the lifter’s joint angular trajectory is interpolated from coder-identified major joint angles of postures in a few key frames extracted from video clips of the lifting task. These estimated joint angular trajectory data are then input into a biomechanical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812441945">Chaffin &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>) for estimating the L5/S1 joint loading. Thus, only video clips of a lifting task and a coder are required for performing L5/S1 joint loading estimations. However, there are substantial limitations to this method.</p>
<p>First, previous research has focused only on symmetric lifting tasks, but half of field lifting tasks involve trunk lateral bending and trunk rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812441945">Dempsey, 2003</xref>). Simply applying a 2-D model to 3-D lifting tasks can lead to an underestimation on the L5/S1 joint moment of the sagittal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812441945">Kingma, de Looze, et al., 1998</xref>). To extend this video coding method to asymmetric lifting tasks, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812441945">Coenen et al., 2011</xref>) proposes a video analysis method in which a coder identifies the 3-D orientation of the trunk. Such a method could provide reasonably good estimates on peak total L5/S1 joint moments during lifting tasks. Second, a good observational method should be both valid and reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812441945">Bao, Howard, Spielholz, Silverstein, &amp; Polissar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812441945">Corlett, Madeley, &amp; Manenica, 1979</xref>). The validity and reliability of using video-based coding systems to estimate 3-D L5/S1 joint moments, however, have not been fully investigated. Third, the interpolation method used for regenerating joint angular trajectories and estimating L5/S1 joint moments in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812441945">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812441945">Hsiang et al., 1998</xref>) was a polynomial interpolation, which has been found to be not as good as cubic spline interpolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720812441945">Xu, Chang, Faber, Kingma, &amp; Dennerlein, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we present a video coding system that can be used to estimate 3-D L5/S1 joint moments of 3-D lifting tasks on the basis of video clips. The main goal was to evaluate the validity and the interrater reliability of this system. Various simulated lifting tasks were performed and reference 3-D L5/S1 joint moments were obtained with the use of force plates and an opto-electronic tracking system. The video clips of these simulated tasks were input into the proposed video coding system for estimating 3-D L5/S1 joint moments. The comparison between the motion tracking system–based L5/S1 joint moments and the video coding–based L5/S1 joint moments would provide insight into the validity of this system. Interrater reliability of the video coding system was assessed among the users of this system.</p>

<title>Simulated Lifting Tasks</title>
<p>The kinematic data of body segments during various lifting tasks were derived in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720812441945">Xu, Chang, Faber, Kingma, &amp; Dennerlein, 2011</xref>). The experiment setup in that study is briefly described next for readers’ convenience.</p>
<sec id="section10-0018720812441945">
<title>Participants (lifters)</title>
<p>After signing an informed-consent form, 12 male participants (age 47.5 ±11.3 years, height 1.74 ±0.07 m, weight 84.5 ±12.7 kg) took part in the lifting task experiment. Participants with acute or chronic LBP, surgical history, or leg injuries were excluded from the experiment. The experimental protocol of the simulated lifting task was approved by the institutional review boards of Harvard School of Public Health and Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018720812441945">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The lifting task consisted of picking up a crate (10 kg; width × depth × height = 39 cm × 31 cm × 22 cm) and placing it on a shelf without moving the feet. There were three lifting ranges (floor to knuckle height, floor to shoulder height, knuckle to shoulder height). Furthermore, there were three asymmetric angles of the end position relative to the starting position of the box (0°, 30° to the right, and 60° to the right). All the lifting trials started with the participants standing in front of a plastic crate. The initial horizontal distance of the crate and the lifting speed were chosen by the lifters without constraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812441945">Figure 1</xref>). Two repetitions were performed for each lifting condition. A total of 18 lifts (3 × 3 × 2) were performed by each participant in a full-factorial design with random sequence.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812441945">
<title>Direct measurement and reference L5/S1 moment</title>
<p>Reflective markers were taped on anatomical landmarks of the lifters’ body segments, including feet, shanks, thighs, and pelvis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812441945">Cappozzo, Catani, Della Croce, &amp; Leardini, 1995</xref>). The 3-D space positions of markers during the lifting tasks were measured by a motion tracking system (MotionAnalysis, Santa Rosa, CA) with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The raw 3-D coordinate data were filtered with a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter at 8 Hz. The ground reaction force was measured with two force plates (Model 9286AA, Kistler, Switzerland) and was synchronized with the motion tracking system. Given the measured movement of body segments and the ground reaction force, the reference 3-D L5/S1 joint moment was calculated by the bottom-up method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812441945">Kingma et al. (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>A digital camcorder (GR-850U, JVC, Japan) synchronized with the motion tracking system recorded the lifting task from the side view for each trial and each lifter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812441945">Figure 1</xref>) and generated 216 video clips (12 lifters × 18 lifts). Because 2 video clips were missed during the experiment, 214 video clips were used for the evaluation of the video coding system.</p>

<sec id="section13-0018720812441945">
<title>Video Coding System Development</title>
<p>The video coding system consisted mainly of two components. The first was the coding interface by which the raters determined the key frames from the video clip of a lifting task and estimated the major segment angles shown in the key frames. The other component was the algorithm by which the whole body movement of the lifting task was regenerated on the basis of the estimated major segment angles to calculate the L5/S1 joint moment. These two components are presented next in detail. The flowchart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812441945">Figure 2</xref>) summarizes the system.</p>

<sec id="section14-0018720812441945">
<title>Coding interface</title>
<p>The coding interface has been reported in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720812441945">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). To familiarize the reader, we will briefly explain each step of using this interface. First, the rater retrieves a video clip of a lifting task with a customized program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812441945">Figure 3</xref>). The rater then watches the video clip and selects the frame in which the load is lifted and the frame in which the load reaches the final position. These two frames are displayed on the interface as Frame 1 and Frame 4. The interface then automatically selects Frames 2 and 3 between Frames 1 and 4 with equal time-space between them. The reason four frames are extracted from a video clip is that four key frames can effectively reconstruct the lifting trajectory and 3-D peak L5/S1 joint moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812441945">Hsiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812441945">Xu, Chang, Faber, Kingma, &amp; Dennerlein, 2012</xref>).</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812441945-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>After all four frames are extracted from the video clip, the rater needs to estimate angles of seven body segments: shank, thigh, arm, forearm, trunk sagittal bending, trunk rotation, and trunk lateral bending. The validity and reliability for the observation of these segment angles were found to be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720812441945">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). After the rater estimates all 28 angles (4 frames × 7 segment angles) for a video clip, the interface displays a mannequin whose posture is based on the estimated segment angles, the stature of the lifter, and the anthropometric data of the body segment lengths as a proportion of body stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812441945">Roebuck, Kroemer, &amp; Thomson, 1975</xref>). By comparing the lifter’s posture and the mannequin in the key frames, the rater can adjust the segment angles to better match those of the lifter in the video clips.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720812441945">
<title>Participants (raters)</title>
<p>We recruited 10 raters (age 37.0 ±16.7 years) with knowledge and experience of ergonomics and/or kinesiology to test the video coding system. Each rater used the coding interface to estimate the L5/S1 joint loading for all the 214 video clips. The sequence of video clips was randomized for each rater. Before the experiment, 3 video clips were given to the raters for training. The experimental protocol for the raters was approved by the institutional review boards of Harvard School of Public Health and Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0018720812441945">
<title>Estimation of L5/S1 joint moment</title>
<p>The data collected from the coding interface were the frame sequence numbers in a video clip of the four key frames and the estimated seven segment angles in each of these frames. To estimate the L5/S1 joint moment, the major body segment (shank, thigh, trunk, upper arm, and forearm) lengths and weights, as well as the load weight, were necessary. The segment lengths and the load weights were directly measured, and the segment weights were derived from the body segment circumference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720812441945">Zatsiorsky, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>For each of the seven major segment angles, we applied a cubic spline interpolation to generate the segment angular trajectories on the basis of the frame sequence numbers of the four key frames, recording frequency of the video clip, and the estimated segment angles in the four key frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812441945">Xu, Chang, Faber, Kingma, &amp; Dennerlein, 2010b</xref>).

Since only the sagittal angles of the shank and thigh were estimated from the coder interface, the rotation matrices of these segments were actually a 2-D rotation matrix with 3-by-3 form. Although the rater also estimated only flexion angles for the arms, arm orientations were 3-D because of the asymmetry in trunk 3-D motion. The full body movements were then reconstructed with the rotation matrix of each body segment and fixed segment lengths.</p>

The video coding system–based L5/S1 moment in the sagittal plane followed the trend of the reference; however, it is smoother (has fewer local minimum and maximum values) than the reference, as it is based on a cubic spline interpolation through only four key frames. Considering that the moment in the sagittal plane was dominant in the total L5/S1 moment, both the estimated and the reference total L5/S1 moments were close to the moment in the sagittal plane. The total moment was the vector summation of the L5/S1 moments of the three planes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, a video coding system was examined for estimating 3-D L5/S1 joint loading during 3-D lifting tasks. Its validity and interrater reliability were then investigated. The correlation coefficient and linear regression indicated that the estimated peak moment and the estimated cumulative moment in the sagittal plane were positively correlated to the reference value yielded by the motion tracking system, with acceptable absolute errors. The ICC showed that when different raters used this system, the estimated 3-D L5/S1 moments showed a general agreement between the raters.</p>
<p>Among the estimated peak and cumulative moments of the three orthogonal planes, the ones of the sagittal plane correlated best with the reference values. Their histograms of the estimation errors indicated that the overall numbers of overestimation and underestimation were about the same. Further analysis revealed that after averaging for 18 lifts and 12 lifters, the percentage error for the peak moment in the sagittal plane ranged from −3.7% to 3.2% across raters, and after averaging for 18 lifts and 10 raters, it ranged from −15.4% to 12.6% across lifters. Analogously, the percentage error for the cumulative moment ranged from −10.0% to 23.3% across raters, which was close to the error range found in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720812441945">Sutherland, Albert, Wrigley, &amp; Callaghan, 2008</xref>) and from −9.7% to 12.0% for different lifters.</p>
<p>If <italic>n</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 2, . . . 10) raters were randomly selected and the averages among those raters were used as the estimated moments, the range of the percentage error for the moment would be reduced as the number of selected raters increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0018720812441945">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the overall estimated peak and cumulative moment of the sagittal plane were unbiased in general, although there might be overestimation or underestimation for a specific rater or for the video clips of a specific lifter. Using an average of multiple raters could reduce the error of the estimated moments.</p>

<p>The estimated moments of the coronal and rotational planes were not well correlated with their references. Because the video coding system is based on only four key frames of the video clips from a single viewing angle, it is not as sensitive as the motion tracking systems on estimating the moments with small amounts of change. For the lifting tasks performed in this study, the large moment of the sagittal plane attributable to gravity and the strong upward acceleration can be estimated with the video coding system, whereas the small moments of the coronal and rotational planes cannot be estimated well. As the moments of the coronal and the rotational planes were not dominant in the total L5/S1 moment for the simulated lifting tasks, the estimation error of these two planes did not account for the majority of the estimation error of the total L5/S1 moment. In the real world, some lifting tasks may contain larger moments in the coronal plane and the rotational plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812441945">Faber et al., 2009</xref>). Since we did not fully investigate whether the proposed video coding method could catch large moments in the coronal and rotational planes, using the current video coding method for those lifting tasks might result in a more erroneous total L5/S1 moment estimation.</p>
<p>Because the moments of the sagittal plane accounted for the majority of the total moment for the simulated lifting tasks, the correlation coefficients and the absolute estimated errors of the total L5/S1 moment were close to those of the moment of the sagittal plane. The absolute estimated error of the total L5/S1 moment was in the same range as shown in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812441945">Coenen et al., 2011</xref>). A further analysis was performed to see whether identifying only the trunk sagittal angle in the key frames could provide a good estimate on the total L5/S1 moment. The rater-identified trunk rotational angle and the trunk lateral bending angle were set to zero to simulate the case in which the rater would identify only the trunk sagittal angle. In this way, the regenerated body movement that was used to estimate the L5/S1 joint moment became a 2-D movement, and the total moment was the moment in the sagittal plane. The results show that identifying only the trunk sagittal angle could also provide a robust estimate on peak total moment and the cumulative total moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0018720812441945">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812441945-fig8.tif"/></fig>
<p>A reason for this finding is that for most of the lifting tasks in the present study, the peak L5/S1 moment and the majority of the cumulative L5/S1 moment occurred at the beginning of the lift, when the body movement was almost symmetric and in the sagittal plane. Thus, for such lifting tasks, a 2-D video coding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812441945">Chang et al., 2003</xref>) would be robust enough to estimate the peak and cumulative total moments. However, it should be noted that for 3-D lifting tasks with more asymmetry in the starting position, ignoring the trunk lateral bending and trunk rotation could introduce significant error in the L5/S1 joint moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812441945">Kingma, de Looze, et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The ICC coefficients revealed that the proposed video coding system can provide a reliable estimate (ICC ≥ 0.8) on the total L5/S1 moment. When the raters watched the same video clip, they had a good agreement (ICC ≥ 0.8) on the estimated peak and cumulative L5/S1 moments of the sagittal plane. For the moments of the coronal and rotational planes, although the ICC coefficient did not show a strong consistency among the raters (0.4 &lt; ICC &lt; 0.8), the pooled standard deviations were in a limited range. This finding means that although the raters did not agree with each other for the moments of these two planes, the magnitude of their disagreement was limited. Consequently, because the raters agreed with each other on the moment of the sagittal plane, which contained the majority of the total L5/S1 moments, and the disagreement on the moments of the other two planes had a limited range, the total L5/S1 moments had a good consistency among different raters.</p>
<p>The error of the estimated moments mainly consisted of two parts. The first error source was the four-point cubic spline interpolation applied on the Euler segment angles. Compared with the measured angular trajectory, such interpolation yielded less than a 10° error in terms of root mean square error on the Euler segment angular trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720812441945">Xu et al., 2010b</xref>). When these erroneous segment angular trajectories were used to calculate the 3-D L5/S1 joint moment, the error of the 3-D L5/S1 joint moment ranged from 11 Nm to 22 Nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720812441945">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). The second error source was the raters’ perception. When the raters identified the segment angles with the interface of the proposed video coding system, the average identification error for different body segments ranged from 4.4° to 14.7° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720812441945">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). These perception errors were then introduced to the segment angular trajectories during the interpolation.</p>
<p>A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812441945">Andrews &amp; Callaghan, 2003</xref>) indicated that the percentage error of the cumulative low-back moment was less than 3% when the video sampling rate was as low as two frames per second. In the current study, although the video sampling rate varied for each video clip since four frames were extracted for the video clips with different time lengths, the mean video sampling rate was 2.30 ±0.46 frames per second, which is comparable to the sampling rate in that previous study. However, the percentage error of the cumulative L5/S1 moment in the current study was 17%, which is much larger than the percentage error found previously. This finding could be attributable to the two different reference moments adopted by the two studies. Whereas the previous study used a video-based 2-D static biomechanical model as the reference moment, the current study used a tracking system–based 3-D dynamic biomechanical model. The difference between the two references needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>In addition, the lifting cycle started from the initial upright standing posture in the previous study, whereas it started from liftoff in the current study. Since the overestimation and underestimation tended to cancel each other out across the lifting tasks in Callaghan and Andrews (2003), a shorter lifting cycle in the current study may have inflated the percentage error of the cumulative total L5/S1 moment.</p>
<p>It should be noticed that the validity and the reliability of the proposed video coding system were examined with only limited and well-controlled lifting tasks in the present study. These laboratory lifting tasks were within a confined range, starting from a symmetric lifting origin without foot movement, and represented a limited lifting range with limited dynamic variability. The validity and reliability could be altered when using this video coding method for real-world lifting tasks with a free movement of the body. For example, in many industry jobs, the lifters move their feet during lifting tasks. Although the body movement with respect to feet could still be regenerated, such body movement would be in a noninertial frame of reference, and fictitious force would need to be considered during the L5/S1 moment calculation. As the lifting speed was chosen by the lifters, only a slight to moderate dynamic component was contained in the total L5/S1 moment. It is still questionable whether this video coding system can provide a good estimate for the lifting tasks with fast lifting speeds, since the algorithm of body movement regeneration and the sampling speed of a conventional camera may be not suitable for fast movement. To generalize the current results, more lifting configurations need to be performed for evaluating the proposed video coding system.</p>
<p>There were a few other limitations to this study that need to be addressed. First, only raters with ergonomics or kinesiology backgrounds were recruited for the segment angle identification. It is unclear whether the results can be generalized to an inexperienced population. Second, unlike 3DSSPP (University of Michigan 3D Static Strength Predication Program), which allows the raters to input 3-D joint angles for shoulder and hip joint, the current video coding system did not consider the upper-arm and thigh abduction angles. Upper-arm abduction can lead to a shortened moment arm of the load, and thigh abduction can alter the perceived segment angles of lower extremities. Identifying the upper-arm and thigh segment angles in 3-D, however, could be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812441945">Krosshaug et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812441945">Lu, Waters, Werren, &amp; Piacitelli, 2011</xref>). Third, markers attached on the lifters may help the rater to identify the center of the joints. In a video clip of a real-world job, the clothes a lifter wears may make it harder to determine the positions of the center of the joints. All these limitations should be further investigated in future research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the validity and interrater reliability analyses show that the proposed video coding system could provide a relatively good estimate of total L5/S1 joint loading on the basis of side-view video clips of simulated lifting tasks.
