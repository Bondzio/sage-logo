<abstract>
<p>This article locates health care and technology within the shifts in capitalist evolution from welfare to neoliberal development and examines why the concept of Comprehensive Primary health care has been distorted by the market to varying extents globally. Its focus is on India’s planning process where the thrust is to transform health services into commodities and tools of extraction of profit to which all levels of health care are subordinated. Since the 1990s, all Plans, official planning committees and legislations are meant to mould services in this direction. Instead of an integrated health service with primary health care getting support from the secondary and tertiary, the current thrust of the planning process has been to fragment health service into independent components—UHC, tertiary care and NRHM—in the name of providing rural and urban health services. In each of these strategies, public–private partnerships, commercialisation and appropriation of the public resources are the dominant trends. UHC thus no more remains the state-led integrated and inclusive service but a Trojan horse of the neoliberal strategy.</p>

<p>Promises made by governments at a given point of time may not be as realistic as they sound specially, if the ambitions of planning for a given sector appear contrary to the overall trends. A careful analysis of the content and historical continuities helps to assess how realistic they are. This is an examination of the acceptance of Universal Health Care (UHC) by Indian policy-makers by briefly reviewing the historical contexts of (a) capitalist development and the place of welfare and technology therein; (b) the Indian context of UHC; and (c) recent policy efforts at achieving UHC. This is an attempt to highlight the present trends and the challenges.</p>
<sec id="section1-0049085713493037">
<title>The International Context</title>
<p>High growth rates in capitalism came with low employment and welfare and were challenged by the socialist system despite its lower growth rates. In the 1930s when capitalism faced its first crisis, it used the strategy of state investment into welfare sector to tackle market stagnation and solve the problem of unemployment. Thus, welfare too became the political face of a capitalist alternative to the socialist model; a model where capitalist states regulated markets and invested in it. The politics of solidarity in Europe, cooperation within the western block, congenial international arrangements between the US and its allies and unequal terms of trade with the ex-colonies gave some stability to the capitalist order under US leadership. It offered consumerism and aid to its slow-growing periphery—countries that were no more colonies but were reintegrated as primary producers and as external markets. Though it is also argued that wars and the ensuing production and arms sale were greater forces in the making of this system rather than welfare, it is accepted that welfare sector expansion played an important role in rejuvenating economy. The emergence of institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) no doubt helped concentrate power in the hands of the western block over 1930s to 1960s, where most of the trans-national corporations were located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049085713493037">Beaud, 2004</xref>: 213–26).</p>
<p>The search for new markets created inter-imperialist conflicts within capitalist economies. The hegemony of the US control over this search was threatened and the oil crisis added to the woes of the Western countries which intensified the business of loans and aid and fresh wars in West Asia. Yet, it failed to contain the next global crisis. The Asian countries, despite their relative economic resilience, started getting trapped in the debt burden!</p>
<p>Capitalist economies failed to retain their growth rates which fell from 4.9 per cent in 1960s to 2.9 per cent in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0049085713493037">Schmidt &amp; Hersh, 2000</xref>). The system had no option but to revert to surplus extraction without welfare—the neoliberal model of the 1970s. The collapse of the USSR and absence of its ideological resistance helped this shift. Lowered demands reduced profitability of production leading to the growth of finance capital which maximised profits through constantly shifting investments in global production sites making speculation rather than production the key to profits. Information technology became the instrument of this growing phenomenon of finance capital. To control peripheral economies, lending and trade on unequal terms became instruments for extraction of profits by the international financial and political institutions. The North, specially the US, protected its own agriculture and labour to the extent possible and attempted to practice austerity, the ex-socialist states were forced to face the consequences of the economic shock and the developing periphery of the capitalist system was offered Structural Adjustment Policies (SAP). In the process, many countries that constituted the periphery were forced to undermine their welfare sectors and use them for extraction of surplus. Transforming the structural contours of infrastructures for health and education sector and reinvesting in them became a policy alternative. The strategy was to deepen the links between public and private sectors, shift state subsidies to private sector, focus on technology-based services (with promotion of hi-tech) and commoditise them, and create low cost alternatives for the poor to contain social unrest. Thus, balancing corporate interests, elite demands for personalised hi-tech services and needs of the majority were attempted. The interest in welfare markets and poverty reduction was again revived in the neoliberal model of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049085713493037">Bello, 2002</xref>: 91–106).</p>
<p>A few interesting lessons can be drawn from this brief history. First is that historically, welfare has been the field of action in the two major global economic crises; in one, it was the field for investment and in the other, the focus of financial cutbacks and restructuring that revived revenue generation! Second, technology played a crucial role in both eras. The outburst of new technologies during the industrial revolution led to absorption of labour and expanded employment, making welfare possible by increasing paying capacity. The nature of technological inventions in sectors such as medicine (antibiotics, vaccines, chemicals for vector control, nutritional supplements), drinking water supply (filtration plants and piped water supply) and sanitation (sanitary pits and waste disposal technologies) and transport (roads, railways, bus systems), made extensive population coverage possible and economically feasible, thereby scaling up these services. The second crisis of the 1970s preceded by the electronics-based communication revolution, was tackled partially by this very technology for faster movement of financial capital across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0049085713493037">Perez, 2002</xref>); it increased wealth without actually increasing production. The invention of the chip revolutionised the invasive power of medical technology, made it more individualised, costly and restrictive of employment within the sector. This character discouraged scaling up of its services that concentrated in the medical markets for those who could afford it or in tertiary care public institutions. The old technologies were downgraded or discarded in the name of modernity and advancement, irrespective of their relevance in the context of countries of the periphery! These new technologies backed by Health Sector Reforms (HSR) helped promote loans, international trade and private insurance systems in medical services and served the interests of the corporate sector, not necessarily the public health interests of these countries.</p>
<p>These trends have had a detrimental effect on the welfare sectors of the countries constituting the periphery of the capitalist system. SAP meant rollback in welfare sector including health, handing over medical care to private sector, opening public hospitals to private investments and their commercialisation, casualisation of workers in the name of efficiency, public private partnerships and techno-centric focus. This helped deepen the links with global market and between public and private sectors, penetration of local markets by multinational corporations, shifts of subsidies from public to private, commoditisation of health services and change of role of the state from commanding to overseeing and stewardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0049085713493037">Qadeer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It was inevitable that these policies unfolded differently in different countries given their historical and political contexts and political orientation. Latin America that accepted SAP much earlier as well as South Africa had a different trajectory of building their welfare sectors as compared to India. Their democratic systems were relatively more inclined to limit the weakening of welfare due to reforms and invested more in health sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0049085713493037">Patrick Heller Brown University, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0049085713493037">World Bank, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0049085713493037">2006</xref>) even though hi-tech curative services dominated and concerns for equity remained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0049085713493037">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0049085713493037">2</xref></sup> Woven into the evolutionary story of its consolidating elite—the landlords, the industrial bourgeoisie and the emerging middle classes—India’s official acceptance of SAP not only further integrated the country into the periphery of the capitalist system but also set the stage for a major transformation of its welfare sector including health sector. The neoliberal challenge to expand and transform the scope of the medical market compelled governments to ignore Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) and opting for UHC. Any analysis of UHC in contemporary India therefore, cannot be serious without locating it in this historical context and linking it up with the neoliberal strategies of the Indian state—now opting out of its commitments to CPHC, without openly rejecting it.</p>

<title>The National Context of UHC for India</title>
<p>The concept of universality in health services is not new to India. The British realised the importance of epidemic controls for self-protection and economic expansion and winning over people for consolidating the regime and in the latter half of their rule, started introducing services for the common man. The nationalist movement further pressed them to implement welfare policies and in 1942, the Bhore Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049085713493037">GoI, 1946</xref>) was set up by the British to evolve a blue-print of health services for the country. The Five-year Plans used some of its recommendations, the Mudelair Committee Report (1961) reviewed the achievements, and the government of India accepted the Alma Ata Declaration on CPHC that was to be people oriented, based on needs and affordable technology, at the core of the developmental process, and funded and provided by the state (WHO, 1978). In these efforts to achieve universality, the two core principles were free services for all and state provisioning.</p>
<p>While the Bhore Committee was the blueprint till the 5th Plan, from the 6th and the 7th Plan onwards, medical care was opened to non-governmental and private sectors. Significant expansion of the private sector from the 1970s onwards and increasing state subsidies for it made it an important player after the mid-1980s. The Bhore Committee lost its attraction for the state which formally accepted SAP and the first set of HSR in the early 1990s bringing down the investment in health to 0.96 per cent, 0.88 per cent and 0.91 per cent of GDP over 1991–92, 1995–96 and 2003–04, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0049085713493037">Rao et al., 2005</xref>), opening medical care to markets, introducing user fee and contractual services in public institutions and public–private partnership (PPP). This first phase of reforms based on receding state control did not mean retreat of the state (as is often professed), but a much more hardened state, reengineered as the safety net for capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049085713493037">Lang, 2002</xref>) and nicknamed as the ‘steward’! Its direction became anti-poor, anti-welfare and least concerned about the prevailing hunger even among children as is evident from the inability to meet the Supreme Court’s directives on hunger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0049085713493037">3</xref></sup> This transformed state, through consistent policy changes, consolidated the markets and the interests of those who had access to it. It is therefore heavily guided by class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0049085713493037">Patnaik, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Social and political pressures and conflicting interests within the government did bring about some limited pro-people policies and programmes such as National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Right to Information Act. In services however, the trend to push for market expansion and partnerships with private sector prevailed. The WHO through the Commission on Macro Economics and Health heralded the second phase of HSRs that proposed investing in health (WHO, 2001). This was a measure to support higher growth rates in economies in distress through commoditisation of health services and its techno-centric growth rather than to improve equity in public health. The slogan of inclusive development was used by the government’s flagship programme, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), promising full coverage to the rural population. In reality it reduced CPHC to ‘essential’ primary level care (limited to reproductive health and family welfare)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0049085713493037">4</xref></sup> within districts. The district’s secondary level institutions were given autonomy at the cost of their service links with tertiary level institutions, liberating tertiary public institutions from their referral responsibilities to join the market. This autonomy also meant institutional growth guided by the market pressures rather than the priorities of population’s epidemiological needs. Thus, the more paying services grew at the cost of a more balanced expansion of services.</p>
<p>The achievements of NRHM did not match the accepted UN millennium goals where apart from halving ‘extreme poverty’ by the target year 2015, child mortality (under five) was to be reduced to 2/3, MMR to 3/4, and HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria were to be combated (though in collaboration with the pharmaceutical companies) and sanitation and drinking water supply were to be improved with better technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0049085713493037">5</xref></sup> Thus while it distorted the structure, its performance was inadequate. A recent review indicated some success in improving drug supplies, increasing the number of functional PHCs in addition to creating accredited social health activists (ASHA). It pointed out that NRHM never received the required financial support of ₹900 per capita and functions with an allocation of only ₹270 per capita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0049085713493037"><italic>The Hindu</italic>, 2011</xref>). This is in contrast to India’s defence expenditure being ₹164,415.49 crores for the year 2011–12<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0049085713493037">6</xref></sup> inevitably impacting inputs into welfare and bringing health expenditure to ₹28,353.06 crores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049085713493037">CBGA, 2012</xref>: 30) for the same period.</p>
<p>In this milieu of contradictory pressures from donors to restructure health sector and invest in it and from popular movements to consider health and food security a fundamental right, the Indian state shifted its commitment from CPHC to UHC! The latter was defined by the High Level Expert Group as follows (camouflaging differences between the two concepts):
<disp-quote>
<p>Ensuring equitable access for all Indian citizens in any part of the country, regardless of income level, social status, gender, caste or religion, to affordable, accountable and appropriate, assured quality health services (promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative) as well as public health services addressing wider determinants of health delivered to individuals and populations, with the Government being the guarantor and enabler, although not necessarily the only provider, of health and related services. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2011a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the case studies though, of Brazil and South Africa that accepted reforms and were referred to earlier, it is evident that despite high investments in health, equity remained an issue while medical markets flourished. How will India face this dilemma is unravelled by the policies that unfolded after the year 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0049085713493037">
<title>Contemporary Official Strategies to Provide UHC in India</title>
<p>The preamble of the Draft National Health Bill was a rather lofty document promising, ‘protection and fulfilment of rights in relation to health, and wellbeing, health equity and justice, including those related to, all the underlying determinants of health and health care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049085713493037">GOI, 2009</xref>). It granted health as a fundamental human right that requires an overarching legal framework but the framework focused only on responsibilities of state as a steward not as provider. Explicit definitions of terms were neglected by the Bill making multiple legal interpretations possible. For example, it used terms such as essential public health system, essential health facilities and health care services but did not make explicit their boundaries or, which of these would be universal! The understanding of universal access was monitory—financial support for approaching a provider, public or private—affordable for the state, not actual services.</p>
<p>While certain key social determinants were a part of the core responsibility of the state (safe drinking water, housing, sanitation, food), neither minimum standards to be achieved for these were spelled out nor were specific mechanisms set up to ensure inter-ministerial convergence. Third, the Bill was more concerned with the private providers and did not specify the responsibility of the public sector except for its role in public health services for the marginalised. The issue of universalisation therefore remained vague and devoid of a time plan. Fourth, by putting the private and public providers in the same basket of an integrated system, the Bill ignored not only the basic contradictions of the two but also tilted the balance in favour of profits for the private sector by ensuring payments for services by the state without articulating shared objectives or conditions and liabilities of this partnership. Fifth, the Bill proposed State and district level Public health Boards to implement obligation, evolve rules and regulations for recruitment from the open market, develop mechanisms for PPP and empower decentralised monitoring committees, but no principles for this implementation or regulation were articulated. No institutional redressal mechanisms for non-medical services like drinking water, sanitation, etc., were mentioned nor schedules, by-laws and rules were circulated. In other words, the Bill remained a policy document of the steward—the agency in service of—rather than a law for—the private sector.</p>
<p>Following the Bill, the 12th Five-year Plan Approach Paper, apparently oblivious of the financial cutbacks on public sector in health and the ensuing loss of its pride and prestige, lamented about the sector’s lack of capacity to deliver services! Ignoring failures to contain malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and filariasis, it proposed expansion into new areas like handling deafness, care of the elderly, oral florosis, mental diseases, cancer, etc. It limited prevention to education and counselling ignoring the conditions of poverty. While it proposed participation and community based validation for the primary level services, not a single thought was spared for the regulation of tertiary institutions of the private sector that are at the core of the business of medical tourism! Promising more resources, insurance system, training and expansion of health manpower and drugs, the approach paper accepted that publically financed health care does not necessarily mean provisioning of services. It emphasised the virtues of public–private partnerships, publically financed insurance schemes such as the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), of outsourcing diagnostics and of a universal health care system on the same lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2010, the Planning Commission set up a HLEG that laid out a plan for rebuilding health care services for UHC. While the conceptualisation of content and structures was not much different, the key difference from CPHC’s underlying principles was that the state was fully responsible for ensuring access but for provisioning it could use all of the private providers as partners under contract. The main challenges thrown up by the definition were (a) resource mobilisation for strengthening of public sector and subsidies for the private providers; (b) working out the integrative processes within the public sector programmes and between public and private sectors; (c) the regulatory mechanisms of the two sectors and conditions for partnership; (d) time plan for achieving universal care; (e) prioritising the needs of those below poverty line and those sitting on it (an equal proportion); and (f) defining the private partner’s responsibility in national disease control programmes, maintaining national health statistics and monitoring mechanisms. To handle these, the HLEG upheld the principle of universality, equity and higher investments in health sector. It was clear that the state must be ‘primarily and principally responsible for universal health care which is an entitlement to comprehensive health security’. Hence public sector services must be strengthened, improved and brought centre stage to ensure ‘access and services’ to all sections of the people. They recommended that user fees in public institutions should be discontinued; participation of citizens must go beyond existing forms of community involvement in preconceived programmes of provisioning and monitoring health care. It was argued that UHC could succeed only if it was founded on common interests of all sections, ‘social solidarity and cross-subsidisation across classes’. Hence, it proposed a single universal method of financing through general and differential health taxation and recommended that ‘70 percent of it should go to primary health care’.</p>
<p>Despite these positive recommendations, four basic problems are noteworthy. The recommendation that to augment the services, private sector institutions and individuals could be contracted-in under ‘clearly prescribed contractual conditions’ may sound feasible but given the present balance between private and public sectors and their non-existent regulatory mechanisms, it was impractical. It did not follow any analysis of either the divisions within or the nature of private sector or where best regulated linkages are feasible. Countries like Sri Lanka have successfully used their primary providers to help in primary level care while the state focused on building an efficient and well regulated secondary and tertiary level services in public sector offering effective, epidemiologically appropriate services. Such a system provides professional and moral authority to the state’s regulatory mechanisms. Given a relatively undermined public sector in India that itself needs to evolve, the licence for partnership could act as a Trojan horse for the masters of industry, waiting to transform fully, need-based tertiary care into a full-fledged medical market. An open proposition of PPP—even if conditional—at all levels without strengthening state services opens spaces for the powerful corporate sector that has been pressing the government for spaces at all levels of services to earn huge revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049085713493037">CII and McKinsey, 2002</xref>: 93–118).</p>
<p>The second problem area is the package of services at different levels itself which is left to the experts who till date have not found answers to the challenge of integration of vertical programmes, of grasping the boundaries of systems covering medical service, health care service and comprehensive health. They have stuck to fertility control programmes based on technology and failed to locate fertility within the same social determinants that cause ill health. Similarly, they continue to mistake primary level health care with comprehensive primary health care, are dazzled with hi-tech in medical care and the norms of care set by corporate hospitals. As a vision document, it was necessary to set guidelines for developing the package using epidemiological reasoning for technological choices at different levels.</p>
<p>Third, the recommendations totally ignore the vast presence of traditional practitioners in the country and the fact that in 14 major states, about 20–98 per cent households reported using them in the past 3 months and in five of these the use was 60–98 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0049085713493037">Ritu Priya &amp; Shweta, 2010</xref>: 129–40). Equally disturbing is the neglect of the present system of medical education which does not sensitise doctors to the prevailing national dilemmas of universalising health care. Taught to judge services through international standards, doctors are encouraged to migrate to achieve those!</p>
<p>Fourth, while health security is inclusive of a broad range of welfare services, these are left to overall planning without confronting the extent of non-availability of food, drinking water, housing and sanitation and its impact on health. By ignoring the constraint these social determinants impose on achieving health through technology-based services, the group of experts remained confined to intra systemic techno-managerial solutions giving them priority over social and structural issues. UHC then might achieve universality of access but not necessarily health for all!</p>
<p>The Steering Committee for Health constituted by the Planning Commission to guide the 12th Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2012a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0049085713493037">7</xref></sup> while considering the recommendations of HLEG, dropped the word public health from the definition, chose to ignore its key recommendations, criticised it for ignoring traditional systems and found it ‘not comprehensive’ as it focused only on UHC with CPHC at its core!</p>
<p>Low financial input and dependence on insurances, PPPs and pressure on states to contribute remained its financial strategy. It planned for a reduction in Out of Pocket Expenses (OOPE) from 71 per cent to 51 per cent by the end of the plan and saw UHC as EHP of clinical services provided by in-patient and ambulatory care covering ‘RCH, emergency services, essential medicines for most of the disease burden in the country’. It proposed pilot UHC projects in one district of each state through ‘managed care’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0049085713493037">8</xref></sup> enrolling households under empanelled providers, both public and private. They would be credited for the cash-free services they provide by a system of per capita capitation fee. It appears that undue urgency for UHC rather than a long-term perspective guided the Committee along. It had a flawed notion of public health itself separating clinical care from all other activities of the sector even though it claimed a ‘systemic approach’ and expressed concern about ‘the growing reliance on private providers’.</p>
<p>Despite underlining the financial and structural problems of the public sector and saying that ‘strategies of provision of inputs and creation of infrastructure under NRHM have not translated into assured health care services for the people’, it paid little attention to the problems it identified such as disconnect of disease control programmes with other social sectors, weak use of traditional systems, poor practice and drug regulatory system and public health management. It selectively picked up the strategy of contracting-in private providers from the HLEG and added referrals services through involving private providers. Timelines and linkages of NRHM and UHC remained vague and the age-old strategy of focusing on high fertility states and integration of vertical programmes into NRHM was restated. Significantly, the responsibility of reviving public sector infrastructure was left to the state in the name of state’s autonomy and flexibility. Training of a range of personnel, developing health information systems and handing social determinants of health through a cadre of public health were mentioned but the process and principles for accomplishing these were not. The committee essentially believed that ‘Health sector primarily focuses on the delivery of curative services’. It thereby ignored the history of evolution of public health service in India that, apart from using curative care for prevention, built promotive programmes by provisioning food and food supplements and sanitation and drinking water to vulnerable populations. Except for the proposal of State public health Acts and a system of providing free drugs for EHP, not much was new.</p>
<p>Strengthening of tertiary care was an independent task and private sector facilities were put centre stage with the logic that it caters to 60 per cent of inpatients. The members never explored its referral linkages or asked who makes this 60 per cent and what are their illnesses? The potential of primary and secondary level care to reduce the heavy burden on tertiary institutions was ignored and also the fact that the majority of the poor still depend upon public sector tertiary care.</p>
<p>Given this perspective and the space provided to the representatives of the private sector and industry and the market bias, the HLEG’s relatively rational recommendations displeased the Planning Commission whose internal steering committee has prepared a road map for health sector reforms and delivery of UHC where a major role is given to the private sector and the private insurance companies. In its own assessment report to the Prime Minister recently, the Planning Commission criticised the HLEG for ignoring the well established private sector and has commented that with the major share of personnel, beds and patients, ‘the private sector has to be partnered with for health care’. It said that the HLEG report proposes creation of a new set-up for implementation of its goal and has focused exclusively on UHC, thereby ‘it lacks a holistic prospective’ and added that increase in public health spending ‘will not translate into lower OOPE on health as projected by the HLEG’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0049085713493037">9</xref></sup> This is a reflection of Planning Commission’s ignorance and irresponsibility as it has failed to keep its promise to invest adequately in health sector every year of the 11th Plan and it has not understood that UHC needs to be interpreted not as cashless clinical services to lower OOPE alone but as a strategy for free CPHC in a time bound plan where the marginalised have a priority in services. Those in power have their own vision of UHC where reduction of OOPE is more critical as it means higher state subsidies for the private sector. HLEG’s vision is not desirable but partnership with private sector is—in the name of a holistic perspective!</p>
<p>Caught between the welfare approach of the HLEG report and the crass neoliberalism of the Steering Committee, the draft chapter on health in the 12th Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2012</xref>) attempted to find a midway but could only make it less crass! For it, UHC is ‘Some form of universal medical coverage’ meant for economic growth through equity in health for large percentage of people. The scope of the EHP and population coverage is to be determined by the budget constraints while delivery is through managed care model. How will it link up to the public health programmes to form an effective preventive strategy beyond reducing pain and suffering is not clear. For example, if 75 per cent of the TB cases are to be diagnosed and 85 per cent treated over the next 10–15 years to reduce disease incidence then, how would public and private institutions or NRHM and UHC co-ordinate and cooperate in achieving this task? Lacking in such precise planning and a vision, the 12th Plan, like all previous such documents, leaves crucial questions unanswered.</p>
<p>Emphasising the necessity of strengthening public health services—NRHM/NHM and the national disease control programmes—the draft Chapter calls them ‘the second step’ of UHC. Unfortunately, Primary Health Centres and Community Health Centres that also provide clinical care are sidelined by the urgency to achieve UHC through managed care within two plans as it ensures absence of a level playing field for the ill functioning public sector institutions that may not be able to compete with private/corporate setups. Their strengthening should be the first step but the draft document incorporates all of the Steering Committee’s fragmented recommendations for public health, UHC, PPPs and state funded insurances like the RSBY based on the argument that the existing resources of the private sector cannot be ignored. As of today, RSBY functions as a type of PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049085713493037">Bajpai &amp; Saraya, 2012</xref>) and the challenge of integration, coordination and convergence remain ideas awaiting translation into plans. Interestingly, while public sector institutions are encouraged to mobilise their own resources through autonomous functioning, PPPs are helped from industry’s corporate social responsibility funds. At the same time, no mention is made of the private and corporate tertiary sector’s profits and its role and responsibility.</p>
<p>While the 11th Plan itself proposed a 3 per cent investment in the health sector, the 12th Plan proposes only 2.1, 0.42 per cent of the GDP goes to drinking water and sanitation. These investments are the same as in the 11th Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049085713493037">CBGA, 2011</xref>: 21) reflecting the real concern for social determinants. With the huge burden of subsidies promised to the private sector, what would remain to run and strengthen public sector services and infrastructure is not clear. Even the shortages for NRHM perhaps cannot be met. The document puts heavy pressure on resourcestarved states to finance its health plans and other welfare services and districts to take responsibility of creating PPPs revealing the power relation between states and the centre.</p>

<title>The Trend and the Challenge for the Future</title>
<p>As we saw in the earlier sections, the nature of technology and its organisation had been at the core of the public health planning for India. The first wave of technology that came to India between 1930 to 1960–70 was such that much of it could be scaled up within available resources. In other words, within a public health perspective—by judicious choice of technology and its clinical application in an organised form—organised medical interventions could transcend medicine’s individual orientation to impact the history of diseases through national disease control and eradication programmes. This was initially hampered by India’s inadequate planning strategies that selectively picked on the Bhore Committee’s recommendations and over time focused on urban-based superspecialisations rather than rural and urban basic health services. Later, the planning process was overshadowed by the needs of the growth-oriented model of development where costly and individualised technologies promised greater revenues from the emergent medical markets at home and abroad during the latter half of the twentieth century. In the West (the home of modern medicine), this shift was credited to the success of the first phase of medical technologies and also to the accompanying improvements in the living standards of the people that contributed to the control of infectious and nutritional maladies. The movement of technological evolution from mass based to hi-tech individualised care in such a milieu was uneventful however, pushed by the global medical market—its premature transfer to the countries still struggling with huge burden of malnutrition, infectious and non-infectious diseases, in the periphery of the capitalist system—created a crisis in their health sectors.</p>
<p>Instead of making the right technological choices from the old and the new, India chose to accommodate the hi-tech medical market for its neoliberal developmental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0049085713493037">2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0049085713493037">10</xref></sup> The Steering Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0049085713493037">Planning Commission, 2012</xref>) and the 12th Plan thus share one major vision, which is that of fragmentation of services into UHC, NRHM, state-led insurances and tertiary care, all based on an intermingling of public and private sectors in different ways. The Planning Commission documents are significantly silent on the role of corporate medicine and its pressure to participate in all levels of care giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049085713493037">CII and McKinsey, 2002</xref>). While the UHC is ultimately seen as a network of curative services, NRHM remains an independent effort at providing EHP, with RCH and family welfare at its core and selected vertical disease control programmes at its periphery. This has further fragmented clinical care, marginalising tertiary care within the scope of public sector and shifting it into the hands of more powerful corporate and private sectors. The public sector tertiary care is to survive on PPP (for which the private partner can get 20 per cent funding from the state), help from corporate social responsibility funds and self-generated resources according to the 12th Plan proposals! For effect, however, are projected the six AIIMS-like institutes of the future without any planned regional referral function.</p>
<p>Second, the push and the urgency for UHC is being utilised to rationalise a partnership between public and private sectors with an emphasis on tertiary care. While the HLEG at least envisages a conditional partnership (without specifying them), the other two documents treat them as equal partners in a homogenous system without any conditionalities or even identifying the complexity of the private sector and the problems at each level. There is an assumption that given the fact that there are a number of private and public providers, there is one uniform, homogenous system. So both public and private providers are made a part of the single health care system. This is a flawed vision as the centrality of profit for the private sector makes their objectives contradictory. If at all they make a system, it is a parasitic one where one sector thrives on the other taking advantage of its power relationship. Given the political context where industry guides national planning and has identified health sector as a major source of revenue, where political leadership translates corporate responsibility as a means of guiding the functions of the state and as a right and duty to enter social sector (rather than using ethical practices in business): the power balance between the two sectors is evident.</p>
<p>Third, these documents are insensitive to the fact that clinical medicine is a powerful instrument of prevention and when organised to achieve efficient coverage of population, can lead to control and prevention and thereby change the history of disease. They promote only insured individualised medical care under UHC with no perspective of disease control. No concern has been shown to how the private and public providers will coordinate and collaborate to ultimately synchronise their services to achieve public health goals. Hence, mechanisms of coordination and co-operation (in addition to regulation) are not debated though the need for regulation is accepted.</p>
<p>Fourth, while the need for defining essential care at various levels and developing the package of its content is recognised by the HLEG, the Steering Committee and the chapter on health in the 12th Plan define it as ‘RCH, emergency services and essential medicines for most of the disease burden in the country’. None of them articulate the key principles for defining essential services. Consequently, no systematic evidence-based effort is made for defining essential care needs of different social groups living under very different conditions. Average estimates of disease burden that continue to guide the planners, hide the social and economic determinants of diseases and help adopt priorities not relevant to the marginalised!</p>
<p>These planning documents then are trying to accommodate the hi-tech medical market in India’s health care system. This new avatar of UHC is poised to take health system further away from the initial dream of universal and comprehensive health care and it must be critiqued.</p>
<p>UHC has to be visualised as a Rubik’s cube that requires all sides to be tackled together. It is not only necessary then to reassert the positive recommendations of the HLEG but also go beyond and spell out the steps for defining the content of CPHC and steps to strengthen public services. Also, UHC needs to be extricated from its isolation. The mistake made by the Bhore Committee of assuming that poverty and under-nutrition will be dealt with through economic planning must not be repeated. Welfare and livelihood is essential along with rebuilding the public health system within which aspects of comprehensive care left out by HLEG need to be addressed for genuinely inclusive development. For this, public health researchers must define the minimum standards of key non-health inputs which, if not achieved, act as a deterrent and a constraint for health services.</p>
<p>The primary task at hand is to revive the destroyed public sector in health, and ensuring infrastructure and manpower necessary for comprehensive primary health care in a phased manner over the next 10 years. Revive the morale of its workers, build management systems that are responsible, accountable and transparent and can regulate, monitor, be supportive and people-friendly. The unfinished agenda of defining the components of EHP, reviewing existing programmes and their integration, handling the task of training appropriate personnel, provisioning of drugs, etc., needs to be completed. This basically means taking forward the work of reviewing NRHM, expanding it, addressing its weaknesses and making it more comprehensive; reforming medical education and linking up with traditional system provider net works. This is obviously antithetical to the present trend, wherein catastrophic expenditure on illness and the urgency to reduce it, has become the logic behind linking private sector in all possible ways with the public sector to further accelerate the shift of public subsidies for expanding India’s medical market.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies alone are no panacea given the balance of power and the stewardship role of the state that is subservient to the corporate sector. Only with a well regulated, strong public sector and community based monitoring can we hope to regulate the private sector and work with its primary and selective secondary providers. If in the 12th Plan the commitment to rebuilding the core of public sector is met, it can begin to support the primary providers by the end of it. Otherwise it would be subsumed by schemes of PPP in the name of state-led insurances which are already corroding it. Innovative methods would be required for regulating the traditional providers as well. The corporate monopoly of the different levels of services must be arrested to contain costs. If this sector is efficient and has international standards, it must stand on its own without subsidies from the state. There is evidence to show that while it continues to draw on state resources, it has failed to respond to the needs of the disadvantaged and state regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0049085713493037">Qadeer &amp; Reddy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The health movement in India has a major responsibility in developing its constructive criticism. It must demand articulation of minimum standards of welfare and their implementation, create blueprints for rebuilding the public sector health services and work towards stopping commercialisation of public institutions and subsidies to corporate sector partnerships so that sufficient resources could be made available for the task at hand. Analysing the results of investing in health and welfare in the present context and critiquing choices of technology therefore is a central task.</p>
