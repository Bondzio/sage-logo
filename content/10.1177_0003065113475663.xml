<p>It is a bittersweet moment as I pen my last “Comings and Goings” in my role as editor of <italic>JAPA</italic>. Bonnie Litowitz assumes the editorship of <italic>JAPA</italic> as of January 2014. Bonnie will work closely with me as editor-elect during 2013. She is intimately familiar with the pleasures and perils of editing <italic>JAPA</italic>, having served as my associate editor for many years, as well as serving in a similar capacity during the editorship of Arnold Richards, my predecessor. Bonnie brings enormous erudition and enthusiasm to our journal.</p>
<p>Jeanine M. Vivona has received the 2012 <italic>JAPA</italic> Prize for her article “Is There a Nonverbal Period of Development?” which appeared in <italic>JAPA</italic> 60/2.</p>
<p>Diane E. Donnelly is the inaugural winner of the <italic>JAPA</italic> New Author Prize for her article “The Function of Suffering as Portrayed in <italic>The Scarlet Letter</italic> and Reflected in Clinical Work,” which was published in <italic>JAPA</italic> 60/6. I continue to encourage new authors to submit their work to <italic>JAPA</italic>. The New Author Prize was created to promote this effort. Details about the prize appear in this issue, and I hope readers will bring it to the attention of their colleagues.</p>
<p><italic>JAPA</italic> podcasts—in-depth interviews with authors of papers recently published in the journal—explore these authors’ scholarly and clinical interests, as well as possible extensions of their ideas into adjacent disciplines. In addition to podcasts with Mari Ruti and Jeanine Vivona, we have recently added an interview with Lewis Kirshner about his article “Toward an Ethics of Psychoanalysis: A Critical Reading of Lacan’s Ethics,” which appeared in <italic>JAPA</italic> 60/6.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who gave so generously of their time as Editorial Board members from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012: Stephen B. Bernstein, Daria Colombo, Anne Erreich, James P. Frosch, James F. Leckman, Janice S. Lieberman, Ellen Pinsky, Donnel B. Stern, and Jeanine M. Vivona. Each of these board members has made important contributions on behalf of <italic>JAPA</italic>. I look forward to further collaboration with them in the future.</p>
<p>Welcome to the following new Editorial Board members, whose terms run from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015: Richard Almond, Stanley Coen, Tiziano Colibazzi, Andrew Gerber, Richard Honig, Luba Kessler, Jane Kite, Raymond A. Levy, Kate Schechter, Joel R. Sneed, Jennifer Stuart, Alan Sugarman, Jane G. Tillman, and Phyllis Tyson. And welcome also to Rebecca Chaplan, a newly appointed Editorial Associate, whose term runs from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015.</p>
