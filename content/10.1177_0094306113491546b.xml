<p>With this volume, Michael Mann completes his long march through the history of power since the Neolithic, from the initial caging of populations in proto-states in the irrigated river valleys of the Middle East and Asia to what might be called the global caging of populations in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is notable, of course, that Mann sprinted through the first few thousand years (devoting, by my calculation, a page to every hundred years in the initial portions of Volume One), then slowed to a jog between 800 and 1760 (a page for every five years in the later chapters of Volume One), and has been strolling along at a leisurely pace since then (between 5 and 9 pages per year in Volumes Two, Three, and Four). Volume Four has all the virtues we expect from this author: theoretical rigor, a thorough and critical sifting of the available evidence, enviable clarity of exposition, and sharp no-nonsense judgments about both the doings of historical actors and the dubious claims of other analysts. In short, it is classic Michael Mann.</p>
<p>Volume Four is entitled “Globalizations.” The book does address the unprecedentedly thorough spread of power networks around the globe in the years since World War II. However, the most striking feature of this volume is not its global reach but its very strong focus on the doings of one country: the United States. A more appropriate title for the volume would be “The Age of American Empire.” Mann includes full chapters on the two chief alternatives to United States domination in the postwar era: the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. These chapters, however, are strongly weighted toward the passing away of the communist alternative to American dominance in the years since 1980. The chapters focus on the attempted reform and eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and the far more successful post-Maoist economic reforms, which converted China into a quasi-capitalist state that has found its place in the U.S.-dominated global political and economic order. Meanwhile, the discussions of other areas of the world are located primarily in chapters entitled “American empire during the cold war,” “Neoliberalism, rise and faltering,” “American empire at the turn of the twenty-first century,” and “Global crisis: The great neoliberal recession”—all of which center firmly on the United States. There are, in addition, two chapters devoted exclusively to American politics between 1945 and 1980, one on class relations and the other on civil rights and identity struggles. One consequence of this lavish attention to the United States is that American political figures of moderate importance, such as Joseph McCarthy, Henry Luce, Barry Goldwater, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, or Paul O’Neil, make more appearances in the index than Sukarno, Jawaharlal Nehru, Kwame Nkrumah, Charles DeGaulle, or Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>Mann’s choice to center his analysis on the United States in this period is perfectly justifiable. This is, after all, a history of power, and America has amassed an unprecedented share of the world’s economic, political, ideological, and military power in the era since 1945. Three facts should make this clear. First, in 1945, the United States, which had 6 percent of the world’s population, produced an astounding 35 percent of its GDP (p. 270). Second, in the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has accounted for nearly half of the world’s military spending. With its archipelago of bases and its extensive navy and air transport fleet, it is the only country capable of applying concentrated military power swiftly all around the globe. Finally, although the American share of world GDP has shrunk since 1945, its dominance in the financial and monetary sphere has been maintained, even enhanced. This has become particularly clear in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis, when the U.S. Federal Reserve, established in the early twentieth century as the lender of last resort for American banks, in fact acted as the lender of last resort for the entire global economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491546">1</xref></sup> Although, as Mann argues, the American empire now seems to have entered into decline, it still retains enormous stores of power—military, political, economic, and ideological alike.</p>
<p>Mann points out that America’s imperial dominance was a highly contingent consequence of the Second World War. The United States, safe from attack behind its vast Atlantic and Pacific moats, came through the war with its industrial might enhanced while bombing and intense ground war gutted the productive capacities of the other combatants. Had it not been for this insanely destructive war, there would have been no world-spanning American empire in the late twentieth century. Unlike its European predecessors, the American empire has been informal, without significant territorial possessions. America has dominated by a combination of “gunboat diplomacy,” rule by proxies, economic imperialism, and hegemony, which Mann defines as the acceptance of American leadership as benign or natural. The mix of these strategies has varied by region and over time. In Europe and Japan, American power has been consistently hegemonic. Latin America was kept in line by economic imperialism backed up by the threat of gunboat diplomacy. In Asia, the United States began by intervening brutally in civil wars in Korea and Vietnam, but later became a more benevolent hegemon. In the Middle East rule by proxies has predominated—recently supplemented by George W. Bush’s aggression in Afghanistan and Iraq. The diversity of the world and the inevitable difficulties of logistics have made America’s imperium far from absolute, but the United States has consistently been able to bend the course of events in the direction of its interests.</p>
<p>Mann has a very dark view of American history in this period. He sees a steady accretion of domestic reaction from the social democratic high point of the New Deal in the 1930s right down to the present, with only a minor liberal “bleep” (as he puts it) in the 1960s (p. 65). I agree that the Cold War anti-communism of the 1950s was deeply oppressive and that the years since 1980 have seen a durable rightward turn. But Mann, for all his claims that history is open and full of contingencies, has succumbed to a downbeat teleology, allowing his knowledge of how dysfunctional and reactionary American politics would become in the twenty-first century to cast a pall over the whole of the postwar period. In Mann’s view, the sole positive development in the United States in these years was the civil rights movement, which brought about major changes in the racial order of the United States and helped diminish the power of racism as an ideology all over the globe. The civil rights movement also provided a global paradigm for claiming full citizen rights and cultural recognition for other oppressed groups, including women, dominated ethnicities, and sexual minorities.</p>
<p>But over the past three decades, America’s most important contribution to world political and ideological development has not been identity politics—it has been neoliberalism. No fan of utopian ideologies of any stripe, Mann sees neoliberalism as theoretically untenable and mainly pernicious in its effects. It has failed to increase the overall productivity of the world economy; what it has accomplished is a generalized financialization of economic life and a redistribution of wealth and power from labor to capital. Mann properly warns that the global power of neoliberalism should not be exaggerated. Outside the United States and the United Kingdom, where it has been applied in relatively pure form, neoliberalism has been mixed with a whole array of quite different policies—continued Communist party economic guidance in China, state-sponsored developmental regimes elsewhere in Asia, a mix of neoliberal reform and strong welfare states in Europe, and so on. As much as neoliberal ideologues may wish for a world in which free markets trump states, nation states still determine most economic policies and both citizens and officials in most states have kept neoliberal enthusiasts at arm’s length. The current global economic crisis, which Mann dubs “the great neoliberal recession” should, in principle, have challenged the dominance of both the neoliberal model and its American sponsor. Yet so far there has been no sustained challenge to the neoliberal international order—it has remained intact.</p>
<p>The establishment and perpetuation of the American empire forms the spine of Mann’s exposition in this volume, but he also makes plenty of astute arguments that are more or less orthogonal to this central story. I cannot possibly discuss all of these in this brief essay, but I will mention six of his key claims.</p>
<p>First, Europe, which had for centuries been the most bellicose portion of the globe, has been transformed by the horrors of World War II into the world’s most peace-loving region. It is, Mann argues, the profound desire of Europeans for peace, not economic interest, that has given rise to the European Union, a unique and barely workable arrangement that is highly unlikely to be copied elsewhere.</p>
<p>Second, although the period since World War II has seen an unprecedented globalization of power, these years have also been, at least formally, the era of the definitive triumph of the nation state. With the dismantling of the European Empires and then of the Soviet Union, nation states now occupy nearly all the landed surface of the globe. Although some of these nation states are small and weak, and although IGOs, NGOs, and transnational corporations have expanded in this period, most of the world’s social power continues to be exercised at the level of the national cages, not by an amorphous proto-international order, and not by the hegemonic imperial power.</p>
<p>Third, in spite of the darkness that haunts Mann’s account of this period, he admits that it has, on the whole, been a <italic>favorable</italic> era of human history. In spite of some bad periods and some disfavored regions, the world economy has grown fairly steadily. The rise in incomes, together with the progress of medicine, has greatly lengthened lifespans not only in wealthy countries, but in very poor countries as well.</p>
<p>Fourth, racism, until World War II, was the world’s most pervasive ideology. Its radical decline in the period since the war has been one of the most benign trends in recent history.</p>
<p>Fifth, this has also been a favorable era because wars between major powers have ceased and have been replaced by less devastating forms of combat. This is the paradoxical effect of the existence of nuclear armaments, which have made full-scale international warfare self-defeating for all parties. Yet the continuing existence of these arms means that a sudden end to civilization, and perhaps to human life on earth, remains a disturbing possibility for the future.</p>
<p>Sixth, contrary to American self-admiration and a good deal of scholarly opinion, the imperial power of the United States has not been a force for peace in world affairs. Rather than an international sheriff, America has acted as the period’s chief aggressor—in Asia until 1975, in the Middle East since 2003, and sporadically elsewhere, sending expeditionary forces, overthrowing governments, raining down bombs, and now making drone strikes. Hence the coming decline of American power, which Mann believes will lead to a consortium of powers, should be good for the peace of the world. Of this claim I am skeptical. It is certainly true that in spite of its pious declamations, America has visited much moral and political evil on the world. But it is also true that its globe-spanning military power has served as a huge disincentive to military adventures by other countries and that a decline of American power could well lead to dangerous military rivalries among states. What happened when hegemonic British power declined in the late nineteenth century should give us pause.</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed by Mann’s final substantive chapter, which assesses the looming global crisis of climate change. Mann provides an exceptionally lucid account of the potentially dire consequences of global warming, of the possible technological means of limiting or mitigating these consequences, and of the daunting political difficulties likely to block an effective response. The chapter provides a profoundly downbeat conclusion to his grand project: at the end of the long saga in which humanity amasses ever-greater concentrations of social power, we are faced with the possibility of a human-induced dissolution of civilization itself.</p>
<p>I think this potentially catastrophic ending of Mann’s story almost demands that we rethink the account of the history of social power he has presented in the later chapters of Volumes One and in Volumes Two through Four. My favorite portion of Mann’s project has always been the first part of Volume One, where he races through hundreds of years of history at a time—forty pages on the rise of Mesopotamian civilization, twenty on Assyria and Persia, fifty on the Roman Empire. What would the past four centuries of history (roughly speaking the modern era) look like if we sped up and viewed them in the bolder and more summary fashion characteristic of these early chapters?</p>
<p>If the end point of the story is the runaway global warming of the anthropocene, it seems clear that the dominant form of power in this era has not been the nation state, as Mann sometimes suggests, but capitalism. The clearest measure of capitalism’s impact is that its carbon-fueled productivity has enabled an astounding ten-fold increase in the human population since about 1750. The rise of capitalism has brought about a sharp break in the history of social power, one comparable in novelty and importance only to the breakthrough to civilized state societies that Mann recounted early in Volume One.</p>
<p>If capitalist civilization marks such a startling break with the past, this implies that the question of how it emerged deserves a more prominent place than Mann has given it in his project. In my opinion, Mann obscured the significance of capitalism’s emergence in Volume One, where he projected backwards into the Middle Ages a supposed European “dynamism” out of which capitalism slowly and naturally arose over centuries. The only turning point he treated was the Industrial Revolution, considered in a purely English context.</p>
<p>A more robust treatment would surely (among other things) say more about early capitalism’s powerfully global thrust, led not by the English, but by the Dutch. The perfection of the art of armed commerce (a novel combination of economic and military power) by the Dutch East India Company in the early seventeenth century gained the Netherlands a stunning accumulation of wealth and power and set off a scramble among other powers to get into the Dutch game. By the end of the seventeenth century the English and the French had both reached a rough maritime parity with the Dutch and their three-way rivalry set off the powerful dynamic of the Atlantic economy, generally agreed to be a key driver of the eighteenth-century capitalist acceleration. This synthesis of militarized globalization and capitalism—which I take as a basic and entirely novel structural feature of the entire capitalist era, right down to the present—preceded industrialization by 150 years.</p>
<p>My second revision concerns the rise of science as an autonomous source of social power in the modern era. Mann ponders this idea briefly in Volume Four, but his argument remains that the crucial power resources generated by science (and technology) over the past few centuries are not autonomous but must be counted as economic, political, or military power because the scientists who made or applied the discoveries have been employed by corporations, states, or militaries. Within the terms of Mann’s theory, this argument is perfectly logical. But perhaps this indicates that his theory is not fully adequate for grasping the new dynamics of power in the capitalist era.</p>
<p>It seems clear that science is autonomous. Whatever the institutional location of its initial development, scientific knowledge has spread promiscuously through an increasingly world-spanning scientific and technological community that has its own norms, modes of communication, and system of rewards. Scientific power is, in Mann’s own terms, interstitial—it moves through the pores of the other power structures and cannot be monopolized by any of them or by any nation-state. Science also has an autonomous temporal rhythm which, since the seventeenth century, has been characterized by a rapid and continuous growth in knowledge—as measured by, for example, the number of scientific publications or the number of professional scientists. It is true that scientists rarely exercise power directly, as do military, economic, political, and ideological leaders. But especially over the past century and a half, the autonomous development of science has made tremendously enhanced forms of power available for use by other power-wielding institutions. The intertwining of scientific-technological power with the modern capitalist economy has been particularly obvious. But as nuclear weapons mounted on guided missiles make all too clear, science has also transformed military power.</p>
<p>It is largely the advent of this novel scientific form of social power that has endowed the capitalist era with its extraordinary but dangerous dynamism, a dynamism that has provided us with long lives and abundant consumption goods, but that has also led us into the anthropocene. A final indication that scientific and technological power is autonomous from economic power is that the capitalist economic system, with its drive toward endless accumulation, will almost certainly have to be overcome to preserve human thriving in the anthropocene. By contrast, an intensified and systematic application of science will be absolutely essential to the preservation of a decent form of social life for our descendants.</p>
