<abstract>
<p>Using data from a survey of rural–urban migrants in a city in China, this paper investigates the relationships between migrant–resident ties and migrant integration. Migrant integration is assessed with respect to three dimensions: acculturation, socioeconomic integration and psychological integration. Migrant networks are divided into three categories: kin resident ties, non-kin resident ties and non-resident ties. The relation between resources embedded in migrant networks and socioeconomic integration is also examined by translating position-generator data into network resource indices. The results reveal that non-resident ties still make up the majority of migrant networks and migrant–resident ties are significantly associated with migrant integration. The roles of non-kin resident ties in migrant integration are more consequential. They have positive effects on all three dimensions. Considering the different effects of migrant networks on different dimensions of integration, many migrants risk being trapped in permanent poverty and falling into the underclass in city societies.</p>

<p>Rural–urban migrants in China not only experience institutional discrimination, but are also stigmatised in various ways by urban societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012470394">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012470394">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) and are far from being integrated into the mainstream of city societies. Previous research on both international and internal migrants has shown that social networks play an important role in their integration into host societies especially if the destination is unfriendly to immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012470394">Mouw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012470394">Zhao, 2003</xref>). Migrant networks contribute to such economic outcomes as access to the labour market (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012470394">Zhao, 2003</xref>) and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470394">Amuedo-Dorantes and Mundra, 2007</xref>), as well as non-economic outcomes such as ethnic identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470394">Lubbers <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Previous research has paid much more attention to kin-based and ethnicity-based ties. Social ties constructed by immigrants with the natives or local residents in destination areas (hereafter referred to as migrant–resident ties) after they enter the host society may also be a major part of their networks. However, there has been little study of such ties. Migrant–resident ties constructed over time, beyond kin and ethnic ties, are a valuable host-area-specific social resource that may facilitate migrant integration into the destination societies. In the absence of institutional support, the role of social networks in Chinese rural–urban migrants’ integration into cities becomes particularly important. Understanding the role of migrant–resident ties in migrant integration may assist in enhancing the integration process. The main objective of the present study is to test our hypotheses regarding the effects of social networks on integration. We pay special attention to the role of migrant–resident ties by comparing them with non-resident ties.</p>
<sec id="section1-0042098012470394">
<title>1. Background</title>
<p>Massive rural–urban migration has occurred over more than 20 years in China. However, due to both a lack of consensus on the definition of migrant and the absence of an authoritative national survey, we do not know the exact number of rural–urban migrants. According to the Sixth National Population Census of the People’s Republic of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012470394">National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2011</xref>), there were 261 million migrants (including urban-to-urban migrants) in 2010, of whom the majority are rural–urban migrants.</p>
<p>Because of their great number and important economic and social impacts on Chinese society and beyond, increasing scholarly attention has been paid to rural–urban migrants. As a group, they have been the major part of Chinese manufacturing; it is they who have built the brand of ‘made in China’, the so-called world factory. They are also the major source of labour for Chinese service industries. However, the system of household registration (<italic>hukou</italic>) divides the Chinese population into agricultural <italic>hukou</italic> and non-agricultural <italic>hukou</italic>. The latter is economically and socially superior to the former, with vastly different labour-market entry processes and different access to high-level occupations, housing, medical care and pension benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012470394">Chan and Buckingham, 2008</xref>). <italic>Hukou</italic> determines people’s official or permanent legal residence and is used as a measure to manage migration. Under the <italic>hukou</italic> system, offspring still inherit <italic>hukou</italic> status from either their mother or father and the conversion of <italic>hukou</italic> status, especially from agricultural to non-agricultural (<italic>nongzhuanfei)</italic> remains under tight government control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012470394">Chan and Buckingham, 2008</xref>). It is still difficult for rural–urban migrants to obtain the legal status of permanent resident in cities. Rural–urban migrants are generally excluded from city societies, including access to institutes of higher education, city-wide social welfare programmes and many types of jobs. Most rural–urban migrants participate in the secondary rather than the primary labour market, as a result of which they work in low-paying ‘3-D’ (dirty, demanding and dangerous) jobs that urban residents eschew. They are still segregated both economically and socially from urban residents, far from being integrated into the mainstream of city societies.</p>
<p>It should be noted that rural–urban migrants in China are a unique group who migrated from the traditional agricultural society to the modern industrial society. Rural–urban migrants mostly work in cities of the central and eastern areas in China, where, apart from the inequalities due to their <italic>hukou</italic> status, they are in a relatively homogeneous society with no race barriers or colour barriers, and almost no religious barriers to their integration into the mainstream of society. Obstacles of language and culture shock that rural–urban migrants face in China should therefore not be as challenging as for most international immigrants.</p>
<sec id="section2-0042098012470394">
<title>1.1 Migrant Networks</title>
<p>Migrant networks are social networks of migrants. We argue that migrant–resident ties are an important part of migrant networks that have not been emphasised in previous studies of either international or internal migrants. Especially in the initial stage of settlement, kin-based and ethnicity-based ties in the destinations play a very important role in facilitating migrants’ adaptation to their new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012470394">Browning and Rodriguez, 1985</xref>). However, over time, such ties might hinder their further integration due to social obligations, pressure to conform or downward levelling norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012470394">Green <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Recently, in literature on migration, social ties beyond kin and ethnic relations have attracted researchers’ attention (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012470394">Haug, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470394">Lancee, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012470394">Haug (2003)</xref> points out that it is particularly useful for immigrants to construct social ties with residents because most employers are residents. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012470394">Mouw (2002)</xref> argues that developing connections with the native residents is a strategy to circumvent discrimination. However, to date, there are surprisingly few empirical tests of the effect of migrant–resident ties on migrant integration. An exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470394">Lancee’s (2010)</xref> recent study, which shows that immigrants’ contacts with destination residents are positively associated with their economic returns.</p>
<p>Interpersonal ties are of special importance in Chinese social behaviour. As an indigenous concept, <italic>guanxi</italic> has been used to describe the meaning and importance of interpersonal relationships in China. <italic>Guanxi</italic> literally means relationship, but its essence is a set of interpersonal ties that facilitate exchange of favours among people on a dyadic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012470394">Hwang, 1987</xref>). Since <italic>guanxi</italic> involves familiarity or intimacy, trust and reciprocal obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012470394">Hwang, 1987</xref>), in practice, it generally occurs among immediate family members, relatives and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012470394">Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Apparently, as members of Chinese society, rural–urban migrants follow these rules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098012470394">
<title>1.2 Migrant Integration</title>
<p>Concepts such as assimilation, incorporation and adaptation offer ways to understand and describe the integration into the mainstream experienced by many migrant individuals and ethnic groups. The term ‘integration’ is also often used in studies of migration and we will use it here. However, we will not alter other researchers’ original wording in reviewing their work. Assimilation has been most important in research on migrants to America. Obviously, the socio-cultural context for rural–urban migrants in China is very different from that for international immigrants. However, both groups are usually disadvantaged and vulnerable, and have similar difficulties in integrating into the host society. Thus, assimilation theory can provide insights for our study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012470394">Gordon (1964)</xref> offers a systematic dissection of assimilation to capture the complexity of the process, ranging from cultural, structural, marital, ‘identificational’, ‘attitude-receptional’ and ‘behaviour-receptional’, to civic assimilation. By dividing migrant integration into acculturation and economic adaptation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470394">Portes and Zhou (1993)</xref> propose a segmented assimilation theory, postulating three possible patterns (upward assimilation, downward assimilation and selective acculturation) of immigrant integration that are most likely to take place for contemporary immigrants and their offspring in America. The processes of migrant integration are, however, highly variable, depending not only on social and personal variables in the sending and receiving societies, but also on other factors that exist prior to, and arise during, the course of integration (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012470394">Berry, 1997</xref>). The combined effects of these factors might lead to variation among different migrant groups in how the different dimensions of integration operate, which has been shown in the segmented assimilation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470394">Portes and Zhou, 1993</xref>). Thus, we argue that identification of the dimensions of migrant integration, as researchers such as Gordon, Portes and Zhou have done, is crucial in delineating the trajectories of this process.</p>
<p>The main difficulties in integration faced by rural–urban migrants lie in how to adapt to modern industrial society, achieve upward socioeconomic mobility and complete the transformation from country people to city people. In the absence of racial and colour barriers, and almost no religious barriers to their integration into the mainstream of society, Gordon’s framework for migrant integration seems overcomplex for application to rural–urban migrants. In our view, for rural–urban migrants in China, upward socioeconomic mobility is a key pre-condition for structural assimilation as defined by Gordon. We believe that structural assimilation is just the manifestation at the group level of migrants’ realisation of cultural, socioeconomic and identificational assimilation at the individual level. For the case of Chinese rural–urban migrants, we argue that Gordon’s assimilation dimensions, such as marital, ‘attitude-receptional’, ‘behaviour-receptional’ and civic assimilation are by-products of migrants’ acculturation, upward socioeconomic mobility and identificational assimilation; once rural–urban migrants are integrated on these three dimensions, the other dimensions should pose no problems. As many others (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012470394">Portes and Zhou, 1993</xref>) have done, we thus focus on fewer dimensions that are essential for the integration of Chinese rural–urban migrants—namely, acculturation, socioeconomic integration and psychological integration.</p>

<title>2. Social Networks and Integration of Chinese Rural–Urban Migrants</title>
<sec id="section5-0042098012470394">
<title>2.1 Categories of Social Networks</title>
<p>To study the link between social networks and migrant integration from the perspective of migrant–resident ties, it is clear that we need to divide migrants’ social ties into resident and non-resident ties and pay special attention to the former. The majority of non-resident ties are kin-based and ethnicity-based ties with home regions. They also include ties with other migrants from regions other than their home regions. Also, it is necessary to group migrant–resident ties into kin resident ties and non-kin resident ties for the following reasons. Kin ties are mostly ‘ascribed’ relations, often accidentally constructed before immigration and usually beyond an individual’s control. Non-kin resident ties, however, are mostly personal relations, often gradually constructed after migration. As a result, we divide migrant networks into the following three categories: kin resident ties, non-kin resident ties and non-resident ties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042098012470394">
<title>2.2 Dimensions of Migrant Integration</title>
<p>As argued earlier, we identify three dimensions of integration for Chinese rural–urban migrants: acculturation, socioeconomic integration and psychological integration.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Acculturation comprehends those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012470394">Redfield <italic>et al</italic>., 1936</xref>, p. 149).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to Gordon’s acculturation, changes may occur in language, dress, daily customs, even values and norms. We believe that the most important issue in acculturation raised by rural–urban migration is the adaptation to a new lifestyle after migrants begin making a living in a modern industrial society.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic integration, which is not addressed in Gordon’s multidimensional formulation, is a key dimension of migrant integration. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012470394">Alba and Nee (1997</xref>, p. 835) note, “socioeconomic assimilation is equated with attainment of average or above average socioeconomic standing”. It is usually measured by income (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470394">Lancee, 2010</xref>). In the Chinese context, socioeconomic integration is of major significance for rural–urban migrants. The general socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by migrants is largely rooted in the institutional restrictions associated with the <italic>hukou</italic> systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012470394">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>By psychological integration, we mean the extent to which immigrants feel emotionally bonded to the host society. If migrants do not feel they belong to the host society or recognise themselves as members of the host society, despite having a high level of acculturation and socioeconomic integration, they cannot be totally integrated into the receiving society. Upon psychological integration, immigrants would adhere consciously or subconsciously to the main norms and values of the host people.</p>
<p>What are the relationships between these three dimensions of migrant integration? We agree with Gordon’s argument that acculturation is a necessary first step and has top priority in migrant adjustment. Socioeconomic integration is an important stage of integration, signalling the maturity of the integration process. Psychological integration is the highest level of migrant integration. We believe that acculturation and socioeconomic integration might exert effects on psychological integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098012470394">
<title>2.3 Hypotheses</title>
<p>Drawing upon previous research, we argue that mechanisms through which migrant networks affect acculturation, socioeconomic integration and psychological integration are not the same; they are resocialisation theory, social capital theory and identity theory respectively.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012470394">Bar-Yosef (1968)</xref> considers the adjustment of immigrants as a process of desocialisation and resocialisation. Immigrants first experience the disintegration of the person’s role system and the loss of social identity, and then establish a new identity and role system. Presumably the resocialisation starts as a trial-and-error learning of the absorbing society. Adequate channels of communication and a feedback system help the immigrant to recognise his/her errors of social perception and facilitate his/her future adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012470394">Bar-Yosef, 1968</xref>). The family, schools, peer relationships and the mass media are main agencies of socialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012470394">Giddens, 2009</xref>). Since they are generally involved in ‘3-D’ jobs, migrants’ access to mass media is limited and their peer relationships become the most important resocialising agencies. Life style in modern urban society is totally different from traditional rural society, and the process of a new cultural learning of modern society is important and necessary<disp-quote>
<p>Informal groups of people of similar ages, at work and in other situations, are usually of enduring importance in shaping individuals’ attitudes and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012470394">Giddens, 2009</xref>, p. 289).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Residents in cities are the agency of the relatively modern values, norms and behaviour patterns. We believe that close connections with urban residents (either non-kin resident ties or kin resident ties) make it easier and more likely that the ways of urbanites will be learned and that urbanites’ values, norms and social practices adopted (Hypotheses Hra1 and Hra2; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012470394">Table 1</xref>). Non-resident ties have two possible effects on migrant acculturation, a ‘defender’ effect and a ‘classmate’ effect. Migrants’ relatives and friends, especially those who are still living in the traditional society, are more likely to be defenders of the traditional culture. Under the ‘defender’ effect, non-resident ties are negatively associated with migrants’ acculturation in the process of their resocialisation. In contrast, some relatives and friends of rural–urban migrants, especially those who are also rural–urban migrants, are their ‘classmates’ in the same ‘classroom’—i.e. the modern urban society. Adequate communication among ‘classmates’ can improve their acculturation. Due to the geographical proximity, rural–urban migrants’ communication with relatives and friends living in the same city might be more frequent and influential. Thus the ‘classmate’ effect is expected (Hypothesis Hna).</p>

<p>Social networks play an important role in socioeconomic returns for individuals including migrants (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012470394">Zhao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012470394">Amuedo-Dorantes and Mundra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470394">Lancee, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012470394">Lin (2002</xref>, pp. 19–20) provides four general explanations in his theory of social capital—information, influence, social credentials and reinforcement—to explain why social networks enhance the outcomes of social actions, especially instrumental actions such as earning and job seeking. Previous research shows that not only the number of social ties, but also the resources accessed through social ties matter for social actions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012470394">Lin (2002)</xref>, three indices including upper reachability (the best resources accessed), heterogeneity (the range between the highest- and lowest-reachable resources), extensity (the number of reachable positions) plus network size can be used to measure network resources. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012470394">Lancee’s (2010)</xref> findings, we hypothesise that all their ties and the resources embedded in their social networks are positively associated with migrants’ socioeconomic integration (Hypotheses Hrsn1, Hrsn2, Hnsn, Hrsr<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012470394">1</xref></sup> and Hnsr).</p>
<p>Concerning identity dynamics, identity theory describes social networks as an immediate context defining the salience of a particular role (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012470394">Stryker, 1980</xref>). The social network exerts a ‘conformity effect’ on social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012470394">McFarland and Pals, 2005</xref>, p. 292)—i.e. “the more ties you have with the same identity, the more likely you will be to adopt that identity as your own”. In their study of migrants in Spain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470394">Lubbers <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> found that network characteristics contributed significantly to an understanding of ethnic self-identification and that homogeneous personal ties with family members and people from the country of origin are associated with exclusive ethnic self-identifications, “whereas more heterogeneous personal networks tended to exhibit more plural definitions of belonging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470394">Lubbers <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, p. 721). As a result, we expect that migrants’ numbers of resident ties are positively associated with their psychological integration (Hypotheses Hrp1 and Hrp2). In contrast, the more ties migrants have with non-residents, the more likely that they will not identity themselves as a member of urban societies (Hypothesis Hnp).</p>

<sec id="section9-0042098012470394">
<title>3.1 Data</title>
<p>Data for this study come from a survey of rural–urban migrants conducted by the Institute for Population and Development Studies at Xi’an Jiaotong University in early November 2009 in X City, Fujian. Fujian is one of the key receiving locations for rural–urban migrants. X City is a south-eastern coastal city administered under Fujian province and became one of China’s four original Special Economic Zones in the 1980s. Y District, one of X City’s six city districts, is the heart of X City and is the city’s centre for commerce, science, education, sports, tourism and culture. Y District had a population of 0.71 million in 2008, of whom 72.41 per cent are immigrants (rural–urban migrants are the majority). With the highest proportion of immigrants in Fujian Province, Y District is an excellent example of rural–urban migrants’ receiving areas in China.</p>
<p>The migrant subjects are rural–urban migrants aged above 15 with agricultural <italic>hukou</italic>. Since there was no sampling frame available for our migrant survey, a loose quota sampling method was adopted. We attempted to cover all typical occupations engaged in by rural–urban migrants to increase our sample’s representativeness and diversity. There are two types of rural migrants according to their housing arrangements: concentrated-housing migrants and scattered-housing migrants. The former live in dormitories or work sheds provided by enterprises. The latter live in communities and their places of residence are mostly rented and rarely owned by themselves. The migrant survey was conducted in all five sub-districts of Y District in both enterprises and communities; we refer to these as enterprise migrants and community migrants respectively. The predetermined sample size was 1500, of whom 500 were enterprise migrants and 1000 community migrants. Since some of the employed migrants and almost all the self-employed migrants are living in communities, such a sampling strategy is necessary.</p>
<p>In the enterprise survey, our main concerns were to obtain full coverage of typical industries in which migrants work and a relatively even distribution of males and females. In total, 489 enterprise migrants were interviewed in six enterprises, of whom 17 per cent, 55 per cent and 28 per cent were from service, manufacturing and construction industries respectively; and 60 per cent were male migrants.</p>
<p>The total sample of 1000 community migrants was evenly distributed across all five sub-districts—i.e. 200 for each sub-district. We planned to have an even distribution among the following five sub-groups: married men, unmarried men aged 27 or below, unmarried men aged over 27, married women and unmarried women, making the proportion of male migrants about 60 per cent and indirectly producing a relatively even age distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012470394">2</xref></sup> Our minimum requirement of sample size for each sub-group was 200. After excluding ineligible participants, 1018 community migrants were selected from 15 communities and interviewed.</p>
<p>Respondents totalled 1507 of whom 60 per cent were male, 35 per cent aged 16–24, 43 per cent aged 25–34, 22 per cent aged 35 and above; and 46 per cent were married (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>). With respect to the occupation distribution, 16 per cent were self-employed, 37 per cent worked in manufacturing industries, 32 per cent in the service industry, 9 per cent in the construction industry and 6 per cent others. Our non-probability sampling method causes bias in our data, which restrict our ability to generalise our findings. However, given the relatively large size and diversity of our sample, our data are still appropriate for association analyses at the cost of detailed accuracy.</p>

<title>3.2 Measures</title>
<p>Besides variables connected with migrant networks and migrant integration, we divide other predictor variables that might affect the status of migrant integration into two categories: individual factors and migration factors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref> lists all the variables.</p>
<p>In the survey, each migrant respondent was asked to report “Over the past few months, due to private matters rather than work issues, how many family members or relatives, and friends have you contacted frequently with face-to-face meetings, phone or text messages, or email/snail mail”. They were also asked to report the specific number of local urban residents among family members or relatives, and friends. Here we seek information about migrants’ <italic>guanxi</italic> network (including family members, relatives and friends) through the qualifications implied by ‘frequently’ and ‘private matters’. In the analysis, non-kin resident ties, kin resident ties and non-resident ties are all operationalised as continuous variables unless otherwise specified (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, using the ‘position generators’ method, we also asked, “Did you know of anyone among your family members, relatives, friends in X City who have the following 18 kinds of occupation”. (For a full list of these occupations and their Chinese Socio-economic Index scores, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098012470394">Table 3</xref>, which was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012470394">Bian and Li’s (2001)</xref> measure of ‘New-Year-Greeting networks’ specifically designed for Chinese). If a respondent happens to have some family members, relatives or friends who have an occupation on this list, he/she is also asked to report whether there is a local urban resident among them. We use this information to construct three network resource indices (i.e. upper reachability, heterogeneity and extensity) plus network size (the number of ties) presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref> to measure network resources (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470394">Table 4</xref>) when examining the link between migrant network and socioeconomic integration.</p>

<p>We use modernity to measure acculturation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470394">Inkeles and Smith (1974)</xref>, for people who grew up in the countryside, late socialisation experiences such as factory work, migration and later life in the city can all help people to become modern. We argue that, for rural–urban migrants, realising both the transformation from ‘farmers’ into ‘workers’ and from ‘traditional men’ into ‘modern men’ is a crucial step in the process of acculturation. Thus, modernity is a useful indicator of migrants’ acculturation status. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012470394">Inkeles and Smith (1974)</xref>, after taking rural–urban migrants’ current situation into consideration, we attempt to assess migrants’ modernity by the following five qualities: keeping informed about the world; the granting of more autonomy and rights to those with less status and power, such as minority groups and women; manifesting a sense of personal efficacy and a general abandonment of passivity and fatalism; seeing the virtues of planning and showing an interest in carefully planning their affairs in advance; and liking people to be on time. We selected only one item to reflect each quality from Inkeles and Smith’s scale of modernity, with minor modifications made to fit the Chinese context. Compared with their study on modernity, our measure is admittedly crude. Our final index of modernity includes the following five qualitative aspects</p>
<list id="list1-0042098012470394" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Do you often get news and information through a newspaper or the Internet? (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Do you agree with the statement that parents should let boys rather than girls receive a higher level of education? (1 = agree, 2 = indifferent, 3 = disagree).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do you think one’s success depends on? (1 = mainly luck, 2 = half luck and half personal efforts, 3 = mainly personal efforts).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To what extent are you willing to arrange your work and affairs in advance? (1 = I just play it by ear, 2 = only a few things, 3 = most of my things).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Suppose that you make an appointment with your friend to meet at a specific time, but he/she does not show up on time, how many minutes late would you view as being late? (1 = more than half an hour, 2 = five minutes to half an hour, 3 = no more than five minutes).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Our index of modernity is calculated as the average of these five scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We use income to measure socioeconomic integration, which is operationalised as a continuous variable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We use sense of belonging to measure psychological integration. Sense of belonging is measured with three observed variables adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012470394">Bollen and Hoyle’s (1990)</xref> scale: I feel a sense of belonging to cities; I feel that I am a member of cities; and, I see myself as part of cities. All three items were scored on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Cronbach reliability alpha is 0.788. We use the average score as a measure of rural–urban migrants’ psychological integration.</p>
<p>We control for individual factors and migration factors that might influence migrant integration. The former include gender, age, marital status, educational attainment and ethnicity. We use five variables—i.e. intraprovincial migration, duration of stay, the number of working hours, occupation and frequency of returning home—to reflect respondents’ migration characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0042098012470394">
<title>3.3 Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>We first present a description that shows the status of social networks. To reach a better understanding of the formation of non-kin resident ties, kin resident ties and non-resident ties, we use Poisson regressions to investigate the migrants’ individual and migration characteristics that are well connected in terms of these three ties. Secondly, we describe the status of migrant integration. Finally, we pay special attention to the role of resident ties in migrant integration by using OLS models. To examine whether network resources have a significant association with socioeconomic integration, we also ran two OLS models on socioeconomic integration by replacing the three network variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref> with the four network resource indices in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470394">Table 4</xref> of resident ties and non-resident ties. As noted earlier, it is possible that acculturation and socioeconomic integration influence migrants’ psychological integration. Therefore, we control for acculturation and socioeconomic integration while examining the relationship between migrant network and psychological integration.</p>

<title>4.1 Migrant Networks</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref> presents descriptive information on non-kin resident ties, kin resident ties and non-resident ties. There are sharp differences between resident ties and non-resident ties. According to our data, only 39 per cent of migrants have non-kin resident ties and 32 per cent have kin resident ties; in contrast, only 0.61 per cent of migrants do not have non-resident ties. The average numbers of non-kin resident ties and kin resident ties are 1.40 and 1.26 respectively. The average number of non-resident ties is about 20. Thus a limited proportion of rural–urban migrants have non-kin resident ties and kin resident ties, and non-resident ties make up the majority of migrant networks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098012470394">Table 4</xref> compares network resource variables of migrants’ resident ties<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012470394">3</xref></sup> and non-resident ties. The mean of upper reachability of resident ties is a little higher than that of non-resident ties. However, the difference is not significant. There are significant differences in heterogeneity, extensity and network size between resident ties and non-resident ties. It is somewhat surprising that the network resources embedded in resident ties are not better than in non-resident ties. A possible reason is the hierarchical social structure—i.e. those social actors with lower social status are less likely to contact other actors with higher social status. Because of their lower socioeconomic status, migrants’ opportunities to construct social ties with local urban residents of higher socioeconomic status are limited.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098012470394">Table 5</xref> shows that some individual and migration factors are associated with the construction of non-kin resident ties, kin resident ties and non-resident ties. Formation of ties with non-kin residents is associated with individual and migratory characteristics such as gender, education, duration of stay and, most of all, occupation. Male migrants (IRR = 1.22) and higher education (IRRs for junior high and senior high and above are 1.32 and 1.55 respectively) are significantly related to a higher number of non-kin resident ties. Longer time spent in urban society increases the incidence rate (IRR = 1.37) of having ties with non-kin residents. Occupation is associated with a marked increase in IRRs for non-kin resident ties (IRRs for self-employed and non-manual labour are 1.83 and 3.47 respectively).</p>

<title>4.2 Migrant Integration</title>
<p>The integration status of rural–urban migrants is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012470394">Table 2</xref>. The mean of migrants’ modernity is 2.41, ranging from 1 to 3, which suggests that migrants’ acculturation in terms of modernity is not bad. With respect to socioeconomic integration, migrants’ average monthly income is 2089 <italic>yuan</italic> with a range from 250 to 50 000 and a median of 1600. The average score for sense of belonging to cities is 3.54, which is not very high since it lies between ‘neutral’ and ‘somewhat agree’.</p>

<title>4.3 The Relationships between Migrant–Resident Ties and Migrant Integration</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098012470394">Table 6</xref> presents the relationships between migrant–resident ties and migrant integration. For each indicator of migrant integration, we introduce variables in two sets so as to assess whether migrant network variables make a significant contribution to migrant integration and how much variance is explained by the migrant network. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098012470394">Table 6</xref> shows that network variables make significant contributions to all three dimensions of integration. The proportions of variance that can be explained by network variables versus all the variables included in model 2, model 4 and model 6 are 27.6 per cent (0.016/0.058), 3.6 per cent (0.008/0.220) and 32.8 per cent (0.021/0.064) respectively, which suggests that social networks make much greater contributions to acculturation and psychological integration than to socioeconomic integration.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098012470394">Table 6</xref> reveals three significant relationships between non-residents and migrant integration: migrants with more non-resident ties tend to have higher modernity, higher income and lower sense of belonging (Hypotheses Hna, Hnsn and Hnp). The findings that non-kin resident ties and non-resident ties play opposite roles in psychological integration are consistent with previous findings that heterogeneous personal networks tend to exhibit more plural identity while homogeneous networks can reinforce an individual’s exclusive ethnic self-identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012470394">Lubbers <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we ran another two OLS models by replacing the network variables with network resource variables to examine the link between network resources and income. The results, which are not presented in the paper due to space limitation, are available upon request and show that network resource variables make a significant contribution to income (p&lt;0.05) with an adjusted <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> improvement of 0.005 (adjusted <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> for the whole model is 0.222). However, we find only one significant positive relationship in the model—namely, the network size of non-resident ties is positively associated with socioeconomic integration (the coefficient is also 0.001 with p&lt;0.05, the same as in model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098012470394">Table 6</xref>), which reflects that the three other network resource variables do not matter as much as network size (Hypothesis Hnsr is not confirmed). None of the network resource variables of resident ties is significant (Hypothesis Hrsr not confirmed). Considering that network resources embedded in resident ties are not better than in non-resident ties, such findings are not so surprising.</p>
<p>The test results for our specific hypotheses are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0042098012470394">Table 7</xref>. Compared with kin resident ties and non-resident ties, the roles of non-kin resident ties in migrant integration are more consequential. Kin resident ties are not significantly related to acculturation and psychological integration (Hypotheses Hra2 and Hrp2 are not confirmed). Model 4 shows a significant negative relationship between kin resident ties and socioeconomic integration (Hypothesis Hrsn2 is not confirmed). This is unexpected and of great interest; it deserves to be studied further. Non-resident ties are positively related to migrants’ acculturation and socioeconomic integration, but have a negative association with psychological integration. In contrast, non-kin resident ties have positive effects on all three dimensions of migrant integration. The reasons underlying the different roles of migrant–resident ties in different dimensions of migrant integration might be the following. First, migrants have still been restricted to the secondary labour market rather than the primary one in recent years, which hinders their upward socioeconomic mobility. Institutional barriers exert a more direct and stricter effect on migrants’ socioeconomic integration than on acculturation and psychological integration. As a result, social networks contribute a little to explain the variance of socioeconomic integration and network resource variables of migrant–resident ties are not related to socioeconomic integration. Secondly, in general, migrants are more likely to meet non-kin residents than kin residents in workplaces and neighbourhoods. Day-to-day or face-to-face contacts with non-kin residents facilitate migrants’ cultural and psychological integration. This might explain why kin resident ties have no significant association with acculturation and psychological integration.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>Although researchers tend to attach great importance to social networks for migrant integration into receiving societies, there are surprisingly few empirical tests to support these theories and studies from the perspective of migrant–resident ties are even rarer. This paper is one of the few that empirically investigates the relationship between social networks and migrant integration. The focus on migrant–resident ties in the present study provides further understanding of the process of migrant integration. Our findings shed some light on the role of ties between immigrants and local residents in destination societies. Several findings are worth summarising.</p>
<p>First, non-kin social ties between migrants and local urban residents are limited; non-resident ties still make up the majority of migrant networks. Because of the constraint imposed by hierarchical social structure, the majority of local urban residents whom migrants knew were of middle socioeconomic status or below. Social resources embedded in migrant–resident ties are not better than in non-resident ties.</p>
<p>Secondly, formation of ties with non-kin residents is strongly affected by individual and migratory characteristics. Male migrants, higher education, longer time spent in urban society and the occupations of self-employed and non-manual labour are significantly related to a higher number of non-kin resident ties.</p>
<p>Thirdly, migrant–resident ties have significant associations with migrant integration. In comparison with kin resident ties and non-resident ties, non-kin resident ties play a crucial role in migrant integration. In the presence of institutional discrimination, rural–urban migrants are confined to the secondary labour market which explains why migrant networks make a very limited contribution to socioeconomic integration. In contrast, institutional barriers do not have direct and strict effects on acculturation and psychological integration. As a result, social networks contribute much more to acculturation and psychological integration.</p>
<p>Considering the different effects of migrant–resident ties on the three dimensions of migrant integration, migrants face the risk of being trapped in permanent poverty and falling into the underclass in city societies. The limited effects of migrant–resident ties on socioeconomic integration might lead to a situation where migrants’ socioeconomic integration lags behind both their acculturation and psychological integration. Recognising that young migrants are more educated, more ambitious, more skilled, know less about farming and have a stronger preference for non-farm work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012470394">Yue <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), it is safe to infer that, once migrants have culturally accepted the urban industrial lifestyle and psychologically consider themselves as members of cities, most will not return to their rural origins and, unlike their predecessors, will settle in the city, regardless of their socioeconomic situation. It follows that those migrants with a lower socioeconomic status will be trapped in the underclass in city societies.</p>
<p>Our findings on the role of migrant–resident ties in migrant integration carry far-reaching policy implications. Currently, in China, institutional discrimination (primarily through the <italic>hukou</italic> system) is the strongest barrier to migrant integration, especially socioeconomic integration. We argue that institutional reforms are urgent for migrant integration. Before completely removing such institutional obstacles, promoting stronger relationships between migrant workers and urban residents is a practical way to advance the process of migrant integration, especially for acculturation and psychological integration. Since urban residents often consider migrants as ‘foreigners in their midst’, actions should be taken to lead urban residents to realise migrants’ important contribution to the socioeconomic development of city societies and even the whole of China. Programmes that aim to promote relationships between migrants and urban residents in workplaces and neighbourhoods, and migrant and urban children in schools, could also enhance migrants’ integration into city societies.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. First, it is important to note that our data are cross-sectional and hence it is possible that the relationship we have modelled from migrant–resident ties to migrant integration actually works in the reverse—some migrants may have a higher level of integration first and then seek to construct social ties with local urban residents. A more robust test of the role of migrant–resident ties would require longitudinal study. Secondly, we lack qualitative data to explain how rural–urban migrants construct migrant–resident ties and what impact such ties play in their integration process; these should be addressed in future research. Thirdly, in our survey, network sizes are only roughly estimated by asking respondents to report the number of corresponding social ties, which may decrease the reliability of network measures. Further investigation should be aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of network measures.</p>

<p>The continuing unbalanced sex ratio at birth for years in China has led many males of lower social status to face difficulty in getting married. Unmarried males aged over 27 have even less chance to marry. Some of these are rural–urban migrants. Since one objective of the survey is to compare the well-being of married men, young unmarried men and elderly unmarried men among migrants, we thus divide the migrants into these five sub-groups.</p>
