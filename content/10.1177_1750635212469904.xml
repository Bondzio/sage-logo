<p>The landscape/battlefield photographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212469904">Simon Norfolk (2012)</xref> illuminates a growing divergence between the ways wars are fought and the ways they are photographed (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212469904">Hoskins, forthcoming</xref>). Whilst modern war increasingly involves special forces, drones and related cyberwarfare – all aspects that are difficult to photograph for obvious reasons – a mainstream Western media perpetuates an iconic vision of 20th-century warfare in the 21st. Most recently this is evidenced by the persistence of the US military helicopter ‘medevac’ image from the war in Afghanistan in the US mainstream media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469904">Shaw, 2011</xref>) echoing David C Turnley’s 1991 World Press Photo of the Year which, in turn, is a ‘re-shoot’ of the iconic Larry Burrows’ Vietnam photograph which made the cover of <italic>Life</italic> magazine in April 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212469904">Hoskins, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212469904">Norfolk, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>These shifts in the representationality of contemporary warfare not only challenge and skew mainstream media coverage, but also the study of the relationship between contemporary media and warfare. The modes of representation and the forms of data available to research inevitably determine how the field is ‘envisioned’. The arrival of ‘big data’ has enabled researcher engagements with the media content of warfare to be gathered, mined and analysed in new ways. This ‘<italic>databasing the world’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212469904">Bowker, 2007</xref>: 22, emphasis in original) has brought about new remote forms of warfare as well as new means of studying the relationship between war and media. The former (distancing modes of representation) push journalists and scholars further from an interrogation of the means and consequences of contemporary warfare and its mediations, whilst the latter (new ways to access, search and order media data) shape two paradigms of study.</p>
<p>The first paradigm is the turn to emergent media. This includes the ‘scraping’ of huge datasets of social media such as Facebook and Twitter aggregating potentially millions of postings or tweets into a single corpus. The use of social media in the Arab Spring and the 2011 English riots, for example, have spawned projects concerned with the digital medial dynamics of organization and resistance to revolution and urban unrest.</p>
<p>The second paradigm is the turn to established media. This is the basing of entire projects/articles on a corpus that is obtained through the searching and mining of print and broadcast (transcripts) across sometimes vast numbers and extensive periods of publications and programmes in databases such as Lexis Nexis. In respect of achieving robust insights into the relationship between war and media and in advancing the field, both of these paradigms of study are fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>The role of media in the planning, fighting, (de)legitimizing, exacerbating, assuaging, remembering and historicizing of conflict and warfare in the context of today’s ‘new media ecology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212469904">Hoskins and O’Loughlin, 2010a</xref>) is not reducible to either established or emergent media. Instead, the mediation of war is a matter of an ongoing set of dynamics: remediation, translation, connectivity, temporality, reflexivity, across and between media and their multiple modalities. The point is that the influences and impact of any medium cannot be understood in isolation from other media, or, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212469904">WJT Mitchell (2005</xref>: 260): ‘<italic>all media are mixed media’</italic> (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>This raises the question: why have these two research paradigms developed? Perhaps it is owing to the seductiveness of volume. The large corpus is attractive as it is often mistaken for the validity, reliability and generalizability of comprehensiveness of a dataset. There is a history to these developments. From the 1970s, pioneers such as the Glasgow University Media Group legitimately laid claim to a certain fullness of data when television in the UK for example consisted of only three channels and news programming was constrained to the punctual lunchtime and evening bulletins, and radio news was similarly limited.</p>
<p>Although the media ecology has transformed beyond recognition, the legacy of early media content analysis (along with a lot of outmoded ‘broadcast era’ concepts and theories, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212469904">Merrin, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212469904">forthcoming</xref>) continues to haunt the field and is perpetuated in the training of future scholars today. I have read countless article submissions to this journal (and to many other journals) in which the same modes of analysis and claims are merely transposed from one dataset to the next, from one war to the next. The most common example is the selection of one or more country’s press coverage of the Iraq War. Some of these accounts seem oblivious to the fact that at the time this was the most multimodal and multimedia war in history. Instead, they strip away all of the dynamics of the media ecology in which such coverage is inextricably embedded.</p>
<p>Even leaving aside the dynamics of intermediation and remediation in a highly connected new media ecology, how can claims be made as to the ‘construction of meaning’ or the ‘framing’ of a particular event or discourse based singularly upon the quantification of terms from a database that strips out the very organization and contextualization of these terms, namely layout, images, captions, whether these are in a print newspaper or online?</p>
<p>In this journal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212469904">Nik Gowing (2011</xref>: 16) writes of the snail-like response of those ‘institutions of power’ to grasp the transformations in the new media ecology:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this relentless, uncompromising and often brutal new real-time information environment, the most obvious remains the most elusive. Mindsets rarely shift comfortably and willingly. Their institutional systems are no longer equipped to embrace the ferocious new real-time realities of what is effectively now an infinite, almost four-dimensional media landscape.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gowing’s words seem highly applicable to a great deal of scholarship in the field of war and media: its concepts, theories, methods. There is much insecurity in imagining how the ‘new matrix of real-time information flows’ (p. 16) can be fitted into long prescribed and established modes of analysis. The point is that they can’t.</p>
<p>Having studied the television coverage of war and its consequences for over a decade, this may all seem a bit rich coming from me. However, in work with colleagues in recent years, we have at least attempted some of the interdisciplinary holistic analyses that are required to avoid falling into the gap between established and emergent media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212469904">Hoskins and O’Loughlin, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212469904">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635212469904">Awan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469904">Scollon and Scollon (2004)</xref>, these projects have employed the analytical framework of ‘nexus analysis’. A nexus analysis maps the ‘semiotic cycles’ (the circulation of symbols, including media content) generated by actions taken in response to a mediated event or in the formation of a social network or institution such as a military or terrorist organisation. Crucially, this framework is designed to capture the past, present and future trajectories of meaning implicated in the sum of communications around the phenomenon.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that these represent the only attempts to move beyond the dichotomy of established and emergent media, but they are at least born from recognition of the key problem, in my view, of a serious stasis in the field.</p>
<p>As the mediations of warfare become more complex – both concentrated and diffused – the means of mining such mediations demand greater scrutiny, with a more critical vision and robust methodology needed to interrogate the shifting dynamics of war in the new media ecology.</p>

<title>A new editor</title>
<p>After five years, I am stepping down as co-editor of <italic>Media, War &amp; Conflict</italic>, partly for reasons of other accumulating commitments but, more importantly, it is time to make way for a new member of the team. We are all delighted to welcome Dr Sarah Maltby as a new co-editor of <italic>Media, War &amp; Conflict</italic>. Sarah is based in Sociology at City University, London, and is well-known for her work on the military management of information and media, morality and representations of suffering, and as founder of the international War and Media Network. Her latest book is: <italic>Military Media Management: Negotiating the ‘Front’ Line in Mediatized War</italic> (Routledge, 2012).</p>
<p>It has been a real pleasure to work with my fellow editors – Ben O’Loughlin, Barry Richards, and Philip Seib – to whom I am deeply indebted. This journal was first imagined in a conversation with Julia Hall in 2004 (then media editor at Sage) and we owe much to her vision. I must also express my real thanks to her successor – Mila Steele – for her faith in the journal, to our brilliant Managing Editor, Arlene Luck and the great UK production team of Monica Schiza and Jane Price. Finally, it has been a real pleasure to read the work of our authors and also the constructive and thoughtful contributions of our reviewers, and we are very grateful for their continuing commitment.</p>
