<abstract>
<p>The discussion about the relationship between globalization and journalism has stressed the westernization of information flows, contra-flows, and the globalization of news practices. Beyond information flows and news practices, it is important to examine the impact that globalization has on news narratives. With the emergence of the extra-national WikiLeaks, it is possible that the ‘national narrative’ through which journalists interpret information is eroded and replaced by an increasingly autonomous journalism. This study tests this possibility by examining how an Israeli newspaper and an Australian newspaper incorporated leaked documents into news coverage and how they framed WikiLeaks’ contribution to journalism. It finds that the papers in each country mined the leaks for geopolitical relevance to their respective countries, but did so in a way that facilitated debate about what the national interest should be. In doing so, the papers reframed WikiLeaks from a problem for the state to a whistleblower against their countries’ and US officials. By extension, the papers positioned themselves as whistleblowers and democratic facilitators. A ‘national lens’ continues to inform newswork, but the ‘national narrative’ has eroded.</p>

<body>
<p>In November 2010 WikiLeaks – an organization that facilitates whistleblowers – began leaking a series of diplomatic cables that publicized secret communiqués between US State Department officials and non-US officials around the globe. Although WikiLeaks was praised by some for facilitating government transparency, these leaks threatened each state’s ability to control information flows and narrative constructions about their policies. In the USA and elsewhere, WikiLeaks was criticized for eliminating diplomatic ‘rough draft’ communications between states and states and their embassies, threatening states’ abilities to speak honestly with one another through non-public channels. These concerns would suggest a global interest in condemning WikiLeaks as a threat to national and global security.</p>
<p>Indeed, Brian Williams, of the US National Broadcasting Company, began his 29 November broadcast saying, ‘It has happened again. The website WikiLeaks has gone public with US state secrets, thousands of them, a massive coordinated leak of documents seemingly <italic>designed to hurt the United States</italic>, its power, prestige, and influence around the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912448901">Williams, 2010</xref>, our emphasis). This was an instance in which the network closed ranks to protect the ‘national interest’ and reassert the norms of ‘proper’ state–citizen and state–journalism relations in which some communications should remain concealed from the public. We account for this ‘closed’ construction via the journalistic practice of protecting and reasserting the norms of the nation-state when it is perceived as threatened. Because secrets that were exposed were centrally those of the USA, we would expect US news organizations to adopt a ‘national narrative’ whose framings are consistent with consensus positions emanating from the White House and Congress, which immediately and consistently framed WikiLeaks as a national and global security threat despite previously having praised WikiLeaks for facilitating Third World transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912448901">Leigh and Harding, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we are interested in understanding and explaining the reportage about WikiLeaks in news media located in nations – namely, Israel and Australia – whose state secrets were released more peripherally than US secrets (i.e. in releasing US secrets WikiLeaks concomitantly leaked other states’ secrets). We do so to examine the impact that the emerging global media ecology, particularly the birth of the extra-national journalist, has on the ‘national epistemology’ that informs nation-based newswork. Debates about the relationship between globalization and communication/journalism have stressed the Americanization or westernization of communication flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912448901">Cottle, 2009</xref>), contra-flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884912448901">Thussu, 2007</xref>), and the ‘globalization’ of news practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912448901">Reese, 2008</xref>). Our interest here leans toward testing the latter possibility: can the emergence of the extra-national news organization render more vulnerable the ‘national lens’, whether the national epistemology or its exaggerated national narrative, through which nation-based news organizations interpret the world?</p>
<sec id="section1-1464884912448901">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>As global capital expands, a ‘liquid modernity’ has emerged in which citizens and mediaworkers are said to shift from a nation-based prism toward a global outlook, developing a ‘distinctly anti-hierarchical character’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912448901">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 29). As a result, the concept of ‘citizenship’ is fluctuating and extending toward forms beyond the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912448901">Hoffman, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912448901">Reese (2008)</xref> argued that globalization has influenced all news organizations in at least minimal ways, and one of those effects may be the shift from the national to the global outlook and from national reverence to irreverence. In the USA, for example, <italic>The Daily Show</italic> mocks political authority and criticizes established journalistic practices that enable propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912448901">Baym, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912448901">Jones, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With the birth of the extra-national WikiLeaks, the liquid modern newsworker has gained more traction. WikiLeaks is not based in any nation-state and its practitioners and those who leak information to it come from all over the globe. Julian Assange, the organization’s founder, fits the description of the liquid modern person as he moves between states, claims no national home, and possesses an irreverent stance toward the nation and western power. Like most hackers, Assange and WikiLeaks are committed ‘to the free flow of information, unrestricted access to computer resources, and the idea of computer technology as an instrument of the public good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912448901">Nissenbaum, 2004</xref>: 203). Hackers work toward freeing information, believing that free information is essential if they are to live out their positive conception of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912448901">Coleman and Golub, 2008</xref>). Assange’s public statements reveal a commitment not only to freeing information, but to an anti-hierarchical philosophy and a national irreverence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884912448901">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>National irreverence may be facilitated by globalization’s ‘deterritorialization’ of the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464884912448901">Reese et al., 2007</xref>), and there are traces of a global epistemology that informs news stories written even for nation-based news organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912448901">Berglez, 2008</xref>). This new epistemology has emerged out of globalization itself as well as journalistic practices that are made possible by it – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912448901">Reese (2008</xref>: 242) called a whole ‘system of newsgathering, editing and distribution not based on national or regional boundaries – where it is not expected that shared national or community citizenship is the common reference uniting newsmaking, journalists, and audience’.</p>
<p>The emergence of the extra-national news organization, and nation-based journalistic reliance on its work, may render more vulnerable the ‘objective’ national epistemology and its exaggerated national narrative. In normal times professional journalism is written according to the ‘objective’ practices of journalism whereby reporters construct ‘open’ accounts and avoid labels. Even professional practices, however, are constrained within an objective-appearing national ‘ethnocentrism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912448901">Gans, 2004</xref>), and the national political consensus effectively limits discourses available and legitimized in the press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912448901">Hallin, 1986</xref>). The ‘notions, values, and ideas that resonate’ within a particular culture mediate news constructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884912448901">Ravi, 2005</xref>: 59). Thus, journalists wear the ‘domestic glasses’ of their particular nation-sate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912448901">Nossek, 2004</xref>). This national epistemology is exaggerated to the point of the national narrative when the national interest is perceived as threatened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912448901">Liebes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912448901">Nossek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884912448901">Roeh and Cohen, 1992</xref>). Unlike the professional narrative, the national narrative is constructed in a ‘closed’ manner in which reporters ‘must go to the right sources, at the right times, and come away with the right information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884912448901">Nossek and Berkowitz, 2006</xref>: 692). In times of a perceived national security crisis, the nation becomes the ‘hometown team’ which the citizenry is to support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884912448901">Reese, 2004</xref>) and dissent is marginalized or ridiculed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912448901">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912448901">Hallin, 1986</xref>). These effects are typically attributed to the role that officials play framing news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912448901">Bennett, 1990</xref>), but journalists often adopt the national consensus independently of official rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884912448901">Reese and Lewis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the rise of the extra-national journalist and the concomitant potential for an enhanced global epistemology may erode the national epistemology’s dominance, news of global affairs has typically been ‘domesticated’ by reporters’ domestic glasses, so that the nation acts as a ‘countervailing force to the pull of globalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912448901">Gurevitch et al., 1991</xref>: 207). In the USA, for example, contra-flows from Arab satellite networks are framed as untrustworthy, irrational, immoral, and unethical sources of information and interpretations (Wessler and Adolphsen, 2006). However, reporters sometimes confront news that is neither ‘ours’ nor ‘theirs’, but ‘ours both’. In cases where nation-state security interests overlap, reporters operating in different nation-states adopt similar operating assumptions to construct news, whether the professional or national narrative is chosen and may do so independently of officials’ public rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912448901">Handley and Ismail, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Epistemologically centric</italic> approaches to media analysis, then, predict that story constructions result from news media epistemologies and the journalistic practices that are made possible by them and that are a result of those epistemologies. It does not necessarily matter what official sources are saying, especially because official sources might not always be willing to speak to journalists about global affairs. The question is whether those epistemologies are global or national in scope, and whether reliance on the extra-national journalist can undo the national epistemology and its exaggerated national narrative.</p>
<p>A <italic>source-centric</italic> approach to media analysis predicts that constructed narratives result from journalistic reliance on a range of sources, with deference to state officials’ interpretations. From this perspective, WikiLeaks would be framed according to the manner in which a particular country’s officials perceive the leaks and these framings would vary across journalistic boundaries as consensus national interests are crafted. This position would predict that, to the extent that a global elite interest in framing WikiLeaks as a threat to global security would emerge, it would be reflected in news framing.</p>
<p>To the extent that the literature on Israeli and Australian journalism helps answer these questions, it shows that the press in each state is contradictorily independent of and attached to official state interpretations. More so than the US press, Australian newsworkers provide analysis and interpretation, and investigate the claims of their government. An overwhelming majority of Australian reporters report that using state documents without permission ‘might be justified’ in some instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912448901">Deuze, 2002</xref>). Australian journalism is also marked by a deep faith in fulfilling its role as the Fourth Estate. Australian journalists report wanting to uncover the truth behind a sanitized information management machine, an assertiveness for investigating the powerful despite possible legal repercussions and a belief in something called the ‘public interest’ that legitimizes the investigative function, and are ‘well-placed’ to serve that public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884912448901">Schultz, 1998</xref>). Based in a multicultural society, Australian journalists are highly interested in international news, especially that coming from Europe, the USA, and the Pacific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912448901">Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Israeli news media, even local media, are mostly national in scope due to the state’s small size and as part of an effort to overcome a series of ethnic and ideological divisions that limit national solidarity. Yet Israel’s journalism reflects these divisions as it is informed by its citizens’ critical stance toward state authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912448901">Shoemaker and Cohen, 2006</xref>). Although toggling between an allegiance to the nation and the profession, professionalism is said to eventually trump the national narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884912448901">Zandberg and Nieger, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We ask the following research questions:
<disp-quote>
<p>RQ1: How did these papers frame WikiLeaks and incorporate WikiLeaks-released diplomatic cables into their news reports? What narratives were constructed out of the released cables?</p>
<p>RQ2: How does nation-based news mediation of the extra-national WikiLeaks help us understand the impact of the global emerging media ecology on the ‘national lens’?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1464884912448901" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We chose two newspapers to study these issues: <italic>Haaretz</italic> (Israel) and the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> (Australia), employing the search term ‘WikiLeaks’ for both. <italic>Haaretz</italic> articles were retrieved from the newspaper’s website and Canberra <italic>Times</italic> articles were retrieved from the Lexis-Nexis database.</p>
<p>Given that Assange’s home country is Australia and because Australian state secrets were leaked we chose to analyze the <italic>Canberra Times</italic>. The <italic>Canberra Times</italic> may be a local paper, but it is a paper that serves Australia’s capital region. Its website boasts a circulation of 42,000 with its Monday–Friday edition, 72,000 on Saturday, and 40,000 on Sunday. It is available in Sydney, Australia’s largest city, and Melbourne, Australia’s second largest city. As a paper located in Australia’s capital, the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> claims a motto, ‘To serve the national city and through it the nation,’ but it also claims to serve the ‘Canberra people [who] are commonly engaged with the outside world’. Thus, ‘the news mix of the paper reflects intense interest in world and national news, as well as of the affairs of the city’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884912448901">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We chose <italic>Haaretz</italic> because Israel occupied a rather substantial space in the WikiLeaks release. Of course, Israel’s regular presence in world news – and with the Middle East being the hotbed that it is – further enhances the rationale for picking a major Israeli paper. Privately owned with both print and online editions, <italic>Haaretz</italic> is Israel’s ‘first and most prestigious daily’, considered to possess a liberal editorial line and read by the country’s social and political elite (Caspi and Limor, 1999, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884912448901">Rinnawai, 2007</xref>: 157).</p>
<p>We analyzed coverage in these papers from 29 November 2010, through 12 December 2010, because it constitutes a time period when WikiLeaks had permeated establishment news discourse, including the personal saga around allegations that Assange had sexually assaulted two women in Sweden. We analyzed news articles, excluding opinion items and news analysis, yielding 44 stories in <italic>Haaretz</italic> and 31 in the <italic>Canberra Times</italic>. Only articles that were at least partly original to each paper were selected for analysis. If both <italic>Haaretz</italic> and another news organization authored the story, for example, it was included in the analysis but if <italic>Haaretz</italic> did not help author the story, it was excluded from analysis. We chose this sample selection technique to ensure that only the material created by the sampled newspapers was investigated.</p>
<p>We employed textual analysis, which ‘depends upon very detailed data analysis’ and is a qualitative strategy that draws from theory toward the ‘deep analysis of small bodies of publicly shareable data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912448901">Silverman, 2000</xref>: 828). Using relevant ‘moments’ as ‘sites of discourse’ as sampling periods is an adequate method whereby these moments ‘serve as points of reference to guide … examination of news’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912448901">Ismail, 2008</xref>: 185). In this case, the prolific rise of WikiLeaks following the initial leak of diplomatic cables on 28 November 2010 through to the legal quagmire constituted our moment of interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1464884912448901">
<title><italic>Haaretz</italic> analysis</title>
<p>We confront a phenomenon where WikiLeaks served as a news-breaker, from which <italic>Haaretz</italic>, among other outlets, derived information thereby assuming the role of news-maker. We argue that WikiLeaks has surpassed its more traditional news counterparts in prominence, having scooped them to some of the more controversial political substance. WikiLeaks offers information that, for the state, should have remained secret, but which finds its way to the public sphere anyway.</p>
<p><italic>Haaretz</italic> tended to employ the leaks to focus on Israeli and Middle Eastern matters, indicating the dominance of a national epistemology. But even news that might shed negative light on Israeli policies and decisions was communicated in <italic>Haaretz</italic>. For example, one story reported that in 2009:
<disp-quote>
<p>… Israel had tried to coordinate Operation Cast Lead with Egypt and Fatah, offering to allow its neighbor and the Palestinian faction to take control of Gaza after an Israeli defeat of Hamas, according to US State Department documents released last night by WikiLeaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>but received negative responses from both Egypt and Fatah. The story was careful to note: ‘Numerous news outlets yesterday published the contents of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks’, thereby highlighting the importance assigned to material emanating from this site.</p>
<p>Also in terms shedding light on Israel’s problems, <italic>Haaretz</italic> published a story on 3 December conveying that the US Embassy in Tel Aviv had been closely monitoring Israeli figures involved in organized crime, even ‘taking pains to prevent members of crime families from being issued visas to the United States’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>In a story also involving intelligence activity, senior officials in the Lebanese government reportedly sent the US embassy detailed intelligence that Hezbollah was operating an independent communications network across Lebanon, one which strategically serves Iran given the well-known Iran–Hezbollah alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010d</xref>). The very next day, the newspaper reported that the Lebanese communications minister said Iran financed the network’s construction, referencing the same cable that was cited in the previous day’s story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010e</xref>). The question here becomes why the sponsorship information appeared on 7 December rather than 6 December when the same cable is at stake. In other words, was more information added to WikiLeaks during this time period or did <italic>Haaretz</italic> choose to incorporate this information the next day and, if so, then for what reason?</p>
<p>In a separate reaffirmation of Hezbollah’s centrality to Israeli politics, <italic>Haaretz</italic> reported on a leak that claimed the Israeli government knew of Hezbollah’s involvement in attacking an Israeli diplomatic convoy in Jordan in January of 2010. This was construed as apparently a response to the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, a Hezbollah militant commander, whose killing Hezbollah accused Israel of plotting. In reasserting the Iran–Hezbollah connection, the same story reports on a cable featuring Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, saying that ‘a Hezbollah victory means the end of the Lebanese government and the beginning of an Iranian takeover of Lebanon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010f</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps because of what WikiLeaks revealed – questionable Israeli practices and Arab support for a strike against Iran – <italic>Haaretz</italic> labeled WikiLeaks ‘the online whistle-blower’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010d</xref>) and ‘the whistle-blowing website’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010c</xref>). In doing so, <italic>Haaretz</italic> positioned itself as a whistleblower as well.</p>
<p>On 3 December <italic>Haaretz</italic> reported on a classified US diplomatic cable saying that Lebanese Defense Minister Elias Murr delivered advice to the US Embassy in Beirut on how Israel could defeat Hezbollah should a new war erupt on Israel’s northern border by not, among other things, antagonizing Christian communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010c</xref>).</p>
<p>Other cables reportedly spoke of Israel’s ambassador to Turkey calling Turkey’s prime minister a ‘fundamentalist’, according to a report submitted by his US counterpart to his superiors in Washington. This, the story explained, was ‘among an array of classified US documents released by the WikiLeaks group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884912448901">Ravid and News Agencies, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In some instances, the figures of concern responded to WikiLeaks material. A case in point is Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan’s rebuttal to the aforementioned:
<disp-quote>
<p>Erdogan on Monday downplayed the publications. Speaking in Istanbul before travelling to Libya for an Africa-European Union summit Erdogan said the credibility of the WikiLeaks website that leaked the documents was ‘questionable’, Turkey’s news agency reported. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884912448901">Ravid and News Agencies, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>WikiLeaks also emerged as a potential vehicle for scoring political points. One story addressed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s commentary on documents revealing Arab leaders’ fear of Iran’s nuclear program and others expressing US dissatisfaction with Erdogan; he is quoted as saying, ‘The documents show many sources backing Israel’s assessments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912448901">Ravid, 2010a</xref>). Attesting to the repercussions of WikiLeaks revelations, the same story also quotes Netanyahu as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Every Israeli leader has known for years that that [sic] dispatches are likely to leak out, so we adapted ourselves to the reality of leaks,’ he said. ‘That has a bearing on who I invite to meetings. No classified Israeli material was exposed by WikiLeaks.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a separate instance underlining the potential power of WikiLeaks, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that contacts with the United States over a renewed moratorium on West Bank construction had been frozen ‘in the wake of the WikiLeaks crisis and the tensions between North and South Korea’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912448901">Lis, 2010</xref>). In fact, the report also states that some Knesset members criticized Barak in light of the revelations, describing Israel’s foreign policy as ‘problematic’.</p>
<p>Julian Assange himself invoked Netanyahu’s rhetoric in justifying the purpose of his project. Commenting on Netanyahu’s statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can, Assange ‘singl[ed] out Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an example of a world leader who believes the publications will aid global diplomacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010b</xref>). Assange spoke only days after WikiLeaks published thousands of secret diplomatic cables.</p>
<p>On the other hand, US State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley expressed his displeasure with leaked information on a weapons manufacturer in Haifa, Israel, which the USA regards as imperative to its security interests. Crowley called this publication ‘irresponsible’ on grounds that information involving critical infrastructure that supports the USA and other economies should be kept secret. He also claimed that this information ‘amounts to a targeting list that will be of interest to groups like al Qaeda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912448901">Ravid and Reuters, 2010</xref>). Further, the White House issued a statement saying that President Barack Obama supported ‘responsible, accountable, and open government at home and around the world, but this reckless and dangerous action runs counter to that goal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, having risen to the public spotlight, Assange became a public figure, alerting news attention when controversy surrounded him. His arrest last December, based on a Swedish warrant over allegations of sex crimes, made the news. Yet, WikiLeaks’ spokesman said the website would remain operational and adhere to its publication plans regardless of developments in Assange’s case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service and Reuters, 2010</xref>). Among those in Assange’s defense was a Kremlin official who stated that perhaps a way of helping Assange with his legal crisis would be awarding him a Nobel prize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912448901"><italic>Haaretz</italic> Service, 2010d</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Canberra Times</italic> analysis</title>
<p>Like <italic>Haaretz</italic>, our analysis of the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> reveals that the nation continues to predominantly inform news coverage of events. Coverage fluctuated between the national narrative and the national epistemology, and within the national epistemology WikiLeaks was framed alternatively as a threat to and a facilitator of the national interest.</p>
<p>Immediately, the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> straddled between framing WikiLeaks’ release of secret diplomatic cables as a national security threat and employing the leaked cables as a legitimate journalistic source to report about Australia’s foreign policy concerns and internal politics.</p>
<p>Although the paper initially assigned David Ellery, its ‘defense reporter’, to the WikiLeaks revelations, it referred to the cables to illuminate for the Australian public Alexander Downer’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884912448901">3</xref></sup> frustration with reunification talks in Cyprus – an island with ‘strong people-to-people links’ with Australia<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884912448901">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912448901">Ellery, 2010a</xref>). Yet that same day Ellery and David McLennan, the paper’s Parliamentary Bureau Chief of Staff, were assigned to report about the implications the cables might have for national security. ‘A whole-of-government task force,’ they wrote, was assigned to examining the cables for any ‘information that puts Australia’s national security at risk’, and the Australian Federal Police opened an investigation to determine ‘whether any Australian laws have been broken’. Although the paper employed a statement from WikiLeaks about its activities as a source to frame the USA as spying on its allies, ignoring human rights abuses in client states, and pressuring countries, the paper balanced this with US officials who framed WikiLeaks as ‘reckless and dangerous’, calling for Julian Assange’s prosecution for espionage. The story employed WikiLeaks-released cables to illuminate Australia’s activities with respect to its interests in the Pacific, but these details occupied a space within a larger national security threat frame in which Australian officials were employed to condemn the leaks as, quoting one official, ‘unauthorized and almost certainly illegal’. Australia’s Defense Minister was employed to say, ‘It does put people’s lives at risk. It puts ours and others’ national security at risk and it is conduct which is completely irresponsible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912448901">McLennan and Ellery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The next day a <italic>Canberra Times</italic> headline declared, ‘Secret documents just show “sloppy analysis”’, and with it the paper began to trivialize the information released by WikiLeaks. At that point the newspaper was suggesting that the <italic>only</italic> revelation the documents revealed was sloppy analysis on the part of US embassy officials. The paper quoted Dr Michael McKinley, a professor of International Relations at Australian National University, to trivialize the leaks:
<disp-quote>
<p>And really, what is in these things? What does calling Vladimir Putin an alpha dog tell the [US] Secretary of State [Hillary Clinton] that she needs to know when she’s talking to him? It’s just sloppy and useless information.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite this over-arching trivializing frame, however, the national security threat frame remained available in the story:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Federal Government is taking a very serious approach to the leaks and commissioned a team of Australian officials to examine the documents for entries that could harm the national interest. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912448901">Johnson, 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In another story that day the same reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912448901">Johnson, 2010a</xref>) described what the cables revealed about Russian weddings. With no reportage about the significance of the descriptions or their possible ramifications for global or Australian relations, how else to interpret journalism about this as other than framing the leaks as trivial gossip?</p>
<p>The <italic>Canberra Times</italic> chose to write stories from leaks that directly mentioned Australia, indicating a national epistemology that dominated its newsworkers’ thinking about the newsworthiness of the leaks. By 3 December the paper, although characterizing WikiLeaks as a threat and framing Julian Assange as ‘in hiding’ from the authorities, employed the leaked cables as a journalistic source to describe Australia’s relations with the USA and other nations, quoting and paraphrasing from the cables as if they were a journalistic source:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Canadian Government had its nose put out of joint because Australia was brought to an inner intelligence-sharing circle over the Iraq War, according to the latest WikiLeaks diplomatic cables to be published.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>Canberra Times</italic> continued, ‘In another cable published yesterday, the American embassy in New Delhi praised Australia and then prime minister Kevin Rudd for the Government’s reaction to the 2009 bomb attacks on Mumbai’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912448901">Johnson, 2010c</xref>).</p>
<p>A ‘global elite’ interest to characterize WikiLeaks as a threat clearly had an impact on the paper’s coverage, however, indicating the presence of a national ‘ours both’ narrative. WikiLeaks-as-national-security-threat continued on 4 December as the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> wrote that Australia’s ‘federal Attorney-General threatened to sic the Australian Federal Police on to Julian Assange and his confreres for releasing material which had “the potential to affect the national security interest of the USA and its allies, including Australia”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912448901"><italic>Canberra Times</italic>, 2010</xref>). In this story the WikiLeaks-released cables were framed as a threat to both Australia and the USA.</p>
<p>When that ‘global elite’ wasn’t commenting, however, a national epistemology continued to inform newswork – although in this case the national epistemology was transformed from framing WikiLeaks as a threat to framing it as facilitating the public sphere. Journalists believed that WikiLeaks, and by extension themselves, were helping the nation protect itself against domestic and foreign threats. By 6 December, however, government officials, besides characterizing WikiLeaks as a threat, were refusing to comment on the released cables. The paper chose to fill the interpretive vacuum by employing the WikiLeaks-released cables as a means of illuminating for the public Australia’s internal political dynamics and its relations with its Pacific neighbors and the USA. The national security threat had all but disappeared as the paper invoked the released cables as a starting point to debate the meaning of Australia’s national interest. The cables revealed that Kevin Rudd, when Australia’s Prime Minister, ‘urged the United States to prepare to “deploy force if everything goes with” with China’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912448901">David McLennan (2010)</xref>, the reporter, continued:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mr. Rudd also reportedly told Mrs. Clinton his proposed Asia-Pacific community was ‘mostly as an effort to ensure Chinese dominance of the East Asia summit did not result in a “Chinese Monroe Doctrine”’ and an Asia without the United States.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The next day the paper quoted Rudd, who was now Australia’s Foreign Minister, who stepped in to perform ‘damage control’ with respect to the publicized leaked cable. According to the paper:
<disp-quote>
<p>Responding yesterday to a leaked diplomatic cable detailing his frank conversation last year with the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Rudd said the Sino-Australian relationship remained unchanged despite the leak.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rudd called the Australian–Chinese relationship ‘robust’ enough to handle disagreements and revelations like these, but most important for consideration here is the fact that the publication of the released cable initiated, in the news pages, serious debate about Australia’s foreign policy behavior: ‘But shadow foreign minister Julie Bishop,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912448901">Johnson (2010d)</xref> wrote, ‘said Prime Minister Julia Gillard needed to clarify whether Mr. Rudd’s commentary on China was the Government’s current policy.’ The reason is that Bishop believed ‘Mr. Rudd’s language could be damaging to Australia’s international relations’.</p>
<p>That day’s newspaper, 7 December, used the cables to report about internal Australian concerns, including Australians on the US terrorist watch list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912448901">Flitton and Epstein, 2010</xref>) and whether the Australian National University would follow the lead of some US colleges that warned their students not to read the cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884912448901">Mannheim, 2010</xref>). More significant, though, is the fact that the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> largely abandoned framing WikiLeaks as a national security threat, as US officials would have liked, for a facilitation of debate about the meaning of Australia’s real national interests following the revelation that Rudd had lobbied the USA to use force against China.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912448901">Ellery (2010b)</xref> wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>A professor of strategic studies said last night the most charitable assumption that could be made of Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd’s belief the US should be ready to contain China’s Pacific aspirations by force was that he hadn’t thought seriously about the issue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That professor, Hugh White, head of the Strategic and Defense Studies Center at the Australian National University, was quoted to say that Rudd ‘needs to explain what he means and what the consequences could be to the Australian people’ if Australia and the USA were to wage war on China.</p>
<p>The paper employed the WikiLeaks-released cables as a source to reveal internal political power plays in relation to US pressure. The paper reported, for example, that the released cables revealed that members of the Federal Labor Party deliberately ‘deceived’ its leftist faction with its use of language in a defense white paper that laid out principles regarding ‘missile defense cooperation with the United States’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The cable, obtained by the WikiLeaks website and released to Fairfax, quotes the then Defense Department deputy secretary and white paper coordinator, Mike Pezzullo, as telling US embassy officials how the language in the missile defense section had been ‘governed by [former defense minister Joel] Fitzgibbon’s desire to avoid party divisions at the ALP’s national conference’ in May last year. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912448901">Dorling and Baker, 2010</xref>, newspaper’s brackets)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Labor’s leftist factions opposed US plans to develop a missile shield in the region, but:
<disp-quote>
<p>US embassy officials in Canberra were told by Mr. Pezzullo that then prime minister Kevin Rudd’s thinking on missile defense was very different to that of Labor’s Left. The white paper’s language ‘leaves the door open for continued cooperation,’ the cable noted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912448901">Dorling and Baker, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The cables, the paper reported, revealed that Mark Arbib, the Federal Labor minister, ‘is one of the United States embassy’s valued confidential contacts, providing information and commentary on the workings of the Australian Government and the Labor Party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912448901">Dorling, 2010a</xref>). The same day the paper quoted from a cable that revealed that ‘right-of-center unions maintain a powerful sway over federal and state ministers by engaging in backroom diplomacy, funding political campaigns and grooming future MPs’. The <italic>Canberra Times</italic> reported, ‘The United States state department cables reveal that senior union leaders have privately briefed American officials on how they use their influence over the Labor Party to shape policies, including those on climate change,’ and ‘reveal the close watch American officials keep on the union movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912448901">Dorling and McKenzie, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps because of these revelations, WikiLeaks, at least briefly, was framed as facilitating government transparency and democracy. Australian Greens leader Bob Brown ‘welcomes the publication of US embassy reports that identified Labor Senator Mark Arbib as a “protected” source of information on the Australian Government and Labor Party politics’. The story almost exclusively relied on Brown to frame the utility of the revelations:
<disp-quote>
<p>The WikiLeaks releases which have informed the world about what goes on behind closed doors in international diplomacy is something we wouldn’t have heard about and won’t hear about in the future if we don’t have guarantees of freedom of information. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912448901">Dorling, 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the exception of a story that described WikiLeaks as a ‘powerful new actor in global politics’ and compared the WikiLeaks disclosures to ‘the violence of September 11, Pearl Harbor,’ and ‘the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand that unleashed the Great War’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912448901">Flitton, 2010</xref>), coverage had shifted from framing WikiLeaks as a national security threat, to employing the cables it leaked as legitimate journalistic sources, to even praising WikiLeaks. The paper referred to WikiLeaks as a ‘whistleblower’, although this only occurred twice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912448901">McLennan and Ellery, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912448901">Taylor, 2010</xref>). Toward the end of our sample period the cables were simply employed as a neutral source of information that would illuminate Australia’s Pacific concerns and internal power plays, facilitating debate about the national interest and politicians’ role as US informants, moving away from US concerns about WikiLeaks as a threat to its internal communications to concerns about ‘our’ behavior around the globe and whether it is rational and productive. Indeed, the use of the word ‘our’ appeared in an article toward the end of the sample period, indicating that the national epistemology continued to inform newswork:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despite repeated public assurances by the Government that gains are being made in Afghanistan and that long-term success is possible, secret United States embassy cables reveal that some of our top diplomats and officials hold grave concerns about the prospect of success in the nine-year war that has claimed the lives of 21 Australian soldiers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912448901">Dorling and McKenzie, 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact, Julian Assange was hardly discussed in the news reports, and when he was mentioned reporters relayed simple descriptions of the sexual allegations he faced in Sweden and whether he had once attended the Australian National University.</p>

<sec id="section5-1464884912448901" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We asked how nation-based newspapers in two countries framed WikiLeaks and incorporated WikiLeaks-released documents into their news reports to determine what narratives were constructed. Our purpose was to take a step toward understanding the impact that the emerging global media ecology – particularly the birth of the extra-national journalist – has had on the reporter’s ‘domestic glasses’. The answer seems to be: not much. The national epistemology continued to inform newswork as most of the reports were about Israel and Australia. However, WikiLeaks provided an additional source of information that allowed the papers to step away from what officials were saying about the national interest and about WikiLeaks itself, increasing the tendency toward the critical end of each paper’s national obligations. Thus, the national epistemology changed shape throughout coverage: from framing WikiLeaks to a national security threat to an organization whose job may have helped the nation save itself from itself.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that <italic>Haaretz</italic> and the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> employed the leaks to open up, at least briefly, legitimate debate about what <italic>should</italic> constitute the national interest. These acts of journalism – employing the leaks to reveal problematic US behavior and faulty Israeli and Australian foreign policy practices – are consistent with WikiLeaks goals: to expose problematic behaviors and initiate a wider debate. By reporting the contents of the leaks to initiate debate, each paper provided each country’s citizenry with access to formerly secret government communications and enabled them to listen to important debates about the national interest.</p>
<p>At particular points in coverage, when not much was known about what the leaks revealed, <italic>Haaretz</italic> and <italic>Canberra Times</italic> framed WikiLeaks as a threat to national – and global – security. The news for these two nations was ‘ours both’: a threat to all of them, and so a ‘global elite interest’ framework had mapped onto coverage. During these brief periods we might say that a global elite interest emerged to frame WikiLeaks as a threat as, in Israel and Australia at least, officials aligned with the Obama administration and US Congress to frame WikiLeaks as a threat. However, national figures will also pursue their own perceived national interests as they see fit independently of the USA, which then finds a source of transmission in their particular nation’s news media. The state continues to matter as both <italic>Haaretz</italic> and <italic>Canberra Times</italic> donned their ‘domestic glasses’. What was different about these domestic glasses, however, was that journalists were less reliant on Israeli and Australian official sources and increasingly reliant on WikiLeaks itself as a news source. That the nation continued to inform newswork, then, means that it was epistemologically self-imposed and not dictated by state sources. These papers were especially critical of the USA when the leaks revealed that the USA was operating in ways that might contradict their states’ national interest and meddle in their regional and internal affairs.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the leaks most centrally revealed US behavior, both <italic>Haaretz</italic> and the <italic>Canberra Times</italic> shifted away from the ‘ours both’ framing of WikiLeaks as a national and global security threat to employing the organization as a legitimate journalistic source and even praising it as a whistleblower – and these papers employed the leaks to construct news stories even when officials refused to comment. It’s not surprising that officials in each state would employ the WikiLeaks-released cables in a way that would advance their vision of the national interest. Nor is it surprising that the papers would ‘index’ the views of those officials advancing a particular rhetoric about the leaks or that each paper would craft critical coverage of the USA. But when considering the well-researched existence of the ‘national narrative’ in which ‘our’ interests result in a closed reading it is surprising that even though the news of and provided by WikiLeaks exposed state secrets, those secrets were incorporated by the press into a narrative that was positioned as a <italic>debate</italic> about what the national interest <italic>should be</italic>.</p>
<p>Framing WikiLeaks as a whistleblower necessarily positioned these newspapers as whistleblowers too – whistleblowers against the USA and against state officials who had harmed the perceived national interest. Indeed, in November 2011 the Walkley Foundation, an Australian journalistic organization that recognizes the best Australian journalism, awarded WikiLeaks for demonstrating ‘a courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism: justice through transparency’. The rationale for the award went on:
<disp-quote>
<p>While not without flaws, the Walkley Trustees believe that by designing and constructing a means to encourage whistleblowers, WikiLeaks and its editor-in-chief Julian Assange took a brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people all over the world.</p>
<p>And in the process, they have triggered a robust debate inside and outside the media about official secrecy, the public’s right to know, and the future of journalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884912448901">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The indexing norm cannot adequately explain coverage because the papers relied on WikiLeaks-released documents to construct narratives and did so independently of official rhetoric, continuing to rely on the documents even when officials did not comment and even against the framing that emanated from official rhetoric – and this opening up of the national debate was considered ‘ours’ by the papers. Both papers were willing to criticize the state and to employ the documents to do so, but did so out of national, not global, concerns.</p>
<p>The extra-national WikiLeaks, then, helped nation-based news organizations facilitate debate and transmit important information to citizens in Israel and Australia. Both the papers and WikiLeaks were whistleblowers, so we argue that the extra-national journalist may help the domestic journalist curb the worst qualities that emanate from his ‘domestic glasses’ while improving her best qualities. We believe that the extra-national journalist makes more possible the furtherance of democratic values in each nation’s news media. WikiLeaks became a legitimate source for, if not partner for, news organizations, and the content it released facilitated a critical look at the way governments work. Because both papers had access to the same sources – the cables themselves – and because each paper eventually put ‘our’ interests ahead of ‘ours both’, even criticizing the USA despite geopolitical alliances, the national epistemology can be said to continue to inform newswork despite the emergence of the extra-national journalist.</p>
