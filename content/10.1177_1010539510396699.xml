<abstract>
<p>This study compares health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its determinants among older people (≥60 years) in rural Bangladesh and Vietnam. Cross-sectional studies among older people were conducted in Bangladesh (n = 1031) and Vietnam (n = 870). Data on HRQoL were collected using an instrument that includes 24 items distributed into 6 dimensions. Older people in Vietnam reported more favorable HRQoL outcomes than those in Bangladesh, reporting better HRQoL on physical, psychological, social, and financial dimensions. Hierarchical linear regression analyses show that advanced age, being a woman, belonging to a poor household, and reporting poor health were significantly associated with lower HRQoL scores in both Bangladesh and Vietnam. In Bangladesh, being illiterate was additionally associated with lower HRQoL scores. The results of this explorative study underline the importance of a cross-cultural understanding of HRQoL of older people and the influence of the socioecological context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The concept of quality of life (QoL) is increasingly being recognized and used as an outcome measure in health research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510396699">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510396699">2</xref></sup> To make a distinction between QoL in its more general sense and the requirements in health research, the term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is commonly used. HRQoL is described to include those aspects of overall QoL that are related to health, such as physical and mental health perceptions, including functional status, social support, and socioeconomic status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510396699">3</xref></sup> hereafter referred to as HRQoL. In spite of the vast amount of interest in QoL, different instruments make use of different definitions, and often, no specific model for QoL is formally stated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510396699">4</xref></sup> The World Health Organization Quality of Life Group defines quality of life as “an individual’s perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations values and concerns.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510396699">3</xref>(p50)</sup> Similarly, researchers describe QoL as a subjective and multidimensional concept,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510396699">1</xref></sup> including physical, mental, and social functioning and well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510396699">5</xref></sup> Traditional models, however, rarely assess the various domains of QoL simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510396699">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510396699">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers have indicated the need for comparative research on quality of life based on empirical data to guide policy development and in targeting programs to assist older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510396699">8</xref></sup> Because of the subjectivity of HRQoL, it is suggested that contextual milieu, such as cultural differences, need to be taken into account to understand or assess HRQoL cross-culturally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510396699">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510396699">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510396699">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510396699">9</xref></sup> QoL has different meanings in different societies; thus, differences in cultural values are likely to influence the importance of the specific domains of QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510396699">10</xref></sup> A qualitative study in rural Bangladesh shows that having a role in the family and in the community and being functional both physically and economically are important factors that influence older people’s quality of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510396699">11</xref></sup> whereas Western ideals relate high QoL to successful self-improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510396699">10</xref></sup> Another study also reports substantial variations in the cultural meaning of happiness, where happiness is defined in terms of personal achievement in the North American culture in contrast to East Asia, where it was defined in terms of interpersonal connectedness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510396699">12</xref></sup> In addition to cultural differences, socioecological dimensions can explain variations in HRQoL in different societies. Examples of such socioecological dimensions include demographic and socioeconomic status, health care provision, and lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510396699">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, cross-cultural comparison regarding HRQoL of older people in low-income countries is scant.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, the number of older people (≥60 years) in 2003 was about 7.5 million—5.1% of the total population (146.7 million)—and in Vietnam, it was approximately 6 million—7.4% of the total population (81.3 million).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref></sup> Life expectancy at birth is 63 years for both women and men in Bangladesh. On the other hand, in Vietnam life expectancy is 74 years for women and 68 years for men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510396699">14</xref></sup> Because of a lack of formal pension schemes in low-income countries, older people themselves are likely to remain economically active till health permits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510396699">15</xref></sup> Thus, 50% of older people (≥65 years) in Bangladesh compared with about 20% of older people in Vietnam are economically active.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510396699">16</xref></sup> Almost one fifth (18%) of the total population in Vietnam and more than one third (36%) of the total population in Bangladesh live in extreme poverty (income &lt;$1 per day). Adult (≥15 years old) illiteracy rate in Vietnam is 6.1% among men and 13.1% among women. It is higher in Bangladesh for both men (49.7%) and women (68.6%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref></sup> Diversity between Bangladesh and Vietnam is also evident in terms of lifestyle, such as religion, diet, and physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510396699">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510396699">18</xref></sup> Even the health system in Bangladesh is not extensive compared with that in Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510396699">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the similarity in geographic location between Bangladesh and Vietnam in the southern part of Asia, differences in social, economic, demographic, and health care contexts are expected to have a differential impact on the HRQoL of older people in the rural parts of these 2 countries. Research reporting on HRQoL among older people living in rural areas in Bangladesh and Vietnam is sparse. The objective of this study is to compare the HRQoL status of older people (≥60 years) in rural areas of Bangladesh and Vietnam and to identify the determinants of HRQoL in these 2 countries.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Data for this study were derived from an intervention study titled “Primary Health-Care in Later Life: Improving Services in Bangladesh and Vietnam.” The aim of the PHILL project was to identify the effectiveness of low-cost, preventive and health promotion interventions in improving primary health care for older people (≥60 years) in the rural communities of Bangladesh and Vietnam. This study has been approved by ethical committees in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Sweden.</p>
<sec id="section3-1010539510396699">
<title>Sampling and Data Collection</title>
<p>Data for these cross-sectional studies were collected in Bangladesh and Vietnam during April to June 2003 prior to the commencement of intervention activities. The samples include 1901 older people of whom 1031 were from Bangladesh and 870 from Vietnam.</p>
<p>The study area in Bangladesh was located in Chandpur district, a rural area 70 km south of the capital Dhaka. Two subdistricts were purposively selected where each had a government primary health care center and a health center run by a nongovernmental organization. From each subdistrict, 4 villages within a 3-km radius of the health centers were randomly selected. Census information was used to identify households with older people. This census yielded 966 households and 1135 older people. The initial sampling of the older people were later confirmed by using an events calendar, including major historical events such as partition from India in 1947, the (Bangla) language movement in 1952, the martial law in 1968, the liberation war in 1971, and reproductive events, such as menarche, marriage, and childbirth.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, the study area was located in Chilinh-Haiduong province, a rural area 90 km east of the capital Hanoi. Four communes were purposively selected based on the following criteria: geography (mountainous and low-land communes), local authorities’ capacity and willingness to participate and similar characteristics between intervention and control area in terms of socioeconomic status, age distribution, and availability of private and public practitioners. From each commune, 2 villages, within a 2-km radius of the commune health station were randomly selected. Census information yielded more than 600 households with older people, resulting in a total of 887 older people. In Vietnam, age of the older people could be confirmed by examining their identification cards.</p>
<p>Informed consent before interviews was obtained from the older people themselves or from their family members in both Bangladesh and Vietnam. Nonresponse rates were 2% in Vietnam and 9% in Bangladesh. Nonresponse was a result of unavailability, sickness, or refusal to participate.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<sec id="section5-1010539510396699">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Independent variables include age, sex, marital status, household economic status, education, present occupation, and self-rated health. Age was expressed in years. Marital status was classified as married or single. Educational status was categorized as either illiterate or literate. In both Bangladesh and Vietnam, participants who could read and write their native language were considered as literate and illiterate otherwise. Occupation was classified as paid and unpaid work. Participants who were involved in income earning activities were categorized as having paid work and all the rest as having unpaid work. Finally, self-rated health was categorized as being very good, good, so-so, very poor, and poor. The first 3 categories were regarded as indicating a good health status and the other 2, poor. Data on household economic status was collected in different ways in the 2 countries. In Bangladesh, households in the villages were categorized as poor if they possessed less than 0.5 acres of land and relied on manual labor for more than 100 days per year. All others were classified as nonpoor. In Vietnam, the village leaders who keep records about the economic status of the households of the village gave information on household socioeconomic status based on household income. These were then categorized as poor and nonpoor.</p>

<sec id="section6-1010539510396699">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The main dependent variable in this study is HRQoL scores. HRQoL was assessed using an instrument developed specially for older people in Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510396699">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510396699">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510396699">20</xref></sup> This instrument aims to measure HRQoL among older people and contains 24 questions, divided into 6 dimensions (ie, physical, psychological, social, spiritual, financial, and environmental).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510396699">20</xref></sup> Cronbach’s α for the instrument was found to be 0.84, which indicates high reliability of the instrument. The majority of items were computed based on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 to 4 (2 items were dichotomous) indicating negative to positive response status. Results in this study are presented by the 6 dimensions and the total score of HRQoL. The ranges of the scores of the 6 dimensions and total HRQoL scores are as follows: 5 to 20 in physical and psychological, 6 to 20 in social, 2 to 8 in spiritual and financial, 4 to 16 in environmental, and 24 to 92 in total HRQoL scores.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1010539510396699">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive analyses and the χ<sup>2</sup> test were done to compare the samples of the 2 countries by demographic and socioeconomic variables. An independent <italic>t</italic> test was performed to compare means and test for significant differences between countries by each dimension and total HRQoL score. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was calculated, using a pooled standard deviation, to determine effect size. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used separately for each country to identify determinants of HRQoL and to examine variations in HRQoL status accounted for by the determinants.</p>

<title>Distribution of Socioeconomic and Health Indicators</title>
<p>The socioeconomic profile of the sample reveals that about one third of the older people in both Bangladesh and Vietnam are involved in paid work. Illiteracy is nearly 3 times higher in Bangladesh (63%) compared with Vietnam (22%). Differences are also found between the countries in terms of household economic status. Among the older people in Bangladesh, 33% report belonging to poor households compared with only 13% in Vietnam. Almost 80% of the older people in both Bangladesh and Vietnam rate their health to be poor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510396699">Table 1</xref>).</p>

In these analyses, demographic information was entered in the first step, socioeconomic information in the second step, and health indicator in the final step. These analyses indicated that demographic indicators accounted for approximately 6% of the variation in HRQoL scores in Bangladesh, compared with 7% in Vietnam. It also indicated that older age and being a woman were significantly associated with lower HRQoL scores in both the countries. In addition, the block of socioeconomic indicators accounted for an additional 9% of the variation in HRQoL in Bangladesh, compared with only 0.6% in Vietnam. Among these variables, belonging to a poor household was significantly associated with lower HRQoL scores in both Bangladesh and Vietnam. Furthermore, in Bangladesh, being illiterate was an additional determinant of lower HRQoL scores. Poor health was significantly associated with lower HRQoL scores in both the countries. In Bangladesh, the self-reported health indicator accounted for almost 7% of the variation in HRQoL, compared with nearly 14% in Vietnam. Marital status and occupation of the older people were not found to be associated with HRQoL in either Bangladesh or Vietnam. Altogether, the determinants accounted for nearly 21% variation in HRQoL in both the countries. Finally, the combined model indicates that age, sex, education, economic status, and self-rated health status were significantly associated with HRQoL scores in old age (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study examined data from 2 rural areas of Bangladesh and Vietnam to compare the HRQoL of older people by its 6 dimensions and the determinants of HRQoL.</p>
<sec id="section15-1010539510396699">
<title>HRQoL of Older People in Bangladesh and Vietnam</title>
<p>Significant differences were observed between Bangladeshi and Vietnamese older people in all dimensions of HRQoL. Older people in Vietnam reported better HRQoL than their peers in Bangladesh, reporting higher on all dimensions except the spiritual and environmental dimensions. Results of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> further revealed that variation in the mean existed only in 2 dimensions between the 2 countries: higher scores on the spiritual dimension in Bangladesh and psychological dimension in Vietnam. However, to understand the observed differences, it is important to consider the general context of the 2 countries. It is stated that the HRQoL of individuals is influenced by the standard of the community they live in, in terms of poverty, health care indices (such as life expectancy), availability and access to health care, educational level of the population, communication facilities, hygiene, and energy availability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510396699">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510396699">21</xref></sup> Through comparison of data between Bangladesh and Vietnam, the current study confirms that such indicators play a significant role in influencing HRQoL of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510396699">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, it is possible that the higher HRQoL status of older people in Vietnam could be explained by the fact that in Vietnam fewer people (17.7%) live in extreme poverty compared with Bangladesh (36%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref></sup> About 30% of the total population in Bangladesh is undernourished compared with 19% in Vietnam. Furthermore, the percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) spent on health care is higher in Vietnam (6%) compared with Bangladesh (2.8%). The number of physicians is more than double (54 per 100 000 individuals) in Vietnam compared with Bangladesh (23/100 000).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref></sup> Better economic and health systems in Vietnam may explain the higher reported HRQoL in Vietnam compared with Bangladesh, particularly in terms of physical and financial dimensions.</p>
<p>Bangladesh and Vietnam are diverse in terms of religious practices. Islam is the dominant religion in Bangladesh, whereas in Vietnam, the majority of the people follow Buddhism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510396699">17</xref></sup> The presence of religion in Bangladesh is reflected in everyday activities, such as separation of the public and private spheres for men and women and in ceremonies related to birth, marriage, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510396699">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510396699">23</xref></sup> Religion has also been described as a mechanism used to cope with adversities and could therefore be of more importance for older people in Bangladesh who are in a more unfavorable situation in terms of sociodemographic, economic, and health indicators compared with those in Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510396699">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1010539510396699">
<title>Determinants of HRQoL in Old Age: Similarity Between Bangladesh and Vietnam</title>
<p>Consistent with other research, the current study found age, sex, household economic status, and health as key factors influencing older people’s HRQoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510396699">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510396699">8</xref></sup> Advanced age is found to be associated with physical decline and reduced mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510396699">25</xref></sup> A study with WHOQOL-Bref data from 23 culturally diverse centers described that women older than 65 years reported significantly poorer HRQoL than men older than 65 years on all facets, with the exception of physical environment, sexual activity, social support, and home environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510396699">26</xref></sup> A study in Bangladesh showed that being functional, both physically and economically, were important for older people’s HRQoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510396699">11</xref></sup> The reasons for the lower HRQoL scores among women might include lifelong nutritional deficiency and social and cultural norms preventing them from accessing health care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1010539510396699">
<title>Impact of Socioeconomic Status on HRQoL</title>
<p>Research points out that older people in rural Asia will need increased access to service as well as financial resources in order to maintain a minimum quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510396699">27</xref></sup> However, as in many low-income countries, formal social care service is not common in Bangladesh, but it is so in Vietnam. However, in both the countries, it is the family who are ultimately expected to look after their older parents and kin. Still, poor health, as reported by the majority of the older people in our study, and physical decline as a result of advanced age creates a need for professional health care services, which cannot be provided by family members. Furthermore, access to community service is connected to the financial situation of the older people and/or their households. This means that older people without a secure source of income are more likely to be in need of service and support and therefore more dependent on assistance from their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510396699">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510396699">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>A direct relation between education and health outcomes has been reported in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510396699">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510396699">31</xref></sup> A recent study in Bangladesh found that socioeconomic status, and education in particular, has a strong influence on adult mortality in rural areas. Both men and women with education had lower mortality compared with those without education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510396699">32</xref></sup> The current study shows that illiteracy is 3 times higher among older people in Bangladesh, compared with Vietnam. The even distribution of literacy does not feature as a determinant of HRQoL in Vietnam, whereas the high prevalence of illiteracy in the sample in Bangladesh clearly indicates its impact on low HRQoL. A potential limitation of the study is inclusion of self-rated health as a predictor of HRQoL, which may have an influence on the results. However, because self-rated health is associated with activities of daily living, instrumental daily living, and chronic illnesses, it may reflect the impact of these indicators.</p>
<p>In conclusion, results from this explorative study underline the importance of a cross-cultural understanding of older people’s HRQoL and the influence of the socioecological context. Older people in the 2 rural areas of Bangladesh and Vietnam differed in the way they reported their HRQoL. Although both the countries exhibit certain characteristics common to southern Asia, the socioecological contexts of the 2 countries vary significantly. Conclusions regarding HRQoL cannot be generalized from one country to another. However, determinants of poor HRQoL, such as increased age, female sex, poor household economic status, and poor health, were found to be common among older people in the rural areas of these 2 Asian countries.</p>
