<p>63.4536 ALLANSSON, Marie, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>The first year of the Arab Spring</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 45–56.</p>
<p>While the 2011 uprisings in the Arab world shared a number of traits, the extent of demands made by the protesters varied as did the level of violence. While there were comparatively few fatalities in Algeria and Morocco, other countries were much more severely affected. The highest levels of violence were reported in Libya and Syria. An outline of the domestic developments in each of the six countries — Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen — that experienced at least 25 fatalities related to the Arab Spring in 2011 allows for the examination of international involvement in the different cases, including external support given to aid one of the parties, and third-party involvement and neutral interventions carried out to attempt to solve the crises.</p>

<p>In recent years, European politics has witnessed two simultaneous developments, indicative of two contradictory trends. The first is an emphasis on the idea of a cosmopolitan Europe, as facilitated by further European integration. This accelerated integration is said to be creating a cosmopolitan Europe in which citizenship is decoupled from its national bearings and supra-national European institutions facilitate the emergence of new identities and belongings that are not necessarily national in origin. The second trend points towards an increasing visibility of right-wing parties and movements expressing hostility towards cultural multiplicity and an official denunciation of multiculturalism, accompanied by a closure of borders and denial of rights to non-European nationals. These seemingly contradictory trends are not necessarily contradictory, but instead complementary, in erecting real and imaginary borders around Europe. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4538 BAUMANN, Jonas, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Organized violence in the Horn of Africa</bold>. <italic>SIPRI Yearbook</italic> 2012: 57–64.</p>
<p>In order to provide a coherent overview of the violence that affects the Horn of Africa, the situation needs to be analyzed through the lens of Uppsala Conflict Data Program's three categories of organized violence: armed conflict between and within states, one-sided violence against civilians, and violence between non-state actors. States in the region have demonstrated a growing tendency to become military engaged in neighboring countries. An examination of the armed conflict in Somalia, particularly its international aspects, allows for a discussion of one of the worst cases of one-sided violence in the area, taking place in Ethiopia's Somali Region. Two examples in the Ethiopia-Kenya border area speak of the prevalence of non-state conflicts in the region.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Qaddafi regime, a new situation has arisen for Libya on the African scene. The new regime appears not very stable, but still more open, less aggressive and erratic, less missionary and challenging than the previous one. The victory of the rebels can now give the image of a peaceful country, that of an effective protagonist, an actor of African stability. The geographical proximity of Libya and the African countries has given them a special place in its national security and foreign policy priorities. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Focusing on conflict legacy, this article contributes to the study of domestic mediating conditions as an explanation of “shallow Europeanization” in the Western Balkans, defined as a disconnect between European rules and local practices. It critiques the prevalent neo-Weberian understanding of state capacity, which highlights rule-enforcement capability of state institutions, but reduces conflict legacy to a question of resources. The article argues that a relational approach to state capacity which attributes its strength to enduring ties among state and non-state actors better captures the challenge to EU-driven domestic transformation in a post-conflict context. A case study of the Hercegovina Holding is used to unravel a Bosnian Croat network originating during the 1992–1995 Bosnian war. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4541 BRESSER-PEREIRA, Luis Carlos — <bold>Os três ciclos da sociedade e do estado (The three cycles of [Brazilian] state and society)</bold>. <italic>Perspectivas</italic> 41, Jan.-June 2012: 13–52.</p>
<p>The history of independent Brazil may be divided in to three political cycles, and, since 1930, one can distinguish five political pacts or class coalitions. Since 1930 these pacts have been nationalist. Only in the 1990s did the Brazilian elites surrend to neoliberal hegemony. Yet, since the mid-2000s, they are recovering their idea of the nation. The main claim is here that the Brazilian elites and the Brazilian society are “national-dependent,” i.e. ambiguous and contradictory, requiring an oxymoron to define them. The elite is dependent because it often sees itself as “European” and the Brazilian people as inferior. but Brazil's domestic market is big enough and the Brazilian state capable enough to persuade the elites to be national. It now searches for a synthesis between the two last political cycles: between the nation and economic development and the democracy and social justice cycles. [R]</p>
<p>63.4542 BRIGSTOCKE, Julian — <bold>Immanent authority and the performance of community in late nineteenth century Montmartre [France]</bold>. <italic>Journal of Political Power</italic> 6(1), 2013: 107–126.</p>
<p>This article develops an account of the aesthetic structure of “immanent,” non-foundational forms of authority. It argues for the need to develop a positive account of decentralized authority as an important constitutive form of social bond. Through a genealogical reading of the cultural experiments of the artistic community of late 19th c. Montmartre, it builds an analysis of the affective and perceptual structures of immanent authority. Authority, it argues, operates across three axes of experience: amplitude, gravity and distance. Although the artistic experiments and cultural politics of <italic>fin-de-siècle</italic> Montmartre were politically naive, they offer an illuminating lens through which to view the emerging experiential structures of authority in the 20th c.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union and the failure of its modernization project have eroded the trust of the Russian nation, giving rise to a serious cultural crisis. Eager to join the great western powers, the anticommunist nationalism of Boris Yeltsin did not respond appropriately to the expectations of the Russian people regarding the definition of a new role for their nation in world history. The reversal in the early years of the new century marks the transformation of nationalism into a political resource and its appropriation by Vladimir Putin as leader of the nation. As the key element of the new modernization project, state nationalism must serve to stabilize the country. This implies revitalizing the social contract and updating the sovereign power of the state, to the detriment of the political system. [R]</p>
<p>63.4544 CAMPBELL, Neil; SAHA, Shrabani — <bold>Corruption, democracy and Asia-Pacific countries</bold>. <italic>Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy</italic> 18(2), Apr. 2013: 290–303.</p>
<p>This paper argues that the relationship between democracy and corruption is non-monotonic. When a country shifts from autocratic rule to highly imperfect democracy (an ‘electoral democracy’) it is frequently perceived that the level of corruption increases. Conversely, when the democracy level is already relatively high (approaching ‘mature democracy’) an increase in the level of democracy is typically expected to decrease the level of corruption. To assist with our discussion of these issues, before going on to the empirical part of the paper, we look specifically at the case of South Korea to illustrate how corruption responded to an increasing level of democracy. Using panel data, we find strong empirical support for the non-monotonic relationship. For Asia-Pacific countries, we find that the democracy-corruption relationship becomes negative, at a surprisingly high level of democracy. Moreover we also find that the South Asian region is the most corrupt. [R]</p>
<p>63.4545 ÇELIK, Ayşe Betül — <bold>State, non-governmental and international organizations in the possible peace process in</bold> <bold>Turkey's conflict-induced displacement</bold>. <italic>Journal of Refugee Studies</italic> 26(1), March 2013: 1–25.</p>
<p>Turkey has experienced several different internal migration periods since its foundation in 1923. However, the internal displacement of the 1990s brought to the forefront the divergent discussions on whether this wave of internal displacement can be approached from a traditional developmentalist approach or whether critical issues pertaining to the Kurdish Question also need to be addressed, requiring a broader understanding of what peace means to IDPs and different actors. This article studies these two approaches taken by the Turkish state, local NGOs and international organizations. It discusses Turkey's internal displacement issue and Kurdish Question and analyzes these actors’ different perspectives on the policies related to the areas affected by the conflict, and to addressing internal displacement. Internal displacement is an important issue to be addressed in peace processes. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>This paper addresses the question of the resilience of authoritarian rule and especially the strategies of survival set up by authoritarian regimes to avoid “regime change”. Using Saddam Hussein's Iraq as a case study, the paper analyzes the composition and management of the Iraqi ruling elite, through an in-depth chronological and statistical study of the Iraqi ruling institutions. This is on order to explain to what extent the patterns of elite's circulation/management and its composition mattered for the Iraqi regime's survival. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4598]</p>

<p>Ongoing diplomatic and peacekeeping initiatives by the international community in Darfur over the past decade have failed to stem the violence and resolve social conflict. Based primarily on political analysis, such initiatives do not address the underlying causes of the civil war at the individual, family, and tribal levels. This paper examines the psychological and sociological motivations for the violence within and between the Arab and African tribes of Darfur to include motivation exploration of ethnic defections, failing cultural identity markers, and the effects of cognitive dissonance of the personal and social identities of the Darfur tribes.

<p>One of the principal chants that was raised during the Egyptian uprising of 2011 was <italic>aish, huriyya, karama insaniyya</italic>, or “bread, freedom, human dignity”. This slogan encapsulated the three primary collective action frames that activists employed during the uprising. I argue that these frames were drawn from, and engaged with, three broad themes in Egypt's political discourse that had been developed over the previous decade: poor economic conditions, lack of democracy, and police abuse.

<p>63.4550 DAVIES, Rebecca — <bold>Afrikaner capital elites, neo-liberalism and economic transformation in post-Apartheid South Africa</bold>. <italic>African Studies</italic> 71(3), Dec. 2013: 391–407.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the transition, and with the uneven progression of the liberal democratic project in contemporary South Africa, the profile of Afrikaner capital elites in the key mining and financial sectors has remained prominent. Yet the contribution of these actors, whether as a distinct fraction of capital or as individuals, to the post-apartheid economy is not fully understood. Even while they have reformed their local presence and reconstructed their economic power, these strategies are strongly related to the nature of the global and African National Congress (ANC)-led projects of neo-liberalism, and are not necessarily indicative of a persistent or renewed Afrikaner capital bloc. This article examines these shifting patterns of state-capital relations against the context of both the institutional and material legacy of apartheid, and contemporary global restructuring.

<p>This article questions the idea of a Chinese model. It argues that the “Chinese model” is a variant of neo-authoritarian development associated with the developmental experience of other Eastern Asian states. What distinguishes China is the revolutionary experience — ignored by both Chinese and non-Chinese promoters of the Chinese model idea — that has left its mark on post-revolutionary development. Admiration for the authoritarian China model idea is voiced most audibly by those who place efficient development ahead of all other considerations, including democracy and social justice.

<p>This article argues that the Labour government misled the people of Northern Ireland about the implications of the Good Friday Agreement to secure a “Yes” vote in the referendum on the deal. During the referendum campaign, Prime Minister T. Blair was prominent among those arguing that there would be [weapons] decommissioning before either paramilitary prisoners were released or Sinn Féin sat in government. Legislation to release paramilitary prisoners without prior decommissioning was introduced into Parliament just two weeks after the referendum. In December 1999, Sinn Féin entered government without IRA decommissioning. Blair later acknowledged that the “political skills” that were initially useful in pushing the peace process forward became counterproductive and undermined the moderate power-sharing settlement that the GFA was intended to deliver. Power-sharing between the hardline parties in 2007 was the fortuitous, if less desirable, outcome. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.4553 DREZNER, Daniel W.; McNAMARA, Kathleen R. — <bold>International Political Economy, global financial orders and the 2008 financial crisis</bold>. <italic>Perspectives on Politics</italic> 11(1), March 2013: 155–166.</p>
<p>The 2008 financial crisis triggered the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression. The crisis has provoked soul-searching among economists, yet IPE scholars have been relatively sanguine. We argue that IPE has strayed too far away from studying the geopolitical and systemic causes and consequences of the global economy. IPE must explain the generation and transformation of global financial orders. Both the distribution of political power and the content of economic ideas will shape any emergent global financial order. A Kuhnian life-cycle framework of global financial orders permits a systemic approach to global finance that integrates the study of power and social logics into our understanding of markets.

<p>63.4554 ENGSTROM, Erik J.; HAMMOND, Jesse R.; SCOTT, John T. — <bold>Capitol mobility: Madisonian representation and the location and relocation of capitals in the United States</bold>. <italic>American Political Science Review</italic> 107(2), May 2013: 225–240.</p>
<p>We examine the location and relocation of political capitals in the US, including the choice of Washington, DC, as the nation's capital and the location and relocation of capitals in the 48 contiguous American states. We argue that the location of capitals in the US followed a systematic pattern in accord with the theory of representative government developed in the new nation, especially as articulated by J. Madison. Based on an empirical analysis of historical census and political boundaries data from 1790 to the present, we find that decision-makers consistently tended to locate — and especially relocate — the seat of government as near as possible to the population centroid of the relevant political jurisdiction, consistent with the principle of equal representation of citizens.

The cases of Egypt and Morocco)</bold>. <italic>Revue internationale de Politique comparée</italic> 19(4), 2012: 93–110. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The golden legend of the French Revolution have accustomed us to consider that the people overthrew regimes and that the explanation of the change lay first in the emergent social movement. The “Arab Spring” has not helped to temper that view, quite the contrary. The author endeavors to show that upstream of the political crises, there had been a weakening of authoritarianism. The study focuses on a comparison between Morocco and Egypt. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4598]</p>

<p>Commentators claim that the UAE is dealing with a genuine security threat, acting within its sovereign laws, and treating “pro-democracy” dissent in the same way it treats “pan-theocratic” dissent. This has now been exacerbated by senior figures within the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood seeking to influence the course of events and even cause a diplomatic spat between Egypt and the UAE. Nevertheless, it is the criticism in the Western press that has seemingly surprised many observers the most. An analysis of the ways in which the Arab Spring has affected the stability and reputation of the Middle East's de facto financial, logistics, and transportation hub demonstrates that no street demonstrations have thus far occurred and that the Arab Spring has taken no casualties in the UAE.

<p>63.4557 FOUSKAS, Vassilis K. — <bold>Whatever happened to Greece?</bold> <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 84(1), Jan.-March 2013: 132–138.</p>
<p>This article examines the origins of the Greek debt crisis and argues that the key sources of the debt are the economic and political factions that have dominated Greek politics since the fall of the Colonels in summer 1974 amidst the Cyprus calamity. These factions (political parties, economic interests etc.), whose policy actions and preferences are amalgamated with the interests of Euro-Atlantic elites, are now being severely undermined, both politically and economically, as the prosperity of the Greek middle classes is eroded following two years of harsh austerity measures imposed on the Greek ruling factions by those Euro-Atlantic elites. Furthermore, this article outlines ways out of the Greek debt crisis, putting into test some reasonable policy proposals that are being widely discussed in Greece and abroad. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study analyzes: (1) how the definition of terrorism varies according to political contexts and goals, arguing that such definitions depend on political context; (2) how terrorism can be analyzed using mainstream International Relations theory, debating the limits and possibilities of its schools of thought, and (3) how South American countries have adopted a global counterterrorism strategy which is clearly alien to their own political agendas. The theoretical proposal of this article is to analyze terrorism as a political phenomenon using the apparatus of the Copenhagen School. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>In power since independence in 1991, the Uzbek regime has heavily invested in the repertoire of its past and tradition so as to re-interpret it. The context — that of creating a new state — can explain this practice but the temporal distance with this founding event makes painfully obvious the discrepancy between a national imagination almost exclusively based on a re-invented memory and the reality of daily life. The regime finds however it difficult to articulate its public action and discourse with a modernity that would open tangible prospects of the promised future. The urban redevelopment program aims to articulate a modernity to the past but this relationship remains problematic in that the regime depends on a social status quo in which inequalities are widening. The past is thus summoned once again to justify the program, while any idea of social progress is shrugged off. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4598]</p>

<p>The consequences of ethnic diversity in Africa have been widely noted. However, the sources of this diversity remain unexplained, which is surprising in light of Africa's high level of ethnic diversity as well as its large internal variation. I show that ethnic diversity in Africa is a result of its tropical location, the pre-colonial slave trade, the colonial creation of large states, and low levels of urbanization, and that my results are robust to various controls. I also show that controlling for the slave trade eliminates the statistical significance of an Africa dummy variable in regressions using data on global ethnic diversity. [R]</p>
<p>63.4561 HAQQANI, Husain — <bold>Islamists and democracy: cautions from Pakistan</bold>. <italic>Journal of Democracy</italic> 24(2), Apr. 2013: 5–14.</p>
<p>Success in free elections held after the “Arab Spring” protests in Tunisia and Egypt has brought Islamists to power through democratic means, and Islamist influence is on the rise throughout the Arab world. Much of the debate about liberal democracy's future in Arab countries focuses on the extent to which the Islamists might be moderated by their inclusion in the democratic process. But until the major Islamist movements give up their core ideology, their pursuit of an Islamic state is likely to impede their ability to be full and permanent participants in democratization. The real test of the Islamists’ commitment to democracy will come, not while they are in power for the first time, but when they lose subsequent elections. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Religion is now politically active in ways that until recently were unthinkable. Both in Europe and elsewhere in the world, religion [is] becoming an important contributor to various political issues, conflicts and competitions. To understand what has happened in this regard necessarily involves a remodeling and re-assumption of our understanding of the public roles of religious actors. Until the 1960s or 1970s, theories of secularization had long condemned religious actors in both Western and non-Western countries to social and political marginalization. Secularization theory maintained that as countries modernized, religion would lose its public centrality. But, as this did not happen, there is now a need to rethink the public role of religion. This article focuses on Europe, using democratization, democracy and civil liberties as key examples. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4109]</p>

Political stability and the regime crises in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt)</bold>. <italic>Rivista italiana di Scienza politica</italic> 43(1), Apr. 2013: 3–28.</p>
<p>The breakdown of non-democratic regimes unveils a paradox: they stabilize quickly once some internal control over the oppositions is established, and access to political power is denied, but they eventually face disruptive crises. Why? Non-democratic regimes are identified through a conceptual sketch of democracy, and three approaches of the study of political stability are identified; the political cultural; the socio-centered; the institutional. The political culture and the socio-centered approaches point out the “social factors,” while the “institutional” approach focuses on “regime factors” which may stabilize a non-democracy. A hypothetical model is developed and applied to authoritarian breakdown in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. I argue that although “social factors” have a role in political crises, “regime factors” are the key variables explaining the durability of non-democratic regimes and their capacity to delay the breakdown.

<p>63.4564 KAINA, Viktoria — <bold>How to reduce disorder in European identity research</bold>. <italic>European Political Science</italic> 12(2), June 2013: 184–196.</p>
<p>The article offers some ideas about how we can avoid analytical confusion in future inquiry on European collective identity. I discuss two important theoretical deficiencies that impede advancement in the research on this topic: (1) the two-level problem in analyzing collective identities; and (2) the issue of equating “belonging to” with “belonging together”. I also make some proposals on how we can deal with these problems. Finally, I present a few considerations on further research questions and point to several empirical desiderata. [R]</p>

<p>The terms “crisis” and “anomaly” are usually used by international and Italian political dcience, dociology and history to qualify the state of democracy in Italian Republic for the past as for the present. I study these notions of “crisis” and “anomaly,” then study the political science and historical literature about the deep change of political system and political parties since the 1990s. Finally, the article gives a general analytical frame-work for the present Italian politics. Instead of considering Italy as an anomaly, the idea is to think of the political mutations of this country as a kind of “laboratory” of a general change of European democracies.

<p>This article argues that unlike advanced industrialized democracies, where institutions evolve gradually and wholesale change is rare, many new democracies in Latin America are characterized by serial displacement, in which constitutions, electoral rules, and other institutions change both radically and frequently. Serial displacement is a product of extreme uncertainty and frequent incongruence between formal rule-makers and real power-holders, which, in turn, are a product of regime instability, electoral volatility, frequent institutional borrowing, social inequality, and rapid institutional design. It also argues that limited enforcement is often a source of institutional stability, and that varying levels of enforcement can be a substantively important source of institutional change.

<p>63.4567 LEVRAU, François; LOOBUYCK, Patrick — <bold>Is multiculturalism bad for [European] social cohesion and redistribution?</bold> <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 84(1), Jan.-March 2013: 101–109.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism as an official policy strategy has recently come in for significant criticism in a number of Western European countries. A key criticism is that multicultural policies undermine redistribution policies, since they would erode the social cohesion upon which redistribution measures are built. However, empirical research does not univocally confirm this critique. This article explains why this is the case. The first argument is called the integration-recognition paradox. Policies that focus on recognizing minority groups may lead to a greater social acceptance of those minorities, and in turn may lead to their feeling more appreciated as participants in society. In a second argument, the authors discuss how multicultural policies could easily be combined with policies that invest in national unity and social cohesion.

<p>We examine how war and rivalry affect state building in the Middle East. We argue that wars and rivalries promote state capacity, defined as the ability of a government to penetrate society for the purposes of resource extraction. Using cross-national time-series data for eighteen Middle Eastern countries from 1960 to 2003, we find that the structural pressure caused by the presence of international and domestic rivals augments extractive capacity. Conversely, both international and civil wars jeopardize state-building in the Middle East. Furthermore, the negative effects of war upon state capacity are far greater than the constructive effects of rivalry. [R]</p>

<p>Since attaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has suffered intense cases of sectarian skirmishes resulting in massive casualties. At least 18,000 lives have been lost in hundreds of violent incidents sparked by various ethnic, religious, and political groups since the 1980s. In more recent times, the situation has been exacerbated by Boko Haram — an emerging terrorist sect — which has mounted waves of deadly bomb attacks strategically directed at a cross section of public spaces. Given this predicament, scores of articles, commentaries, and newspaper reports on the issue have erroneously misinterpreted the uprising as merely another form of religious violence, or at least as a vendetta against Christians in Nigeria. But Boko Haram terrorism is primarily a political reaction to bad governance, organized under the cloak of religion. [R]</p>

<p>This paper claims that the recent Greek economic crisis is not the sole or indeed the major cause of the current predicament, but an outcome of a more long-term “cultural,” social and political crisis. Although current debates tend to overemphasize economic considerations and international factors, the view of the author is that, although important, these factors, when discussed in isolation, tend to conceal rather than disclose the “meaning” of a way of life that is in crisis. Therefore, instead of discussing nomological causes, this paper points towards the content of beliefs and various articulations of beliefs that have shaped everyday conduct, and highlights social and political practices that have constituted social life.

<p>In Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and to a lesser extent Argentina, the commodity boom made possible the emergence of “rentier populism,” a new type of political coalition, based on the economic incorporation of the informal sector and funded by windfall gains from exports of natural resources. Based on a new fiscal structure, rentier populism in turn fostered the intensification of plebiscitarian mechanisms of vertical accountability and neutralized constraints of horizontal accountability. The chapter explores the conditions under which a common exogenous shock, the commodity boom, spread across the region with differential coalitional effects. It also delineates the mechanisms that link the rentier populism coalition to the emergence of plebiscitarian and hegemonic forms of accountability. It places the coalition in historical perspective, using G. O'Donnell's earlier work on political economy as a source of contrasts and similarities.

<p>How can the long process of change in Italian democracy (1992–2012) be analyzed and explained? Answering this question requires placing the phenomenon of macro-political change of a democracy within a theoretical framework that will give answers to other questions: How should a transition from one type of democracy to another be analyzed; have there been other cases of such a transition; what happened in Italy that brought about a change from a democracy to another one? By developing a theoretical proposal and providing a set of empirical data, replies are suggested to those questions and an explanation is given. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.4585]</p>

<p>This study contributes to the scholarly understanding of the insurgency in the oil-rich Delta region of Nigeria. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a loose coalition of insurgent groups responsible for many spectacular cases of kidnapping and bombing, is interrogated within the new wars theoretical prism. The article draws on interview and focus group data garnered from six categories of actors, including forty-two ex-insurgents engaged in kidnapping, pipeline vandalism, inter alia, and official e-mails from MEND's spokesperson, “Jomo Gbomo”. MEND's loose structure, fluid membership, public sympathy, the Delta creeks and vast resources, the article argues, have combined to produce an unprecedented insurgency in Nigeria. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Seeking to offer a unified theory about Greece's current political and economic crisis, this article unravels the particular mechanisms through which this country developed as a populist democracy, that is, a pluralist system in which both the government and the opposition parties turn populist. It furthermore shows how this democracy facilitated the political class and the vast majority in Greek society to achieve and maintain for several decades an admirably high coordination of aims enabling them to exploit the state and its resources. Seen within the theoretical framework proposed, Greece offers policy-oriented scholars crucial insights into what may go badly wrong in developed Western democracies. [R]</p>

<p>The spread of cell phone technology across Africa has transforming effects on the economic and political sphere of the continent. We investigate the impact of cell phone technology on violent collective action. We contend that the availability of cell phones as a communication technology allows political groups to overcome collective action problems more easily and improve in-group cooperation, and coordination. Utilizing novel, spatially disaggregated data on cell phone coverage and the location of organized violent events in Africa, we show that the availability of cell phone coverage significantly and substantially increases the probability of violent conflict. Our findings hold across numerous different model specifications and robustness checks, including cross-sectional models, instrumental variable techniques, and panel data methods. [R]</p>

<p>Developments in Turkish politics from 2007 signal a historic shift in the country, long controlled by the staunch and virtually autonomous bureaucracy, both military and civilian, in the face of fragile civilian politics. A unique leverage used by civilian politics in bringing about the change has been the discourse of Europeanization. Originally a project that was part and parcel of the identity politics of the bureaucracy from the 19th c., the discourse seems to have been appropriated by forces defiant of the bureaucratic rule to reconfigure access to power. This shift in power may amount to nothing less than a regime-change, completed and sealed in the last general election in June 2011, although it remains to be seen whether the new regime, as yet amorphous, will deliver the improved democracy it promises.

<p>In July 2009, the capital city of China's Xinjiang Province exploded in violence. The riots should have come as no surprise: deep down there is tremendous discontent and resentment among Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim group. The Chinese government needs to ask itself what caused such a horrific event to take place. If not, July 2009 will be a prelude of what is to come. As of now, Xinjiang is not a place where terrorists or people with extremist views have a stronghold, but if the government continues in the same direction, it may produce people who espouse such views. This article will examine how the roots of Uighur rage are found in Beijing's long-established anti-Uighur policies, which are based on the idea of Han superiority. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper highlights some of the issues that European Muslims have faced and experience today. I consider the causes and rationale behind the current situation and suggest ways in which this may evolve. Four contributory factors have led to the deepening multidimensional identity crisis of Western society: globalisation, immigration, the emergence of a new kind of citizen and social and terrorist violence. These have led to the creation of physiological and emotional tensions, doubts and fears in both Muslims and people of other faiths. Similar questioning is also evident within Muslim-majority countries. I propose suggestions for how improvements might be achieved, for better coherency and understanding to enable us to evolve from this feeling of fear and doubt towards self-confidence and mutual trust through a long-term dialectical approach.

<p>In the first decades of the 20th c. an international legal regime was established in order to control a category of drugs seen as dangerous for individual and public health as well as the moral and social orders. In the 1970s, the US declared a “war on drugs,” considering drug-trafficking a menace to its national security. That policy has since then reinforced repressive measures along US borders and driven the involvement of militaries in the combat against drug-trafficking in Latin America. Despite the increase of illegal drug production and consumption, the militarized approach has been maintained, generating great violence and transborder conflicts. The article presents a political history of the militarization of policies on drug trafficking, highlighting their effects in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. [R]</p>

Circumpolar navigation and subsoil resource exploitation will become economically viable realities and coastal states will try to extend their jurisdiction on these spaces as permitted by the Law of the Sea; the challenges of inevitable judicalization resulting from coastal state claims will render international cooperation more essential than ever.

<p>This paper explores how intervention has gradually become normalized as an exercise in risk-management in Kosovo. It focuses on the post-1999 political process through which the operational conditions of international intervention have been established and reproduced over time. It argues that the NATO's 1999 military intervention left two important legacies that have shaped the policy and practices of intervention throughout the past decade. One is discursive, rooted in the intervening powers’ legitimization of the military campaign as an “exceptional” breach of the non-intervention principle. The other is political that underpins the administrative state of affairs the NATO intervention created, which perpetuated the prolonged practices of the external regulation of governmental and institutional affairs in Kosovo.

<p>In Italy, the term <italic>anomalia</italic> is used by critics of the Italian political system to lament its alleged lack of maturity and modernity. In other countries, such as Britain, the US and France, the term “exceptionalism” is used to highlight, often in a complimentary way, the particularity of the country. This article reviews some of the uses of the term in Italian politics particularly with regard to the hegemony — for the first 40 years or so of the First Republic — of the Christian Democratic Party and the weight of the Italian Communist Party. This tends to highlight problems of coalition-making and alternance of parties in government instead of the true “anomaly,” namely, the existence of an unusually strong criminal organization, the mafia or the problems affecting the Italian model of development.

<p>When the Berlusconi government collapsed, a new government under the technocratic leadership of M. Monti came to the rescue. This replicates a pattern seen before, in which long stretches of opportunistic, ideologically divided and ineffective political economic leadership for time are followed by pragmatic technocratic leadership at critical junctures, which manages to overcome political institutional constraints to liberalize and modernize. In order to explain this back-and-forth pattern, the article combines a discursive institutionalist analysis of Italian political leaders’ ideas and discursive interactions with a historical institutionalist analysis of Italy's formal political institutional arrangements. It also sets Italy's political economy in comparative perspective, as a “state-influenced” market economy in which the state hinders more than it enhances political economic activity, by contrast with France and even Spain.

<p>I discuss how the events unfolding in the Arab world since early 2011 — the Arab Spring — are not easily understood as suggested by many western (as well as Arab) commentators and scholars.

While “Eurasianism,” with its idea of “symbiosis” between Russians and Muslims of various ethnic backgrounds, has been replaced in the minds of the elite and some of the general public with “Byzantism,” a peculiar Russocentric ideology. “Byzantism” emphasizes the importance of transethnic Orthodoxy and Russian language/culture as key elements of Russian civilization. It also implies adherence to a strong corporate state and the assumption that Russia is surrounded by a hostile East and West, the last more dangerous, for it undermines the spiritual core of Russian/Byzantism civilization. These views, however, are challenged by those who believe that Russia is a part of the West or, to be precise, of Central/Western Europe. [R, abr.]</p>

The spectrum of conflicting-antagonistic positions is an antinomic endeavor, transforming, in the context of an enlarged EU, the political union project into an ambiguous and even unrealistic target.

<p>The chapter addresses the question of the discontinuity and continuity in Italian discourse about European integration after the Second World War. On the one hand, discontinuity is shown by the changing approach to the EU by S. Berlusconi and the leaders of the ruling center-right coalitions of the Second Italian Republic starting in 1992 as well as by the effects of the economic crisis in underpinning populism. On the other hand, by a historical institutionalist approach, the author stresses that the weight of the anti-fascist origins of the Europeanist streams, the rich cultural heritage and the lack of any practical nationalist alternative explain the comparatively high rate of continuity in Italian support for EU integration.

The extent of organized violence at the end of the decade was lower than at its beginning, although the decline was not dramatic. Moreover, while in the 1990s there were wide fluctuations in the number of conflicts, this pattern was not repeated in the 2000s, indicating that the downward trend may be a promising indication of future developments.</p>

<p>This paper defines the Arab Spring, identifies its rationale and discusses the consequences. While a wave of socio-political and economic change seems to come in the Arab world, regime-change (as in Egypt) could be obvious with adequate reforms such as new constitution or elections. How democracy would be established in the “no democracy region” is a matter of concern. If democracy is introduced in the Arabian Peninsula without its true exercise, the Arab Spring could produce uncertainty, insecurity, civil war, human rights violations, terrorism and so on. The other concerns lie with the relations between the “global war on terror” and the Arab Spring, and between Israel and the Arab Spring. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Since 2011, Bahrain and Oman are the Gulf monarchies where expressions of social discontent have been more vocal. Unsurprisingly, the authorities of these two states, with more limited oil resources than their neighbors, face greater difficulties to propose a new social contract replacing the old patrimonial model based on the clientelist distribution of the rent. This paper analyzes, in a comparative perspective, the non-coercive strategies implemented for the last years in Bahrain and Oman to consolidate the current political order. It will pay special attention to the “Arab Spring,” to what these events reveal of these regimes’ internal political mechanisms and of the efficiency of legitimation strategies used until now.

<p>The implementation of the US military surge in Iraq coincided with a significant reduction in ethnic violence.

We address this question using an agent-based model that is built on GIS-coded data on violence and ethnic composition in Baghdad. Our model shows that patterns of violence and segregation in Baghdad are consistent with a simple mechanism of ethnically motivated attacks and subsequent migration. Our modeling exercise also informs current debates about the effectiveness of counterinsurgency operations. We show that even small levels of policing can dramatically mitigate subsequent levels of violence. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article [examines] some surprising similarities between the recent political trajectories of Turkey and Thailand, arguing that international norms strongly shape domestic cleavage formations. The timing and the manner of incorporation of particular states into the international system affects not only their political and economic development, but also the way various domestic groups see their mission, their identity, and their opposition. In both Turkey and Thailand, what development has brought is neither the opposition between traditional status groups and the market generated social forces, nor the tradition/religion-based opposition to modernization and democracy that is typically assumed to mark developing societies. What we find in both cases instead is a modernization-generated statist/bureaucratic social middle class that justifies its skepticism of democratization on the basis of norms upheld by the international society itself.

<p>This article argues that the insurgency in southern Thailand, currently into its ninth consecutive year, is a non-international armed conflict (NIAC). The title implies the contentiousness of the argument, which is responsive to the government of Thailand's express claim that the situation in the South is rather one of banditry, organized crime, and/or ill-defined insurgency. The article [reviews] the nature and applicability of international humanitarian law (IHL) and the factual background of Thailand's conflict. It then applies the relevant IHL to the facts by addressing, through their various constituency sub-elements, the two main legal elements of Common Article 3 NIACs: organization and intensity. It dispenses with the specific claim that Thailand's southern violence is primarily of a non-ideological, criminal nature and that such militates against its constituting a NIAC. [R, abr.]</p>
