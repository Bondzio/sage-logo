<p>Stephen H. Gregg’s, <italic>Defoe’s Writings and Manliness: Contrary Men</italic>, skillfully uses the works of Daniel Defoe to consider the multiplicity of eighteenth-century British masculinities. Gregg begins by defining his use of terms such as <italic>masculinities, effeminacy</italic>, and <italic>manliness</italic>. These terms are not unfamiliar to scholars in this field, but by drawing the reader’s attention to the anachronistic labeling of eighteenth-century men and men’s lives, the author provides the framework for consideration of men and masculinities prior to the mid-nineteenth-century. Greg defines Defoe’s men as “contrary” which he further deconstructs, “Defoe’s men are men, but they are never unproblematically so: they seem to display a contrariness which indicates that failure as an ideal man—that is, a failure in manliness—is never far away …. Defoe’s abiding interest was in ‘failures' of manliness” (1). Gregg argues that Defoe’s men are not traditional paradigms of eighteenth-century British manliness, but through their shortcomings and their contrary relationship to manliness, they demonstrate manliness as a process of becoming rather than a state of being. As Gregg explains, “Being a man in Defoe’s writings was not necessarily being manly: rather, manliness is a continual and effortful becoming—and it is an effort that is not always successful” (1). This “effortful becoming” is developed through Gregg’s consideration of common themes found in Daniel Defoe’s works including: economy, gentility, rationality, intimacy, and faith in relation to the developing notions of men and manliness during this time.</p>
<p>Through his focus on Defoe’s novels, Gregg asserts that as English society moved further away from feudalism and closer toward capitalism, the ideal man and manliness began to shift as well. Gregg pulls from the culture surrounding Defoe and his contemporaries as he considers the influence of the changing economy and society on the expectations of manliness. The effeminacy associated with the loss of agency makes the denial of self to succeed in business, an essential component to the merchant tradesmen class, an increasingly problematic trait for early modern manliness. Gregg draws upon the example of Defoe’s postulation in <italic>The Complete English Tradesman</italic>, “There is some difference between an <italic>honest man</italic> and an <italic>honest tradesman</italic>” (20). The problematic compromise of trading one’s virtue for success in business and economic endeavors is a common struggle of Defoe’s men. Gregg uses Defoe’s <italic>A Journal of the Plague Year</italic> to address the multiple possibilities of masculinities during the uncertainties and helplessness of plague of 1655. “<italic>A Journal of the Plague Year</italic> presents no unitary or stable ideal of manliness: ideals of masculine behaviour become atomized and re-formed into a series of vignettes of exemplary, yet multiform, manlinesses” (112). Through the examples and attention to the multiple motives of Defoe’s characters, such as his consideration of Robinson Crusoe as both a passionate and rational being, Gregg shows how Defoe’s men often both define and defy manliness and masculinities; yet, through these experiences the reader understands that it is not Defoe’s characters that are contrarian, but rather, the nature of masculinities as a whole.</p>
<p>Defoe’s use of contrarian men is mirrored by Gregg’s efforts in demonstrating the contrary nature of masculinities. As Gregg describes Defoe’s writing, “It [contrariness] is to be aware of the parameters of both sides, of heterodoxy and orthodoxy, to willingly ply between the hegemonic and the transgressive, the ideal and the corrupt,” the reader understands how Gregg has worked to achieve a similar chiastic experience of masculinity and effeminacy in this book (166). Prior to considering this text, a reader may have been tempted to experience effeminacy as the antithesis to the masculine ideal; Gregg demonstrates the complex relationship between these characteristics. Conceptions of both manliness and effeminacy have been derived from concepts such as virtue, intimacy, faith, economy, and reason. As modernity progresses, the poles of the manliness and effeminacy dichotomy wax and wane within one another. What remains constant, however, is that either identity is in a constant act of becoming rather than being. The representations of manliness and masculinities through the flawed men of Defoe’s works show the formation of masculine ideals and the struggle of individuals to achieve these ideals.</p>
<p>Gregg adroitly shows how early modern masculinities differed from their later modern counterparts through Defoe’s portrayal of the ideal masculinities for which his men must continually strive. Often manliness is associated with ideal virtue. The virtue of faith in a God, virtues of friendship, and the value of maintaining virtue despite the rise of capitalism are all common struggles among Defoe’s men, as well as the men of the time. The rise of modernity changes the known social constructions of manliness and masculinity; through his attention to textual and cultural considerations of eighteenth-century England, Gregg shows how the scaffoldings of early modern masculinities are still used in the modern efforts of becoming men.</p>
