<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2005, approximately 11 million people died worldwide from cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112461324">1</xref></sup> Hypertension is a major risk factor, causing 51% of stroke and 45% of ischaemic heart disease on a global scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112461324">2</xref></sup> Of the 30% of deaths attributable to cardiovascular diseases in 2008 in Brazil, 12% were caused by high blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112461324">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Across populations, sodium intake which mainly is due to common salt consumption is related to a progressive increase, with age, in the level of blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112461324">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112461324"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112461324">6</xref></sup> Conversely, a reduction in salt intake has been repeatedly shown to be highly cost-effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112461324">2</xref></sup> A Cochrane systematic review pointed out that a modest reduction in salt intake for at least 4 weeks creates a significant and important effect on blood pressure in both individuals with normal and with elevated blood pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112461324">7</xref></sup> reinforcing the fact that a reduction in salt intake results in lowered blood pressure. Consequently, several guidelines were developed about limiting salt consumption, most of them recommending no more than 6 g/day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112461324">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112461324">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112461324">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reducing salt intake in the human population is not an easy task, because there are important variations in patterns of salt consumption. In European and North American countries, the main sources of dietary salt are the many processed foods, restaurant and catering food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112461324">1</xref></sup> In developing countries, the major sources of salt consumption are salt addition during cooking, as well as in sauces, spice mixes and seasonings, rather than in pre-packaged prepared foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112461324">10</xref></sup> Previous studies of salt consumption related-behaviours among Brazilian hypertensive individuals clearly show that addition of salt during cooking is the main source of consumed salt, responsible for 61% of the total daily salt intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112461324">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112461324">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies report the effects of interventions to reduce salt consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112461324">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112461324"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112461324">15</xref></sup> The intervention that was applied in Cappuccio’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112461324">13</xref></sup> resulted in a reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, even though no significant decrease of urinary sodium was detected. Their intervention consists in a standard health education package from the Ghana Ministry of Health, which includes general information on public health problems, complemented by specific advice on reducing the addition of salt and limiting amounts of high salt content foods.</p>
<p>A study by Ireland and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112461324">14</xref></sup> which aimed to compare the use of the ‘Tick’ symbol and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand guideline, applied 15-minute sessions of dietary education to identify reduced-salt foods. They found a significant and equivalent decrease in urinary excretion in both study groups. Finally, a study by Robare et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112461324">15</xref></sup> observed positive results in reducing urinary sodium among hypertensive adults. Their intervention was based on nutrition counselling that is grounded in behavioural theory, specifically in behaviour change and social learning theory, and it includes self-management and problem-solving approaches. Overall, two of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112461324">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112461324">14</xref></sup> offer no theory-based interventions and no theoretical background is provided. The study by Robare et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112461324">15</xref></sup> was theory-based, but it has no assessment of the intervention on the targeted behavioural determinants.</p>
<p>In intervention research, the use of a theoretical framework can be important to understand why and how the chosen content and activities provoke the expected result. Therefore, for research purposes, interventions should need an explicit, detailed description (what its content is, how it works and how much is needed for an effect to occur). Studies need to be linked to an underpinning mechanism (thus, a theory) supporting the intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112461324">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bartholomew et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112461324">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup> developed an intervention framework, named ‘Intervention Mapping (IM)’, with the purpose of providing health promotion programme planners with a systematic approach in designing interventions. IM affords intervention planners a systematic mode for integrating empirical findings from the literature, theories, research results and field data collected from the target population at each phase of intervention development, because it is often unclear how and where these tools should be used in programme planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strategies aimed at reducing salt intake are needed to promote and to support behavioural changes. In the context of developing countries, the addition of salt to food preparation is one of the most representative nutritional behaviours that contributes to overall salt consumption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112461324">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112461324">10</xref></sup> not only in the general but also in specific populations such as hypertensive individuals; therefore, this study’s aim is to describe the systematic planned theory- and evidence-based development of an intervention aimed at reducing salt addition during food preparation for hypertensive Brazilian women. Our target population was restricted to women, because in general they are in charge of cooking in Brazil and consequently, control the addition of salt to food. The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to guide its development.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. IM is a process for developing theory- and evidence-based health education programmes, comprised of six phases, each with clear tasks and a clear end product: needs assessment, creation of a matrix of change objectives, selection of theory-based methods and practical applications, designing of the programme, specification of adoption and implementation plans, and generation of programme evaluation plans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section8-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 1: Needs assessment</title>
<p>The first step concerns the description of the health problem/risk behaviour in the target population, including its behavioural and environmental causes and determinants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112461324">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup> This phase usually begins with a question about the specific health or behaviour change issue and its determinants, and then identifies evidence for as many causal relationships between constructs and the behaviour as are reported in the literature. We conducted such analyses at the population level and provided information on causal factors based on a previous study conducted by Cornélio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112461324">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 2: Matrix of change objectives</title>
<p>In the second step, the targeted behavioural outcome was subdivided into performance objectives. We constructed a matrix of change objectives that combined specific behavioural performance with theoretically and empirically derived determinants that represented the foundation for designing the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 3: Theory-based methods and practical applications</title>
<p>In the third stage of the IM process, we selected theoretical methods and practical applications. Theoretical methods are general processes, derived from empirical or theoretical evidence, used to directly influence the determinants of behaviour or environmental conditions, whereas practical applications are defined as techniques for the application of those theoretical methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 4: Design the programme</title>
<p>Based on the methods and practical applications we selected, we developed a plan for the intervention components, including the description of the sequence of components in the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 5: Adoption and implementation plans</title>
<p>In this phase, adoption and implementation plans were specified for programme implementation with fidelity. Several actions were taken to prepare the use of the programme in an evaluation study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 6: Monitoring and evaluation</title>
<p>The aim of this step is to generate a plan to assess whether the intervention programme was successful at changing both behaviour and psychosocial determinants. Thus, the main endpoints were defined, according to the intervention’s objectives.</p>

<title>Step 1: Needs assessment</title>
<p>Studies by Cornélio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112461324">11</xref></sup> and Ferreira-Sae et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112461324">12</xref></sup> conducted with hypertensive individuals, identify high salt consumption (approximately 12 g/day) among persons with hypertension, which far exceeds the current recommendation of 4 g of salt/day for this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112461324">9</xref></sup> Moreover, these studies indicate that the main source of salt intake (approximately 62%) was derived from addition of salt during food preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112461324">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112461324">12</xref></sup> These findings were complemented by literature searches.</p>
<p>Given that an important aspect of this health problem has a behavioural cause, IM specified that the determinants of the behaviour should be identified. The Cornélio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112461324">19</xref></sup> study used an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112461324">20</xref></sup> to identify the determinants of salt intake behaviour. The behaviour of salt addition during food preparation is predicted by intention, which in turn is determined by self-efficacy and strength of habit, as was observed and defined by Verplaken et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112461324">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The needs assessment yielded to the definition of the ultimate objective of the intervention, which was ‘using 4 g or less of salt/day during cooking your meals’. Our programme concentrated on the motivational determinants, self-efficacy and habit, because they predict intention, which is the main predictor of behaviour.</p>

<title>Step 2: Matrix of performance objectives</title>
<p>Our matrix, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112461324">Table 1</xref>, was based on the results of the study by Cornélio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112461324">19</xref></sup> and meetings with experts on cardiology and behavioural sciences. We formulated four performance objectives directed at altering self-efficacy and habit: to become aware of the effects of salt consumption on health and blood pressure, to decrease the automaticity of using of salt during cooking, to prepare a quantity of no more than 4 g of salt before beginning to cook, and to resist the temptations of using more than 4 g of salt/day. These were the most immediate goals for the intervention to accomplish and were stated in terms of what a person needs to learn and do to facilitate performing a specific behaviour. We discussed the performance objectives with experts in the fields of cardiology and behavioural sciences, as well as with representatives of the target population.</p>

<title>Step 3: Theory-based methods and practical applications</title>
<p>We searched the literature for information regarding the methods known to influence the learning and/or change objectives related to each determinant. Subsequently, we selected practical applications for each method. This was done keeping in mind important aspects, such as: restraints in time, money and delivery; as well as whether the target population would be willing to participate in performing our practical applications and would find them acceptable. In the description of the methods, we took advantage of the definitions provided by Bartholomew and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112461324">18</xref></sup> as well as those provided by Abraham and Michie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112461324">22</xref></sup> in their taxonomy of behavioural change techniques.</p>
<p>We discussed the intervention components with the project group and pretested selected content for acceptability, in a group of women (<italic>n</italic> = 10) with similar characteristics to the target population, to ensure that the practical applications selected were appropriate. Two main theories were used to guide the development of our intervention: Transtheoretical Model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112461324">23</xref></sup> and Social Cognitive Theory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112461324">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112461324">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously, the Transtheoretical Model was applied as a theoretical framework for dietary behavioural interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112461324">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112461324"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112461324">28</xref></sup> From this theory, we selected two methods that are consciousness-raising and counter-conditioning, in order to counteract the influence of habit.</p>
<p>Consciousness-raising is used in the early stages of change, to help individuals increase their awareness of the advantages of changing and the multiple benefits of healthy behaviour. Knowledge must be considered an essential step toward promoting behavioural change. If people lack knowledge about how their lifestyles affect their health, they have little reason to put themselves to work, to change the detrimental habits that they enjoy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112461324">29</xref></sup> This method was chosen to increase women’s knowledge and awareness about current recommendations on the restrictions for daily dietary salt intake, for hypertensive individuals, as well as the risks related to excessive consumption of this nutrient. A brainstorming session was selected as a practical application for achieving consciousness-raising.</p>
<p>Counter-conditioning involves changing one’s responses to environmental stimuli and is therefore the process of substituting positive healthy behaviours for unhealthy behaviours. This method was used to promote healthier behaviours as a way to replace problematic ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112461324">30</xref></sup> The practical applications for counter-conditioning encompassed the delivery of a cookbook containing recipes with natural spices and seasonings, a poster with pictures illustrating natural spices that can be used to replace salt, the manipulation of measuring spoons to dose salt and information about label-reading.</p>
<p>Social Cognitive Theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112461324">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112461324">25</xref></sup> was used to improve self-efficacy, the confidence in one’s personal ability to perform a task or a specific behaviour. A body of evidence suggests that enhancing self-efficacy results in changes in eating behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112461324">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112461324"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112461324"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112461324">34</xref></sup> There are four major information sources for enhancing a person’s self-efficacy: performance accomplishments, vicarious learning, verbal persuasion, and addressing the person’s physiological and affective states. These sources can take several forms. Performance accomplishments include any positive experiences in performing a behaviour. Vicarious learning is about the observation of others engaging in similar behaviours. Thus, both of these sources are related to skills development. Verbal persuasion is positive feedback from significant others or professionals, to encourage individuals to adopt and maintain a given behaviour, and it is directed in such a way that it helps people to view the experience as a successful one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112461324">24</xref></sup> To enhance self-efficacy not to use salt, our programme focused on skill development and consolidation, overcoming barriers to the use of salt and on the positive reinforcement of successful achievements. Thus, the chosen methods to improve self-efficacy were guided practice, identification of barriers and coping response, and verbal persuasion.</p>
<p>Guided practice with feedback contributes toward skill enhancement and the building of self-efficacy, by providing opportunities for the subject to gain hands-on skill-building activities and corrective feedback in salt use. Thus, our intervention programme included simulation activities where women had the opportunity to measure the salt addition to food preparation by using a measuring spoon for meting out 4 g of salt. Given the simulated conditions, there is no fear of making mistakes created and this exercise is continued until the women perform the behaviour proficiently and spontaneously. Feedback is provided, in order to enable women to make corrective adjustments.</p>
<p>Verbal persuasion contributes to self-efficacy when the persuaders use tools to lead the individual into believing that she/he can successfully perform specific tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112461324">24</xref></sup> For our study, reinforcement phone calls were chosen as a practical application for verbal persuasion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the method of overcoming barriers to adopt and maintain a new lifestyle was included, in order to improve the perception of self-efficacy and consequently, change the subject’s behaviour. Role-play was used as a practical application for the identification of barriers and the formulation of appropriate coping responses in the intervention programme.</p>

<title>Step 4: Designing the programme</title>
<p>The main theme of the programme was ‘use no more than4 g of salt/day to prepare your food’. The name SALdável programme was derived from the words ‘salt’ and ‘healthy’ in Portuguese (sal and saudável, respectively). First, we conducted some brainstorming sessions with experts and members of the target group, to identify the intervention materials and to define the sequence of programme interventions, keeping in mind the necessary links between objectives and practical application. Second, a manual of intervention was produced to guide the health professionals (nurses and nutritionists), which we named facilitators, the ones who received training in the intervention. The manual for facilitators included sections on: (a) hypertension and salt consumption, (b) theoretical methods, (c) practical applications, and (d) steps and procedures for implementation. Our intervention programme proposed two 60–90-minute group sessions, which were offered to a maximum of 10 women, with two reinforcement phone calls. The first group session was conducted by two nurses and the second one, by a nurse and a nutritionist. The phone calls were made by a nurse.</p>
<p>The first session focuses on consciousness-raising and overcoming barriers by means of brainstorming session and role-playing activity, according to the following steps:</p>
<sec id="section19-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 1. Brainstorming</title>
<p>The facilitator induced the discussion group to act, based on eight questions meant to stimulate knowledge-building about hypertension and the consequences of excessive salt intake, by encouraging the participants to add something to the information to be remembered. The facilitator encouraged women to identify the barriers and difficulties in using no more than 4 gof salt/day during the cooking of meals. It is at this stepthat the scenario (barrier) emerges, to be simulated in role-playing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 2. Choosing the scenario and role distribution</title>
<p>In this step, based on the group’s discussion and on the women’s performance during the earlier step, the facilitator selected the scenario (barrier) and the players, asking them to simulate the barrier and the strategies to overcome it. The other participants (observers) observed the performance of the players, and then analysed the proposed strategies to overcoming the barrier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 3. Debriefing</title>
<p>The most important step of role-playing consists of a brief period of reflection where women are encouraged to discuss issues generated by the role-playing activity as well as the suggested strategies to overcome the barrier. The facilitator moderates the discussion and the participating women are encouraged to express their opinions on the coping strategies that were proposed by the players and say whether they would personally adopt or not the same strategies to overcome the same barriers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 4. The ending</title>
<p>The facilitator reviewed and summarized the key points that emerged during role-playing, mainly about the barriers and coping strategies to use no more than 4 g of salt/day during cooking. Feedback was used to reinforce the positive beliefs and to increase awareness of salt consumption.</p>
<p>At the end of the session, the facilitator offered a measuring spoon of 4 g to each participant and reinforced the need to make an effort to use it within the next 30 days. Participants were told they would receive a phone call15 days later.</p>
<p>The second session focused on guided practice with feedback and counter-conditioning. Guided practice was conducted by a nurse and hands-on skill-building activities were used to enhance women’s self-efficacy in knowing how to quantify 4 g of salt/day, using a measuring spoon. Women were also informed how to adjust this quantity of salt to the number of individuals eating at their home. Feedback was important to correct the use of the measuring spoons. Another activity consisted of a presentation of a poster with images of natural spices, by a nutritionist. The women became familiarized with these alternatives to salt use and they discussed how to use them to prepare meals. They were given a cookbook, prepared by the nurse and nutritionist, containing recipes that used natural spices. Finally, the women were trained to read labels on processed foods, to verify the sodium content, mainly in processed seasonings. At the end of this session, the women were told they would receive another phone call, 15 days later.</p>
<p>A prototype of the programme (comprising materials and strategies) was pre-tested in a pilot test with 10 representatives of the target group, with a mean of 60 years of age, a mean duration of hypertension of 15 years, having 4.2 years of schooling and a mean monthly family income of 924 dollars, in order to identify the aspects of the programme that might be improved. The duration of our sessions was about 60 minutes. At the end of these pre-test sessions, the women were asked through open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of the meetings, as well as about the quality of the materials used, regarding their perception of the materials’ comprehensibility and utility for changing their dietary behaviours related to salt intake. The women in this pre-test reported that the interventions were relevant to the context, that the opportunities for discussion provided were important and that our messages were clear, thus quite understandable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 5: Adoption and implementation</title>
<p>In the fifth step, we developed a plan for accomplishing programme adoption and implementation, created the materials and developed a plan for the recruitment of participants for the intervention and the control groups. At this point, facilitators were trained to carry out the intervention and they were informed regarding the practical applications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1474515112461324">
<title>Step 6: Monitoring and evaluation</title>
<p>A pre-post test randomized controlled trial that included intervention and control groups was performed, to evaluate the effects of the intervention on both motivational (self-efficacy and habit) and behavioural (intention) determinants, as well as on salt consumption behaviour. The main research question to be answered was whether the women in the intervention group, compared to those in the control group, would reduce their salt consumption by adopting the specific behaviour of adding no more than 4 g of salt/day, during the cooking of meals over the 3-month follow-up period.</p>
<p>The main end-points of our study were defined as: the self-reporting measures of adding no more than 4 g of salt/day during cooking, during the last 2 months of the intervention, the subject’s discretionary salt intake, their consumption of processed seasonings with a high salt content and the objective measure of 24 h urinary sodium excretion. Discretionary salt is defined as the individual amount of salt used monthly at home, adjusted to the number of individuals and meals made at home. The consumption of processed seasonings with high salt content was measured by the amount of cubes or packages of seasonings consumed per month at home, also adjusted to the number of individuals and meals made at home. The 24 h urinary excretion of sodium was used to estimate the woman’s daily salt intake, using the conversion 1mmol sodium =23 mg of solid sodium, as 95% of sodium that is ingestedis excreted in the urine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112461324">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cognitive determinants (intention, self-efficacy and habit) were assessed by a questionnaire previously validated by Cornélio et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112461324">36</xref></sup> given at baseline and 15 days after the end of the intervention program. At the time of follow-up, women were also asked about their level of satisfaction with the intervention, their perception of its practical applications and about the group sessions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper describes the systematic development of an intervention programme that was intended to reduce salt consumption in hypertensive women. The planning process reported in this paper resulted in a novel intervention that was aimed at reducing salt intake among hypertensive women, which can be implemented in a public health setting. The novelties of this intervention were the focus on salt addition during cooking; the use of a theoretical framework that had identified its behavioural determinants; and the reference to a planning framework for the development of all the phases of intervention, including its evaluation. Although this intervention was developed based on theory and evidence, its effectiveness still needed to be established in a sound evaluation study.</p>
<p>‘Intervention Mapping’ was found to be a useful tool in developing the SALdável programme intervention. Using a systematic approach that allowed the integration of a theoretical framework, we were able to select the appropriate methods and practical applications to achieve our change objectives. The outcomes of the first IM steps were a good starting point for eliciting practical and creative ideas for the intervention. The clear structure of programme outcomes, performance objectives, determinants and learning objectives helped the nurses to make choices regarding the target behaviour, make a clear delineation and select the appropriate evaluation outcomes. Such an approach and our preliminary findings do justify efforts to develop a solid, theory-based nursing intervention.</p>
<p>We believe that this type of intervention, based on theoretical considerations and aimed at strengthening motivation by means of improving self-efficacy and breaking bad habits, allows for a better understanding of the processes through which such interventions could change behaviour and if implemented, it should contribute to a decrease in salt consumption among hypertensive women. Although the details and specific procedures were designed for hypertensive Brazilian women and may not necessarily be generalizable to other settings, we believe our successful experience and strategies may be helpful for nurses and other health professionals wishing to develop their own interventions to reduce salt intake in hypertensive individuals.</p>
