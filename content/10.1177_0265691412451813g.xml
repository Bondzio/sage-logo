<p>The USSR was the first state in the world to declare that it was run by, and in the interests of, the labouring classes. This adds poignancy to the largely unhappy story told in this excellent collection. The dream of emancipation, prosperity and a new, better life, fostered by the revolutionary movement and the revolution itself, proved to be at best a mirage, and at worst a nightmare. Sixteen articles in three sections trace the fate of this dream, from the 1880s up to the present day.</p>
<p>The first section deals with the politics of the workers’ movement, from its origins in the informal <italic>zemliachestva</italic> of workers from a particular locality and the mutual aid societies of the early 1900s, through the Moscow garment workers’ strike of 1906, the revolution, and worker unrest in the 1920s, up to the CPSU’s efforts to mobilize workers in the terror of the late 1930s. The overall story here is how a movement built from the bottom up, based on the customs and practices of the workers themselves, was transformed into one controlled and manipulated from above, and how this process was resisted. Simon Pirani argues that between 1921 and 1923 the Bolshevik party ‘recast its political relationship with the working class’ (95), replacing mass participation in decision-making with top-down mass mobilization. This may be a little late – the Bolsheviks’ rivals claimed this was happening from 1918 onwards – but the process was real enough. Kevin Murphy’s study of strikes in the 1920s shows how the trade unions functioned as mediators, rather than as organizers, in industrial disputes. Wendy Z. Goldman’s fascinating account of how the Great Terror was brought into the workplace after 1936 depicts a campaign of mobilization assiduously inculcated and fostered by the centre against initial worker indifference.</p>
<p>Aspects of the dream, and the nightmare, are considered in the second section. Diane Koenker looks at the incipient Soviet tourist industry of the 1930s. Rest homes and sanatoria provided respite for a favoured minority of workers, and were a dream for many more. Others could travel around the USSR independently. Soviet tourism was meant to be an experience which improved mind and body, and this remained its official agenda throughout. On the other hand, the ‘special settlements’ established in the taiga in the early 1930s for ‘dekulakized’ peasants were worse than a nightmare. In these desolate places, ably described by Lynne Viola, settlers were often worked to death in forestry or mining, in settlements under the arbitrary rule of a single ‘commandant’ – a Chekist who would fulfil all the functions of Soviet power.</p>
<p>The authorities had their dreams too, dreams of rapid economic development, which were dashed by the realities on the ground. The special settlements were very inefficient, not least because the settlers’ preoccupation with sheer survival meant that output targets could not be reached. As Jean Lévesque shows, the collective farms were little better. Their productivity was undermined by the rapid turnover in their leadership and sullen resentment from their members, who would try to minimize the effort they expended on <italic>kolkhoz</italic> work.</p>
<p>Given the grinding poverty endured by most Soviet citizens for much of the twentieth century, a labour history of the USSR needs to look at the survival strategies people adopted, and this question takes up much of the third section. The notion of the ‘family wage’ had never taken root in Russia, and, as Barbara Alpern Engel shows, even before the revolution it was normal for women to work. The revolution removed the legal restrictions on women’s economic independence, while its consequences made paid work more essential than ever for many women. In a careful statistical study, Gijs Kessler analyses how urban households responded to the demographic and economic challenges of the interwar years – housing shortages, a surplus of females over males, and falling living standards. Older men were able to choose younger wives, leaving many older women single. Multi-generation extended households mushroomed, with older female relatives either working or providing childcare.</p>
<p>Secondary economic activity was vital for many Soviet workers, and Andrei Markevich looks at subsidiary agriculture, one of the few legal ways of supplementing income in urban households between 1941 and 1964. This was an essential activity in wartime, but many chose to continue cultivating parcels of land after the war and the immediate post-war famine, both to obtain scarce fresh foodstuffs and to earn money. Under Khrushchev it declined, as urban dwellers moved from wooden houses to flats and the state tried to restrict private agriculture. But it has been revived: as Sergey Afontsev shows in a piece that brings us to the present day, income diversification has flourished in the context of post-Soviet impoverishment.</p>
