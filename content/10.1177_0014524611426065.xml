<p>When Eric Hobsbawm wrote his notable book, <italic>The Age of Extremes: The short twentieth century, 1914-1991</italic> (1994), he confessed that it was only because he was late getting it to the publishers that he was able to register the events of 1989 – the collapse of the Soviet Union and its empire. Even he, a historian of great repute, was taken by surprise – and so were many other scholars, Kremlinologists among them. The interpretation of the events of that century had to be looked upon from a fresh perspective. How could the Soviet bloc, which had seemed so impregnable, implode in the way it did? When it comes to predicting the course of future events we can all do with a little humility, not least social scientists.</p>
<p>Throughout 2011, again with surprise, we watched the emergence of what we have learned to call the Arab Spring. The peoples of Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya and Syria have challenged their authoritarian regimes with varying degrees of success and often unbelievable courage. The democratic spark has been kindled, although why specifically in 2011 who can tell? It has been like a Middle Eastern version of the domino theory except that some dominoes are still standing. And who knows whether and how far other countries will become involved: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iran and of course Palestine? What are the implications for Israel and how will this work out?</p>
<p>Again, since the global economic meltdown there have been plenty of attempts to explain it. But the collapse of large banking and finance corporations in the USA was truly astonishing and another version of the domino theory was played out, the consequences of which have impinged on millions throughout the world and led to what is routinely termed the age of austerity. Strangely, we might think, it is not those who caused the collapse who are paying for mistakes made on a grand scale.</p>
<p>‘All that is solid melts into air’, Marx famously remarked in his commentary on the emergence of capitalist society. The contemporary social thinker, Zygmunt Bauman has run with the metaphor and described our present time as one of ‘liquid modernity’. Marx, no doubt, looked for a new kind of solidity to replace the old order but Bauman casts a sceptical eye on the failed attempts – in a world of uncertainty, all is fluidity. For Bauman, keeping fluids in shape calls for constant vigilance and perpetual effort, with no guarantees of success.</p>
<p>Bauman does not, however, invite us to drown in a sea of liquid modernity but rather to equip ourselves for action in a world of competing values and interests. That is why his commentaries on the Holocaust, on consumerism, global inequalities, waste, pollution and much else merit critical attention. The last word for Bauman is hope, not despair, even if it is without guarantees or predictive power. An enlarged concern for human rights and global social justice is called for. We do not have to sink into a postmodernist quagmire! In spite of all, as Studs Terkel memorably put it, hope dies last. And hope, of course, is a good and indelible gospel word. Can we ask for more?</p>
