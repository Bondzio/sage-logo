One hundred and twenty-one female college students were recruited from a large 4-year U.S. university, and only Caucasian data (n=99) were used for statistical analysis. Prior to 3D scanning, a short questionnaire was administered to assess the participants' footwear selection criteria and satisfaction with the current footwear offerings, as well as demographic information. Anthropometry of the participants' feet was measured, using a 3D foot scanner (INFOOT<sup>®</sup> by I-ware). Results showed that BMI positively affected the increase of anthropometric measurements; as BMI increased, the participants indicated significantly higher scores on shoe length and insole cushion and a lower score on fashion trendiness in the perceived importance of footwear selection criteria; they tended to wear improperly fitting shoes to accommodate wider and thicker feet; and they were significantly less satisfied with the current market than those with a lower BMI. Strong relationships in all four hypotheses were evident, and findings of this study urged the footwear manufacturing industry to recognize the unfulfilled niche market for the growing population of plus-size consumers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>footwear</kwd><kwd>plus-size</kwd><kwd>anthropometry</kwd><kwd>emerging market</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0887302X12469291"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are an estimated 1.46 billion overweight adults worldwide, and 502 million are considered obese (Finucane et al., 2011). Of particular concern is the United States, where the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey recently indicated that 33.8% of the overall population (32.2% men and 35.5% women) are obese, and the corresponding prevalence estimate for overweight and obesity combined is 68% of the population, including 72.3% of men and 64.1% of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12469291">Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, &amp; Curtin, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a recent statistical study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12469291">Wang, Beydoun, Liang, Caballero, and Kumanyika (2008</xref>) projected that based on the longitudinal data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collected from the 1970s to 2004, if this trend persists, by 2030, 86.3% of U.S. adults will be overweight or obese and 51.1% will be obese.</p><p>The rising rate of obesity and being overweight does not only increase the risk of adverse health conditions but also influences the current retail industry and evolving market demands, owing to consumers’ changing physical profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12469291">Farrigan &amp; Pang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12469291">Finkelstein &amp; Strombotne, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X12469291">Kim, Jolly, &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>). In the context of apparel, plus-size products have been offered already on the consumer market. Since 2000, the plus-size women’s apparel industry has experienced a higher annual growth rate than the overall women’s apparel market (Connolly, 2008). In 2010, the U.S. market share of plus-size apparel was 17% of the overall women’s apparel market (Clifford, 2010), while the growing trend has remained steady (Connor, 2012).</p><p>The obesity epidemic and growth trend of plus-size apparel retailing may suggest that there needs to be a footwear market particularly for plus-size consumers. However, no scientific attempt has been made to gauge the market need. For this inquiry, the use of an anthropometric approach will determine whether and how the foot morphological changes, due to increased weight (body mass index [BMI] as a measure of obesity/overweight), influence consumers’ footwear selection criteria (i.e., fit, function, and form); how they affect consumers’ footwear fit; and how they influence consumers’ satisfaction with current footwear offerings. To this end, the four hypotheses below were formulated:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis </italic>1: As BMI increases, foot morphology changes.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic> Hypothesis </italic>1<italic>a</italic>: As BMI increases, foot size changes.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic> Hypothesis </italic>1<italic>b</italic>: As BMI increases, foot shape changes.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis </italic>2: Increased BMI influences consumers’ footwear selection criteria.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis </italic>3: Increased BMI <italic>negatively</italic> affects consumers’ footwear fit.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis </italic>4: Increased BMI <italic>negatively</italic> affects consumers’ satisfaction with the current footwear market.</p></list-item></list><p>I argue that if all the hypotheses are supported, there is a potential need for a new niche footwear market for plus-size consumers. The rationale for the hypotheses is presented in the following literature review.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0887302X12469291"><title>Literature Review</title><sec id="section3-0887302X12469291"><title>The Effects of Obesity on Musculoskeletal Structure and Function</title><p>Much research in biomechanics has studied the effect of obesity on musculoskeletal structure and function. Hills, Henning, Byrne, and Steele (2002) found that compared to participants of normal weight, obese individuals had a higher plantar pressure (i.e., the pressure exerted on the foot), and this increased plantar pressure was likely to result in wider forefoot areas (i.e., the front area of foot where a group of five long bones are located). Further, the authors (Hills, Henning, Byrne, &amp; Steele, 2002) discovered that obese women tended to have higher pressure on their feet during static weight-bearing than did obese men, a difference that may be due to weaker foot ligaments in the female population. The contact area (i.e., the area of foot with the ground) is higher among the obese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12469291">Hills et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12469291">Mickle, Steele, &amp; Munro, 2006</xref>). In other words, long-term mass increases associated with obesity were likely to flatten the medial longitudinal arch (i.e., the arch that runs along the inside of a human foot; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12469291">Dowling &amp; Steele, 2001</xref>). Scholars assert that obesity generates significantly higher dynamic pressure under the forefoot and obese populations thereby might be at an increased risk of developing clinical problems in this area of the foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12469291">Hills et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12469291">Mickle et al., 2006</xref>). Along these lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X12469291">Tsung, Zhang, Fan, and Boone (2003</xref>) investigated the changes in foot shape under different weight-bearing conditions. They determined that heavier weight-bearing significantly increased the contact area, foot length, foot width, and rear foot width, while it decreased average arch height and arch angle. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12469291">Xiong, Goonetilleke, Witana, and Au (2008</xref>) also discovered that foot deformation can occur as a result of bearing extra weight. With this research, the authors confirmed that increased load from weight-bearing on the foot skeleton contributed to structural deformation and further found that the midfoot had relatively large changes in width and height when it was compared to the forefoot and rearfoot.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0887302X12469291"><title>Foot Morphology and Footwear</title><p>Wearing footwear changes the way humans walk and how the body distributes weight, and poor-fitting shoes are known to cause foot deformities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12469291">Frey, Thompson, &amp; Smith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12469291">Frey, Thompson, Smith, Sanders, &amp; Horstman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12469291">Rajput &amp; Abboud, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12469291">Frey, Thompson, Smith, Sanders, and Horstman (1993</xref>), women are less likely to wear properly fitting shoes than men. This study found that women consistently wore shoes that were smaller than their feet, implicating shoes as the major cause of female foot problems. In a study of patients with diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12469291">Reveal, Laughlin, Capecci, &amp; Reeve, 2001</xref>), 30% of the diabetic patients wore shoes that were too narrow, despite the fact that 84% of the study participants self-reported that their shoes were comfortable; moreover, 81% of those with poor-fitting shoes were women. Interestingly, in comparison between obese and normal weight women, obese women tended to wear significantly larger shoe sizes than normal weight women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12469291">Gravante, Russo, Pomara, &amp; Ridola, 2003</xref>). However, the reasons for the difference were not discussed in the study. Clinical reports suggest that poor-fitting shoes cause various foot problems such as blistering, chafing, black toes, bunions, pain, and tired feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12469291">Hamill, Bates, Knutzen, &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12469291">Marr &amp; Quine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12469291">Messier, Davies, Curl, Lowery, &amp; Pack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12469291">Rossi, 1988</xref>). This causal relationship between footwear fit and clinical foot problems suggests support for the benefits of good footwear fit. Footwear fit is subjective and it is difficult to find the “right” fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12469291">Au &amp; Goonetilleke, 2007</xref>). Referring to the quote by Pliny the Elder that only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12469291">Rossi (1988</xref>) affirmed that the “perfect” shoe fit is impossible and the “correct” fit is highly improbable: “compromise” fit remains the only alternative. Researchers agree that if a shoe is too tight, the interface pressure produces tissue compression, making the shoe uncomfortable for the wearer. On the other hand, if a shoe is too loose, the wearer experiences slippage between the foot and the shoe, resulting in performance degradation and injury to soft tissue due to friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12469291">Au &amp; Goonetilleke, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section5-0887302X12469291"><title>Evaluation of Footwear: Fit, Function, and Form</title><p>Thanks to technological advances, footwear on the current market showcases various innovative features (e.g., abrasion resistance, moisture wicking, odor resistance, and wind proofing); likewise, styles and types of footwear are becoming diverse and abundant. Customized footwear is available for consumers who have foot problems, and orthopedic physicians provide quality services for those who are in need. Even though technological advancement and product personalization are thought to improve the functioning of footwear, some footwear is considered simply ornamental to enhance form rather than functionality to protect people’s feet.</p><p>Generally speaking, evaluation of footwear is based on fit, function, and form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12469291">Goonetilleke, 2003</xref>). In the case of bare feet, form follows function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X12469291">Rossi, 2001</xref>), but for footwear products, fit is the most important property to govern function and form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12469291">Witana, Feng, &amp; Goonetilleke, 2004</xref>). Traditionally, foot length has been considered the most or only critical measure for footwear fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12469291">Goonetilleke, 2003</xref>), and it has been commonly measured by the Brannock device, typically found at retail stores. However, this popular method of foot length measurement often causes poor fitting, as most fit problems are generally about the “width” dimension or volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12469291">Rossi, 2002</xref>). In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) scanning technology has been adopted to measure various dimensions of the human foot. The 3D scan data offer detailed information on the contours of the foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12469291">Telfer &amp; Woodburn, 2010</xref>). That is, 3D foot scanners can generate not only linear measurements (e.g., length and width) but also circumferential measurements (e.g., foot girth), in seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12469291">Telfer &amp; Woodburn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X12469291">Witana, Xiong, Zhao, &amp; Goonetilleke, 2006</xref>). It should be noted that the skill level of the measurer and the instruments used might influence the measurement data, and the presence of dust particles on the scanner or high levels of ambient light might disturb sensitivity of the device (Bornaz, Lingua, &amp; Rinaudo, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X12469291">Witana et al., 2006</xref>). However, the 3D scanning technology is considered the most reliable method available thus far for obtaining accurate foot measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12469291">Telfer &amp; Woodburn, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Subjective evaluation of fit is as important as anthropometric measurements in determining footwear fit and comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12469291">Miller, Nigg, Liu, Stefanyshyn, &amp; Nurse, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12469291">Witana et al., 2004</xref>). In other words, individual preferences may influence fit perception, and thus subjective evaluations may provide information on perceived comfort and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12469291">Telfer &amp; Woodburn, 2010</xref>). This suggests that objective and subjective variables should both be taken into account in fit evaluation. The need for both subjective and objective assessments also corresponds to fit evaluation for apparel products. As scholars have asserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12469291">Ashdown &amp; O’Connell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887302X12469291">Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Xiao, 2011</xref>), subjective perception testing is often used in apparel fit assessment, since human senses sometimes determine complex stimuli more effectively than any machine.</p><p>In addition to fit and comfort, consumers demand quality and reliable products that correspond to their specific needs and standards in functionality and aesthetic tastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12469291">Piller &amp; Müller, 2004</xref>). For example, for many women, shoes are a main fashion accessory that complements their outfits; such selection preference toward style makes it comparatively more difficult for them to find comfortable shoes because their choice is dictated by fashion trends rather than by biomechanical suggestions (Luximon, Goonetillek, &amp; Tsui, 2003). On the other hand, for some consumers, especially those who need to be on their feet for long periods and/or who are less conscious of fashion and style, functional elements such as cushioning and arch support are considered much more important than form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12469291">Goonetilleke, 2003</xref>). These consumers are willing to purchase such footwear products at the expense of fashion and style, or possibly they do not even care about how they look. Individual differences in perceived level of functionality and style (i.e., form) also play an important role in the evaluation of footwear. For instance, a certain level of midsole cushioning that is considered “good” to one person may feel uncomfortable to another (i.e., the wearer’s weight can have a significant impact on subjective perceptions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12469291">Goonetilleke, 1999</xref>). Therefore, in this study, subjective ratings of footwear evaluation, as well as anthropometric foot measurements, were both considered in order to test the study hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-0887302X12469291" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="section7-0887302X12469291"><title>Sample Selection and Recruitment Strategy</title><p>Exploratory in nature, a convenience sample of U.S. female college students was recruited. Although this sampling method has inherent potential biases, this sample group, which is homogeneous in age, gender, status, and geographical location, was expected to reduce possible sampling errors to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12469291">Calder, Phillips, &amp; Tybout, 1981</xref>). Only participants who met the following inclusion criteria—U.S. female college students aged between 18 and 29—were invited to this study.</p><p>Published prevalence data were investigated further to determine the obesity rate of the particular demographic group selected for the present study.

Another national survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12469291">Lowry et al., 2000</xref>) of 4,838 U.S. female college students provided additional concrete evidence, indicating that 17.9% of study participants were overweight and 12.0% were obese. Lowry et al.’s (2000) study also indicated the “age” factor on obesity prevalence: The prevalence rate among female college students (17.9%) was much lower than that of college-educated female adults of all ages (23.4%). This epidemic trend signifies that the prevalence of obesity increases as age increases when both gender and education level are controlled. In sum, the combined obesity and overweight rate estimated for the study population was approximately 30%.</p><p>One hundred and twenty-one female college students were recruited from a large 4-year university located in the Midwest region of the United States; for further minimization of sampling errors, only Caucasian data (<italic>n </italic>= 99, 81.8%) were used for analysis.

Multiple recruitment strategies were employed in this study, which included disseminating recruitment flyers across the campus, in-class announcements, and e-blasts to students whose demographic profiles met the inclusion criteria for study participation. Overall, participants were in favor of participating in the study; however, some exhibited hesitation to actually be involved in the study, due to unfamiliarity with the 3D foot scanning technology. Therefore, to increase the number of participants, once the initial cohort was identified and data were collected, further recruitment was pursued among acquaintances of the participants who already had experience with the foot scanner. As a result, 80 participants were recruited from the first recruitment effort and an additional 41 participants were recruited from the second effort via respondent-driven sampling. The participants represented diverse academic majors of the university. After recruitment efforts were made across the campus, those students who wanted to participate in this study voluntarily contacted the researcher by their preferred communication method, either phone or e-mail, for scheduling. The researcher also followed up with the potential participants who signed up when the researcher was making the in-class announcement for recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0887302X12469291"><title>Research Instruments and Procedure</title><p>Data collection took place between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., when the participants were most active. This narrow time window for data collection was used to avoid potential effects of external variables on the foot size (e.g., swelling), due to measurement time of day. A short questionnaire was administered to each participant prior to 3D scanning in order to measure the participant’s subjective evaluation of footwear. The questionnaire was developed to assess footwear selection criteria and consumer satisfaction with the current footwear offerings, along with collecting the participant’s background information such as the most frequently worn footwear size (length and width), self-reported height/weight, and current academic major/level. As for footwear selection criteria, nine variables that reflected the three evaluation categories of footwear—fit, function, and form—were measured by a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not important at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>extremely important</italic>). Participants were also asked to rate their satisfaction levels with the current footwear market using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).

The average BMI score of the participants was 23.31 (<italic>SD </italic>= 4.22) or normal weight. Sixty-eight percent of the participants (<italic>n </italic>= 66) were identified as normal weight, while 22.7% (<italic>n </italic>= 22) were overweight, 7.2% (<italic>n </italic>= 7) obese, and 2.11% (<italic>n </italic>= 2) underweight. The overweight and obesity combined prevalence in this study was 29.9%, which corresponded well to the combined prevalence rate of Lowry et al.’s (2000) study. However, the overweight rate of this study (22.7%) was comparatively higher, and the obesity rate (7.2%) was lower than those (17.9% and 12.0% respectively) of the Lowry et al.’s study. These differences presumably reflect the overall state-to-state obesity prevalence trends in the United States, which suggests a further investigation of cross-state comparisons in a follow-up study.</p><sec id="section11-0887302X12469291"><title>Anthropometric Measurement</title><p>Simple pairwise Pearson correlation analysis determined that the following six measurement variables, out of 14 landmarks measured by a 3D foot scanner, were strongly correlated with BMI: foot length (<italic>r </italic>= .295, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .003), ball girth circumference (<italic>r </italic>= .357, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .000), foot breadth (<italic>r </italic>= .474, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .000), heel breadth (<italic>r </italic>= .602, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .000), instep length (<italic>r </italic>= .210, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .039), and height of top of ball girth (<italic>r </italic>= .500, <italic>df </italic>= 97, <italic>p </italic>= .000). In order to determine the relationships between BMI and each correlated foot measurement, simple linear regression analyses were performed at a 95% confidence level. Prior to regression analyses, PCA combined the participant’s left and right scan data into a single factor (i.e., the highly correlated variables of foot measurements for both feet were summarized into a single data set, and this new set of data represented a linear combination of the two original variables of feet). Simple linear regression analyses determined regression coefficients of all six variables were positive and the critical significance levels were less than .05, confirming that the relationships between BMI and the six variables were statistically significant. A summary of regression data is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12469291">Table 1</xref>. These findings indicate that participants with a higher BMI tended to have longer and wider feet with higher volume in their forefoot.

Further investigation is necessary to confirm this finding and identify additional determinant factors (e.g., ethnicity) for the variation in human foot length, besides height and BMI.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0887302X12469291"><title>Footwear Selection Criteria</title><p>Simple linear regression analyses revealed linear relationships of BMI with nine variables for footwear selection.

These findings suggest that as BMI increased, the participants valued more on shoe length (fit) and insole cushion (function), whereas fashion trendiness (style) became less important. That is, for those with a higher BMI, when they go shopping, they prioritize the fit and functional components of footwear over style. Hypothesis 2 was thus supported, which posited that increased BMI influences consumers’ footwear selection criteria. This result may signify that plus-size consumers undergo a negotiation process among the three footwear selection criteria to compromise footwear style (i.e., form) for a better fit and functionality.</p></sec><sec id="section13-0887302X12469291"><title>Footwear Fit and Size Disparity</title><p>In order to examine the overall relationship between BMI and footwear fit, footwear size disparity, defined in this study as the difference between the participant’s footwear size most frequently worn and the 3D scanner-calculated foot size, was calculated in the U.S. shoe size system (for detailed information on the size system, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X12469291">Tyrrell &amp; Carter, 2009</xref>, pp. 80–84). The footwear size disparity was used in this study as a parameter for assessment of footwear fit: the higher the disparity than the average range, the poorer footwear fit. The disparity range of this study was from −.5 to 2.0 and the average was .758 (<italic>SD </italic>= .517), which indicates that on average the participants wore shoes .758 larger than the 3D scanner-calculated foot size. That is to say, if a participant’s actual foot size was calculated by a 3D foot scanner as a 7, this individual would wear either shoe size 7.5 or 8 in the U.S. size system, depending on the wearer’s personal preference and feeling of subjective comfort.</p><p>Simple linear regression analysis showed a significant linear relationship between BMI and footwear size disparity (<italic>p </italic>= .000, <italic>F </italic>= 19.177, <italic>df </italic>= 1, <italic>B </italic>= .049, <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= .168). This result suggests that as BMI increased, participants tended to wear larger size shoes (i.e., ill-fitting shoes) than their actual suggested shoe size. This finding supports Hypothesis 3, which proposed that increased BMI negatively affects consumers’ footwear fit. In conjunction with the aforementioned anthropometric findings, it might be possible to infer that participants with a higher BMI would likely wear larger shoes than those with a lower BMI, which would accommodate the proportionally increased width and volume of their feet due to increased BMI. This causal relationship will be further evaluated with a path analysis later in the article.</p></sec><sec id="section14-0887302X12469291"><title>Consumer Satisfaction With Current Footwear Market</title><p>Consumer satisfaction with the current footwear market was measured by the following four variables on a 7-point Likert-type scale: availability of right footwear sizes (e.g., <italic>I have always been successful in finding right size shoes for me</italic>. <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0887302X12469291"><mml:math id="mml-inline1-0887302X12469291"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">χ</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true" stretchy="false">ˉ</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 4.97); availability of right styles (e.g., <italic>I have always been successful in finding right style shoes for me</italic>. <inline-formula id="inline-formula2-0887302X12469291"><mml:math id="mml-inline2-0887302X12469291"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">χ</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true" stretchy="false">ˉ</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 4.68); availability of product variety (e.g., <italic>I am satisfied with the shoe options on the current market</italic>. <inline-formula id="inline-formula3-0887302X12469291"><mml:math id="mml-inline3-0887302X12469291"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">χ</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true" stretchy="false">ˉ</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 4.55); and overall satisfaction with footwear shopping (e.g., <italic>footwear shopping is enjoyable</italic>. <inline-formula id="inline-formula4-0887302X12469291"><mml:math id="mml-inline4-0887302X12469291"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">χ</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true" stretchy="false">ˉ</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 5.36).

For the first hypothesis, six foot measurement variables (foot length, ball girth circumference, foot breadth, heel breath, instep length, and height of top of ball girth) showed significant correlations with BMI. As BMI increased, the sizes of the six variables increased. BMI positively affected the increase of the six anthropometric measurements, which influences the size and shape of the participants’ feet.</p><p>Evidence, gleaned from testing the second hypothesis, showed that increased BMI influenced the participants’ footwear selection criteria. Participants with a higher BMI showed significantly higher scores on shoe length and insole cushion and a lower score on fashion trendiness in the perceived importance of various footwear selection criteria. From this evidence, we might infer that obese/overweight young, female consumers tend to consider fit and function more so than they do style. In addition, changes in foot morphology led to increased BMI which in turn negatively influenced the participants’ footwear fit. This supported the third hypothesis. The result attests to the notion that as BMI increased, the participants tended to wear larger shoes (i.e., improperly fitting shoes) than the average range, to accommodate wider and thicker feet. For the fourth hypothesis, which set out to examine consumer satisfaction with the current footwear market, results indicate that participants with a higher BMI showed significantly less satisfaction with the current market than those with lower BMIs. This may suggest that the foot morphological changes due to increased BMI negatively influence consumer satisfaction with the current offerings available on the footwear market.</p><p>Returning to the morphology of the foot and the effect of BMI, the fact that the height of top of ball girth is higher as the rate of BMI increases implies that the increased BMI does not flatten the entire foot area. While this study confirmed previous research findings that the higher plantar pressure caused by the heavier weight compresses the medial longitudinal arch and heel breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12469291">Dowling &amp; Steele, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12469291">Dowling, Steele, &amp; Baur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12469291">Gravante et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12469291">Riddiford-Harland, Steele, &amp; Storlien, 2000</xref>), the increased weight does not compress the forefoot area but rather adds more volume in that area. This contradiction suggests that there could be great benefits in further research on foot morphological changes in segmented foot areas (forefoot, midfoot, and rearfoot) by the increased weight.</p><p>Path analysis results illustrated the causal relationships among BMI, foot length, foot width, footwear size disparity, and consumer satisfaction. The results showed that BMI positively influenced foot length and width and negatively affected consumer satisfaction with the footwear market. Path coefficients indicated that foot width was a significant predictor of footwear size disparity, but foot length was not. This finding can be interpreted to suggest that when one has wider feet, he or she tends to wear larger shoes than the average range; however, this does not apply to longer feet. This result shows that in order to increase overall market satisfaction of consumers and to be inclusive of those who have wider feet such as the obese population, foot width should be more commonly taken into account in commercial footwear fitting at retail stores.</p><p>Further research needs to be conducted using varied populations with different demographic profiles and larger sample sizes. Although data of this exploratory study represented the combined obesity and overweight prevalence rate of U.S. female college students, generalizability of the study findings was limited by the use of a convenient sample of female college students in a single geographical region. In addition, the relatively small number of study participants (<italic>n </italic>= 99) consequently yielded the small sample size of obese/overweight participants (<italic>n </italic>= 29). In order to address the concern with the unequal sample sizes between normal weight and obese/overweight participants, regression analyses were performed to test the hypotheses in this study. The choice of statistical analyses was appropriate, since BMI is a continuous variable. However, a larger sample size of the U.S. population is recommended on a random sample to increase the validity of the study findings. Studies of participants with different demographic profiles such as males and older females are desirable.</p><p>In the contemporary consumer market, particularly for female consumers, footwear is not just performance gear but a symbolic fashion item that finishes one’s look and reflects the primacy of her individual taste. Therefore, aesthetics has its own value, and consumers pursue both beauty and pleasure from their consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12469291">Postrel, 2003</xref>). However, such aesthetic pleasure does not come without meaningful substantive ramifications—in the case of footwear, fit, and function. Findings of this study strongly suggest that in spite of young female consumers’ high interests in style and looks, the unsatisfactory fit and functionality of currently available footwear in the market, particularly for plus-size consumers, hinder them from looking for aesthetic pleasure. Although consumer satisfaction was measured as an indicator for the emerging market, further research is desired to determine more detailed information on particular consumer needs and wants for the plus-size footwear market. In conclusion, I urge the footwear manufacturing industry to recognize the unfulfilled niche market for the growing population of plus-size consumers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0887302X12469291"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0887302X12469291"><label>Funding</label><p>The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was supported by faculty research funding from the College of Applied Human Sciences, Colorado State University.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0887302X12469291"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ashdown</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>O’Connell</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2006</year>). <article-title>Comparison of test protocols for judging the fit of mature women’s apparel</article-title>. <source>Clothing and Textiles Research Journal</source>, <volume>24</volume>, <fpage>137</fpage>–<lpage>146</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0887302X12469291"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Au</surname><given-names>E.
