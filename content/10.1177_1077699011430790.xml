<p>Some broadcast journalists, like other professionals, are moved to write memoirs as they approach, reach, or pass their career peaks. No doubt, one motive is to establish their reputations and legacies. Veteran and respected journalists such as Robin MacNeil, Bob Schieffer, and Tim Russert are some examples.</p>
<p>These books typically describe professional achievements, inside stories, and obstacles, as well as personal backgrounds, career paths, and people who were influential in the process. Schieffer, for example, focused on the professional, as suggested in his title, <italic>This Just In: What I Couldn’t Tell You on TV</italic>. And Russert wrote a very personal memoir featuring his dad, “Big Russ.”</p>
<p><italic>Transparent</italic>, by CNN anchor Don Lemon, emphasizes the personal. He devotes at least one-third of the book to his experiences while growing up as a black guy in Louisiana. And while he provides some interesting tidbits on motives and approaches in covering important stories, the professional side of the book is a bit thin. Unlike the others listed above, Lemon wrote while he was fairly young and his career was still on the rise. At CNN, he has quite recently begun substituting for superstar Anderson Cooper on <italic>AC 360</italic> and co-anchoring specials with the likes of Wolf Blitzer.</p>
<p>The author apparently writes out of a passionate concern for two topics: racism, of great interest to aspiring minority journalists, and openness, worthy of discussion in public relations classes. Also, he hopes to be an inspiring role model for minority youth, especially aspiring journalists.</p>
<p>Writing much of the time in the first-person singular, Lemon dwells at length on finding an identity and overcoming racism as a young person in Louisiana. A skilled phrase turner, he adds a couple items to the journalist’s and social commentator’s lexicon. In particular,</p>
<list id="list1-1077699011430790" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Black box</italic>: Lemon discovered early on that many employers, colleagues, and professors viewed him stereotypically. They held certain beliefs about what a black person should, can, and cannot do. When he failed, rather than providing support, they disparaged him and saw his failure as confirming their beliefs. In particular, one journalism professor told him he would never make it in the business, so he ought to consider changing majors. This led him to transfer to another school, Brooklyn College, that proved to be a much more supportive environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Colorism</italic>: As a kid, Lemon experienced racist beliefs that led whites to denigrate and discriminate against blacks. In addition, due partly to Louisiana’s colorful and rather cosmopolitan history as a key area in the slave trade, blacks and whites developed clear distinctions among people with varying shades of skin color. Light-brown people, those with dark-brown skin, and genuine blacks were labeled and treated differently in Lemon’s youth. The author reports that, during the winter, some white kids would play with him and treat him as “one of them.” But in summer, when his skin darkened in the sun, they hinted that he should play with kids on the other side of the racial divide.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Lemon notes that such experiences led him to approach some stories as a journalist with special passion and, in his view, insight. For example, he was abused sexually as a child by a neighborhood predator. This traumatic experience led him to pursue with great vigor—sometimes to the chagrin of his bosses—Catholic sexual abuses and coverage of Michael Jackson. Also, his status as a gay black man motivated him to go well beyond the call of duty, as defined by his employers, in covering the AIDS crisis in the United States and in Africa. Despite his persistent pleading, the NBC affiliate in Chicago for which he worked would not send him to Africa. So he and a cameraman went there on their own, at considerable personal expense and some risk. They sent back some award-winning stories on AIDS and wound up paying special attention to positive signs of postgenocide recovery in Rwanda, a nation generally viewed in the West as a primitive backwater.</p>
<p>Lemon also empathized early on with victims of Hurricane Katrina. He had to haggle with bosses before getting to New Orleans in 2005–6. His deep ties there eventually led him to view his home state as a probable future retirement venue.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to public relations students was Lemon’s apparent use of the book to come out as a gay man. He does not mention his gayness until page 80 and discusses it there only briefly. He reports talking things over with many colleagues and friends before deciding to include his gay status in the book. Obviously, he and his advisors bought the argument, advanced by many PR professors, that taking the initiative in revealing sensitive information about yourself allows you to frame the statement in your own words. Also, it guards against possible later accusations of a cover-up.</p>
<p>By the time readers reach page 80 in Lemon’s memoir, they will be aware of the author’s unsettled childhood marred by sexual abuse and an unconventional (in those days, at least) family background. It would seem that this contextualization may help defuse possible negative reaction to his “coming out.” Also, Lemon defends his approach because he has learned from hard experience that keeping secrets is painful and, ultimately, unfruitful. Thus, he advances a strong argument for the book’s title, <italic>Transparency</italic>.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is extensive discussion of the author’s career path. Knowing that he wanted to be a news anchor, he had to choose at various points between anchoring at a local affiliate versus gaining increased national exposure as a network correspondent, and between working for a then “established” network versus Fox or CNN. He wrestled with these choices, and worked for these organizations, before settling in at CNN.</p>
<p>The book’s somewhat preachy tone features chapter titles on “lessons in” such things as gratitude, faith, truth, diversity, priorities, and facing fear. Some readers may be turned off by this. But Don Lemon’s obvious sincerity and well-thought-out arguments make it palatable. The book deserves a place on supplementary reading lists.</p>
