<abstract>
<p>At a time when ‘trust’ is argued by many to be on the wane within post-industrial societies this article examines a case study of pupil voice brought about through collaboration between a secondary school (for pupils aged 11−16) and a university located in a large conurbation in southern England. Building on data from focus groups and individual interviews with pupils and teachers, the author suggests that for pupil voice to be truly effective and transformative, policy-makers, academics and practitioners need to move away from the ‘synthetic trust’ that typifies many pupil voice initiatives to one where authentic trust forms the cornerstone of all professional relationships in schools.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pupil voice has been the subject of considerable academic debate over the last twenty years (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0892020612445685">Giroux, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020612445685">Ashworth, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0892020612445685">Whitehead and Clough, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0892020612445685">Fielding, 2011</xref>). While many of these discussions emerge within Anglophone educational systems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0892020612445685">Mitra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445685">Bland 2011</xref>), the policy context within which these debates occur is shared by many other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0892020612445685">Wisby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0892020612445685">Kan, 2011</xref>). For example, the recent emphasis by the Swedish government on pupil voices as a starting point in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0892020612445685">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2010</xref>); the Danish government’s encouragement of schooling where ‘pupil voice is seen as an integral right for children and young people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0892020612445685">Flutter, 2007</xref>: 345); Dutch legislation under the 1982 Participation Act stating that students be consulted about the curriculum before the start of the academic year, through its Participation Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0892020612445685">Davies and Kirkpatrick, 2000</xref>); and Brazilian legislation reinforcing the existence of student guilds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020612445685">De Carvalho, 2012</xref>). Supranational driving forces for this current interest in pupil voice include concerns over the rights of children as laid out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0892020612445685">United Nations, 1989</xref>); an emerging citizenship agenda in schools exacerbated by fears over decreasing political participation by young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0892020612445685">European Council, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020612445685">Breslin, 2011</xref>); and the repositioning of children as key stakeholders (i.e. ‘clients’, ‘customers’ and ‘consumers’) in education, in part, as a response to an emerging neo-liberal educational policy framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020612445685">Czerniawski, 2010</xref>). Within the United Kingdom policies accelerating the growth in pupil voice initiatives have included the Education Act 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0892020612445685">Every Child Matters (2003</xref>), the UK Healthy Schools Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0892020612445685">DfES, 2004</xref>) and the Children’s Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0892020612445685">DCSF, 2007</xref>). Despite the change in government in 2010, implementation of these statutory initiatives is tightly policed through the inspection framework deployed by the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted). The Education Act of 2005 ensured that Ofsted has to take into consideration the views of pupils when carrying out its inspections of schools and at a local authority level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020612445685">Cremin et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Many international studies have explored the role of pupil voice in educational change and reform (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0892020612445685">Mitra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0892020612445685">Kan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020612445685">Bergmark and Kostenius, 2011</xref>), while others have stressed the importance of not only listening to voices, but engaging in dialogue (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0892020612445685">Lodge, 2005</xref>). Over the last decade, dialogue and consultation have been major themes emerging from the pupil voice agenda (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020612445685">Arnot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0892020612445685">Flutter and Rudduck, 2004</xref>). We have moved from the notions of dialogue, ‘shared responsibility’ and consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0892020612445685">Huddleston, 2007</xref>), to students becoming researchers in their own right (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0892020612445685">Fielding and Bragg, 2003</xref>), which is, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0892020612445685">Thomson and Gunter (2006</xref>: 839), potentially a more ‘transformative/disruptive process’. The diversity, scale and depth of pupil voice initiatives emerge then out of tensions generated through the initiation of government and school-based policies, practitioner-led initiatives and the academic literature that informs them.</p>
<p>Much of the pupil voice literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0892020612445685">Wisby, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0892020612445685">Gunter and Thomson, 2007</xref>) in the UK has reflected on the prevailing neo-liberal policy framework within which schools have long operated and the way in which this appears to have shaped interest in pupil voice and the mode that provision has typically taken in practice. Another body of literature, unrelated to pupil voice, has examined the extent to which neo-liberalism is associated with the erosion of trust in post-industrial societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62a-0892020612445685">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24a-0892020612445685">Elliot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61a-0892020612445685">Patulny, 2004</xref>). However, it should be acknowledged that little has been done to bring these two bodies of literature together despite the contradiction between the rise in pupil voice initiatives internationally and, in some societies, a perceived decline in trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24a-0892020612445685">Elliot, 2004</xref>), the cornerstone of all pupil/teacher interaction and an essential ingredient in authentic pupil voice initiatives. This article addresses these omissions by focusing on the issue of ‘trust’ and in particular how its contextual specificity can be explored through a case study of a school where pupil voice has been championed and acclaimed nationally as a successful initiative. The views of pupils firmly entrenched within the pupil voice at this school are contrasted with those ‘silent voices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445685">Fielding and Rudduck, 2002</xref>), i.e. those who felt alienated, excluded and disenchanted with the initiative.</p>
<p>The article initially examines two competing narratives associated with pupil voice: the first relating pupil voice to empowerment, democratic education and transformation and the second positioning pupil voice as a policy technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445685">Ball, 2001</xref>). The significance of trust is then discussed in relation to pupil voice and social cohesion. After familiarising the reader with the case study, a brief overview of the research design is explained before examining extracts taken from the interviews with pupils and teachers from the school. The subsequent discussion argues for a third narrative that reconsiders and repositions trust at the cornerstone of all professional relationships with young people in schools.</p>

<sec id="section2-0892020612445685">
<title>Pupil voice − conflicting narratives</title>
<p>In this article, ‘voice’ is used as ‘strategic shorthand’ recognising its limitations (Robinson and Taylor, 2007: 6) and its multiple contestations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0892020612445685">Fielding (2009</xref>) describes student voice as ‘a portmanteau term’, and as ‘student voice’, ‘pupil voice’ and ‘learner voice’ are concepts often used synonymously, I have reluctantly done likewise in this article when reviewing some of the literature. By ‘pupil voice’ I refer to the formal and informal processes in schools that enable all pupils to be consulted on their education and that such consultations are treated universally with trust, integrity and a commitment to transform education for the better.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10b-0892020612445685">Cheminais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0892020612445685">Flutter and Rudduck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0892020612445685">Halsey et al., 2008</xref>) that there are considerable benefits to some educational stakeholders when young learners are consulted about schooling. These include: improvements in student services; improvements in decision-making; greater democracy for learners; fulfilling legal requirements within schools; enhancing children’s skills; and empowering child self-esteem. In addition to these advantages, many teachers, heads, administrators and policy-makers can gain access to the specialist (and largely untapped) knowledge that learners have about their schools. This leads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445685">Fielding (2001</xref>) to argue that many pupil voice projects can act as a catalyst for change in schools including improvements in teaching, the curriculum and most importantly, student−teacher relationships. However, Fielding is also highly critical of some of the ways that pupil voice is articulated:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Are we witnessing the emergence of something genuinely new, exciting and emancipatory that builds on rich traditions of democratic renewal and transformation?…or are we presiding over the further entrenchment of existing assumptions and intentions using student or pupil voice as an additional mechanism of control?</italic>
</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445685">Fielding, 2001</xref>: 100)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the literature on pupil voice sits uncomfortably within two competing narratives. The first situates pupil voice within discourses that relate to empowerment, democratic education, transformation and radical pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0892020612445685">Fielding and Bragg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0892020612445685">Taylor and Robinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0892020612445685">Lodge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0892020612445685">Giroux, 1986</xref>). The second narrative positions pupil voice as a policy technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445685">Ball, 2001</xref>) embodying tokenism, regimes of audit and instrumentalism leading to greater organisational efficiency and the enhanced competitive positioning of the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0892020612445685">Reay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0892020612445685">Fielding and Bragg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0892020612445685">Gunter and Thomson, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0892020612445685">
<title>The significance of ‘trust’</title>
<p>In relation to pupil voice, by ‘trust’ I refer to a young person’s readiness to be exposed to significant others (e.g. their peers, parents and teachers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56a-0892020612445685">Mead, 1934</xref>) in the belief that such exposure will be treated with compassion, capability, honesty and transparency. These values are the bedrock of any authentic pupil voice initiative. Like pupil voice, trust is a problematic, complex and contested concept. Hosmer (1995) states that ‘there appears to be widespread agreement on the importance of trust in human conduct, but unfortunately there also appears to be an equally widespread lack of agreement on a suitable definition of the construct’ (Hosmer, 1995: 380). Empirical studies have, for example, focused on trusting relationships between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37a-0892020612445685">Frost and Moussavi, 1992</xref>); between individuals and organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45c-0892020612445685">Hoy and Kupersmith, 1985</xref>); and in events and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45b-0892020612445685">Hoffman et al., 1994</xref>). Different forms of professional trust are said to range from relatively high degrees in Nordic social democracies such as Finland, Norway and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0892020612445685">Stephens et al., 2004</xref>) to extremely low in more free-market liberal democracies such as England and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24a-0892020612445685">Elliot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61a-0892020612445685">Patulny, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Trust has been strongly identified with belonging, civic virtue and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445685">Bourdieu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020612445685">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0892020612445685">Fukuyama, 1996</xref>). Putnam, for example argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>social capital refers to connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. In that sense social capital is closely related to what some have called ‘civic virtue’.</italic>
</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62a-0892020612445685">Putnam, 2000</xref>: 19)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The creation of trust among educational professionals for community building is seen by some (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0892020612445685">Groundwater-Smith and Sachs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0892020612445685">Schmidt, 2010</xref>) as an alternative reaction to market models of schooling associated with bureaucratic surveillance, accountability regimes and predicated on inherent distrust. Accepting this conceptualisation would imply that certain types of social interaction based on trust and mutual tolerance can enable people to forge stronger links with each other and strengthen social cohesion. However, for this to be the case a distinction needs to be made between authentic forms of trust and other more ‘synthetic’ alternatives. Authentic forms of trust have been described as more moral, resilient, altruistic and long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0892020612445685">Frey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0892020612445685">Fukuyama 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0892020612445685">Lindenberg 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0892020612445685">Putnam et al., 1993</xref>). By ‘synthetic’ the implication is that such trust is contrived, instrumental, rational and to some extent fragile.</p>

<title>Pupil voice at ‘East Valley’ School – an introduction to the case study</title>
<p>East Valley School (pseudonym) consists of approximately 860 learners and is located in a predominantly white working-class semi-industrial catchment area in a conurbation in Southern England. The school has been described as ‘outstandingly effective’ in a recent government inspection report [reference retained for ethical purposes] and many of its teachers and students have represented the school at high profile national events (e.g. those run by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) showcasing good practice in relation to pupil voice. The pupil voice project which this article explores was launched by members of the senior leadership team (SLT) to provide a method of encouraging pupils to become actively involved in decisions about their own learning and to empower them with appropriate ways to do this.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the project 92 pupils received both school- and university-based training. A team of academics, including the author of this article, ran a series of workshops at the university. These were designed to help pupils gain confidence in the variety of ways they can voice an opinion; run productive meetings; and have a rudimentary understanding of research methods and research ethics. Visits to the university raised the pupil voice initiative profile in the eyes of the pupils as well as ‘tick’ boxes for the SLT in terms of raising aspirations for university applications. Under the direction of the SLT, three ‘voices’ were created focusing on teaching and learning; behaviour and the school’s physical environment. In relation to these themes, members of the pupil voice body gathered data by observing teachers teach, canvassing pupils and interviewing members of the site and teaching staff. A pupil voice executive of 15 pupils was created representing the three ‘voices’ made up of one pupil from each year group. Based on the research data from the pupil voice body, the executive created three ‘charters’ associated with the three voices and these were displayed in all classrooms and corridors.</p>
<p>The second year of the project involved reflection and dissemination of the work carried out along with further development of the research skills (through workshops at the school and a day visit to the university) of the now hundred-strong pupil voice body. The success of the first year, as interpreted by the school SLT, was evident in the improvements in classroom behaviour and the fact that pupils were asked to talk at conferences and were invited to national and regional award ceremonies. This second year was crucial in moving forward the project, maintaining momentum both internationally and locally expanding the number of pupils involved. Initiatives that were instigated under the pupil voice project included a ‘Global Voice’ initiative set up under the guidance of teachers to explore developments in teaching and learning in schools in other countries and a ‘Community Voice’ initiative focused on the local area in which the school was located that brought together pupils, police, parents and local council members to improve relationships with these stakeholders.</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>This interpretive small-scale exploratory case study draws on established qualitative research methods associated with longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0892020612445685">Elliot et al., 2008</xref>) and conducted along strict ethical guidelines in relation to researching and working with school pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0892020612445685">Freeman and Mathison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020612445685">BERA, 2011</xref>). In consideration of the small sample size and the potentially sensitive nature of the data, all participants were given guaranteed confidentially and anonymity and it is for this reason that pseudonyms for institutions and individuals have been used.</p>
<p>The study presented here is part of a broader project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020612445685">Czerniawski et al., 2010</xref>) theoretically and methodologically framed by questions related to pupil voice at societal, institutional and individual levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0892020612445685">Layder, 1993</xref>). In addition to extensive field notes taken during the nine training sessions at the school and the university, data collection took the form of guided/semi-structured face-to-face interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48a-0892020612445685">Kvale, 1996</xref>) and focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0892020612445685">Krueger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0892020612445685">Morgan, 1998</xref>) with 32 pupils aged 12 to 16. Of the 32 pupils, 16 (9 girls and 7 boys) were involved in the pupil voice initiative at the school and 16 (10 boys and 6 girls) were not. Of the 16 pupils making up the purposive sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0892020612445685">Winne and Alexander, 2006</xref>) of those involved in pupil voice five members were from the executive body. Five experienced members of the teaching staff (three females and two males) were also interviewed including one member of the senior leadership team from the school.</p>
<p>The approach to data analysis adopted for this study owes much to the grounded theory tradition associated with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40a-0892020612445685">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref>. Through an iterative process of reading and re-reading the data, initial open coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0892020612445685">Strauss and Corbyn, 1990</xref>) forced the author to make analytic decisions about the data while selective/focused coding highlighted more frequently appearing initial codes to sort and conceptualise the data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10a-0892020612445685">Charmaz, 2000</xref>).

<p>As a researcher working in the field, I have been working closely with colleagues and pupils at this particular school over the duration of the project. I therefore acknowledge my positioning as a researcher and how this can operate as a filter affecting each and every stage of the research process. However, this has also placed me with a unique opportunity to critically engage and articulate with a knowledgeable and theoretically informed choice of methodology and method which is congruent with this inquiry while remaining both ‘contextually qualified’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020612445685">Brisard et al., 2007</xref>: 224) and ‘contextually sensitive’ (Crossley and Jarvis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020612445685">2001</xref>: 407) to the respondents who have contributed to this research.</p>

<title>The views of those involved in pupil voice</title>
<p>All but one of the pupils in this group (<italic>n</italic>=16) talked enthusiastically about pupil voice at their school and the openness of the leadership team to their ideas. For instance, some described how senior teachers ‘listened to what we had to say in meetings’, ‘took on board our suggestions’ and ‘gave us the opportunity to transform things we were unhappy about’. Pupil voice was described by these pupils variously as a ‘success’, a ‘triumph’, a ‘massive improvement on the old school council’ and ‘more than just chips and vending machines’. Several pupils identified the success of the project with the belief that they were, by their teachers, ‘really trusted’ to do research, attend meetings and offer suggestions to the SLT. Alanna (16 years old), for example, believed that the school ‘takes seriously most of our views that are put to them and we’ve seen some real changes and it’s nice to feel that level of respect’. Similarly, Rita (15) eagerly spoke about attending meetings with other staff members, how she felt ‘for the first time trusted’ and how ‘it felt really strange and very grown-up at first to be around a table with my teachers but they listened to what I had to say and it felt really good’.</p>
<p>There was a tendency for these pupils to position themselves and their peers differently depending on whether they felt they were involved with pupil voice (i.e. part of the 92-strong body) or not. Responses revealed that they positioned themselves and the rest of this group as ‘trustworthy’, ‘responsible’, ‘sensible’ or ‘good’ whilst they viewed those not involved as ‘bad’, ‘not interested’ or ‘too cool’. Reflecting how his membership of the pupil voice executive might be perceived by others, Martin (15) felt that ‘some [learners] are cynical and see us as the ‘good’ kids but I think they trust us and they tell us what they want’. This form of identity work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0892020612445685">Reay, 2009</xref>), apparent with many of these pupils, often reinforced the idea that those not involved in pupil voice were somehow lacking in the values and attributes required for school success. Discussions with teachers revealed that pupils involved in pupil voice tended to be ‘more popular’ with and ‘more trusted’ by teachers and pupils than those not taking part. This perception was reinforced by one senior teacher who described the input of members of the pupil voice executive as:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Extraordinary. It really has taken us aback at the sophistication of their ideas and the positive effect they are having on teaching and learning at the school and on the school environment. At times, it is hard to believe they are pupils and not young teachers.</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This likening of pupils involved in pupil voice to teachers was reinforced by another member of staff who identified some of their teaching suggestions as ‘straight out of a teaching text book’. Often those identified as more ‘heavily involved’ with pupil voice were seen as possessing values and attributes that conformed to dominant values associated with school success. These pupils were described as ‘possibly better students’ who ‘work hard’ and would be prepared ‘to do more for the school’ than other pupils. Furthermore, most pupils from this group believed that those on the executive body of pupil voice were ‘probably’ considered by pupils and staff to be either ‘gifted and talented’ and/or ‘good students’.</p>
<p>Juxtaposing this generally positive perception of pupil voice by those involved in it was resistance to the idea that pupil voice might marginalise some young people. When Nicola (14), for example, was asked whether or not she felt that all pupils have the same opportunities she had to get involved in pupil voice, she responded by saying that ‘there is nothing stopping anybody going for it’. Most believed that ‘systems were in place’ for all pupils to express their views that were transparent and ‘open to all’. Pupils involved in the pupil voice initiative viewed themselves as ‘representatives for the whole school’, ‘trusted’ by their teachers and classmates to ‘feedback any issues the class raised’ and ‘relied on’ to produce and generate ideas for the three school charters based on their research. When asked to what extent they felt that pupil voice at the school was fully ‘inclusive’, 14-year-old Tracey said that ‘all forms have their representative voice’ and ‘know who to go to so if they want to express something’. Similarly, Michael, 14, said that ‘the form vote, so your form knows how responsible you are, how sensible, how good you are at leading so they vote you in’. Findings indicated that the thought that many pupils might not opt to take part in pupil voice was not one that caused particular concern with Joanne (13), for example, saying that ‘in form times we get questions to ask the form and they get taken to the meetings and passed onto the executives…everyone can have their say, obviously the minority choose not to’. When asked who this ‘minority’ might be, Martin stated that ‘there will always be a minority that just don’t want to get involved, or they’re too shy, or they just don’t want to do it, because it’s not cool enough’. In general it was felt by these young people that the pupil voice systems ‘worked’ and included ‘those that wanted to be included’.</p>
<p>Only one pupil interviewed questioned the openness and transparency of pupil voice at his school. James, 16, critically questioned his own position within both the executive and the school after a trip to a school in Finland arranged under the ‘global voice’ initiative. Comparing the contrived distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0892020612445685">Stephens et al., 2004</xref>) he experiences in his English school (e.g. the English use ‘sir’/’miss’, the wearing of uniforms, etc.) with the comparatively ‘trusting’, ‘informal’, ‘friendly’ and ‘first name’-based relationships that he and his colleagues felt that Finnish teachers cultivated with their learners: ‘it made me think that something is not right here [in England], we talk about “relationships” with our teachers but what relationships do we actually have other than ensuring that we all look good together’. Reflecting on the benefits of the trip, James said that ‘I got back and started to really think about why I was allowed to go and not others [at his school] – it was like “oh <italic>he</italic> is good, <italic>he’s</italic> not going to fail the exams so he can go” and I don’t think that’s right – I mean – why me?’</p>
<p>Pupil identities are ‘social identities’ in that they are a fusion of both the individual identity of the pupil (the image of the pupil’s own achievements, characteristics and values) and a collective identity (the experience of being an integrated part of a group) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0892020612445685">Ulriksen, 1995</xref>). The collective identity of those involved in pupil voice, one grounded in the belief that they are considered, ‘good’, ‘trusted’ and ‘respected’, provided most of these pupils with a positive perception of the pupil voice project, enhanced by their own centrality to it. This centrality restricts their ability to identify that those who do not get involved could possibly have any reason other than lack of interest. A picture thus emerges of a group of young people, genuinely enthusiastic and committed to a pupil voice initiative, who are perceived to resemble ‘young teachers’ and who are firmly behind the structures in place that the school has initiated. It is also a picture of a group of pupils who appear unable to identify why some of their peers might feel jaded, alienated and let down by their experience of pupil voice.</p>

<sec id="section8-0892020612445685">
<title>The views of those not involved in pupil voice</title>
<p>Fielding and Rudduck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0892020612445685">2002</xref>) argue there are many ‘silent voices’, i.e. students who feel unable to comment without some sort of security framework to protect them from school hierarchies, whether from within the teaching body or the many types of pupil subcultures in the school. While, from the school’s point of view, and indeed that of those pupils involved in pupil voice, structures existed for all pupils to express, enact and engage with the initiative, most pupils in this group expressed feelings of marginalisation from the process. And while it was initially tempting to accept that these young people were not particularly bothered about being excluded from pupil voice this perception quickly evaporated once discussions opened up.</p>
<p>When these young people were asked to what extent they would have liked to have been involved in pupil voice, responses initially included ‘not interested’, ‘it’s a waste of time’ and in one case ‘what teacher would ever take <italic>me</italic> seriously?’ Scratching below the surface, however, revealed more complex reasons for this lack of engagement and adolescent vulnerability. For some, the more formal procedures associated with pupil voice (attending meetings, canvassing other pupils, feeding back to the class, etc.) engendered in them a sense of insecurity with what this might entail, expressed as feeling ‘too shy’, ‘awkward’ or ‘uncomfortable’ when dealing publicly with other pupils or teachers. One pupil said that she would be ‘too embarrassed in case I got it wrong’. The opinions expressed by those not involved in pupil voice are subtle, contradictory and at times subversive, yet they reveal a desire to be more fully involved while simultaneously revealing mistrust and frustration with the processes that accompany pupil voice.</p>
<p>For many the lack of engagement appeared rooted in the adolescent vulnerability and marginalisation they experienced with some of their peers and teachers. For instance, Sarah, 14, said that ‘it’s not that I’m not interested – there’s a lot that pisses me off about the school and I think I’ve got some ideas but I know that if I put myself forward people won’t vote for me’. Many felt there was ‘little point’ in joining pupil voice, with one pupil saying that ‘you just don’t think you are going to get voted’ and another adding that ‘people nominated themselves and then the rest of the form decided who they wanted’. In one focus group discussion Stephen (14) said that ‘because the good kids don’t really like to interact with kids that are not really as good as them, so they need someone like them to represent them’. On asking what ‘like them’ meant, suggested attributes included being ‘smart’, ‘confident’, ‘articulate’, ‘trusted’ and ‘popular’ with Beverley, 14, laughing saying ‘in other words not like us’. Much has been written about the ways in which certain forms of embodied cultural capital can legitimate existing power arrangements in institutions like schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020612445685">Bourdieu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0892020612445685">Dumais, 2002</xref>). Stephen and Beverley’s belief that those involved in pupil voice are ‘not like us’, carries with it an assumption that somehow their own habits, values and attributes exclude them from participation in pupil voice.</p>
<p>At times, criticism was directed at some teachers who, it was felt, ‘preferred some students to be involved and not others’. This general sense of frustration was captured by Shane, 14, recalling the first time pupil voice was mentioned in his form and how his teacher ‘told us all about the project and asked for volunteers and I knew I did not stand a chance, because some had already been told to volunteer’. The sense that some teachers were complicit conspirators in this exclusion process was reinforced by two teachers interviewed who clearly supported pupil voice but identified ‘curriculum pressures’ and ‘timetabling issues’ impeding the extent to which all pupils could be involved. One teacher admitted that ‘pupil voice eats into the time of those involved in it, staff and pupils, so it is true that I would not be happy about certain, perhaps more challenging pupils, those behind in work, etc. being involved’. Pupil voice representatives were not just viewed by this group as ‘more trusted’, and ‘more popular’ than those not involved, but also seen as ‘gatekeepers’ to the pupil voice executive and, by extension, the school leadership team. This ‘them and us’ situation was conveyed by Claire, 14, saying that:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Pupil voice doesn’t talk to other kids. If they</italic> [pupils involved in pupil voice] <italic>want the best for their students and the teachers they need to go around and talk to the different kids in the playground. At the moment they are only speaking to one side of the kids which is probably their friends. I don’t think the pupil voice asks around – like the other class of kids – like the bad kids…I’m not sure if they are afraid of them – or they don’t want to hear what they have to say.</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Talking about how she felt excluded from pupil voice Dionne (14) says that: ‘someone will have a really good idea but only three or four people will agree with it so it will get outvoted. I think the good kids only say what should be done and usually say what the teacher wants them to say’. She added that ‘if only teachers would talk to <italic>us</italic>, trust <italic>us </italic>in the same way that they seem to with those others’.</p>
<p>The strategies of displacing and ‘othering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0892020612445685">Nias, 1989</xref>) pupils that Claire and members of this group exhibit can be used to build up group identity and solidarity at an age when the identities of many teenagers are susceptible and fragile to the scrutiny of others, be they their peers or their teachers. However, in this case they are also susceptible to what they believe to be the relative ‘lack of trust’ they experience from members of the pupil voice body. It might however be equally argued that the trust experienced by those involved in pupil voice is a certain form of trust, one that is instrumental, contrived and one that is ultimately, synthetic.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The start of this article referred to two competing narratives embedded within the literature on pupil voice. The first related pupil voice to empowerment, democratic education, and transformation. The second positioned pupil voice as a policy technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445685">Ball, 2001</xref>), embodying tokenism, organisational efficiency and the enhanced competitive positioning of the school. In considering these narratives I offer two contrasting interpretations of the findings.</p>
<p>The first is the assumption that the pupil voice initiative at this school is inclusive and offers a representative democracy in miniature. This interpretation would see pupil voice offering access to any young person who is willing, keen, proactive, and perhaps more politically aware and therefore more likely to be involved in the sort of representative politics that pupil voice necessitates. Those young people involved in pupil voice experience trusting relationships with their peers and teachers and are respected for their insight into school improvement. The start of this article drew attention to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445685">Fielding’s (2001)</xref> belief that many pupil voice projects, such as the one this article examines, can act as a catalyst for change in schools including improvements to student−teacher relationships. The young people involved in pupil voice in this study believed they possessed trusting relationships with many of their teachers and pupils in East Valley. But then again, why would they question ‘trust’ as constructed, positioned and situated within an institutional setting and context they have been socialised into? Their perceptions of the trust experienced in their school are partially grounded within school-based structures, procedures and cultural values that, as the second account below suggests, obscure a ‘gulf in trust’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0892020612445685">Leitch and Mitchell, 2007</xref>) between some learners and teachers despite the rhetoric of pupil voice participation. This gulf reinforces the idea that those that avoid involvement do so of their own volition, lacking the ambition, values and attributes required to acquire and represent the ideas, values and aspirations of their peers. Agency is expressed by this group being ‘cool’ ‘not bothered’ and ‘not interested’.</p>
<p>The extent of this gulf in trust between some pupils and teachers is captured in a second, alternative interpretation of the findings in which pupil voice institutionally marginalises those voices that do not ‘fit’ an idealised and conservative understanding of what a successful school (and pupil) should be. This account posits those young people involved in pupil voice as trusted by their teachers to behave appropriately in their role, mirroring the professional values embedded within the school’s teaching body. Peers trust this group of young people because they know that teachers do and that they are held up as examples of responsible, trustworthy and good pupils. However, this perspective also draws attention to the unease and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0892020612445685">Willis, 1977</xref>) to pupil voice by those not involved who recognise and ‘get’ this second perspective in a way that those involved do not. For those not involved, pupil voice is part of a school system that excludes them from the synthetic trust experienced by their peers on the pupil voice body. The use of the adjective ‘synthetic’ posits this trust as contrived, instrumental, rational and to some extent, in the case of James, fragile. By reconsidering its synthetic form an altogether different picture emerges of those involved in pupil voice as an extension of the teaching body. ‘Mini-me’s who are trusted to think, behave and act as teachers might. Trust, in this sense, means that these pupils can be safely listened to and consulted because they toe the ‘party’ line, adhering to the ‘school norms of docile, conforming and diligent pupils’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020612445685">Arnot, 2003</xref>). Teachers and pupil voice together conspire (not necessarily consciously) to sideline those ‘not like them’, who are not asked their opinions, not elected, not ‘heard’. A resulting status quo is maintained with pupil voice bringing about acceptable rather than ‘transformational’ change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0892020612445685">Fielding, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Lodge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0892020612445685">2008</xref>) notes that there has been a shift in the 19th- and 20th-century ‘children should be seen and not heard’ perceptions of childhood compared to more child-centred discourses that exist in many private and public spheres. That said, in many schools, expectations about children are still shaped by an ‘ideology of immaturity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0892020612445685">Grace, 1995</xref>) that characterised both centuries. This ideology is based upon an outdated view of childhood in which school exclusion of many young people from the processes of dialogue and decision making fails to acknowledge young learners like Beverley and their capacity for resourcefulness, ingenuity, enterprise and an ability to reflect on issues affecting their education. Tensions exist between this ideology and more marketised, consumer-based ideologies in schools in which the pupil voice agenda, with its particular brand of synthetic trust, can fit albeit for more instrumentalist purposes. It would, however, be a tragedy if the <italic>zeitgeist</italic> devotion to pupil voice gets reduced to a ‘rhetoric of agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0892020612445685">Gunter and Thomson, 2007</xref>) associated with the second of the two narratives discussed at the start of this article, namely those that embody tokenism, instrumentalism and the enhanced competitive positioning of the school.</p>
<p>In current schooling contexts all professionals are said to have an ‘ethics of care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0892020612445685">Noddings, 1992</xref>) where trust forms the foundation for any ethical decision-making that the job entails. How this is worked through in terms of pupil voice and what it is to be a teacher or indeed, a pupil, is context-specific and culturally situated. If we are to move to the first narrative, one in which pupil voice becomes a powerful tool for transformational change, then this apartheid in trust must be removed through closer examination of the informal ways in which the voices of some become marginalised.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, a third narrative is needed that acknowledges the interplay between more idealised, democratic forms of pupil voice and the reality of schooling. Such a narrative would need to recognise the escalation of market forces in education internationally and acknowledge that many learners and teachers are ‘now working within a new value context in which image and impression management…are becoming as important as the educational process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445685">Ball, 2001</xref>: 13). However, for this narrative to gain prominence with all educational stakeholders, trust must be positioned at the heart of all pupil voice initiatives – a trust that is unbounded, reciprocal and philanthropic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0892020612445685">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is acknowledged that the provision of education is deeply influenced by the cultural context in which it is located, as well as by the economy and the political system responsible for educational policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45a-0892020612445685">Hayhoe, 2007</xref>). The data presented here are not intended to represent the perspectives of all pupils and teachers involved in pupil voice initiatives. However, this qualitative small-scale case study does serve useful and illuminative purposes identifying issues that have international significance, while recognising the specificity of context and setting when discussing the centrality of trust within all pupil voice initiatives.</p>
<p>As shown in the introduction to this article, pupil voice initiatives are being introduced in many countries including America, Australia, Brazil, Holland and Sweden. While drawing attention to the rise of pupil voice initiatives internationally, the article simultaneously acknowledges the existence of different forms of professional trust in different national locations. The findings, for example, drew attention to 16-year-old James’ experiences in Finland, and his changing perceptions of trusting relationships on his return to the low-trust and compliant education system within which his school was situated. It is true that pupil voice initiatives are performed, grappled with, mediated in hectic institutions where learners and teachers have, for the very best of intentions, competing commitments, pressures, priorities and values. It is also true that, taking an historical perspective, the pupil voice movement is contested, tentative, embryonic and culturally situated. But most pupil voice initiatives, such as the one that this case study examines, are collaborative and embrace the integrity and passion that many young learners and teachers bring to their work. Nevertheless, an understanding of how pupil voice initiatives might play out differently in different locations is severely limited without acknowledging, as this article does, the interplay between pupil voice, adolescent culture and the heterogeneity of trust.</p>
<p>For pupil voice initiatives to be effective and truly transformative, all communities of practice and social spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0892020612445685">Gee, 2000</xref>) in schools need to be ones in which authentic trust forms the cornerstone of all professional relationships and where language and all symbolic systems used are non-threatening. One possible indicator of this more authentic form of trust would be the embedding of pupil voice in the recruitment and preparation of those entering the teaching profession. While many schools (in England) involve students in recruitment procedures (e.g. young people on interview panels; observing micro-teaching), this practice is not widespread. Neither is there evidence to show that universities and schools involve pupils at interview stage when considering who should or should not be accepted on teacher education courses. Ensuring that school pupils are prominent at the start of teacher preparation courses would raise the importance of pupil voice in the eyes of future cohorts of trainee teachers and in their professional development. Schools are sites in which trust and respect should form the cornerstones of all teacher/student interactions. Without this, any claim that formal education is in some way, a preparation, enactment and rehearsal for democratic citizenship is disingenuous.</p>
