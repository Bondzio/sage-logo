<abstract>
<p>In recent years there have been several major changes to the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended the use of haemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> as a diagnostic marker of diabetes in 2011. HbA<sub>1C</sub> measurement has been standardised to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) methods and is now being reported in IFCC units. This recommended change was implemented in the UK from 1 June 2009, but is yet to be embraced internationally. We assessed the impact of these changes on the use of HbA<sub>1C</sub> and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in the primary care population. We found a decrease in OGTT tests requested/performed with a concurrent increase in the number of samples with HbA<sub>1C</sub> &lt; 48 mmol/mol (&lt; 6.5%) received in the laboratory. This changing practice of diabetes testing in our primary care antedates the WHO recommendation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glycated haemoglobin has long been the cornerstone of management, but not diagnosis, of patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474651413485879">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474651413485879">2</xref></sup> However, there have been a number of significant changes to the diagnosis of diabetes over the past few years. Firstly, in 2011, the WHO recommended the use of HbA<sub>1C</sub> as a diagnostic test of diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474651413485879">3</xref></sup> in an addendum to its initial WHO/IDF report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474651413485879">4</xref></sup> WHO recommended HbA<sub>1C</sub> ≥ 48 mmol/mol as the cut-off point for diagnosis of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474651413485879">3</xref></sup> The lack of need for any patient preparation (single non-fasting sample), less inconvenience to patients and the reduced day-to-day variability enhance the clinical utility of HbA<sub>1C</sub> over fasting glucose and conventional OGTT for the diagnosis of diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474651413485879">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474651413485879">4</xref></sup>. Until recently, the OGTT had been retained for the diagnosis of patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474651413485879">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, in 2009 there was a change in standardisation of HbA<sub>1C</sub> measurement from DCCT-aligned (NGSP) to IFCC methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474651413485879">5</xref></sup> and a subsequent change of units from DCCT (%) to IFCC (mmol/mol). This recommended change was implemented in the UK from 1 June 2009, but is yet to be embraced internationally. We aimed to assess the impact of these changes, and particularly the change in units, on the use of HbA<sub>1C</sub> and on the frequency of OGTT in our primary care.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was performed at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Our laboratory network serves an urban area (Leeds and Bradford) with an estimated population of 1.1 million. Retrospective data collection from the laboratory information management system was performed for the period, inclusive of, January 2010 to September 2012. All data on HbA<sub>1C</sub> analysis and OGTTs from primary care, during the specified period, were included in the study. HbA<sub>1C</sub> analysis was performed by ion exchange HPLC on Tosoh HLC-723 GHb GV (G8) (Tosoh Bioscience Ltd., Redditch, Worcestershire, UK). Over the study period, the assays performed well in internal and external quality assurance assessments. This study was approved by the Trust clinical audit department. Statistical analysis was performed using the Analyse-it statistical add-on package for Microsoft Excel.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 234,705 requests for HbA<sub>1C</sub> analysis and 12,985 requests for OGTT were performed during the period between January 2010 and September 2012. The laboratory HbA<sub>1C</sub> request rate increased by a median of 164 requests per month. The monthly HbA<sub>1C</sub> results steadily declined over the same period with a median HbA<sub>1C</sub> decrement of 0.35 mmol/mol per month, but with no significant trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474651413485879">Figure 1</xref>). There was an increase in HbA<sub>1C</sub> results in the non-diabetic range concurrent with a fall in OGTT requests. The number of samples with a value &lt; 48 mmol/mol had tripled (1106 to 3804) with a median rise of 81 requests per month and the number of OGTT requests reduced to 40% (599 to 244) over the study period. Over the same period the total number of HbA<sub>1C</sub> requests rose by a total of 2464 with a mean monthly increment of 77 requests. The number of increased tests over the study period (2464) was similar to the increase in tests within the non-diabetic range (2698).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We initially planned to audit if there was a deterioration in diabetes control illustrated by an increase in HbA<sub>1C</sub> values due to the change over of HbA<sub>1C</sub> units from % (DCCT aligned) to mmol/mol (IFCC standardised). This change was agreed at a national consensus meeting and the process of change included a period of dual reporting of HbA<sub>1C</sub> results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474651413485879">5</xref></sup> from June 2009 to September 2011 to allow clinicians to familiarise themselves with the new units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474651413485879">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474651413485879"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474651413485879">7</xref></sup> Deterioration in diabetes control was a perceived concern during the changeover period due to publication of a Swedish study by Hanas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474651413485879">8</xref></sup> This report showed significant changes in glycaemic control of diabetes patients, during a 9-year follow-up period when two calibration changes of HbA<sub>1C</sub> were made (a methodological change with calibration to the DCCT reference in 1992 and alignment to the Swedish National standard in 1997). It was hoped that the prolonged period of dual reporting and information sheets would inform patients and clinicians to prevent this deterioration. Unfortunately, our data cannot reveal information on this point as there was a steady fall in mean monthly HbA<sub>1C</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain the paradoxical fall in mean HbA<sub>1C</sub> concentrations, in the absence of any significant therapeutic advances in diabetes. Plausible explanations are (i) reimbursement of clinical diabetes services based on HbA<sub>1C</sub> measurements and (ii) a steady increase in the use of HbA<sub>1C</sub> in place of fasting glucose as a diagnostic test since 2009. We postulate the latter to be causal, as there was an increase in samples received with HbA<sub>1C</sub> in the non-diabetic range alongside a decline in the number of OGTT requests from primary care.</p>
<p>The analysis of our data does not provide information on the deterioration in glycaemic control as the data come from a routine laboratory database that does not record whether subjects have diabetes. We analysed another laboratory’s database linked to a diabetes register and noted that there was no apparent deterioration during the changeover period (Kilpatrick ES, Rigby AS, Atkin SL, Barth JH, unpublished communication). This would suggest that laboratory databases without clinical information can only be used to study test usage. The study of the clinical validity of tests may well be made easier with the growing use of electronic patient records.</p>
<p>In summary, we have studied the change in testing patterns for diabetes in primary care and noted a steady change in practice that is consistent with WHO (2011) recommendations for the use of HbA<sub>1C</sub> rather than glucose as a diagnostic test but which began at least two years earlier.</p>
