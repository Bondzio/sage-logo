<p>The Editorial Board of the <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</italic> is proud to announce that two articles published in the pages of this journal are to be the recipients of two 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) <italic>Adaptive Structures and Material Systems Best Paper Awards</italic>. Each year nominations are solicited from the members of the Adaptive Structures and Material Systems Technical Committee as well as nominations from the members at large. Nominated articles are drawn from any article published in 2011 in any peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings where the topical focus of the article was on adaptive structures and material systems. The two best paper awards—one in the area of <italic>Structural Dynamics and Control</italic> and one in the area of <italic>Mechanics and Materials Systems</italic><bold>—</bold>are reviewed by anonymous judging panels consisting of members of the Adaptive Structures and Material Systems Technical Committee as well as former Best Paper Award winners. Both <italic>Best Paper Awards</italic> were announced at the 2012 SPIE Smart Structures and Nondestructive Evaluation Symposium on 14 March 2012 in San Diego, California, USA.</p>
<p>The first award that was announced was the <italic>2012 ASME Adaptive Structures and Material Systems Best Paper Award in Structural Dynamics and Control</italic>:</p>
<p>Woods BKS, Kothera CS and Wereley NM (2011) Wind tunnel testing of a helicopter rotor trailing flap system via pneumatic artificial muscles. <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</italic> 22(13): 1513–1528. DOI: 10.1177/1045389X1142421.</p>
<p>The second award that was announced was the <italic>2012 ASME Adaptive Structures and Material Systems Best Paper Award in Mechanics and Material Systems</italic>:</p>
<p>Gao F and Weiland L (2011) Streaming potential hypothesis for ionic polymer transducers in sensing: roles of ionomer state and morphology. <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</italic> 22(14): 1623–1630. DOI: 10.1177/1045389X1140978.</p>
<p>The awards, consisting of a plaque and a check for US$500, will be presented at the ASME 2012 Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems Conference at the Evergreen Marriott Conference Resort in Stone Mountain, Georgia, USA, from 19 to 21 September 2012.</p>
<p>The Editorial Board congratulates and thanks all of the above authors, Benjamin KS Woods, Curt S Kothera, Norman M Wereley, Fei Gao, and Lisa Weiland, for their outstanding and award-winning contributions to the <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures!</italic></p>
