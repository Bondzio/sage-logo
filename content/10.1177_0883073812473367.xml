<p>“Comprehensive, authoritative information from the most respected experts: For 30 years, that is what <italic>Children with Disabilities </italic>has given thousands of students, faculty, and professionals who rely on it.” The publisher’s comments about this book are accurate. The authors have incorporated research and changes from the past 5 years in this new edition and drawn on experts in the field of disability, making <italic>Children with Disabilities </italic>the primary textbook for caregivers seeking the latest information in this field.</p>
<p>Recent studies in medical literature show that the prevalence of developmental disabilities is increasing, present in about 1 in every 6 children in the United States. Autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has also increased in the past 12 years. This highlights the increasing need for health, education, and social services for children with developmental disabilities, as well as a better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and the benefits of early intervention. The book fills this need by providing professionals working in this field with the necessary background to understand the different disabilities and management approaches available.</p>
<p>The book is geared toward students in a spectrum of disciplines as a medical textbook, addressing the effect of disabilities on the development and functioning of children. It is also intended to be a reference resource for professionals such as educators, therapists, and other health care professionals who provide care for children with disabilities. The authors hope this book will serve as a resource for families on the medical and rehabilitative aspects of care.</p>
<p>The style of writing is straightforward and well explained to be applicable to the reader. Each chapter begins with learning objectives, with the content of the chapter highlighted by a clinical vignette. The main points of the chapter are further reinforced by using tables and illustrations and each ends with a section reviewing the significant elements and material covered, followed by reference lists. Key terminology is defined in the glossary and there are 3 appendices: (1) syndromes and inborn errors of metabolism, (2) commonly used medications and their side effects, and (3) childhood disabilities services and organizations. The appendices are organized into categories, principal characteristics, and management implications. This aids in the development of global aspects for the care of the child and their family.</p>
<p>This edition has an expanded focus on professional, rehabilitative, and educational interventions as well as updated knowledge on advances in areas of education, science, and medicine since 2007, when the sixth edition was published. The authors have added 4 new chapters addressing long-term outcomes of developmental disabilities, novel therapies, treatment efficacy, and understanding and using neurocognitive assessments for diagnosing a child with developmental disabilities. There is an increased focus on interdisciplinary collaboration and addresses the upcoming <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</italic>, criteria.</p>
<p>This book is organized to guide readers through the breadth of content in this field. The chapters are grouped into 4 sections; section 1, “As Life Begins,” deals with what occurs perinatally and during and shortly after birth to cause a child to be at an increased risk for disabilities. The next section “The Developing Child” addresses the environmental causes and examines various organ systems. Section 3, “Developmental Disabilities,” provides comprehensive descriptions of various genetic syndromes and developmental disabilities. The final section, “Interventions, Families and Outcomes,” discusses ethical, legal, and emotional issues as well as transitions to adulthood. The section closes with prospects for providing health care in the 21st century. This edition includes online materials available for instructors to teach courses about developmental disabilities; customizable power points, illustrations, study questions, and case studies are also available.</p>
<p>The diagnostic process enables the clinician to answer 4 questions: (1) What is wrong with my child? (diagnosis); (2) What is going to happen? (natural history and progression); (3) What can be done to improve the condition? (treatment); and (4) What caused my child’s condition? (etiology). This provides the framework for clinicians to determine prognosis and guide treatment planning.</p>
<p>The authors take complex topics and break them down so that the concepts are thoroughly explained and conceptually illustrated by tables and figures. The discussion is applicable to clinicians and families alike and addresses issues from multiple points of view. <italic>Children with Disabilities</italic>, seventh edition, remains an invaluable resource covering the spectrum of developmental disorders and interventions. This latest edition continues as a must-have in the field of developmental disabilities.</p>
