<title>Fewer premature births following smoking ban in Scotland</title>
<p>According to researchers, there has been a 10% fall in Scotland’s premature birth rate since the country introduced a smoking ban in public places in 2006.</p>
<graphic id="img1-1757913912444036" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1757913912444036-img1.tif"/>
<p>Researchers analysed data for more than 700,000 women, looking at smoking and birth rates for all expectant mothers before and after the ban. The study spanned over 14 years. Fewer premature deaths is one of the benefits that has been linked to a smoke-free environment, along with reductions in heart disease and childhood asthma.</p>
<p>Smoking has been linked to poor foetal growth and placenta problems. However as Andy Cole, Chief Executive of Bliss said: “It is important to remember that the reasons a baby can be born premature or underweight are complicated and that smoking is just one risk factor”.</p>
<p>With any retrospective study it is impossible to rule out other factors and figures did suggest that premature birth rates were already falling in the months before the ban. Yet Dr Daniel Mackay said that their findings “add to the growing evidence of the wide-ranging health benefits of smoke-free legislation”.</p>

<title>Malaria kills more than previously thought</title>
<p>According to new findings, Malaria kills nearly 50% more people than was previously thought.</p>
<p>A report by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington claim that Malaria killed at least 1.2 million people worldwide in 2010. This is more than figures from Roll Back Malaria (RBM) who calculated deaths in 2009 at 781,000.</p>
<p>Researchers claim that the higher figure comes from more reliable and wider data. A technique called ‘verbal autopsy’ was used, which involves interviewing relatives of someone who has recently died in order to help determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>The research also found that more than 78,000 children aged between five and fourteen years and more than 445,000 aged fifteen and older died from malaria in 2010. Such results contrast the view that the majority of malaria deaths occur in children under five years.</p>
<p>Lead author of the study, Christopher Murray said: “You learn in medical school that people exposed to malaria as children develop immunity and rarely die from malaria as adults. What we have found in hospital records, death records, surveys and other sources show that just is not the case”.</p>
<p>Despite this new finding, deaths from malaria have been falling continuously since 2004. Between 2007 and 2010 there were 7% fewer deaths. Tanzania and Zambia have seen the sharpest decline of more than 30% between 2004 and 2010.</p>

<title>Councils to be rewarded for improving outcomes for children</title>
<p>A new government trial will see councils gain extra funds if they improve outcomes for children through their children’s centres.</p>
<p>This new payment-by-results trial will involve 26 councils in England and will measure them against a range of targets specifically designed to increase a child’s readiness for school. Councils who are able to get more mothers breastfeeding or narrow the gap in attainment between rich and poor children under five will all receive extra funds.</p>
<p>As part of this scheme, councils will also be asked to improve the skills of parents identified as needing extra support. If councils achieve their target the money will be paid on top of council’s Early Intervention Grant.</p>
<p>“High quality early years support could have a lasting impact on children’s lives”, Children’s Minister Sarah Teather said, “Our revised guidance makes clear that [local authorities] should concentrate on improving outcomes for some of the most disadvantaged young people and families”.</p>
<p>If the trial is successful then the scheme could be rolled out across England.</p>

<title>Child mental health programme to receive funding</title>
<p>A pioneering programme to give children with mental health problems access to the best available services will receive up to £22 million in funding.</p>
<p>The money will be invested in the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) project and will help expand state-of-the-art psychological therapies and extend training for those working with children outside of a health setting.</p>
<p>One in ten children aged between five and sixteen years have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem. The extra money will go a long way to help ensure early treatment of mental health disorders in children. Failure to treat mental illness early can have a devastating impact on a child’s future, and so it is important to be open about mental health from an early age.</p>
<p>Paul Burstow, Care Services Minister said: “This additional funding will help deliver services specific to young people. We’re working with young people and staff to start to change the way mental health is delivered by the NHS”.</p>

<title>Fear of cancer is killing thousands</title>
<p>Thousands of people in the UK are too scared to mention early symptoms of cancer to their doctor because they fear being diagnosed.</p>
<p>Cancer Research UK surveyed 2,000 people and 40% said that they might delay going to the doctor because they are worried about what they might find. This is particularly worrying given that early diagnosis is key to successful treatment.</p>
<p>Many respondents also do not recognise which symptoms could be cancer, with three-quarters failing to mention pain, coughing or bowel and bladder problems when asked to list possible symptoms. Two-thirds also failed to list bleeding as a possible warning sign.</p>
<p>Professor Peter Johnson from Cancer Research UK said: “Our report highlights just how much more we have to do to raise awareness about the early signs of cancer”.</p>

<title>Eat your ‘5-a day’ to get a healthy glow</title>
<p>Researchers at the University of St Andrews have found that eating fruit and vegetables could improve your skin colour.</p>
<p>Scientists from the University monitored the diet of 35 students over a six week period and analysed their skin tone before, during and after the test period. They found that those who ate more fruit and vegetables had more colouration in their skin.</p>
<p>It has already been established that carotenoids found in many types of fruit and vegetables can affect skin tone, but it is not clear how much a healthy diet can influence colour. The study is also not without limitations. Researchers studied mostly white students and the effect for older people was not considered. They also failed to take into account food preparation techniques which can affect carotenoid levels in food.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, any incentive to eat more fruit and vegetables can only be a good thing.</p>
