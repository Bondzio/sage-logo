<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Placement of peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters is a common and necessary procedure related to pediatric inpatient admissions. Most pediatric patients admitted to inpatient wards require PIV access for the administration of fluids, medications, or other intravenous therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811435164">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811435164">3</xref></sup> Although a relatively minor procedure, obtaining a PIV may result in anxiety and discomfort for the pediatric patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811435164">4</xref></sup> Cummings et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811435164">5</xref></sup> reported that disease-related pain, postoperative pain, and PIV line placements are the most common causes of pain in the hospital setting, and that PIVs are the second most frequent cause of the worst pain, exceeded only by disease-related pain. Although PIV placement is one of the most routine procedures in pediatric care, there are limited published data about this procedure. In the pediatric population, obtaining PIV access may be difficult and time consuming because of multiple potential issues, including smaller, less visible veins, lack of patient cooperation, and increased adiposity in infants relative to older children and adults. These potential compounding factors lead to pain and distress for the child and parents.</p>
<p>Peripheral intravenous catheters are often essential to the provision of important or critical therapies for the benefit of patients. Some patients require multiple time consuming attempts before successful placement is achieved. There is a strong need to better understand the determinants of these difficulties and delays in order to improve the care of children. Some potential determinants include age of the child, the experience of the operator, and the technical characteristics of the physical materials used in the process of placement. Some patients (eg, the obese and the chronically ill) present difficulty when hospital personnel attempt PIV access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435164">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811435164">9</xref></sup> The chronically ill patient often has an extended length of hospitalization and typically has fewer accessible veins because of vein scarring/sclerosis from multiple PIVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435164">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811435164">7</xref></sup> Juvin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811435164">8</xref></sup> found that PIV line placement was consistently more problematic in obese patients because of adipose tissue obscuring the veins. Studies of methods to simplify and facilitate the procedure or to decrease the loss rate of PIVs are needed. Improvement efforts might include increased training for those placing the IVs and efforts to mediate patient pain and patient and parent anxiety. Likewise, alternatives to PIV placement for fluid and medication administration should be investigated to assess potential benefits, such as a decrease in discomfort and the possibility for cost reductions because of decreased length of stay and improved utilization of professional staff. However, for studies of these modifications and alternative approaches to be successful, a clear understanding of the challenges to PIV access in the current pediatric care paradigm is necessary.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922811435164" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The research protocol for the study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Medical University of South Carolina and the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University. The study sites were 2 teaching hospitals: Medical University of South Carolina Children’s Hospital in Charleston, South Carolina and Brody School of Medicine in Greenville, North Carolina. Medical University of South Carolina Children’s Hospital is a 161-bed hospital which admits about 6 000 children annually. Brody School of Medicine is a 122-bed hospital admitting about 7300 children annually. PIVs on the floors are placed by unit nurses, and there are no IV teams at the institutions.</p>
<p>Over a 15-month period, 592 patients were recruited by research staff at the 2 participating sites. The patients were all on general pediatrics wards. Potential subjects were identified by registered nurses (RNs) on inpatient wards between 7<sc>am</sc> and 11<sc>pm</sc> on weekdays. Patients were considered eligible if they were younger than 19 years and required PIV access. The decision whether they required PIV access was made by the physician team caring for the patient independent of the research staff for patients meeting inclusion criteria. Consent to participate in the study was obtained from the parents or legal guardians by trained research staff. Assent was also obtained from patients who were able to give assent. Prior to beginning the study, the research staff was educated by RNs about obtaining PIV access and were shown the step-by-step procedure for implementing PIV access. This training allowed the research staff to consistently record the initiation of the PIV placement with application of the tourniquet, the number of attempted skin piercings, and successful completion of the PIV with flushing of the PIV.</p>
<p>Each individual skin piercing was defined as an attempt. A data collection tool was developed, and the following data were collected: age, gender, ethnicity, patient’s weight in kilograms, the total number of PIV attempts and procedural time. The procedural time was calculated from the time the RN first attempted to place the PIV until the RN successfully placed the PIV or until the decision was made to discontinue further attempts. The procedure was considered begun when the tourniquet was placed and ended with flushing of the catheter. The time interval was measured in minutes. Statistical analyses consisted of χ<sup>2</sup> for categorical data and Student’s <italic>t</italic> test for log transformed continuous data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 592 PIV catheter insertions were observed during the enrollment period, with 567 successful PIV placements (overall success rate 95.8%) and 25 unsuccessful placements. The subjects were majority male (55.9%), and the sample had racial/ethnic variation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811435164">Table 1</xref>). Age-groups were stratified as infant/toddler (age 0-2 years), preschool aged (age 3-5 years), school aged (age 6-11 years), and adolescent (age 12-18 years), with the infant/toddler group being the largest (50.7% of sample).</p>

<p>In all, 48% (272/592) of the PIVs were successfully placed on first attempt, whereas 137 (24.1%) additional patients had a PIV placed on the second attempt. Unsuccessful PIV attempts ranged from 1 to 9 piercings before a decision was made to discontinue further attempts. Whereas a single patient required 15 attempts before successful PIV placement, the range for the remaining patients was 1 to 9 piercings before successful PIV placement.

<p>Within the infant/toddler age group, 38.9% had a PIV successfully placed on the first attempt, whereas the first attempt success rate for the other age-groups was 52.0%, 58.5%, and 52.9%, respectively. Overall, 53.5% of the older children were successful on the first attempt. The difference between the infant/toddler group and the older children (combined) for first attempt success was significant (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic> = .0004).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study confirms several subjective impressions regarding IV placement in hospitalized children and adds new data about PIV success and time required among younger children. First, although nearly 50% of PIVs are successful on the first attempt, many children require multiple attempts for success. In addition, the likelihood of success on the first attempt is age related, with children younger than 2 years being far more likely to require multiple attempts for success, although the ultimate success for all age groups is similar. Likewise, it takes significantly longer to start PIVs in the younger children. These observations have significant implications for the care of children hospitalized on general pediatric wards. The frequent requirement for multiple attempts and prolonged efforts in younger children suggests that they may suffer from important delays in the initiation of important or life saving interventions. Younger children probably also suffer from greater stress and discomfort from the process of PIV placement as do their parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811435164">5</xref></sup> Many factors play into patient and parent satisfaction with a hospitalization, but procedures and how they are handled leave significant impressions on parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811435164">10</xref></sup> Most hospitals and hospitalist programs therefore have a vested interest in improving parent satisfaction with procedures, and PIV placement is the most common procedure in hospitalized children.</p>
<p>This study provides a descriptive report of the findings related to direct observation of PIV placement by trained research staff at 2 pediatric hospital facilities. As a 2-site study it may be considered somewhat more generalizable than single site reports. This is a large study, which includes success and failure rates, as well as careful, time-sensitive observations recorded for actual time needed to start PIVs in pediatric patients. A clear understanding of these issues related to PIV placement is key to an awareness of the skills needed and the resources required. In turn, this is important for the development of systematic improvements to PIV placement for fluid/medication administration.</p>
<p>The PIV placement success rates in our data are similar to those of other studies. Frey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811435164">11</xref></sup> reported a 44% success rate per stick in PIV placement with a range of 1 to 10 attempts and a mean procedure time of 20 minutes (range 2-90 minutes) per patient. Frey did not report the overall success rate per patient. A similar study indicated a 53% success rate of PIV placement on the first attempt with a 91% success rate within 4 attempts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811435164">12</xref></sup> These prior reports do not provide an age breakdown, which is an important new element in our study. However, it is likely that the younger ages in this study make direct comparison of overall success rates between studies difficult and may account for the different eventual success rates. Children younger than 2 years comprised fully half of our sample, and they have different first attempt success rates and procedure times from older children. Although our median time to successful placement was shorter than previously reported, we believe that one explanation is likely that procedure time was directly measured by observation by trained observers. In the Frey study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811435164">11</xref></sup> time was estimated by the person performing the procedure rather than directly observed by an independent observer. The time in our study was directly observed and may be more precise.</p>
<p>These observations help guide ideas for future quality improvement efforts in this area. Improvements in the PIV placement process can likely be made at multiple levels, including more aggressive avoidance of IV therapy when possible (such as using oral rehydration fluids for dehydration), improved training of unit personnel, institution of IV teams, and interventions to reduce pain and anxiety among patients and parents. In addition, newer approaches that use alternative methods for delivering resuscitation fluids and drugs may improve parenteral therapy success rates and allow for greater patient and parental satisfaction. Although we do not report in this article the level of training of persons attempting placement of PIVs, it is possible that improved training and experience, particularly for the care of younger children, might decrease the number of attempts necessary and the time to successful placement. In a prior report from this data set, nurse experience and nurse self-rated competence were positively correlated with success. In this analysis time of day and predicted difficulty of placement were stronger determinants of success than nurse experience. However, more experienced nurses were more likely to be involved in the third or later attempts, suggesting that there could be a stronger effect demonstrated for experience if first and second attempts were as likely to be attempted by experienced nurses as by less experienced ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811435164">13</xref></sup> In this study, PIVs were placed by registered nurses on general wards. Only 3.9% of all placements were performed by a specialty nurse and none by a physician, so we believe that our data represent the general pediatric inpatient approach to placing PIVs. Improved PIV hardware systems devised specifically for younger children might improve the ability to place PIVs in a timely and less stressful manner for these children. Since almost one half of all children have a successful placement on the first attempt in a very short time, it may be useful to focus quality improvement efforts on children who require more than one attempt for successful placement. Finally, it appears that there is considerable room and potential benefit in developing alternative methods of fluid and drug administration that do not require PIV placement. For instance, recombinant human hyaluronidase has been tested for its role in rehydrating children by subcutaneous infusions in emergency departments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811435164">14</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0009922811435164">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study does have limitations. As mentioned, the data were obtained from only 2 hospitals, but the subjects were varied by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and disease type/reason for admission. Patient recruitment was dependent on appropriate patient identification and referral to study personnel from the nursing staff. This could have introduced bias into the sample if a nurse did not refer a patient they considered a difficult stick. However, given the number of discrete patients, this bias should have been minimized. There was some concern by the nursing staff that they were being evaluated on their PIV attempts. The research staff reassured the nurses that no reports were being sent to nursing administration about a specific nurse’s performance level at starting PIVs. The nurses may have failed to refer patients when they were unwilling to wait for the research staff to arrive on the floor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922811435164" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, half of all children have a successful PIV placement on the first attempt. This study demonstrates that children younger than 2 years experience lower rates of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement, and the procedure takes longer in these younger children. We believe that focusing training and quality improvement efforts on PIV placement in younger children, as well as exploring alternative approaches to hydration and medication delivery can improve success rates for all children and potentially reduce nursing procedure time.</p>
