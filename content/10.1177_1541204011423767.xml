<abstract>
<p>This research combines social disorganization and self-control perspectives to understand personal victimization among youth. In doing so, several research questions are investigated to explore the independent and interactive influences on violent victimization risk. Using data from the Longitudinal Cohort Study in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN-LCS), results from several multivariate models show that, independent of various situational and lifestyle choices made by adolescents, low self-control increases the likelihood of violent victimization. Further analysis shows that this association varies across levels of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage; low self-control’s influence in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods dissipates while it is amplified for those living in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods. The implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Vulnerability to crime and violence is influenced by the context in which individuals reside, the activities they choose to engage in, and the individual characteristics that make them different from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011423767">Gibson, Morris, &amp; Beaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011423767">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011423767">Maimon &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011423767">Mayer &amp; Jencks, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011423767">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Raudenbush, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck, Wright, &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011423767">Sharkey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011423767">Rountree, Land, &amp; Miethe, 1994</xref>). Historically, situational and contextual theories have had the largest influence on understanding variation in personal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011423767">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011423767">Hindelang, Gottfredson, &amp; Garofalo, 1978</xref>). Ranging from lifestyle choices to the imposed structural conditions of neighborhoods, a primary focus in personal victimization research has been on how environments encountered by people can put them at risk of victimization, and more specifically expose them to situations where offenders are more proximate. On the other hand, studies show that individual traits increase individual risk of being victimized. In particular, low self-control—defined as the likelihood that individuals will consider the short- and long-term consequences of their actions in pursuit of self-gratifying behavior—is a trait that has been shown to influence victimization risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck, 1999</xref>). These antecedents of personal victimization have largely been independently explored and research has often neglected how the two may be integrated to better understand victimization risk.</p>
<p>Commonly defined by high rates of poverty, residential turnover, and ethnic heterogeneity, socially disorganized neighborhoods are contexts with structural and social characteristics that make personal vulnerabilities to crime heightened. For instance, researchers have observed that neighborhoods with more unemployment, lager numbers of residents living below the poverty line, and heightened residential mobility are often plagued with high rates of crime and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011423767">Sampson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1541204011423767">Shaw &amp; McKay, 1942</xref>). Such neighborhoods often have limited means to informally control crime, subcultural values that often condone violence, residents who are less likely to trust one another, and residents who have a lesser sense of cohesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011423767">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). The structural and social disadvantages, combined with fear of retaliation in high crime areas, can make it less likely that residents will intervene for the common good of their community when disorder and criminal activity arise. Further, their lack of organization makes it more difficult to obtain outside resources that can reduce crime-related problems. Not only is crime more concentrated in such neighborhoods, research also shows that children and adolescents growing up in these contexts are at increased risk of exhibiting aggressive tendencies, delinquency, and involvement in serious criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204011423767">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011423767">2003</xref>). Impoverished neighborhoods that face such social challenges make it more likely that residents will encounter motivated offenders which in turn increase their risk of personal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011423767">Sampson &amp; Wooldredge, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Until recently, individual differences as explanations for understanding variation in personal victimization have often taken a back seat to situational and contextual theories. Although early research did focus on demographic characteristics as indicators of vulnerability to victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011423767">Von Henting, 1941</xref>), it was not until the last decade that we witnessed an increase in studies focused on traits that make individuals more vulnerable to crime and violence, specifically personal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011423767">Higgins, Jennings, Tewksbury, &amp; Gibson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>). One of the first studies was by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck (1999)</xref> who developed a theoretical argument as to why those who are deficient in self-control are more likely to be victims. Since that initial study, several studies have consistently found that those possessing lower self-control are not only more likely to be victims but also more likely to be repeatedly victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011423767">Higgins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011423767">Schreck, Stewart, &amp; Fisher, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Combining neighborhood-level and longitudinal data collected from youth in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), the current study merges these two perspectives—which have often been investigated as separate explanations—to illuminate how neighborhood context and individual differences in self-control shape personal victimization. Using multiple frameworks that hypothesize the dominance of social context and the interaction between neighborhood structure and individual differences, this study shows how self-control’s influence on violent victimization is dependent on the structural aspects of neighborhoods in which adolescents live. First, I briefly review studies that have investigated neighborhood influences on crime and victimization. Second, self-control theory is reviewed as it relates to personal victimization and studies that have found support for this link are summarized. Finally, I discuss the significance of the current study by merging these two perspectives to articulate reasons for why these correlates of victimization may interact to explain personal victimization.</p>

<title>Neighborhood Context and Personal Victimization</title>
<p>It is established that crime and violence tend to be concentrated in disadvantaged urban areas. That is, compared to other neighborhoods those with elevated rates of poverty, residential turnover, and ethnic heterogeneity often experience more crime, and those living in them are at an increased vulnerability for becoming victims of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011423767">Rountree et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011423767">Sampson &amp; Wooldredge, 1987</xref>; Smith &amp; Jarjoura, 1989). Known for their landmark study on social organization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1541204011423767">Shaw and McKay (1942)</xref> were some of the first to observe such patterns in various geographical areas of Chicago, and the same patterns of relationships were observed over a decade later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). Shaw and McKay theoretically explain the mechanisms driving the links between poverty and crime as a break down in a neighborhood’s ability to organize and socially control criminal activity and disorderly conduct, and not because of differences between individuals residing in them.</p>
<p>Several scholars have empirically extended Shaw and McKay’s research by measuring intervening mechanisms that offer explanations for why residents in disorganized neighborhoods are less capable of controlling crime. Factors such as weak interpersonal networks, inadequate informal social control, subcultural and competition models that condone and encourage violence, and mistrust among neighbors all have been studied as mechanisms that are important for explaining the connection between structural disadvantage and neighborhood crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011423767">Kornhauser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011423767">Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989</xref>; Smith &amp; Jarjoura, 1989). For instance, stable residency in a neighborhood can promote friendships with other residents as well as the discovery of common interests and values.</p>
<p>A recent extension of social disorganization identified the relationships that may promote order and consequentially lead to less vulnerability to crime and violence, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al. (1997)</xref> coined as “collective efficacy.” Collective efficacy is the willingness of residents within neighborhoods to exercise informal social control in situations of disorderly conduct (e.g., kids loitering outside while truant, painting graffiti) and to intervene for the common good of their neighborhood, coupled with trust and cohesion among neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011423767">Sampson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al. (1997)</xref> were the first to show the influence of neighborhood collective efficacy on violence reduction. Using data from the PHDCN, they found that collective efficacy mediated neighborhood structural influences, such as concentrated disadvantage and residential stability, on neighborhood violence. Children living in areas of high collective efficacy are less likely to engage in violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011423767">Berg &amp; Loeber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011423767">Maimon &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 2005</xref>). In sum, neighborhoods have higher concentrations of crime, violence, and adverse outcomes for children and adolescents when residents do not trust one another, are less willing to work together for the common good of their neighborhood, and when subcultural values are dominated by unconventional values where competition for respect among individuals often results in crime and violence.</p>
<p>Being that violent offending and victimization are strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011423767">Berg &amp; Loeber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011423767">Hindelang et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011423767">Lauritsen, Sampson, &amp; Laub, 1991</xref>), it comes as no surprise that neighborhood structural and social factors are also related to violent victimization risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011423767">Berg &amp; Loeber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011423767">Lauritsen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011423767">Sampson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011423767">Sampson &amp; Wooldredge, 1987</xref>). Research shows that—independent of demographic characteristics—neighborhood poverty, residential mobility, and family structure increase the risk of personal victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011423767">Lauritsen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011423767">Miethe &amp; McDowall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011423767">Sampson, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011423767">1985</xref>). With a desire to explain community variation in victimization, researchers have integrated the routine activity and lifestyles perspectives with social disorganization and collective efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011423767">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011423767">Wilcox, Land, &amp; Hunt, 2003</xref>). Clearly, community social control and collective efficacy intersect with the routine activity concept of guardianship. Marcus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011423767">Felson (1998)</xref> noticed that the most effective guardianship is informal, where the presence of others deters victimization (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011423767">Felson, 1986</xref>). This is especially true since formal agents of social control (e.g., the police) only infrequently appear in citizens’ lives; routine guardianship must therefore result from informal control. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011423767">Lee (2000</xref>, p. 687) stated, guardianship exists within “the constellation of networks and social interactions with other individuals and groups external to the individual.”</p>
<p>Using data from the PHDCN, the British Crime Survey (BCS), and the Seattle phone survey, researchers have scrutinized the joint contribution of individual and neighborhood-level risk factors for victimization. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011423767">Sampson and Wooldredge (1987)</xref> used data from the BCS and found that while lifestyles of adults (e.g., living alone or frequent out-of-home activity) influenced violent victimization risk, aggregated neighborhood factors independently influenced victimization risk. Specifically, contextual factors including family disruption, social cohesion, and the amount of activity on neighborhood streets all had significant associations with risk of being robbed. More recent work in a variety of contexts shows similar results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011423767">Fisher, Sloan, Cullen, &amp; Lu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011423767">Kennedy &amp; Forde, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011423767">Miethe &amp; McDowall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1541204011423767">Thompson &amp; Fisher, 1996</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011423767">Miethe and McDowall (1993)</xref> used data from the Seattle phone survey and found that people living in poorer and busier neighborhoods were at risk of being victims of stranger violence. In a reanalysis of the Seattle data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011423767">Rountree et al. (1994)</xref>, used a multilevel model that accounted for the fact that community residents are not randomly assigned to neighborhoods and found similar findings; that is, risk of victimization varied significantly across neighborhoods and victimization was influenced by contextual variables including density, disorder, and ethnic heterogeneity. Indeed, neighborhood variables appeared to determine how effective individual protective behaviors were. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al. (1997)</xref> found that risk of violence among residents was reduced in higher collective efficacy neighborhoods in Chicago. Taken together, there is impressive consistency in the results that link community characteristics to personal victimization, especially when one considers the variety of contexts examined.</p>
<p>Studies conducted to date on the influence of neighborhood conditions on personal victimization share some noteworthy limitations. First, they have largely used adult samples, leaving less knowledge of how neighborhoods influence personal victimization among adolescents. This is an important area of research because individuals at most risk of becoming victims of violence are adolescents. Second, although relationships were found between neighborhood conditions and personal victimization independent of individual characteristics, most studies linking neighborhoods and personal victimization rarely go beyond incorporating individual-level demographic and lifestyle characteristics that distinguish between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011423767">Berg &amp; Loeber, 2011</xref>). This makes it unclear what other theoretically derived individual-level risk factors play in (e.g., low self-control), understanding neighborhood contextual influences on victimization experiences. Finally, given the limited attention to neighborhoods and personal victimization among adolescents, this initial study focuses on the intersection of neighborhood structural characteristics—commonly used in the social disorganization literature—and individual differences between adolescents to better understand their personal victimization.</p>

<title>Self-Control, Lifestyles, and Personal Victimization</title>
<p>Gottfredson and Hirschi’s general theory (aka, self-control theory) is one of the most tested theories of crime, violence, and deviant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011423767">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2000</xref>). Their theory is premised on a trait—self-control—that is allegedly formed early in life due to parental socialization and disciplining practices, which once formed remains relatively stable over the life course. Those who possess lower self-control are likely to gravitate toward activities that bring short-term pleasures, yet can have negative long-term and contemporaneous consequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> argued that the decision not to consider the long-term consequences of one’s own behavior in the pursuit of self-gratifying pleasurable acts is indicative of characteristics such as the inability to delay gratification, risk taking and impulsivity, a lack of diligence in working toward goals, low tolerance for frustration, and a preference for physical rather than cognitive tasks. Their theory was meant to reach further than simply explaining involvement in crime and violence, and it is argued that children and adolescents with low self-control are more at risk for a host of additional negative outcomes including poor health and disease, accidents, broken relationships, poor educational attainment, unstable employment, and substance use to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011423767">Moffitt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011423767">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2000</xref>). In fact, the interest in self-control and its consequences for social and behavioral outcomes binds several academic disciplines ranging from the link between low self-control and brain function studied by neuroscientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011423767">Eslinger, Flaherty-Craig, &amp; Benton, 2004</xref>); the hereditary underpinnings of low self-control studied by geneticists and biosocial criminologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011423767">Beaver, Wright, DeLisi, &amp; Vaughn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011423767">Bouchard, 2004</xref>); and psychologists who focus on ways to improve self-control among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011423767">Kochanska, Coy, &amp; Murray, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck (1999)</xref> was one of the first to recognize that Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory is also applicable to personal victimization. He observed that self-control theory is compatible with situational theories of victimization by theoretically describing how those with lower self-control make decisions about their lifestyles and have personal characteristics that make them highly vulnerable to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>). For instance, it is likely that low self-control individuals will have more grievances against them because they are more aggressive and have aversive personal styles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204011423767">Felson (1984)</xref> found that most physical assaults took place when aggrieved parties attacked the person who had injured them, and this pattern appears often in the violence literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011423767">Jacobs &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>). With respect to property victimization, the tendency to lack foresight works against efforts at self-protection as well, since self-protection entails at least some inconvenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck, 1999</xref>). Further, characteristics such as impulsivity and risk seeking can lead individuals into situations that put them in closer proximity to offenders and situations that more generally come with a higher risk of being victimized.</p>
<p>Employing various samples, methods, and data collection techniques, recent research by Schreck and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011423767">Higgins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011423767">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011423767">Stewart, Elifson, &amp; Sterk, 2004</xref>) has consistently confirmed that those who have lower self-control are at increased risk of victimization. Also, this research has shown that self-control influences victimization independently of lifestyles and other risk factors such as peers, indicating that the presence of self-control can independently make a situation safer while low self-control can worsen personal safety and one’s possessions in otherwise harmless situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011423767">Stewart et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to research showing that low self-control has influences on trajectories of violent victimization, at least one study indicates that low self-control individuals who are victims are unlikely to change their routines that may protect them from future victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>It has been established that neighborhood structural conditions and individual differences in low self-control can independently influence adolescents’ vulnerability to crime. At present, the role of low self-control as a facilitator of personal victimization vis-à-vis imposed neighborhood structural factors is unknown. That is, does the risk of personal victimization depend on both or do they each have independent influences? The importance of the current study is then to understand how neighborhood structure and individual differences in low self-control jointly shape violent victimization risk.</p>
<p>Although not specifically focusing on victimization, several perspectives have been articulated to predict how context and traits will interact to shape behavior. First, intended for understanding biosocial phenomena, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011423767">Raine (1988</xref>, 2002) proposed a “social push” perspective to discuss the interplay between social environments and traits for understanding how biologically related variables influence antisocial outcomes. His notion of “social push” is consistent with the idea that environments can be “weak” or “strong.” Particularly important for the current study is the idea of a “strong” environment, which is a context that purportedly minimizes the influence of individual differences because of the strong pressures to behave in certain ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204011423767">Lynam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011423767">Mischel, 1977</xref>). Disadvantaged neighborhoods are one context identified by researchers as a strong environment; they are contexts where normative cultures are more likely to strongly influence the behavior of people, especially antisocial and violent behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson’s (1999)</xref> qualitative work on the code of the streets in urban, impoverished neighborhoods exemplifies the notion of strong social environments in that even kids who come from what he coined as decent families must adopt the street code to gain respect among their neighborhood peers to avoid future vulnerabilities to criminal violence. In such strong neighborhood contexts, it has been argued that individual differences among adolescents may not matter much at all because of the social pressures that are present. On the other hand, weak environments are those where the influence of individual differences in traits will have more pronounced impacts on behavior because of the indefinite nature of the social contexts, which may lack pressures to engage in antisocial and criminal activities. In these environments, adolescent’s behaviors are less dictated by environmental social pressures and more likely to be influenced by individual differences. From a neighborhood perspective, and for the purpose of the current study, such a context is the least disadvantaged neighborhoods that, in comparison to others, have less social pressures for adolescents to engage in crime, consequently leading to a reduced threat of victimization regardless of individual differences between adolescents.</p>
<p>Second, Gottfredson and Hirschi would likely argue that neighborhood factors and influences are to a substantial degree determined by self-selection into neighborhoods. For instance, those with low self-control would be unable to hold work that paid well and therefore would, absent other sources of support, drift toward disadvantaged neighborhoods, thus increasing the potential number of prospective offenders in the area. Those with low self-control might have friends, but their ties with others are likely of low quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>). To them, neighborhood disorganization and vulnerability to crime in the area would be largely a by-product of an excess of residents with low self-control. It might follow that any connection between neighborhood structure and victimization should be spurious due to an excess of residents with low self-control living in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Third, neighborhood contextual variables may moderate the relationship between low self-control and victimization. As discussed earlier, many studies have linked neighborhood structural conditions to victimization risk. Disadvantaged neighborhoods may increase vulnerability to crime among individuals due to a lack of collective efficacy and/or informal social control that may increase the concentration of crime in a neighborhood and, consequently, their proximity to offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). Further, subcultural norms in such neighborhoods may condone violence as an acceptable means for handling grievances and/or confrontations with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson, 1999</xref>). These conditions can lead individuals with low self-control to be especially vulnerable to crime because they are likely to find themselves in situations with lower social control and socializing with delinquent peers. Further, such individuals have temperaments that make them more susceptible to grievances and this type of personal style combined with living in neighborhoods where violence is often used as a means for dealing with confrontation and gaining respect can make the risk of violence against them amplified. On the other hand, individuals possessing more self-control may have a lowered risk of becoming a victim in disadvantaged neighborhoods because they may have a heightened sensitivity to neighborhood dangers and try to make sure they avoid situations and people that would otherwise put them at elevated risk of personal victimization. They will likely consider the potential consequences of their actions; in this case, it would be the real threat of becoming a victim of violence. Further, in view of the fact that those with high self-control will act in ways that are less likely to provoke others, as well as be cognizant of the necessity of protective behaviors, then it would seem to follow that high self-control youth living in high-risk environments may have reduced risk of becoming victims because they are more sensitive to the environmental risks.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data from the 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts from the PHDCN-LCS—an interdisciplinary study on how the contexts in which children and adolescents reside contribute to their behavior and psychological development—were analyzed to test hypotheses in the current study. Violent victimization is predicted using individual-level predictors from Waves 1 and 2 of the LCS. Additionally, 1990 U.S. Census data were used to measure neighborhood-level structure of the 80 neighborhood clusters (NCs), that is, aggregations of 1–3 census tracts. Through combining data from the LCS and the 1990 U.S. census, the PHDCN is appropriate for assessing the influence and intersection between neighborhood and individual-level factors on violent victimization experiences among children and adolescents. A wealth of neighborhood structural, organizational, and social process measures exist that have been validated over time, making the PHDCN a unique study on neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011423767">Raudenbush &amp; Sampson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1541204011423767">
<title>Data and Sampling</title>
<p>The PHDCN was implemented in 1995 to collect quality data on the neighborhood contexts in which children and adolescents develop. The sampling design of the PHDCN contains two components: selection of NCs and selection of children and their primary caregivers for the longitudinal study. The 865 Chicago census tracts were combined to create 343 homogenous NCs, which were combined based on census tract similarities such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic conditions, family structure, and other geographical boundaries such as railroad tracks and parks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). NCs averaged approximately 8,000 people each<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1541204011423767">1</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). The 343 NCs were stratified by seven racial and ethnic categories and three categories of socioeconomic status (SES), that is, high, medium, and low. With the goals of achieving a balanced design and to minimize confounding between SES and race/ethnicity, a sample of 80 NCs was selected from within the strata of 343 NCs for the PHDCN-LCS. With few exceptions, the 80 sampled NCs were representative of the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomically diverse Chicago neighborhoods<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1541204011423767">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011423767">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Earls, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the 80 NCs, approximately 6,500 children, adolescents, and their primary caregivers were randomly selected. Starting with a random selection of block groups within NCs, a list of dwellings was compiled and household members were enumerated. In total, approximately 40,000 dwellings were screened. Study recruitment consisted of infants, children, adolescents (including 18-year-olds) and their primary caregivers. For selection, subjects had to be within approximately 6 months of the following age categories: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years. Extensive interviews were conducted with these children and their primary caregivers over three waves of data collection spaced approximately 2.5 years apart. The longitudinal study began in 1995; the second wave of data collection occurred between 1997 and 1999; and the third wave of data was collected between 2000 and 2001. This effort resulted in seven cohorts that span a period of development between infancy and early to mid adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1541204011423767">3</xref></sup>

<title>Low self-control</title>
<p>Following past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011423767">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011423767">Gibson, Sullivan, Jones, &amp; Piquero, 2010</xref>), a 17-item measure of behavioral indicators of low self-control was constructed using the Emotionality, Activity, Sociability, and Impulsivity Temperament Survey (EASI)-temperament instrument. Administered during Wave 1 interviews, primary caregivers were asked to report on their children’s inhibitory control, decision making, risk and sensation seeking, and diligence or persistence in completing tasks (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011423767">Buss &amp; Plomin, 1975</xref>), which are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990)</xref> definition of self-control as well as past empirical research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011423767">Grasmick, Tittle, Bursik, &amp; Arneklev, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1541204011423767">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Reflecting what Gottfredson and Hirschi call impulsivity, inhibitory control reflects the inability to delay gratification and control frustrations, such as trouble controlling impulses and having problems with resisting temptations. Items measuring decision time measure the (in)ability to delay decision making until alternatives can be seriously considered including saying the first thing that comes into one’s head, trouble making up my mind, and acting on the spur of the moment. Taken together, inhibitory control and decision time reflect what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> refer to as impulsivity, a main component of low self-control. Sensation seeking, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> refer to as risk seeking, reflects a preference for novel stimuli, such as seeking new and exciting experiences, doing “crazy” things, and willingness to try anything. Persistence, or diligence as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> call it, is the likelihood that a child will complete or follow through with tasks they start. Children with low self-control are often the first to initiate a task, but also the first to abort them, especially when it does not involve immediate gratification.</p>
<p>For each subject, item responses were summed and standardized (α = .68). More positive scores indicate lower self-control; whereas more negative scores indicate higher self-control. Other studies using the PHDCN also find this measure to be reliable (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011423767">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011423767">2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Parenting measures</title>
<p>Parenting has been implicated in the development of self-control, as a social control mechanism for decreasing the likelihood of misbehavior, and has been associated with adolescent victimization. Parenting measures were taken from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011423767">Caldwell &amp; Bradley, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011423767">Leventhal, Selner-O’Hagan, Brooks-Gunns, Bingenheimer, &amp; Earls, 2004</xref>). This inventory is generally designed to measure the quantity and quality of stimulation in a child’s home environment from primary caregivers.</p>
<p>Parental sensitivity and responsiveness is one domain of parenting measured by the HOME, which consists of parental warmth and parental lack of hostility (and punitiveness). Derived from observations of primary caregivers and children during the in-home interviews at Wave 1, the parental warmth measure consists of 9 items. Likewise, parental lack of hostility consists of several observations that interviewers recorded during the in-home interviews. Reflecting a primary caregiver’s knowledge of their child’s whereabouts, familiarity with child’s friends, and rules surrounding curfews and activities with friends, the parental supervision measure is a 13-item scale of how primary caregivers directly and indirectly monitor and supervise their children.

<p>Similar to prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011423767">Maimon &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011423767">Osgood &amp; Haynie, 2005</xref>) <italic>peer delinquency</italic> is measured using 11 items from the Deviance of Peers instrument administered at Wave 1 to children and adolescents to obtain information regarding the quantity of their peers engaging in a variety of delinquent behaviors (see Appendix B for individual items). For example, respondents were asked “during the past year, how many of the people you spend time with” have “stolen something worth more than $5 but less than $500,” “gone into or tried to do into a building to steal something,” “hit someone with the idea of hurting them,” and “attacked someone with a weapon with the idea of seriously hurting them.” Responses to questions ranged from 1 (<italic>none of them</italic>) to 3 (<italic>all of them</italic>). The measure was standardized (α = .81) and higher scores indicate having a larger quantity of delinquent peers.</p>
<p>Prior <italic>violent offending</italic> behavior is included because the robust relationship between offenders and victims and the evidence that shows low self-control is related to both violent offending and victimization. During the first wave of data collection, children and adolescents were asked to self-report their involvement in a variety of criminal and serious delinquent acts. Seven questions that asked about violence are used to create a dichotomous measure indicating whether a respondent ever engaged in at least one violent offense. For instance, violent offending items include items such as “have you ever:” “attacked someone with a weapon,” “used a weapon or force to get money or things from people,” “been involved in a gang fight in which someone was hurt of threatened with harm,” and “thrown objects, such as rock or bottles, at people.” Those reporting at least one of violent offense were coded as 1 and those reporting none of the violent offenses are coded 0. Of the analysis sample, 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 623) reported engaging in at least one of the violent offenses.</p>
<p>
<italic>Unstructured socializing with peers</italic> is also included as a control because past research shows that it is related to delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011423767">Osgood, Wilson, O’Mally, Bachman, &amp; Johnston, 1996</xref>), and such lifestyles more generally have been linked to victimization risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>).

Originally created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011423767">Sampson et al.

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The analysis will proceed in several steps for testing hypotheses regarding neighborhood structure, low self-control, and violent victimization. First, bivariate comparisons are made for victim and nonviolence victims to determine the demographic and theoretically derived characteristics that distinguish the two groups. Second, a series of multivariate logistics regression models are estimated to determine the direct influence of neighborhood structure and low self-control on violent victimization. Third, additional multivariate logistic regression models are estimated to determine whether the influence of low self-control on violent victimization varies as a function of the level of neighborhood disadvantage in which adolescents reside. Finally, conditional predicted probabilities are estimated to allow a better visualization of the association between low self-control and violent victimization in the least and most disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>

<title>Differences Between Victims and Nonvictims of Violence</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204011423767">Table 1</xref> shows comparisons between subjects who self-reported at least one violent victimization to those not reporting a violent victimization 12 months prior to Wave 2 on demographic characteristics, family/parenting variables, behavioral and lifestyle variables. First, a significantly large percentage of males reported being victimized compared to females; of those who were victims, 57% were males and of those who were nonvictims, 47% were males. On average, victims of violence were significantly older than nonvictims; victims had a mean age of 12.55 at Wave 1 whereas nonvictims’ average age was 11.705. Respondents who were victims of violence were also more likely to be from single-parent household where the primary caregiver is typically the biological mother, 29.5% of victims compared to 20.2% of nonvictims. Black and Hispanic youth were significantly more likely to be victims of violence, but Whites were no more likely to be a victim than others. Second, child and adolescent victims of violence, on average, had significantly less family support and warmth from their primary caregiver compared to nonvictims, yet no significant differences were observed for average levels of supervision and hostility from their primary caregivers. Third, several significant differences were found between victims and nonvictims for lifestyle, situational, and behavioral characteristics. Victims of violence were significantly more likely to report engaging in violent offending at Wave 1; 33% reported engaging in at least one of the violent offenses in their lifetime. Victims of violence also reported having significantly more delinquent peers and spending more time in unstructured activities with peers. Fourth, victims of violence, on average, have significantly lower self-control compared to nonvictims; victims, on average, have .217 standard deviational units greater than the mean, whereas nonvictims, on average, have .097 standard deviational units below the mean. Finally, victims were not significantly more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods compared to nonvictims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1541204011423767">10</xref></sup>

<title>Multivariate Analysis Predicting Violent Victimization</title>
<p>To first address the hypothesis that violent victimization is more likely among those living in more structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods, a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM) was estimated. Although not reported, results showed that while a positive relationship was observed between concentrated disadvantage and violent victimization, this relationship was not statistically significant. This analysis confirms the bivariate comparison that neighborhood structural disadvantage did not have a direct, statistically significant influence on violent victimization at Wave 2 among adolescents.</p>

<p>Model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011423767">Table 2</xref> shows a full model that includes demographic characteristics, family and parenting variables, low self-control, and behavioral and lifestyle characteristics. Delinquent peers, self-reported violent offending, and unstructured time spent with peers each have independent significant associations with violent victimization. Youth who have a larger portion of their friends that engage in delinquent activities are more likely to report being violently victimized (OR = 1.196; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Those reporting that they have committed at least one violent offense in their lifetime at Wave 1 were also more likely to have reported a violent victimization compared to their nonviolent counterparts. Unstructured time spent with peers also has a statistically significant association with violent victimization (OR = 1.117; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); youth spending more time in unstructured activities with peers are more likely to report being victims of violence. And, after statistically controlling for behavioral and lifestyle measures commonly known to have moderate-to-strong influences on violent victimization, youth with lower self-control were still significantly more likely to report being a victim of violence compared to those who possess more self-control (OR = 1.287; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). While sex, age, and single-parent family structure retained significant associations; the difference in violent victimization between Blacks and Whites is accounted for by behavioral and lifestyle characteristics. Blacks are no longer more likely to be victimized than Whites after statistically controlling for peers, violent offending, and unstructured time spent in activities.</p>

<title>Neighborhood Disadvantage and Violent Victimization</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204011423767">Table 3</xref> explores the association between low self-control and violent victimization for youth residing in neighborhoods that are characterized by different levels of concentrated disadvantage. Neighborhoods were classified as low, medium, or high concentrated disadvantage by defining those at the lowest 25th percentile and lower as low disadvantaged; highest 25th percentile and higher as the most disadvantaged; and those in between as medium disadvantaged. The pattern of findings that emerged regarding low self-control and violent victimization across the range of disadvantaged neighborhoods is telling.</p>
<p>First, a logistic regression model for youth living in the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods reveals that the association between low self-control and victimization was statistically significant and positive. Consistent with the full model reported above, youth with lower self-control were more likely to report being victims of violence. Youth in the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods with more delinquent peers; those reporting past involvement in violent offending; and those spending more time in unstructured activities with peers were significantly more likely to report being victims of violence. In addition, males and Blacks were more likely to report being victims of violence in the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods. Unlike in the analysis of the full sample in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011423767">Table 2</xref>, significant differences in violent victimization between Blacks and Whites persisted after controlling for violent offending, delinquent peers, and unstructured time pent with peers.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204011423767">Table 3</xref> shows results predicting violent victimization for those youth residing in medium or moderate disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results reported in this model are largely consistent with those from the low neighborhood disadvantage analysis. That is, low self-control continued to have a significant and positive association with violent victimization for youth residing in moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods. Moreover, adolescents in moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods who socialize with more delinquent peers, engage in violent offending, and spend more time in unstructured activities with peers continue to have significantly heightened risk of being victimized by violence.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204011423767">Table 3</xref> shows strikingly different results for predictors of violent victimization among those adolescents living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Unlike low and moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods, self-control did not have a statistically significant association with violent victimization in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. That is, adolescents residing in high disadvantaged neighborhoods with lower self-control were no more likely than those with more self-control to report being a victim of violence during Wave 2 interviews. In addition, delinquent peers and violent offending—factors that past research has consistently found to be correlates of victimization—were not significantly associated with violent victimization. Unstructured time spent with peers is the only lifestyle characteristics that significantly increased the likelihood of adolescents’ violent victimization in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1541204011423767">12</xref></sup>

<title>Conditional Probabilities of Violent Victimization: The Differing Influences of Self -Control</title>
<p>This section reports the conditional predicted probabilities for violent victimization across levels of low self-control for youth living in the lowest and highest disadvantage neighborhoods while holding constant all demographic, family, and lifestyle variables in previous models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204011423767">Figure 1</xref>

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204011423767">Figure 1</xref> shows low self-control’s influence on violent victimization across neighborhood contexts. First, the probability of violent victimization increases as a function of low self-control scores, with individuals having lower self-control (higher scores) also having a greater chance of being victims of violence, although in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods the association between self-control and victimization was not statistically significant. In the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods, the probabilities of violent victimization increase exponentially from a low to high likelihood of victimization; whereas the chance of being victimized across low self-control scores is not as nearly pronounced in the high disadvantaged neighborhoods and did not reach statistical significance. Second, even at the highest levels of self-control, it appears that the difference in violent victimization for those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods is nearly double the risk compared to those who live in the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods. For instance, youth scoring a −2.5 on the low self-control measure, that is, possessing the most self-control, have almost a 15% chance of being victimized but those in the highest disadvantaged neighborhoods who have a similar score have almost a 25% chance. In contrast, youth living in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods and who have the lowest self-control are at most risk of being violently victimized compared to those who have the lowest self-control and reside in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. In fact, youth scoring a 2.5 on the low self-control measure, that is, possessing the lowest amount of self-control, in the lowest disadvantaged neighborhoods have approximately a 45% chance of being a victim of violence compared to approximately 35% for those who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods and have a score of 2.5 on the low self-control measure.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Decades of research confirm that major social obstacles exist for residents of structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods where conditions such as poverty, unemployment, and residential turnover persist. In such neighborhoods where crime is a very common occurrence, children and their families face imposed social and structural forces that negatively affect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011423767">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011423767">Maimon &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011423767">Sampson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011423767">Sharkey, 2006</xref>). Ranging from health to behavioral problems, quality of life, and more generally life success, neighborhoods are contexts that can influence many aspects of people’s lives.</p>
<p>The current study contributed to this body of literature by weaving together two strains of criminological research—social disorganization and self-control—to better understand youths vulnerability to violence. Results from a variety of different multivariate models support the idea that these two perspectives should not be considered separately for understanding victimization. Three findings are particularly noteworthy. First, this study’s findings confirm work by Schreck and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011423767">Higgins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011423767">Schreck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011423767">Schreck et al., 2002</xref>) showing that adolescents with less self-control are independently at more risk of becoming victims of crime and violence. More impressive is the fact that this relationship remained in light of situational, behavioral, and lifestyle characteristics that are commonly chosen by low self-control individuals and that also influence their vulnerability to violence. Second, and running counter to research on neighborhoods and victimization among adults, adolescents residing in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods were not significantly more likely to report being victimized compared to those residing in less disadvantaged neighborhoods, although the substantive differences were in the expected direction. Finally, and most importantly, it was found that self-control’s influence on victimization is conditioned by neighborhood type. Low self-control had a statistically important influence on victimization for those who live in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods where levels of self-control did not influence victimization among those living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. I interpret this finding as largely consistent with the “social push” perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011423767">Raine, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To recap, the social push perspective implies that in disadvantaged and criminogenic environments more social pressure exists for individuals to engage in crime, violence, and other illegal activities, especially for adolescents and those emerging into adulthood. As such, individual differences between people will have less impact on their behavior because the environmental context overrides individual risk. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011423767">Raine (1988</xref>, 2002) intended for this explanation to be specific to the influence of biological-based traits on antisocial outcomes, it is highly consistent with the measures and findings in the present study for two reasons. First, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011423767">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> theoretically argue that self-control is largely influenced by parental disciplining practices, recent empirical findings show that variation in self-control is partially explained by biological factors such as genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011423767">Beaver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011423767">Wright &amp; Beaver, 2005</xref>), making self-control a trait that fits well under the social push framework. Second, given the strong overlap between offending and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011423767">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>), and the studies that find similar characteristics that predict both, it is easier to make the leap from antisocial outcomes that Raine discusses (e.g., violence, conduct problems, etc.) to violent victimization risk.</p>
<p>Questions still remain as to why variation in violent victimization among adolescents from disadvantaged neighborhoods is not significantly influenced by low self-control, and why those living in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods are. The amount of crime, proximity to offenders, and social and cultural processes occurring in disadvantaged neighborhoods may make all adolescents equally vulnerable to violence, and consequently overpowering the effects of individual differences. For instance, it is plausible to speculate that victimization risk is similar for those living in neighborhoods where residents are less likely to look after youth, especially in high crime environments. Given the lack of community informal social controls and high crime rates, it is no surprise that these children are supervised more often compared to those in less disadvantaged neighborhoods, yet supervision in this study does not seem to reduce risk of victimization either in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Further, subcultural explanations are also plausible. Risk may be similar, regardless of individual differences among adolescents, because low and high self-control adolescents face similar obstacles for attaining status and economic success, which in turn may lead them to adopt unconventional ideals to enhance their status. This can contribute to the emergence of values that encourage and condone violence or an “I will get them before they get me” mentality. Such subcultural values encourage hostile and aggressive sanctions for those who are perceived to be disrespectful, but environments such as these can make all youth vulnerable to crime and more aware of the need to use violence and exhibit aggression in attempts to avoid attacks from their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">Anderson, 1999</xref>). As Anderson states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011423767">1999</xref>, p. 33), street cultures present in such neighborhoods provide a “rationale allowing those who are inclined to aggression to precipitate encounters in an approved way.” Unfortunately, these adaptations can lead to being on the receiving end of violence too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1541204011423767">Stewart, Schreck, &amp; Simons, 2006</xref>). Future research should explore these reasons for why individual difference variables such as self-control do not influence victimization risk in disadvantage neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This study does not provide a conclusive explanation as to why low self-control influences violent victimization for adolescents residing in the least and moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011423767">Raine (2002)</xref>, this could be because the social pressures found in the most disadvantaged contexts are less likely, nonexistent, or attenuated. It could also be that different social processes are operating in these neighborhoods that make low self-control’s influence on victimization more pronounced. Whatever the case, it will be left for future research to explore this finding.</p>
<sec id="section30-1541204011423767">
<title>Implications, Limitations, and Future Research</title>
<p>Findings from this study have several potential implications for reducing victimization risk among adolescents. Because low self-control has such far reaching influences on a spectrum of social and health-related outcomes across developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011423767">Moffitt et al., 2011</xref>), it is important to identify early childhood precursors to low self-control to prevent the accumulation of negative outcomes in children’s futures, one of which is vulnerability to violence. Although early prevention is important, promising research suggests that self-control is plastic and is susceptible to change in later stages of one’s life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011423767">Roberts, Walton, &amp; Viechtbauer , 2006</xref>). Thus, unique and universal prevention and intervention efforts are warranted for targeting developmentally sensitive periods to train and encourage individuals in making informed decisions and to consider the consequences of their own behavior. Nonetheless, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011423767">Moffitt et al. (2011</xref>, p. 2967) stated, “early childhood intervention that enhances self-control is likely to bring a greater return on investment than harm reduction programs targeting adolescence alone.” According to the present study’s findings, such efforts may be particularly important for those living in the least disadvantaged neighborhood environments.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we should neglect opportunities to change self-control among those children and youth in more disadvantaged environments. In fact, in an analysis not reported, youth in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods had, on average, the lowest levels of self-control. Given the broader negative consequences that can stem from this trait, it is equally important to improve self-control among youth from impoverished neighborhoods, especially since families residing in such neighborhoods may not have the resources to do so. It will also be important to identify and address the environmental forces that override the influence of individual differences on crime vulnerability in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Finally, unstructured time spent with peers was the only factor that exhibited a statistically significant relationship with victimization risk of adolescents across each category of neighborhood disadvantage. Parents may have success at reducing their children’s risk of victimization by limiting the unstructured activities they engage in with peers.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study are noteworthy. First, the focus of this study has been on adolescents residing in Chicago neighborhoods and consequently research is needed to understand whether the findings reported here can be replicated in other cities that may have different structural and social problems facing youth. Second, this study did not measure neighborhood social mechanisms directly to determine why low self-control influences youth in some neighborhoods but not in others; therefore, research needs to be conducted on the theoretical mechanisms that are driving the differences found. Third, violent victimization was measured over a 12-month period and only captured current prevalence in that adolescent victims were distinguished by whether they reported one of several types of violent victimization or none at all. Additionally, the current study exclusively focused on violent victimization experiences and did not explore a similar framework for understanding property victimization. Research should further explore the intersection between self-control and neighborhood conditions in which adolescents live by assessing the frequency and the persistence of violent and property victimization over time. Fourth, the analyses reported did not capture neighborhood mobility among families and their children. Research shows that moving out of impoverished neighborhoods may have beneficial effects for children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011423767">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003</xref>), but some studies show that there can be lingering negative effects on children who move from highly disadvantaged conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011423767">Sampson, Sharkey, &amp; Raudenbush, 2008</xref>). Exploring how moving from impoverished neighborhoods into those with less structural and social problems will influence victimization may have promise for understanding not only neighborhood effects on victimization but also the influence of low self-control. Finally, this study measured only one trait. Researchers should not only measure low self-control more extensively through teacher, parent, observational, and self-reports, but also expand the range of biological-related traits to further explore the social push perspective on victimization. These limitations, combined with the challenging ideas proposed, set a modest research agenda that will allow criminologists to further understand how the intersection between neighborhoods and individual traits may jointly and independently help minimize youths’ vulnerability to crime and more specifically reduce their risk of victimization.</p>

The types of context that could be reported for each type of victimization were limited to occurrences in one’s own home, in someone else’s home, at school, in their neighborhood, or outside the neighborhood. Several patterns emerged. First, the most common context for violent victimization was the neighborhoods in which these adolescents live. Other common contexts were the school and outside the neighborhoods. Less common contexts were the respondents’ own homes and home that are not theirs. Of the types of violent victimizations, the most commonly reported by victims were being chased; hit, slapped, punched, or beaten up; and threatened to seriously hurt. The other four types of violent victimization were less common among respondents, that is, being shot, shot at, sexually assaulted, and attacked with a weapon.
