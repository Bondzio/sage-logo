<abstract>
<p>Complexity theory is a scientific paradigm concerned with the ways in which order and disorder (unpredictability, turbulence, chaos) combine to produce emergent higher levels of organization in living systems. The group-as-a-whole is an instance where interactions among individuals, often at ‘the edge of chaos’, lead to group-qua-group dynamics. The paradigms underlying group psychology and complexity theory are considered. Group theory developed along the lines of Enlightenment science, with its emphasis on order and linear causation, while complexity theory reflects the newer sciences of quantum physics and chaos theory, which are based on uncertainty and disorder, respectively. Some basic concepts of complexity theory are discussed, and recent literature on complexity theory and group psychotherapy is reviewed, to provide a background for exploring the potential implications of complexity theory for three dominant theoretical frameworks for dynamic group psychotherapy: Bion’s basic assumptions, Foulkes’ group analysis, and Agazarian’s systems-centered therapy. These will be taken up in Part II, to be published in a subsequent edition of Group Analysis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dynamic group psychotherapy is indebted to several key formulations, which, during the period from World War II to the New Millennium, have provided frameworks for understanding groups and what makes them <italic>greater than and different from</italic> the aggregate of individuals who participate in them. During that era, however, newer scientific paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0533316412453701">Kuhn, 1962</xref>) and intellectual currents emerged. One in particular, complexity theory, has the potential to supplement and re-frame extant group theory.</p>
<p>Complexity theory has already been introduced to group analysts and therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0533316412453701">Rubenfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0533316412453701">Stacey, 2005</xref>). In what follows, I shall try to provide a broad perspective regarding the nexus between extant group theories and complexity theory, with the intent to raise questions and stimulate further thinking about the theories that form the current conceptual base of group psychotherapy practice. Complexity theory is itself in the exploratory stages and its proponents acknowledge their ideas to be formative insights rather than definitive laws of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0533316412453701">Mitchell, 2009</xref>: 291–303). Thus, it is perhaps too soon to call for a radical revision of group theory based on awareness of complexity. However, it is never too early to raise questions.</p>
<p>A key ingredient that has been missing from group perspectives is a natural sciences accounting of the nexus between the individual human being <italic>qua</italic> organism and the group-as-a-whole dynamics they form in vivo, i.e. how to explain in biosocial terms the higher levels of organization and structure that constitute ‘the group’. Up to now the understanding of group dynamics as such has outdistanced the specific explanation of how coherent groups can arise in the first place, a lack which has led some colleagues to assert that group theories and dynamics are convenient myths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0533316412453701">Stacey, 2005</xref>) and conduct individual psychoanalysis the group setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0533316412453701">Wolf and Schwartz, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>Complexity theory allows us to regard the group-as-a-whole as an organic reality by offering a scientific account of the self-organization of higher level living systems such as groups above and beyond the elements that compose them. This account has to do with randomized and turbulent events that ‘playfully’ reconfigure phenomena into new, emergent patterns. This combination of serendipity and causation is the logico-mathematical essence of complexity in nature and human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316412453701">Waldrop, 1992</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>Among the underpinnings of current group-as-a-whole theory, the most influential are: 1) group basic assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412453701">Bion, 1959</xref>); 2) the group matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412453701">Foulkes, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412453701">1990</xref>); 3) group fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412453701">Lewin, 1951</xref>); and 4) group systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316412453701">Miller and Rice, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316412453701">Durkin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412453701">Agazarian and Gantt, 2000</xref>). They all originated and evolved in the mid- to late-twentieth century. Before and during that time period, the scientific world moved from Enlightenment deterministic science exemplified by Newtonian physics to relativistic and quantum physics, and more recently, chaos and complexity theories. Simply put, the Newtonian ‘ping pong’ balls of particles in motion became the ‘clouds’ of quantum matter/energy and the flitting ‘butterflies’ of chaos. These newer conceptions of fundamental units were game changers of modern science. With regard to groups, they lead us to assert that the group members interact in ways that have a degree of unpredictability and instability that influences the group formation in novel ways.</p>
<p>However, despite these scientific advances, group dynamics have adhered to the time-honoured ‘ping pong’ paradigm of linear cause-and-effect with its vision of an orderly universe where paradox, probabilities, turbulence, and disorder are viewed as incidental ‘noise’ in the system that need no further explanation.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412453701">Lewin (1951)</xref> held that groups transformed individual roles and goals into dynamic ‘force fields’, borrowing that idea from electromagnetic physics. In principle, the actions of the group members could be predicted from the way they were pushed and pulled by the group field, the way that iron filings are attracted to a magnet. Thus, both psychodynamic and group concepts at their inception had an apparent elegance that emulated classical science, while consultants, leaders, and therapists were aware that their patients and groups could take sudden, unexpected turns and encounter difficulties of a perplexing, contradictory nature. The theories did not entirely fit the facts, but it was reassuring to know that a cause and effect ‘push-pull’ framework was, within limits, useful in practice and research.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the long-held view of the world as an elegant design was shaken not only by quantum mechanics, with its disclosure of limits to predictability, but also by such fundamental developments as Godel’s incompleteness theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0533316412453701">Nagel and Newman, 2001</xref>) in mathematics, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in all logical systems. Simultaneously, the entire fabric of western thought was transformed by psychoanalysis, existentialism, hermeneutics, and linguistics, eventuating in the post-modern turn that deconstructed all privileged assumptions about reality. Chaos theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0533316412453701">Gleick, 1987</xref>), which pointed to significant disruptions in the fabric of an orderly, logical universe, mirrored this wider intellectual development.</p>
<p>Chaos theory attempted to explain such unexpected events as the potentially large impact of small local changes such an isolated thunderstorm on larger scale weather events such as tornadic activity across a broad geographical region some distance away. The so-called ‘butterfly effect’—whereby a butterfly waving its wings in some part of the world could in principle, though of course highly unlikely, through a ‘domino effect’ on particles in the atmosphere, set off a weather upheaval at a remote location—served as a metaphor for the apparent wilfulness of the meteorological universe as seen through the lens of chaos theory. To cite a parallel in a therapy group, the therapist’s lateness due to a burst car tire could conceivably throw the group-as-a-whole into a dependent or disorganized state. Chance events on one level at one location can impact on whole systems in another place on another level.</p>
<p>Then, in the 1980s, building upon the ideas of chaos theory, as well as cybernetics and other ‘new sciences’, a multidisciplinary group of scientists in a series of meetings at Los Alamos<sup>3</sup> sought to weave diverse ideas concerning order and disorder, predictability and randomness into ‘complexity theory’, a theory of nature and the biological, social, and economic world at the ‘edge of chaos’. They were interested in accounting for complex phenomena where chaos came together with orderly cause-and-effect interactions, fields, and systems to produce organizations of matter that resulted in new hierarchical levels not predictable from the underlying causes. Life itself was seen as such a self-organizing self-reproducing system arising out of the primal soup of matter and energy. The Los Alamos scientists argued further that human groups, organizations, and societies could be seen as higher level self-organizing systems emerging from the interactions of cooperating and competing individuals and subgroups. Their metaphorical equivalent of the butterfly effect was a flock of erstwhile, dispersed birds moving in coordinated flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0533316412453701">Waldrop, 1992</xref>: 241–3). Under particular conditions, organization emerges from randomness.</p>
<p>The dawn of complexity theory left a largely unnoticed gap in group dynamic theories. What could now be seen to be missing was an account of <italic>emergence</italic>, how a group matrix, field, or culture could result from a series of transactions among individuals, initially strangers coming together in a relatively unstructured situation. Significant group-qua-group phenomena of a complex nature remain unexplained.</p>
<p>Thus, it becomes pertinent to inquire: how can group psychologists integrate the work of the Los Alamos group (and co-incidentally modern physics and biology) into group-as-a-whole theory as such? What follows is a preliminary attempt to do so. This is no easy task, but for help in doing so, there is already a small but significant literature on complexity theory and groups. We can review those insights. Then we can consider how we might begin to re-frame group basic assumption, matrix, and systems theories to develop a more general picture of group dynamics.</p>

<title>Recent Group Process and Group Psychotherapy Forays into Complexity Theory</title>
<p>There have been several important attempts to introduce complexity theory into group analysis and group psychotherapy. Each author points to the interplay of order and chaos in groups, but each has his or her own emphasis and perspective.</p>
<p>Rubenfeld, in a seminal article entitled <italic>Group Therapy and Complexity Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0533316412453701">2001</xref>), considered the value for therapists of understanding how groups self-organize in unique and often unanticipated ways. He stressed that the relationship between the individual and the group is nonlinear, which in complexity theory means turbulent or ‘hard to predict’ as well as of different proportion, as might be true, for example, when a seemingly innocuous comment by a member has a larger-than-life impact on the group’s development. In this respect, Rubenfeld emphasized the formative impact of ‘initial conditions’ such as the original composition of the group, the effects of which persist long after these members leave the group.</p>
<p>Los Alamos participant Brian Arthur had articulated a similar concept called ‘increasing returns’ in economics, whereby a product that initially dominates the market might shape all future marketability of products performing the same function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316412453701">Arthur, 1990</xref>). For example, one reason why Microsoft Windows has dominated the computer world is because it got there first, which made it more difficult for competing operating systems to gain a niche in the market. Of course, this is not always the case. Propeller planes came before jets, but were quickly superseded by them. The point is that the initial events can and sometimes do have an outsized impact on subsequent developments.</p>
<p>Similarly, the initial events, composition, and power relations of a group can lead to a unique developmental trajectory. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412453701">Brabender and Fallon (2009</xref>: 58) suggest that complexity theory challenges so-called ‘stage-phase’ models, such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412453701">Bennis and Shepard (1956)</xref>, which propose universal phases of group development. According to complexity theory, initial conditions and subsequent events can change the course of group development, suggesting that, in some ways, each group has its own unique trajectory. It is even possible that the diverse initial conditions of groups that provided the data for the theorists themselves have led to differing group theories. Certainly, for example, Foulkes’, Bion’s, and Agazarian’s groups arose in different contexts, memberships, and leadership styles, and their respective theories may have been affected by these differences.</p>
<p>Rubenfeld goes on to point out that groups, like all living systems, function ‘at the edge of chaos’, a limited set of conditions where order and disorder are in delicate but optimal balance for growth and change. Life itself emerged on earth because of a highly specific set of conditions of temperature, elements such as carbon and oxygen, and so on, with chance encounters of molecules leading to living forms. Similarly, the group leader who seeks to ‘en-liven’ his group must work at the edge of chaos, allowing for productive amounts of chaos and vulnerability but not so much disarray as to lead to fragmentation. Rubenfeld further suggests that such a balance can only be sustained through the leader’s engagement as an active participant rather than adhering to the role of an outside, neutral, detached consultant.</p>
<p>Sustained work at the group’s edge of chaos can be challenged by disruptive enactments:</p>
<sec id="section3-0533316412453701">
<title>Example</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Such an instance occurred in a long-term outpatient group where three of the eight members had borderline personality disorder, including a schizotypal female member, Gwen, who was usually quiet and over-conforming to others’ expectations. On one occasion, however, she came to a group session intoxicated, but initially reserved as usual. A male member observed that Gwen appeared to be ‘not in the room’, in a trancelike state. The therapist, who was familiar with Gwen’s substance abuse history, questioned her about possible substance use. She shockingly responded with an outpouring of epithets, delusions, and grandiose statements about her sexual promiscuity. Several members panicked and insisted she be ejected from the group. The therapist said that, although no one was allowed to come to the group high, Gwen was already here and needed his and the group’s care. He acknowledged that he too felt anxious about Gwen’s condition, but that such disruptions sometimes happen in groups. The session ended with the members still anxious. The therapist then took the patient aside, evaluated her condition, decided it was not an emergency, and set up an individual session with her.</p>
<p>In the next session, with Gwen present but sober, the members rather than confronting her, talked about ending the group. The group was still in a state of contagious panic. The therapist recognized this situation and worked with the group on their emotional states, encouraging them to share their thoughts, but adding a degree of structure by requiring each member to speak in turn, and the others to listen. This restored a degree of order to the group’s chaotic state, and the group was able to confront Gwen about her behaviour and get her commitment to not come to the group high. He encouraged Gwen to explore the sources of her acting-out with the group, and she understood it as a replay of her adolescent rebellion against her over-controlling parents. The group was able to continue its existence but the therapist felt they would need further periods of structured activity to complement the free flow of group associations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this example, the therapist worked actively to restore the disrupted balance of structure and ‘free association’ in the group. Rubenfeld thus emphasized maintaining such an ‘edge of chaos’ in conducting groups. He did not try to resolve the problem of how and why group dynamics emerge from individuals and their interactions.</p>
<p>By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0533316412453701">Stacey (2005)</xref> directly took up the relationship between the individual and the group. Consistent with complexity theory, he held that coherent patterns of group relations emerge from the spontaneous interactions among the members.</p>
<p>His adaptation of Foulkes’ notion of the social self comes very close to recent discussions of the ‘social brain’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412453701">Cozolino (2006)</xref>, who sees each individual as a ‘synapse’ in a larger network. His view of complexity is similar to that of Los Alamos participant John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316412453701">Holland’s (1975)</xref> notion of ‘adaptive agents’, individual units that have the capacity to learn, grow, and create new structures within a Darwinian evolutionary ecology of survival through cooperation and competition.</p>
<p>In therapy groups, the adaptive agents are the group members. Those members whose personalities are attracted to a particular group climate are more likely to acquire power and influence there. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412453701">Bion (1959</xref>: 103–4) used the concept of ‘valency’ to describe a member’s special adaptation to a group basic assumption, for example a paranoid individual who has an affinity to a ‘fight/flight’ group culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316412453701">Gibbard (1974</xref>: 254–61) pointed out the important role of the ‘seducer’, a member who acquires power and influence in a group by sexualizing his or her role. The seducer’s erotization of group relations acts as a catalytic agent promoting risk taking, much as the chemical catalysts in Miracle Gro stimulate the growth of a plant.</p>
<p>Stacey, like Holland, is thus concerned with power and dependency relations in the group, and he emphasizes the importance of individuation in group development, regarding the group mentality itself as a hazard to each members’ individuality.</p>
<p>Stacey is thus suspicious of any notion of group mentality or group mind, a worthy concern. However, his advocacy of individuality from the standpoint of both complexity theory (which inevitably begins with a consideration of the properties of individual agents or units) and human rights within the power relations of groups, leads him to reject concepts of the group-as-a-whole as artifices or epiphenomena, convenient myths used by leadership to minimize the importance of individuals. The reality is that many group-as-a-whole practitioners and theorists are among those most vigilant about boundaries and individual rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Foulkes began his career as a psychoanalyst and came to England as a refugee from Nazism. Bion expressed deep concern about the illusory nature of ‘basic assumptions’ and encouraged groups to work and to think. Lewin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316412453701">Lewin, Lippitt, and White, 1939</xref>) initiated seminal research on democracy in groups. All three, as well as Freud before them, were appalled by the ‘group mind’ or primal horde mentality.</p>
<p>As a result of his emphasis on individuals, Stacey turns complexity theory on its head when he questions the emerging actuality of larger, cohesive units such as the group-as-a-whole. Emergence is a cornerstone of complexity theory. The larger adaptive living structures that eventuate, such as organisms that come about as intersystemic collectivities of cells, are very real phenomena of nature rather than appearances. Complexity theory, like general systems theory, fully supports the notion of group-as-a-whole, but, as Stacey correctly suggests, is most interested in how the group emerges from the interactions of adaptive agents (in this case group members) within evolving evolutionary demands and a process of natural selection that can occur in the microcosm of groups as well as across large populations of species.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412453701">Grossmark (2007)</xref>, in a moving portrayal of a group’s development, offers a trauma-based approach to group therapy incorporating diverse concepts from complexity theory, Foulkes’ group analysis, relational psychoanalysis, and the development of meanings (hermeneutics). His particular interest is in working through unreflective, impulsive traumatic re-enactments to a point where mentalization and meaning can be restored to relations among the members. His framework emphasizes interpersonal relationships more than the group-as-a-whole, but, in keeping with the notion of self-organization, Grossmark follows Foulkes in advocating therapy ‘of, by, and for’ the group rather than as a therapist-driven process. To quote:
<disp-quote><p>The primary dynamic of change is conceptualized as a constant dialectical movement into and out of the ‘familiar chaos’ (Stern, 1997) of the self-states engaged in the enactments and the more reflective and related self states that enable working through. To describe this process and to outline the experience of the analyst’s embeddedness, I look to dynamic systems theory [a term for aspects of complexity theory- VLS] that offers a conceptualization of change and emergence that seems to capture the experience of these enactments both systemically and metaphorically and is beautifully captured by Stuart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412453701">Kauffman’s (1995</xref>: 26) notion that ‘life exists at the edge of chaos’, to hermeneutic psychoanalysis that emphasizes the emergence of meaning from dialogic interaction and to relational psychoanalytic ideas of enactment, dissociation, and multiplicity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412453701">Grossmark, 2007</xref>: 481)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Importantly, Grossmark seeks to integrate complexity theory with relational psychoanalysis and hermeneutics, an important synthesis, which humanizes complexity, putting it firmly on an existential grounding. He is interested in the lived experience of interpersonal relations and the role of expressive emotionality and language within it, which offers a fruitful tack to take regarding the integration of group dynamics, contemporary psychotherapy, and the abstractions of biosocial theorizing.</p>
<p>Grossmark, when considering mentalization and meaning-making in groups, follows the philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316412453701">Heidegger (1962)</xref> in emphasizing temporality. He questions both psychoanalysts’ emphasis on childhood events and conversely, gestalt therapists’ focus on the here-and-now. He cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0533316412453701">Loewald’s (1980)</xref> phrase ‘near future’ to
<disp-quote><p>capture the curious transference enactments wherein the past is continually lived as an about-to-be future. It is useful to think of the life of the group as order emerging from chaos in the imminent future, or as the French poet Yves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316412453701">Bonnefoy (1982</xref>: 50) put it, ‘the ever next’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412453701">Grossmark, 2007</xref>: 482)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Such a shift to immanence in the temporal focus of the group process has important implications, capturing the notion of ‘emergence’ in complexity theory, which depicts how new self-organizations appear when the parameters of a system change.</p>
<p>Grossmark is also consistent with complexity theory when he stresses the importance of ‘non-understanding’ as a way station on the road to meaning. Bion similarly held that the ‘absence of memory, desire, and understanding’ is the optimal listening stance for the psychoanalyst (1970: 33). Non-understanding implies recognition of chaos and the void, notions analogous to the emphasis on unpredictable shifts and discontinuities that characterizes complexity theory. Because of the unpredictably and sudden turns in groups, it is often prudent for the therapist to reserve judgment and wait to see what happens.</p>
<p>Grossmark makes a key connection between complexity theory and subjective self-states, especially subselves or trauma-based dissociative alter egos. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0533316412453701">Rubenfeld (2001</xref>: 460–3) similarly emphasizes multiple subjectivities, suggesting in addition that the group itself manifests an overarching intersubjective state combining the subjectivities of the members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412453701">Grossmark (2007</xref>: 483–4) states that ‘the multiple self-states of the group and its members intertwine in a multitude of enactments and reflective states at any given time’. If selves and subselves are taken as ‘agents’, the group situation exemplifies Holland’s complex adaptive system, with its hierarchal levels of emerging structure, in this case that of subselves evolving upwards to whole selves (persons), subgroups, and group-as-a-whole. Such insights are consistent with the theory of traumatic dissociation as well as Agazarian’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412453701">Agazarian and Gantt, 2000</xref>) systems-centered therapy, in which the lower level person systems are ‘nested’ within the larger subgroup and group systems.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412453701">Brabender and Fallon (2009</xref>: 56–9), in a comprehensive volume, <italic>Group Development in Practice</italic>, regard complexity-chaos theory as one of several new paradigms for understanding the development of therapy groups over time. They point out the connection between complexity theory and general systems theory (GST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316412453701">Bertalanffy, 1968</xref>). Since GST has already been applied to therapy groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316412453701">Durkin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412453701">Agazarian and Gantt, 2000</xref>: 105, 145–6), complexity theory can be brought into systems thinking in terms of the turbulent characteristics of groups.</p>
<p>The characteristics of complex living systems such as groups are, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412453701">Brabender and Fallon (2009</xref>: 57–68), <italic>irreversibility, dissipativeness, non-linearity</italic>, and <italic>the capacity to self-organize</italic>. Non-linearity and the capacity to self-organize have been preliminarily defined above. Irreversibility refers to the impact of past on present in an unfolding way that cannot be ‘re-wound’ as in a time machine. Living systems have a trajectory of birth, life, and death that cannot be undone. This is partly because dissipative thermodynamic systems tend towards entropy or randomness. For groups, irreversibility means, for one thing, that early interactions set an unalterable tone for subsequent events in the group. The early life of the group must be taken into account in diagnosing its more recent problems and conflicts. In complexity theory, while dynamics unfold in the here-and-now, history is an important part of the equation, setting parameters, which influence events later in the group’s history.</p>
<p>The Nobel scientist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0533316412453701">Prigogene (1968)</xref> held that because living systems are open to input of information and energy, they persist and reproduce despite their entropic, dissipative tendency to ‘run down’. For groups, this means that exchange of information and energy among the group members and subgroups ensures its survival and adaptation. The group leader should help the group to maintain a flow of information exchange (e.g. dialogue) and energy (for example, collective decision-making; intervals between sessions to re-charge), which also help to resolve defences and impasses that impede understanding and change.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412453701">Brabender and Fallon (2009</xref>: 58) further emphasize the importance of ‘strange attractors’ (a concept from complexity theory) in understanding the reliability and consistency of group development given the edge of chaos that can push the group in diverse directions. They draw an analogy to ‘the group as a ball that has landed in a basin (the strange attractor). Although the rolls of the ball can show infinite unpredictable variation, the variation is within certain limits established by the shape of the basin’. Strange attractors provide a degree of order within chaos. Examples of strange attractors in a group might include a powerful group member who provides a focus of attention, a shared dream that becomes a metaphor for the group process, or a negotiable conflict between subgroups. Since there are situations that are common to most groups, for example an early stage of dependency where the leader is the attractor, there is some consistency in how groups develop. Brabender and Fallon suggest that the strange attractor offers a way of reconciling the opposing viewpoints that a) groups develop in a consistent manner versus b) groups have unique trajectories. Research in group development suggests that both points of view have merit, and complexity theory provides a way to think about groups in ways that allow for both universality and diversity, linearity and non-linearity.</p>

<title>Next Steps</title>
<p>These several discussions offer a rich lode of ideas about applying complexity theory to group psychotherapy. They emphasize chaos and turbulence in the group matrix, but also suggest how they stimulate self-organization, adaptation, and the emergence of higher-level systems. What has not yet been addressed, however, are the ways in which complexity theory might interface with and modify group theory as such. In this regard, it must be remembered that complexity theory is as yet a rough-hewn framework for understanding the world. Moreover, the modelling of complex phenomena is done with computers, and the ideas originated at a time when the best computers had less than a megabyte of memory capacity! It is still too early to say how these preliminary formulations will change as computer capacity expands exponentially. However, complexity theory has already gained the respect of scientists in disciplines as far ranging as physics, the life sciences, and economics. It is worth our attention as group therapists and theorists and can stimulate our thinking in new directions, as it has done in other disciplines.</p>
<p>The key question that group-as-a-whole theory must answer is how to account for the individual-to-group nexus, i.e. the self-organization of groups into structures and dynamics that are greater than and different from the agents/individuals who compose them. The broad theoretical frameworks that predominate in group work today are 1) Bion’s basic assumption theory and group relations schools that derive from it such as Tavistock and A.K. Rice; 2) Foulkes’ group analysis, with its central concept of the group matrix; and 3) Agazarian’s systems- centered therapy (SCT). Each of these approaches has a substantial following, and a coherent body of studies continues to emerge from them. In a word, these theories offer understandings of the group-as-group as a distinct entity with its own development. They relate the group-as-a-whole to the interactions among the individuals who compose it. But they do not provide a full accounting of how groups self-organize from such interactions and come to exercise a strong influence on the members. In Part II, to be published in the next edition of <italic>Group Analysis</italic>, we will examine some of the limitations and gaps in these theories and how concepts from complexity theory may help by providing explanations for the emergence of higher level group systems.</p>
