<p><italic>Public Libraries and their National Policies</italic> consists of 14 chapters. There is an introduction and a concluding chapter. In between the reader finds 12 chapters, each covering a country. The chapters on the countries are similar in length: all 13-16 pages long. The chapters are all structured in a similar manner. For each country, there are sections on historical background, a current framework, legislation and legal structures, and a conclusion. Each chapter also contains a list of useful websites and a list of references.</p>
<p>Obviously, the book is written out of a deep interest in and concern with public libraries around the world. The author is of course well aware of the challenges in covering twelve countries’ library systems in-depth and aims to use the book to create an interest in fostering further studies. He succeeds in that aim and all the chapters are interesting, even if some of them (due to the sources used) from time to time overrate the importance of some topics in a particular country.</p>
<p>Twelve countries or nations are selected for inclusion and the author is rather honest about the selection. The selection of countries depends on how easily accessible information in English on the libraries have been. This is not a very scientific selection criterion. However, the important issue is of course whether the book has a good coverage of countries situated around the world. A weakness is of course that the translation of material from the native language to English differs from country to country. It means that utilised sources easily can be uneven in type, quality and coverage. The countries covered are USA, Canada, South Africa, Senegal, Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom, France, India, Turkmenistan, China and finally Australia. There are no chapters on public libraries from the Middle East or East Europe. Especially the omission of East Europe is a shame as a number of these states have extensive programs for the development of modern public libraries and they have a long history with libraries as part of a national policy.</p>
<p>Before reading the book, this reviewer was a little skeptical, wondering how it would be possible to cover twelve countries or nations in relatively few pages. Helling has as a matter of fact written an insightful text that gives a good characterization of the countries and the text is easy to read and at the same time it is very factual and filled with useful information that can be hard to obtain otherwise. The situation for public libraries around the world is very diversified and it is a kind of wonder to read about the many models employed worldwide – and of course also to read about the economic, political and social context in which the libraries operate</p>
<p>Overall, Helling has succeeded in writing an interesting book that clearly indicates the intricate relationship between the situation of public libraries and their national context. Especially useful is the short historical introduction to the interaction between the public library system and the national policy, either in existence or in non-existence.</p>
<p>The overriding argument in the book is that some form of national policy – be it in form of an law, regulations or guidelines and standard – would benefit public libraries and their development. The main reason is that even in nations with strong traditions for public libraries we witness a very uneven and uncoordinated development and funding of the libraries. This means very different service levels and opportunities for citizens depending on which county or municipality they live in. Helling is well aware of the fact that most funding is local and national policies can in some places be seen as an unwanted interference. However, the author obviously finds that some countries like Finland have found a suitable and workable balance between local autonomy and national standard and guidelines. Some countries have – as part of their national policy – placed public libraries as actors in their information policy. This is the case in, for example, some of the Scandinavian countries where public libraries play an important role in educating citizens to improve their capabilities to interact with the public institutions through digital communication. The public libraries in these countries also participate in the so-called integration process teaching immigrants and asylum-seekers the basic skills to be able to participate in society. These activities are of course not limited to Scandinavia, but in many other countries these activities are to a higher degree the result of decisions taken at the single library or local level.</p>
<p>The topic of digital resources is outside the scope of the book. However, the relationship between digital resources and public libraries is probably one of the biggest challenges for local public libraries at present. As books, music, films and other forms of material and content increasingly become digitalized, new business models have to be implemented in the library system and cooperation and coordination appear to be necessary if citizens have to have at least some kind of equal access to these products through the library system. Coordinated efforts are probably necessary to negotiate deals with publishers. Cooperation in relation to databases of different kinds is also essential to obtain services that are cost-effective. This calls for strategies and policies that the single local library often is unable to deliver without standards, guidelines or other forms of regulations.</p>
<p>To sum up, it must have been a difficult task to write this book and it is, not surprisingly, easy to find topics on which one can disagree with the author. For example, in the chapter on Sweden one gets the impression that statistics and performance measurement are very important for the library profession there. They are, of course, but not in comparison to many other topics where the discussion has been more exclusively in the native language. However, overall, the end result is a book that is informative, well-written and of great interest for people in the library and information business who are interested in public libraries world-wide. In particular, the contextualization is important indicating that an ideal model for public libraries does not exist: different services are embedded in very different societal structures.</p>
