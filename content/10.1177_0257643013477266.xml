<abstract>
<p>This article identifies the continuity linking the Gandhi and Nehru historical periods in specific discursive and practical formations. The Indian national movement and the post-Independence period constitute a comprehensive historical entity comparable to the twentieth century’s major revolutions. We find a specific discursive/practical paradigm with identifiable features, since reproduced in other nation-making experiences. Its intellectual coherence is in the principle of non-violence or an ethic of reconciliation over totality. The dominant paradigm of modern nation-making was grounded in total assimilation and positivism’s dichotomous rupture with the ‘traditional’ past, focused on the instant of seizing state power. The practical coherence of the Gandhi–Nehru period is in non-violent conflict resolution based on a temporal horizon of growth over final ends. The Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience movements were participatory mass movements fostering public self-reliance and traditional structures reconstructed towards democratic ends. The Nehru era shifted the non-violence principle from a mass movement to a political party within a democratic framework, with political freedom and economic development joined in an unprecedented fashion. Pluralist and non-interventionist solutions were applied to civil society dilemmas in an open ethic of reconciliation. Difference rather than homogeneity was privileged for secular national cohabitation in an open non-violent ethic.</p>

<p>We may count what happened in India between 1920 and 1964 among the twentieth century’s great revolutions. It is comparable to the 1917 Russian and 1949 Chinese revolutions, or the long Vietnamese revolution culminating in 1975, in terms of the mass mobilization of people, the visionary quality of the nationalist/anti-colonial leadership, the struggle to create a modern and democratic society. Each of these revolutions was unique. Yet while the major twentieth-century revolutions followed and developed the distinctive Marxist stream within the Enlightenment/French Revolutionary tradition, the Indian experience challenged— as well as adopted and transformed—core elements of existing conventions in modern nation-making. Above all, a crucial role was envisioned for the multi-centred forces of civil society—bound by the limits of democratic secularism—in an open-ended experience of nation-making.</p>
<p>The age of nationalism (1850–90) had seen radical growth in the prestige and power of the state, for the state alone possessed the power and administrative machinery to conduct reforms on a nation-wide basis. This prestige, in its practical consequences, lent itself to terrible experiences of violence. The history of Indian nationalism was deeply transformed by Gandhi’s selection of Nehru as his successor, and by Nehru’s adherence to Gandhian principles in his thought and practice as the first Prime Minister of independent India (1947–64). Gandhi and Nehru—although different in important ways—were nationalists with a critical reserve regarding the prestige and power of the state that was unusual for their time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0257643013477266">1</xref></sup> This reserve was grounded in the principle of non-violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477266">2</xref></sup> Their shared commitment to structural–institutional aspects of democratic nation-making and a context-specific logic of modernization expressed this deeper philosophical conviction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0257643013477266">3</xref></sup> Nehru’s statesmanship therefore coped with post-Independence India’s complexity not merely through a generically open pragmatism but through following the Gandhian legacy of a multi-centred nationalism without essence. Nehru noted that it was the ‘first time in the world’s history [that] a great political mass movement [was] wedded to [non-violent] ideals’, and contrasted this to ‘class conflict, hatred and violence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0257643013477266">4</xref></sup> The Gandhi–Nehru experience, however, belonged equally to a wider global phenomenon in historical nation-making: the heritage of the modern democratic Enlightenment and the French Revolution. At independence Nehru invoked Gandhi’s legacy and the ‘great past of India’ as well as ‘modern precedents such as the French, American and Russian revolutions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0257643013477266">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Today, looking back upon the twentieth century, the nature and logic of the Indian national movement appear confirmed in the light of the democratic shortcomings of the Russian and Chinese experiences and the growing presence of non-violent mass movements the world over. The present article strives to demonstrate the coherence of the Indian national movement in the Gandhi and Nehru periods, against claims of a disjuncture or allegations that Gandhian politics were hijacked for shadowy purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0257643013477266">6</xref></sup> This coherence is demonstrable in a principle of non-violence that marks the uniqueness of both movements in twentieth-century Indian history—an ethic of reconciliation over revenge. The Gandhi–Nehru experience of the twentieth century set a unique precedent for pluralism against the background of dominant political traditions tending towards totality (the French Revolutionary principle of total assimilation with its intellectual afterlife in Comtean positivism). Its legacy is manifested not only in the martyrdom of Martin Luther King but also that of Iranian musician and civil activist Neda Agha-Soltan in 2009. Her fellow demonstrators captured the alleged assassin, but released him unharmed while taking his ID card, on the grounds that their movement based itself upon an ethic of non-violence.</p>
<p>Gandhian non-violence was the twentieth century’s major organizational and philosophical alternative to unilinear historicist nation-making within an inside/out scheme, where an enemy is constructed upon a road to total synthesis. Indian nationalism within the Gandhi–Nehru ambit broke with the conception of the General Will/ultimate synthesis in favour of a principle of multi-centeredness and non-violent conflict resolution. The General Will, and its attendant violence, was available in the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Indian public sphere—nothing ‘essential’ to India’s ‘soul’ dictated one inevitable political outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0257643013477266">7</xref></sup> The nation, according to this view, is made ontologically in advance but discovered in the moment of battle. It is constituted of an essence that excludes the internal other. This view echoes not merely romanticism, but repeats the founding national principle of the French Revolution. Saint Just insisted that ‘the nation has only one heart’ and ‘the general will can never harbour any principle alien to itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0257643013477266">8</xref></sup> On this inside/out basis he urged a national campaign of violence to purge the French nation of ‘corruption’. This framework has since been used variously to exterminate, homogenize and exile national minorities, to uproot, overtax and exploit populations targeted non-consensually for development schemes, and to destroy resisters to centralized power of whatever variety. Hannah Arendt’s observation that only ‘in the presence of the enemy can … the ideal of French and all other nationalism(s) come to pass’, fails to apply to the overall experience of Indian nationalism during and following the Independence struggle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0257643013477266">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nationalism as an <italic>experience</italic> traceable to the French Revolution demonstrates that a nation can be freed from foreign control by the collective efforts of its population constituted as the people. This opens up the question of <italic>means</italic>. The French Revolutionary tradition of the General Will concerns a mode of obtaining power where the end, conceived as a rupture, is everything: power is to be seized in a lightning-fast assault, and a subsequent programme is imposed conforming to the uniform ‘interests’ of the population as defined by a completed ideological worldview. Nationalism as a doctrine was defined by liberal thinkers such as John Stuart Mill or Giuseppe Mazzini as limited by a single national culture as the strict condition for free institutions. The British colonial claim that Indians could not be united or free because they were a geographic abstraction composed of hundreds of races and creeds, and neither a nation nor a people, was therefore the central line of tension with the emergence of the nationalist movement in the late nineteenth century. Gandhian non-violence, embracing nationalism as an experience, proposed an alternative mode of obtaining power linked to a pluralistic principle that rejected the prevailing nationalist logic of homogeneity.</p>
<p>Nehruism was preceded by Gandhian organizational modes and principles, as manifested in the Non-Cooperation (1919–22) and Civil Disobedience movements (1930–32), and the ongoing Constructive Programme. These involved millions of people of all Indian religions and social classes, and more women than in the Russian and Chinese revolutions combined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0257643013477266">10</xref></sup> Grounded in reconstructed Indian traditions (rather than in rupture), Gandhi cemented the concept of an epistemic limit to the practical technique of non-violence for the purpose of building a broad-based Indian civil society/secular democratic modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0257643013477266">11</xref></sup> Emphasizing means, public self-reliance and mass participation, we see prolonged popular struggle on a moral, political and ideological level, and grounded in everyday life (for example, the 1930 Salt Satyagraha). The effect of Gandhian non-violence was the transformation of the nationalist convention from a substantive discourse grounded in the inside/out logic of homogeneous identity to a convention of pluralistic nationalism without essence—a concept of nationalism without enemies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0257643013477266">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gandhian technique shows a long-term <italic>creative</italic> struggle over hegemony at the level not only of power but also <italic>meaning</italic>, reconstructing the Indian nation based on the Enlightenment egalitarian–democratic values in a multi-class/religious movement <italic>without</italic> demands for any ideological or identity commitment. It was focused on the practical <italic>technique</italic> of non-violence and not an intellectual <italic>definition</italic> of identity. Based on the multi-centred creation of parallel power networks, the Indian national movement expanded the conceptual limits of state power from an elite epistemic <italic>instrument</italic> to a broad network of <italic>relations</italic> encompassing civil society assemblages. It was a massive learning process, involving a broader definition of the state apparatus to be transformed—not merely the summit (the government, the bureaucracy, the police and the military) but also the educational system, the media and multiple other civil society organs from the bottom up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0257643013477266">13</xref></sup> It posited widely based consensus and mass participation—the power of ordinary people in everyday situation—over the instantaneous and violent seizure of power by elites with a completed programme to be imposed from above.</p>
<p>The Nehru era saw the non-violence principle shift from a mass movement (claiming to represent the nation) to a political party (within the competitive arena of a democratic political system) via the mode of institutional ethics. Hundreds of Congress volunteers working all over the country had paved the way for the ‘precocious existence of a rights culture among Indians.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0257643013477266">14</xref></sup> The Indian Constitution’s wide frame of inclusiveness corresponded to the latitude of participation in the national movement: the contributions of women, the property-less and the illiterate entitled them to enfranchisement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0257643013477266">15</xref></sup> Nehru set a world precedent with the ‘biggest experiment in democracy in human history’—universal adult suffrage with a largely illiterate population (in 1951, 16.6 per cent were literate)—upon the highly fragmented and culturally heterogeneous space of newly independent India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0257643013477266">16</xref></sup> In contrast with West European, state socialist and other post-colonial societies, industrial development was undertaken with universal adult franchise. The driving principle of Nehruism was that economic development and political freedom are inextricably joined in democratic nation-making and cannot be legitimately separated. Nehru called this an ‘experiment’ without ‘parallel anywhere in the world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0257643013477266">17</xref></sup> The Nehruvian transition involved shifting to specific policies and political tactics, demonstrating a preference for pluralist and non-interventionist solutions to the myriad centre/state and civil society dilemmas of the early Indian republic. In Nehru’s policy the ethic of reconciliation generated under Gandhi’s leadership was exemplified in the language policy, the process of linguistic state reorganization and the tribal policy, all of which presented a complex and multi-sided interaction of popular movements, civil society and ruling/opposition parties within a broad national context comprising both rural and urban areas. The state adopted an arbitrating and mediating role, in an endorsement of self-reliance and the ethic of reconciliation over final closure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0257643013477266">18</xref></sup> Nehru stated that ‘this is too large a country with too many legitimate diversities to permit any so-called “strong man” to trample over the people and their ideas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0257643013477266">19</xref></sup> Regarding the 400 different tribal people spread all over India with their distinctive languages and cultures, Nehru deemed it ‘absurd’ to use the term ‘backward’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0257643013477266">20</xref></sup> His policy aimed at ‘integrating the tribal people … even while maintaining their distinct identity and culture’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0257643013477266">21</xref></sup> He warned against any politics contributing to their becoming ‘drab imitations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0257643013477266">22</xref></sup> The required changes in modern medical facilities, agriculture and education would be ‘worked out by tribals themselves’, rather than imposed coercively from the outside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0257643013477266">23</xref></sup> For Nehru, national development and freedom, based on the principle of non-violence, were inextricably linked.</p>
<p>In the same spirit, Nehru identified the link between dogmatic certainty and political violence: ‘[I]n the Soviet Union and China, there is only one line to follow [and] people are not free to criticize it’; thus ‘human beings cannot develop fully’ (that is, in the democratic self-learning process).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0257643013477266">24</xref></sup> Nehru argued that the methods these societies ‘adopted were usually violent [and] wrong means would not lead to good results’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0257643013477266">25</xref></sup> This was an echo of Gandhi’s views: In 1924 he said that while admiring the Bolsheviks’ ‘motives’ he was an ‘uncompromising opponent of violent methods’ and did not ‘believe in short-violent-cuts to success’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0257643013477266">26</xref></sup> He criticized Bolshevism in 1919 for its obsession with ‘materialistic advancement as a goal’ at the expense of ‘liberty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0257643013477266">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question of how the revolution translates into a post-revolutionary order—a concern with the potential abyss between theory and practice—goes back at least to the late eighteenth-century German <italic>Aufklarung</italic> (that is, Kant and Herder) in its obsessive meditations on why the rational promise of the 1789 French Revolution transformed into the oppressive bloodbath of the Terror and Napoleonic dictatorship. This has been generally posed as an epistemic problem: If we cannot know the world (as it is ‘in itself’), then how can we pass into action with any confidence in the consequences of our line of practice? This is a question that has been bemoaned as much by Marxist observers of the Soviet experiment as by American ‘policy experts’ watching bloody chaos unravel in occupied Iraq. Both points of view take for granted the impeccable credentials of violence, provided that it is linked to certain knowledge. The unifying coherence of the Gandhi–Nehru experience provides precisely the opposite lesson: The modern compound of political violence linked to a dogmatic claim to inherent truth/rightness necessarily destabilizes efforts to build an open and democratic modern society. For Gandhi, ‘man is not capable of knowing the absolute truth and therefore is not competent to punish’. It was the ‘inability to know this absolute truth that required he maintain an unceasingly open approach to those who would differ from him’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0257643013477266">28</xref></sup> This epistemic claim provided the limit of non-violence designed to preserve a condition of dialogic openness. A strong believer in democracy, Gandhi rejoiced upon learning of the new Turkish Parliament in 1908: ‘the world over, we hear the cry of swarajya’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0257643013477266">29</xref></sup> He led the mass movement in the belief that ‘political emancipation means the rise of mass consciousness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0257643013477266">30</xref></sup> However, he rejected the idea that emancipation could be achieved through authoritarian means: ‘[T]he spirit of democracy is not a mechanical thing to be adjusted by the abolition of forms.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0257643013477266">31</xref></sup> Along the same lines, Nehru identified democracy with a ‘peaceful method of working’ and being ‘open to free discussion’ where ‘minorities, religious or otherwise, must have their say’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0257643013477266">32</xref></sup> He regularly argued that ‘forced imposition of ideas on any section of the population is bound to fail’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0257643013477266">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the major contributions of the Gandhi–Nehru experience was the undoing of an inside/out dichotomy as the defining framework of modernity (that is, vis-à-vis tradition, and so on)—as modernity had been hitherto understood from the French Revolution through Comte and his practical heir in Kemal Ataturk; leading twentieth-century Marxist and liberal ideologues; and of course the Islamist leaders of Iran’s 1979 revolution and the many millennialist movements for a new dawn they inspired. The Gandhi–Nehru experience, in rejecting modernity as an inside/out dichotomy, thereby also denies the possibility of totalizing liberation from either modernity or tradition. Instead, the principle of non-violence entails the purposeful derivation of the best democratic potential of both modernity and tradition, and the negation of their coercive and violent aspects. Examined closely, this suggests a political line embracing Amartya Sen’s conception of freedom as capabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0257643013477266">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gandhi–Nehru experience can be identified—in a way that is not a priori—with the political and intellectual heritage of the democratic Enlightenment. Sunil Khilnani has identified democratic India as ‘the third moment in the great democratic experiment launched at the end of eighteenth century by the American and French revolutions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0257643013477266">35</xref></sup> This third moment differs, however, because it introduces a different type of nationalism. It is a concept of nationalism without essence or enemies, generated through the Gandhian experience of non-violent struggle but formative in shaping the politics of the Nehru period. On the international front, following the devastating 1962 war with China, Nehru continued to maintain that ‘We should not … think in terms of permanent enemies and we should always leave the door open for friendship’—extending the Gandhian logic of nationalism without enemies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0257643013477266">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most striking and controversial point in the coherence of the Gandhi–Nehru experience is the phenomenon of secularism. It is also the most illuminating in revealing the interconnectedness of a distinctive worldview common to Gandhi and Nehru. The politics of secularism—for both of them—aimed to preserve a public space for multiple points of view and lines of action opened up during the non-violent national struggle for independence. Gandhi insisted that he was ready to ‘die for [his religion], but that is my personal affair. The state has nothing to do with it. The state would look after your secular welfare, health, communication, foreign relations, currency and so on, but not your, or my, religion. That is everybody’s personal concern.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0257643013477266">37</xref></sup> India, from the late nineteenth century, saw the emergence of three strategies of national mobilization: secularism, Hindu nationalism and Muslim separatism. In this modern politics of the nation-state, the stakes concerned uniting either the entire Indian population or one of the two largest segments in the intensifying contest for power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0257643013477266">38</xref></sup> With the partition of British India, India chose a secular constitution while Pakistan chose to be an Islamic Republic. In Pakistan, Nehru saw the communal ideological drive to ‘differentiate and create two classes of citizens (…) the latter having some kind of inferior status and less opportunities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0257643013477266">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secularism—not as a substantive worldview/programme negating all historical– religious claims to truth, but rather as a political principle where no single religion must predominate via the state in the establishment of public meaning—was very much the common outlook of Gandhi and Nehru. Ataturk (by contrast) rejected the participation of religious values and ideas in the Turkish nation-making process in the name of a substantive new worldview/programme intended as a purely modern rupture from, and supersession of, the past. Meaning, in its subordinate relation to power, was reduced to a unilinear historicist vision implemented through violence. On this basis he refused Turkish citizens both voting rights and the liberty to construct autonomous civil society organs, until the new worldview could be inculcated in the population from above. Gandhi and Nehru, by contrast, envisioned a potentially positive role for traditional religious values and meanings in the struggle to create a democratic and independent India. Both Gandhi and Nehru saw India’s main strength in a multi-religious and tolerant historical existence. Nehru became gradually convinced that ‘what had kept India going was … a varied and tolerant culture’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0257643013477266">40</xref></sup> He said that ‘in its wider and deeper conception [religion] can be something of great value to life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0257643013477266">41</xref></sup> He rejected doing violence to the ‘traditional past’ in the name of ‘reason’, saying ‘we cannot uproot all our history just because some abstract logic requires it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0257643013477266">42</xref></sup> This open attitude to tradition entailed a continual negotiation of public meaning in order to develop India’s democratic potential and negate the multiple coercive legacies of the traditional past—the importance of <italic>meaning</italic> in nation-making was the equal to that of <italic>power</italic>. Yet both Gandhi and Nehru were united in subordinating religious lifeworlds to critical humanist values, striving to eliminate violence and coercive structures inherited from India’s traditional past. Committed to a democratic reordering of society, they were far from any kind of ethical relativism. Gandhi insisted that ‘intolerance of criticism is inconducive to the growth of national life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0257643013477266">43</xref></sup> They simply insisted that these changes could not happen effectively through violence from above. Legislation against untouchability, for example, was the surface of a deeper dialogic process and public struggle underway in modern India. Nehru said in 1950:
<disp-quote>
<p>Culture … cannot be imposed from outside. That inner growth can be influenced greatly, more especially in early childhood, by the environment, by educational processes …. But whatever the means adopted, the growth must come from the inside. To tell a man … to change his culture appears to me to have no meaning. The only thing we can do is to produce conditions which gradually influence him in the direction of changing his cultural outlook.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0257643013477266">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That is, Nehru saw the struggle over values and meanings from the Independence struggle period extending into post-Independence society as an ongoing and unfinished process, dependent upon the democratic aspirations of Indians themselves.</p>
<p>The significance of Indian secularism (that is, as it differs from that of Ataturk who modelled himself on the French historical experience) is two-fold: first, that the Gandhi–Nehru experience intentionally fostered the growth of autonomous Indian civil society based on the principle of self-reliance. This was a central driving force in the Independence movement and was subsequently protected through the post-Independence constitutional framework (civil and oppositional sources of power in universities, the media, trade unions, parties and so on, essential to the functioning and survival of Indian democracy). It testifies to the priority of dialogic openness in the nation-making process—or consensus as a provisional and context-specific end in moments of conflict resolution rather than consensus as a binding ontological point of departure. The assumption of such a point of departure entails a closed horizon of ultimate synthesis (that is, a single national identity or public meaning). It follows that there was no state ideology claiming total truth (that is, as a single substantive worldview, the modern over the traditional, and so on) but instead a deliberate principle of pluralism. Nehru warned of the ‘danger’ in ‘metaphysical generalizations’ which ‘though seeming to embody higher truths, do not help us very much in our daily tasks’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0257643013477266">45</xref></sup> In 1957 Nehru described socialism as ‘a growing conception, as a thing that is not rigid, as a thing that must fit in with the changing conditions of human life and activity in every country’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0257643013477266">46</xref></sup> He saw freedom not as a seamless metaphysical web—and this was reflected in the structure of the Constitution—but as the ongoing <italic>maintenance</italic> of conflicting and mutually subverting freedoms. Second, Indian secularism within the Gandhi–Nehru ambit necessarily took an uncompromising stance against bids for political power based on romantic nativist discourses of religious identity—this too was a crucial precondition for preserving a politics of pluralism (this does not differ from the Ataturk experience, save that for Ataturk an alternative modern absolute identity had to be promoted with a view to ultimate supersession—and <italic>then</italic> democracy).</p>
<p>Nehru defined democracy as ‘a manner of thinking, a manner of action, a manner of behaviour to your neighbour and to your adversary and opponent’, that is, as a dialogic principle and respect for the person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0257643013477266">47</xref></sup> Affirming self-reliance, he hoped to ‘unleash forces from below among our people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0257643013477266">48</xref></sup> Centring self-reliance and maximum popular participation, Nehru said in 1957:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]f there is real democracy in India, we have to involve the maximum number of people in the task of decision-making and implementation… The modern nations in particular cannot grow unless the responsibility is delegated to the people… Democracy is not a matter of passing laws, it has to take roots among the people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0257643013477266">49</xref></sup></p>

<p>He said that ‘democracy is not merely a question of elections’ but the ‘democratic spirit’ that ‘we hope will grow with outward forms of democracy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0257643013477266">50</xref></sup> If there was a failure in Nehruvian politics, it was an excessive belief in the spontaneity of the masses and the neglect—unlike Gandhi—in creating institutions or structures through which people could be mobilized and educated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0257643013477266">51</xref></sup> Yet his statement that India ‘won our independence through a bloodless revolution in conditions of honour and dignity both to ourselves and to the erstwhile rulers of our country’ affirms the link to the Gandhian spirit of institution-building with a view to self-reliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0257643013477266">52</xref></sup> Above all, Nehru, like Gandhi, was a believer in growth over final ends. Gandhi had argued that ‘there is no such thing as perfect rest or repose in this visible universe of ours’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0257643013477266">53</xref></sup> Therefore, the instant that we ‘slavishly copy the past’ we ‘cease to grow’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0257643013477266">54</xref></sup> This was the basis for the Gandhian temporal horizon of growth over final ends: ‘Our explorations should take place in the direction of determining not the definition of an undefinable term like <italic>Swaraj</italic> but in discovering the ways and means’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0257643013477266">55</xref></sup> This is comparable to John Dewey’s reconstructed temporality where those ‘who are less absolutist may be content to think that, morally speaking, growth is a higher value and ideal than is sheer attainment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0257643013477266">56</xref></sup> Nehru’s consistent preoccupation with the means to socialism—context-specific and immanent rather than the historical conquest of utopia by any means—had to be democratic: ‘We have definitely accepted the democratic process … We think that in the final analysis it promotes the growth of human beings and of society … [W]e want the creative and adventurous spirit of man to grow’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0257643013477266">57</xref></sup> This is a point of view grounded in the Gandhian principle of non-violence and the Gandhian temporal horizon of growth over final ends.</p>
<p>It explains why Nehru was committed—despite difficulties this posed for justice and development—to seeing nation-making unfold at the slower pace constrained by a democratic legal framework. He said: ‘It is not enough for us merely to produce the material goods of the world [and] to have high standards of living … at the expense of the spirit of man’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0257643013477266">58</xref></sup> Thus Nehru criticized countries such as the Soviet Union and China which industrialized far more quickly under authoritarian states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0257643013477266">59</xref></sup> He envisioned the state as an instrument of <italic>maintenance</italic> in the everyday sphere (improving the quality of people’s lives) rather than the <italic>conquest</italic> of the metaphysical absolute (the birth of a new world). Hence Nehru, again following Gandhi, accepted fallibility by indicating ‘plenty of failings in the Congress’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0257643013477266">60</xref></sup> He accordingly urged, in temporally open fashion, that ‘no plan is static and we must keep wide awake all the time in line with changing conditions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0257643013477266">61</xref></sup> Nehru affirmed the modesty of thought. Science, technology and economic development were to improve the broad public welfare and provided a critical function in rational analysis—they did not represent a ‘whole’ claim to metaphysical truth intended to eternally supersede ‘ordinary’ worldviews (as in the positivism that inspired the violent Kemalist Westernization drive).</p>
<p>The Indian national movement and the Nehru period were commonly grounded in Enlightenment universalism; but this was not the universalist assumption that ‘we’ can understand any and all ‘alien beings’ in order to assimilate them to our ‘rationality’. It was rather a context-specific universalism grounded in respect for difference without the need to necessarily ‘understand’ it. The aim was concerned with non-violent conflict resolution in a society of difference. Hence the centrality of dialogue linked to belief in the practical imperative of non-violence rather than universal epistemic finality. Consensus ceases to be an ontological point of departure and instead functions as a recurring provisional condition within a democratic–dialogic framework. This affirmed Western intellectual traditions such as Montesquieu’s ideas on the need for division of power or Emerson’s ideal of self-reliance; but it also drew from Indian traditions such as the Jaina doctrine of the ‘many-sidedness’ of religious truth (<italic>anekantavada)</italic> where it is ‘presumption for any human group to claim to have possession of absolute truth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0257643013477266">62</xref></sup> The ethic of reconciliation entails an open and cosmopolitan horizon. This ongoing ethic without closure is based on the premise of difference rather than homogeneity as the prior necessary condition for national cohabitation. The mutation in the conventional nationalist paradigm articulated by the Gandhi–Nehru experience confronted core problems of modern national politics inherited from the French Revolutionary experience: the forcible assimilation of minorities; the notion of a violent war of modern ideas on the past; and the tendency to an absolutist statist ideology championing a single truth system targeting a historical ‘end product’ through violent means.</p>
