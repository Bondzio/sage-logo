<p>Regulation of athletes’ bodies is commonplace in sporting environments, despite evidence that athletes have a higher risk of developing disordered eating than non-athletes. This article explores how athletes’ bodies are regulated in practice, building on examinations of body surveillance in other contexts. Over 40 interactions occurring during body monitoring are analysed. Athletes, pre-emptively or following an explicit request, accounted for their body regulatory behaviours, also working to produce positive athlete identities. Failing to produce an account of improvement was interactionally problematic, making visible athletes’ accountability to the institute to regulate their bodies. Implications of body regulatory practices are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The body weight and physique of athletes has become focal for coaches and training staff in elite sporting environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>). Idealized standards of weight and body composition<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105311417914">1</xref></sup> have been devised for most sports and are routinely policed within sporting contexts. In particular, considerable research (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311417914">Malina, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>) has indicated that body fat is negatively related to performance, especially in endurance sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311417914">Hawley and Burke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417914">Ostojic, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>). This research has not gone unchallenged, however. Studies have typically been based on cross-sectional rather than longitudinal research and, as such, the influence of changing body composition on performance over time for individual athletes has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311417914">Hawley and Burke, 1998</xref>). Nonetheless, pressure to reduce body fat in order to optimize performance remains commonplace within sporting environments.</p>
<p>Given the demands to reduce body fat and thereby improve performance, numerous tests have been devised to assess body composition (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311417914">Bioanalogics, 2004</xref>). Skinfold testing is a widely-used technique, where folds of skin and subcutaneous fat beneath are pinched and measured (with callipers) at different sites around the body (including abdominal, iliac crest, quadriceps). Using one of several available equations, the total score from the skinfolds is converted to give an approximation of overall body fat percentage (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417914">Bouchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311417914">Otte et al., 2000</xref>). Regular testing of skinfolds is routine within many elite sporting contexts.</p>
<p>Although the reduction of body fat can lead to performance gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311417914">Hawley and Burke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311417914">Ostojic, 2006</xref>), reducing it too far can have physical and psychological health consequences. Reducing fat too much can result in decreased performance, fatigue, anaemia and increases in illness and injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417914">Bouchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>). Athletic pressure to reduce body fat has also been linked with psychological concerns. In particular, it has been suggested that pressure from the sporting environment to reduce fat and to perform at an optimal level, can lead to the development of eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311417914">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311417914">Malina, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311417914">Papathomas and Lavallee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>) and social physique anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311417914">Haase, 2009</xref>). Moreover, the development of an exclusive identity as an athlete has been shown to leave athletes vulnerable to eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311417914">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311417914">Papathomas and Lavallee, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311417914">Jones et al. (2005)</xref> suggest that when athletes’ identity is strongly or exclusively formed in terms of being an athlete, self-worth becomes overly dependent on performance outcomes and success. As a result, athletes may experience increased fear of failure and vulnerability to critcism of their sporting abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311417914">Papathomas and Lavallee, 2006</xref>). Hence, a more diverse identity may reduce the susceptibility of athletes to develop disordered eating.</p>
<p>Compared with non-athlete populations, athletes have been shown to have a higher risk of developing eating disorders and sub-clinical disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311417914">Brewer and Petrie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311417914">Milligan and Pritchard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311417914">Sundgot-Borgen and Klungland Torstveit, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311417914">Wilson and Eldredge, 1992</xref>). Disordered eating refers to eating behaviours that do not meet full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311417914">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) for Anorexia or Bulimia Nervosa (behaviours occur either less frequently or with less severity), yet are still problematic and can lead to long-term health consequences. A number of studies have demonstrated the prevalence of disordered eating in athlete populations. A study of the population of male and female Norwegian elite athletes estimated prevalence rates of clinical and subclinical eating disorders to be 13.5 percent compared with 4.6 percent of age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311417914">Sundgot-Borgen and Klungland Torstveit, 2004</xref>). Studies exploring student-athletes within the US College system have reported higher prevalence rates of disordered eating (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311417914">Johnson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311417914">Milligan and Pritchard, 2006</xref>), possibly reflecting differences in culture and sporting systems.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reduced energy intake resulting from disordered eating, in combination with large energy expenditure from intense training, can lead to amenorrhea<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359105311417914">2</xref></sup> (the absence of three or more menstrual cycles, or delayed menarche) in female athletes. Amenorrhea can subsequently lead to osteopaenia (a precursor to osteoporosis involving loss of bone density or the failure to gain optimal bone density) and, ultimately, osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417914">Bouchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311417914">Hawley and Burke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311417914">Yeager et al., 1993</xref>). This combination of disordered eating, amenorrhea and osteopaenia is known as the female athlete triad<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1359105311417914">3</xref></sup>, a sport-specific health concern that can lead to long-term psychological and physical health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311417914">Gottschlich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311417914">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>). Premature bone density loss can be particularly problematic as it increases the risk of stress fractures and other injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417914">Bouchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311417914">Yeager et al., 1993</xref>). In addition, the rapid loss of bone density is not totally reversible and, consequently, increases the risk of developing osteoporosis. Although non-athletes can experience the female athlete triad, prevalence is much higher amongst athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311417914">Brewer and Petrie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311417914">Khan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311417914">Yeager, et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the prevalence and associated long-term health consequences of the triad conditions, the management and surveillance of athletes’ bodies within the sporting context is a delicate matter. Sporting organizations are focused on maximizing performance, albeit potentially to the detriment of athletes’ well-being. How such regulation and surveillance of athletes’ bodies occurs in practice has not previously been explored. The present study examines interactions that occur during skinfold testing within an Australian Sport Institute/Academy network. Within this institutional setting, athletes are subject to routine skinfold testing to assess body composition. Athletes hold scholarships with the institutes in this network, entitling them to a range of services including coaching, performance analysis, nutrition, psychology and strength and conditioning coaching. As a condition of the scholarship, athletes sign agreements that involve targets for body composition including targeted skinfold scores. Failure to comply with these agreements can result in loss of scholarship.</p>
<p>Interactions that occur during body composition testing of elite athletes have not previously been explored. Extant research has considered interactions occurring during other forms of body regulation, such as during obesity consultations in health-settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311417914">Webb, 2009</xref>) and in the context of commercial weight-management groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>). The focus of such research has been on the functions that talk accomplishes in the interactions, rather than aiming to provide insight into the thoughts and feelings of individuals about the practices in which they are engaging. For example, in an analysis of nurse-patient interactions during weighing of patients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore (2006)</xref> showed that patients pre-emptively oriented to changes in their weight in order to display themselves as good patients who monitor their health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311417914">Mycroft (2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">2008</xref>) demonstrated how weight-loss group members produced pre-emptive accounts of weight gain to manage self-presentation when they had gained weight. In such pre-emptive accounts, group members typically oriented to themselves as having been ‘bad’ or eaten ‘badly’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311417914">Webb (2009)</xref> explored interactions where patients reported their weight to doctors. In these interactions, doctors did not explicitly request an account around patient’s changes in weight; however, patients treated initial greetings as requests for accounts. Patients then produced accounts externalizing responsibility in instances of weight gain, yet accepting agency in cases where weight had decreased.</p>
<p>In the studies outlined previously, the individuals being assessed were overweight and were engaging in body regulation for themselves (for health or other reasons). In this article, however, analysis explores how body regulation and management are routinely accomplished within an elite sporting environment where those being assessed are already in peak physical condition and are required by the institute to engage in body regulation. In particular, this article examines how athletes account for their body composition, while simultaneously orienting to themselves as elite athletes who are required to regulate and manage their athletic bodies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data consist of interactions occurring during over 40 skinfold testing sessions of 31 different athletes taking place within an Australian network of sport institutes and academies. The testing was conducted by one of three Exercise Physiologists, often with a physiology student also present. Those being tested were junior elite athletes, competing either nationally or internationally in their age groups in a variety of sports including netball, diving, trampolining, sailing and water polo. Two-thirds of tested athletes were female, and ages ranged from 13 to 23 years. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee. Coaches were approached for permission to work with their squads. Coaches informed athletes of the study and the researchers gained athletes’ (and guardians’ where applicable) consent and audio recorded the interactions. Recordings were transcribed according to the Jeffersonian transcription system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311417914">Jefferson, 2004</xref>). All names and identifying features were removed from transcripts.</p>
<p>Analysis drew on the principles of Discursive Psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311417914">Edwards and Potter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311417914">Potter, 1996</xref>) informed by Conversation Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311417914">Sacks, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311417914">Schegloff, 2006</xref>), exploring recurrent patterns of interaction and the way in which interaction is collaboratively accomplished. Particularly of focus were the systematic ways in which accounts around body composition were co-produced in testing sessions. In accounting for, and describing, behaviours and actions, talk displays the appropriateness or inappropriateness of such behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311417914">Drew, 1998</xref>). As such, talk also orients to, and produces, identities for individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311417914">Davies and Harré, 1990</xref>). Accordingly, the ways in which identities were jointly accomplished within the co-production of accounts was also a focus of analysis.</p>
<p>In analysing the skinfold data, the interactions were broken down into sections: Openings, the testing period and closings. Each section was analysed to explore the similarities and differences in how athletes’ behaviours were talked about and discussed and how identities were produced across the different testing sessions. The openings, in which athletes produced accounts around their behaviour, were then analysed in more depth. The specific conversational turns produced during the accounts were examined line by line to see how the talk was organized and what athletes and exercise physiologists made relevant and achieved in each turn at talk.</p>
<sec id="section3-1359105311417914">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>During the interactions, athletes produced either one of two types of accounts of their body regulatory behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1359105311417914">4</xref></sup>. In around one-quarter of instances, athletes produced pre-emptive accounts of their test results in the opening turns of the interactions, typically projecting an increase in skinfolds. In the remaining interactions when pre-emptive accounts were not produced, athletes accounted for their body regulatory behaviours in response to an explicit request from the Exercise Physiologist (EP). Both types of accounting will be examined below.</p>
<sec id="section4-1359105311417914">
<title>Pre-emptive accounts</title>
<p>In pre-emptive accounts, responsibility for failure to improve body composition was ascribed to external factors. While in other contexts, those being weighed projected weight gain in terms of their own bad behaviour, athletes in the present data worked to manage their identity as athletes, avoiding presenting themselves as having acted inappropriately by not working towards improved body composition. The following extracts provide examples of pre-emptive accounts. Extract 1 comes from the beginning of the testing session of a teenage female athlete. The pre-emptive account begins early in the interaction, just before testing commences (which begins at line 5 with the EP reading the score for triceps).</p>

<p>19 EP: r<underline>ig</underline>ht</p>
<p>The initial question from the EP at line 1, asking the athlete to recall the previous test result orients to the institutional context within which the measuring is done. Within this context athletes are required to engage in body regulation. The opening question in the form of an interrogative implies that the athlete should know her previous scores and, thus, be engaged in surveillance of her body. The repetition of the (emphasized) athlete’s name by EP (line 3) in exasperated intonation, in response to the answer that the athlete cannot remember (line 2), can arguably be heard as a telling-off of the athlete. Telling-off suggests the need for athletes within this context to monitor and survey their bodies.</p>
<p>The athlete then begins to produce a pre-emptive account (line 4) that can be heard to imply potentially poor skinfolds. In nurse-patient interactions during weighing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore (2006)</xref> showed that patients estimate increases in their weight to demonstrate that they are good patients who are aware of their weight. Similarly, in the present extract, in producing a pre-emptive account implying skinfold increases, the athlete is able to present herself as currently (even if not previously) aware of her body composition and, thus, engaging in required body surveillance. The offering of a pre-emptive account, then, allows the athlete to attend to her identity by presenting herself as acting appropriately (by monitoring her body).</p>
<p>In producing the pre-emptive account, agency for the potential score increase is ascribed to external and uncontrollable factors, in this instance illness. Formulating the account in terms of having been ‘really sick’ ‘for the past month’ implies an inability to train and a resultant failure to improve body composition. The use of ‘really’ emphasizes the severity of the illness, countering potential claims that the athlete may have been able to continue training and improving body composition throughout the illness. Likewise, describing the illness as month-long further defends against claims that the athlete may have been able to improve body composition since the previous testing session prior to becoming ill. The account culminates with the upshot ‘it’s locked me up basically’ (line 18), which arguably functions similarly to idiomatic expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311417914">Drew and Holt, 1988</xref>), working, in instances where there has been a lack of alignment between speaker and recipient, to end the account while simultaneously enhancing its legitimacy.</p>
<p>The externalization of agency further manages identity. Rather than present herself as having failed to exercise enough, the athlete locates responsibility for increased skinfolds in external factors beyond her control. Accordingly, the athlete can produce an account of potentially bad scores without presenting herself as failing to act appropriately. Such pre-emptive accounting contrasts with accounts seen in weight management groups where members made explicit reference to themselves having been ‘bad’ or ‘naughty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>). In the present data, for athletes to present themselves as acting badly would fail to meet institutional requirements.</p>
<p>The following extract provides an example of an additional way in which pre-emptive accounts were produced. In this pre-emptive account, injury or illness is not held accountable (as was seen in around half of instances), yet responsibility for potential skinfold increases is still externalized. This extract again constitutes the opening lines of the interaction between EP, the athlete and a physiology student and begins before the weight of the athlete is discussed. In many testing sessions, weight is measured and discussed. However, weight and skinfold scores measure different aspects of the body and changes in weight do not necessarily translate into changes in skinfolds (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Unlike the previous example, the athlete produces an explicit account of increased skinfolds (lines 2,3 and 4). The forecasting of score increases was typically more explicit when pre-emptive accounts were not framed around illness or injury. Accounts of injury and illness are perhaps more hearable as resulting in failure to improve body composition. The athlete prefaces her account of why her skinfolds may have increased with ‘oh I dunno’ (line 15). Oh-prefaced responses to inquiries can indicate that the recipient views the question as problematic, with oh-prefacing often signalling reluctance to continue with the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311417914">Heritage, 1998</xref>). The use of ‘I don’t know’ can also be used to avoid developing a line of questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311417914">Hutchby, 2002</xref>). As such, the request for details can be viewed as problematic for the athlete, perhaps orienting to difficulties of producing accounts around skinfold increases without presenting behaviour as inappropriate.</p>
<p>The reason for the potential increase is then formulated in terms of the athlete being ‘hungrier’ (line 15). This account implies that she has been eating more. However, rather than produce an account of increased eating, as weight loss group members did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>), this formulation locates control outside of the athlete, allowing her to remain non-accountable. Indeed, the athlete fails to provide an account of her actions in response to this hunger. It could be argued that being hungrier need not necessarily result in increased skinfolds and that athletes could, and perhaps should, continue to eat appropriate proportions regardless of changes in appetite. In remaining vague around her actions, the athlete further avoids presenting herself as having acted inappropriately by overeating. The use of ‘just’ (lines 15–16; ‘I’ve just been hungrier lately’), works to present the externally determined hunger as the <italic>only</italic> factor contributing to the potential skinfold increase. The repetition of the ‘hungrier’ formulation (lines 15 and 17) with the use of ‘actually’ and the unfinished ‘not just’ (which could be heard as continuing to say ‘not just an excuse’, ‘not just saying that’, etc.) works to emphasize the athlete’s account while also countering potential counter claims that this is not a legitimate excuse. Therefore, in formulating the account with agency externalized, the athlete was able to manage identity by avoiding depicting failure to engage in required body regulating behaviours. Moreover, as was also seen in Extract 1, the athlete oriented to awareness of body composition and regulation to manage identity as a good athlete who is both aware of, and monitoring, body composition.</p>

<title>Requested accounts</title>
<p>When athletes did not produce pre-emptive accounts early in the interaction, EPs routinely made explicit requests for accounts of athletes’ body regulatory behaviours (ie, eating, exercise etc.). The requesting of accounts here differs from other contexts of body regulation in which either a) accounts were not requested nor contextually required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore, 2006</xref>) or b) opening greetings were heard as requests for accounts, but accounts were not explicitly requested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311417914">Webb, 2009</xref>). Following requests from EPs, athletes produced accounts of positive behavioural change. However, these accounts were typically vague and hedged in order to avoid presenting themselves as previously having acted inappropriately and also to manage the potential of increased skinfolds. Extract 3 provides an illustration of how accounts of behavioural change were explicitly requested and produced. It comes from early in the interaction, after initial greetings had taken place.</p>

<p>As was typical throughout the dataset, an explicit request for an account is made by EP (lines 1–4). Requesting an account makes visible the role of the EP in regulating athletes’ body management behaviour within this institutional context. Body regulation is required by the institute, and, therefore, as is evidenced by explicit requests for accounts, athletes are accountable to the institute (rather than to themselves) for body composition. Moreover, formulating the request in terms of changes that have been made implies that athletes should have changed behaviour.</p>
<p>As shown in Extract 3, athletes typically produced vague accounts of behavioural change in terms of ‘eating’ and food intake. Throughout this interaction, EP requests further detail (lines 6, 8 and 16–17). The continued requests for details place the athlete in a difficult position; needing to produce a detailed account of the change, while avoiding presenting herself as having previously acted inappropriately by not engaging in body regulatory behaviours. Identity management is particularly evident in lines 18–19, where the athlete immediately responds to the EP in terms of having not previously eaten ‘bad stuff’. In suggesting she was eating ‘lots of stuff’, the athlete allows room to show improvement (ie, reduced food intake) without presenting herself as having previously acted inappropriately by consuming ‘bad’ foods. The upgrade to lots of ‘good stuff’ (lines 20–21), further attends to identity, presenting herself as eating appropriately. The vagueness of the account (eg, repeated use of ‘stuff’, ‘lots of stuff’, ‘like eating’ etc.), despite the repeated requests from EP for further information, arguably highlights the difficulty of producing an account around change without allowing a negative self-presentation of previous behaviour. Such accounting contrasts with that typical in weight-loss groups, where members routinely produced accounts of having eaten ‘badly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>). This contrast may reflect athletes’ institutional accountability for body composition and behaviour.</p>
<p>Following the account, EP produces the upshot that the athlete has reduced food volume (lines 26–27) and receives agreement from the athlete (line 28). EP then discusses seeing ‘what the results are’ (line 29–30). Within this context, not only do athletes need to produce accounts of change (while trying to avoid a negative self-presentation), but they produce these accounts in a context where a physiological measure may fail to show improvement in body composition. In Extract 3, the athlete orients to the potential difficulty of having produced an account of change prior to receiving results (‘I’m hoping it’s going to be lower’, line 31). In doing so, she flags that changes in eating might not be reflected in the results. Similar hedging of accounts was seen throughout the data with athletes orienting to the possibility that skinfolds may not reflect their efforts to regulate their bodies, thus, allowing them to produce accounts of positive change, yet leaving room for possible bad results.</p>
<p>The following extract provides an additional example of a typical way in which accounts were requested and produced. This extract occurs early in the interaction, following discussion of the athlete’s target score.</p>

<p>14 EP:    yep</p>
<p>As seen here, requests for accounts were, at times, framed specifically around eating, training, or exercise behaviours, rather than general behavioural change. As was typically seen, the request was framed in terms of changes made since the previous session (lines 1–3), orienting to a need for continual change and improvement. That is, asking athletes at each testing session about changes made, positions athletes as needing to continually make changes and strive to improve.</p>
<p>The athlete produces an account in terms of having eaten ‘healthier’. The use of ‘healthier’ as opposed to ‘healthy’ (for instance) enables the athlete to attend to identity, allowing for an account of change without presenting herself as having previously eaten unhealthy food. In response to the request for further detail (lines 6–7), the athlete suggests she has ‘cut out’ an extra food group. The athlete’s previous consumption of lollies is left vague; she may have consumed many lollies or only eaten unhealthy food on rare occasions. In suggesting she is cutting out unhealthy food, she presents herself as currently engaging in healthy eating practices without presenting herself as necessarily having previously consumed large quantities of lollies. Further evident is the hedging of this account (‘I feel’, line 4; ‘I’ve tried’, line 11). Such hedging softens the claims and can be seen as a way to manage the potential of increased skinfolds, which would undermine her account of improvement.</p>
<p>The previous extracts are typical examples of accounts produced throughout the dataset. However, one deviant case in the data did not follow the above pattern of producing an account of positive behavioural change. In this instance, the athlete instead produced an account of reducing (rather than improving) her body regulatory behaviour. This deviant case is shown in Extract 5. It also comes from early in the testing session, following a brief discussion of the athlete’s weight.</p>

<p>As was typical throughout the dataset, the EP produced an explicit request for an account. However, in contrast with the other accounts produced, the athlete formulates the account in terms of a reduction in training load (line 4–5). The self-repair from (what was presumably) ‘I’ve pulled back on my training’ (with li- presumably going to say like) to, instead, invoking the coach as the authority that she was training ‘too much’, justifies this behavioural change. Rather than present herself as having reduced her training load, the athlete (through the self-repair) frames herself as having previously trained ‘too much’ and, hence, reducing training is an appropriate action. Presenting training ‘too much’ as her coach’s words strengthens the claim of over-training and externalises agency for her behaviour, thereby allowing her to manage identity.</p>
<p>EP then requests an account for changes in eating (line 8). Here the athlete fails to produce an account of change. The hedging ‘mm’ and laughter at lines 9 and 11 indicate interactional difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311417914">Potter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311417914">Potter and Hepburn, 2010</xref>). To fail to produce an account of change (even in the context of having made appropriate changes to training) is hearably problematic within this context. This interactional difficulty orients to the need for body regulation and change. To have failed to make requisite changes and, therefore, not displayed appropriate athlete behaviour, is something that is problematic in this context.</p>
<p>Therefore, when athletes did not offer pre-emptive accounts, EPs requested accounts of change, orienting to the institutional requirements that athletes engage in ongoing improvement in body composition. In all but one instance, athletes produced accounts of having made positive changes, attending to their identity as athletes who should be engaging in body regulation. However, such accounts were typically hedged and vague, allowing athletes to manage the tension between needing to produce accounts of change, and (a) the possibility that testing would not show improvements in body composition and (b) to avoid presenting themselves as having previously acted inappropriately. As was seen in the deviant case, <italic>not</italic> producing an account of positive change was problematic, further showing how athletes are required to display engagement in improving body regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In interactions taking place during body composition testing within a Sport Institute/Academy context, athletes produced one of two types of accounts around body regulatory behaviour. Athletes either pre-emptively produced an account early in the interaction, or produced accounts in response to an explicit request from Exercise Physiologists. Similar to patients predicting weight increases to demonstrate that they were good patients who were aware of their weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore, 2006</xref>), athletes in the present data forecast skinfold increases to demonstrate that they are monitoring their bodies and, hence, are good athletes. Predicting failure to improve body composition, however, implies failure to engage in body regulation. To manage this, athletes routinely externalized agency for skinfold results. Externalization of agency was also noted in interactions when patients were telling weight news to doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311417914">Webb, 2009</xref>). The removal of agency was used by patients to manage moral dimensions associated with being obese. Within the present data, externalization allowed athletes to avoid presenting themselves as acting inappropriately (by failing to regulate their bodies) and, hence, allowed them to manage their identities as athletes.</p>
<p>When pre-emptive accounts were not offered, Exercise Physiologists prompted accounts regarding regulatory behaviour. In other contexts of body regulation, explicit requests for accounts were not seen: during weighing, patients and group members typically accounted for their weight, however, accounts were not requested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311417914">Pillet-Shore, 2006</xref>). When telling doctors weight news, patients treated initial greetings as requests for an account, yet requests were not explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311417914">Webb, 2009</xref>). In these other contexts, weight loss can be understood as taking place largely for the individual (for health or other benefits); hence, the individual is ultimately accountable to themselves for weight gain/loss. Within the sporting context, body regulation is an institutional requirement placed on athletes and, thus, athletes are accountable to the institute for their actions and bodies. Requesting accounts of change makes visible the institutional context in which improving body composition is required. As evidenced by the deviant case, failing to produce an account of improving body regulatory behaviours was problematic. In weight-loss groups, members typically produced accounts in terms of having eaten or acted ‘badly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311417914">Mycroft, 2008</xref>). However, within the sport context, where athletes are required to improve body composition and are accountable to the sporting body, athletes needed to produce accounts around positive behavioural change. Moreover, in requesting accounts at each testing session (often framed in terms of changes made since the previous test), athletes are positioned as needing to improve continually and engage in ongoing behavioural change.</p>
<p>In contrast with other contexts of body monitoring, where those being surveyed are overweight and typically being assessed for health reasons, athletes in the present sample are in peak physical condition. As seen in the data, in the sport context athletes are made <italic>more</italic> accountable for their body composition and actions. Orientation to expectations that athletes engage in self-surveillance is also evident during interactions. Such exploration of skinfold testing builds on existing body regulation literature from health and weight-loss contexts and provides insight into how body regulation is done in additional contexts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exploration of how body regulation is carried out in practice, and of the social actions accomplished in and through the interactions taking place, also contributes to traditional literature exploring behaviour and identity. For example, some theorists have argued that people often conform to or participate in behaviours that they are not necessarily in favour of due to a phenomenon labelled, pluralistic ignorance (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311417914">Miller and McFarland, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311417914">O’Gorman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311417914">Shelton and Richeson, 2005</xref>). Pluralistic ignorance refers to individuals’ erroneous impressions of others’ attitudes and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311417914">O’Gorman, 1986</xref>). Individuals over-estimate the extent to which others are favourable towards engaging in a given behaviour and, therefore, in order to manage the impression that the give to others, they engage in the behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311417914">Suls and Green, 2003</xref>). However, from a discursive psychological viewpoint, what individuals think and feel is not accessible or amenable to empirical exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311417914">Hepburn and Potter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311417914">Potter, 1996</xref>). Thus, rather than revealing athletes’ inner thoughts and feelings about whether they, or other athletes, are happy to be participating in body regulatory behaviours, the interactions analysed here can be viewed as performing actions in the social world, such as identity management. Rather than considering whether athletes have actually made the changes in regulatory behaviour that they claim, how they felt about these changes, or what they thought fellow athletes might think about such regulation, the current study highlights how athletes produced accounts during interactions taking place during body regulation in ways that presented them as good athletes.</p>
<p>In addition to building on previous literature, such as that dealing with body regulation, the present study may provide insight into athletes’ experiences and offer practical implications when working with athletes. Given the higher prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating amongst athlete populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311417914">Brewer and Petrie, 1996</xref>) and that Anorexia Nervosa is the third most common chronic illness amongst adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311417914">Beumont, 2000</xref>), orientation to accountability and expectations evident within these interactions may be problematic. While the aetiology of eating disorders is complex, pressures from social environments, as well as environmental stressors, are argued to contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311417914">Polivy and Herman, 2002</xref>). The direct accountability for athletes’ bodies within the sporting context needs to be considered when understanding the social environment in which athletes may develop disordered eating.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has been suggested that difficulties with identity or identity formation are central to the development of eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311417914">Polivy and Herman, 2002</xref>). Within athlete populations, when identity is highly invested in being an athlete, vulnerability to disordered eating increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311417914">Papathomas and Lavallee, 2006</xref>). Within the interactions, the relevance of presenting a good athlete identity is evident with athletes doing considerable work to manage their identity. As such, adequate body regulation can be seen as part of holding an appropriate athlete identity. Understanding the ways in which identity is oriented to and made relevant within these interactions may further aid understanding of the context in which athletes are vulnerable to disordered eating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over-reduction of body fat results in serious physical health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311417914">Bouchard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311417914">Yeager et al., 1993</xref>), yet requests for accounts are often framed such that athletes are positioned as needing to engage in ongoing reduction of body fat. The reframing of requests could be modified and perhaps, instead of implying the need for continual change, could orient to maintaining targeted scores. Although interactions were only recorded within one Sport Institute network, routine testing of body composition is commonplace throughout sporting environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311417914">Wilmore, 1992</xref>). It is likely that the way testing is conducted may be similar across alternate sport settings, something which may be beneficial for future research to explore.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the present study adds to literature regarding body regulation and monitoring, offering insights into similarities and differences of how body regulation occurs across contexts. Moreover, within the context of increased prevalence of disordered eating and the female athlete triad, the study provides insight into the practices surrounding athletes’ bodies and, hence, may contribute to understanding and improving athletes’ psychological and physical health.</p>
