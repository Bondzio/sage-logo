<p>Like Joel Wainwright, I first heard Kojin Karatani at the ‘Rethinking Marxism’ conference at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2006. To follow Karatani’s argument, that we need to think beyond the triad of capital-nation-state in order to imagine an alternative to capitalism, required agility and patience. And, as Wainwright notes in the introduction to his interview with Karatani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436931">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>), to conceptualize this necessary-but-impossible-articulation of an alternative (X) is an aporetical challenge. That is, while one cannot quite imagine a world beyond capital, one cannot <italic>not</italic> desire it. Of course Marx’s <italic>oeuvre</italic> is central to engaging that challenge. But for Karatani:<disp-quote>
<p>To understand Marx’s intervention, one has to bracket the conventional categories of political economy, philosophy, and political philosophy. It is necessary to observe Marx’s footwork, regardless of the targeted object. And in so doing, there is one clear thing that stands out – Marx’s thought existed as nothing other than a critique of previous thought. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436931">Karatani, 2003</xref>: 133)</p>
</disp-quote>
Likewise for Karatani the moral and political economic domains are ‘thoroughly inseparable’, and the task of analyzing capitalism to conceptualize a more just world is an ethico-economic one. To understand his contribution is to recognize that <italic>critique</italic> or <italic>transcritique</italic> – what he refers to as being transcendental and transversal simultaneously – is central to his method. This is especially true in <italic>Transcritique </italic>where he reads ‘Marx via Kant and Kant via Marx’ to scrutinize and reinterpret the world made by capital. In his exchanges with Wainwright, it is clear that his conceptualization of the alternative mode of exchange X emerges from the intertwined critiques of metaphysics and political economy. In their exchange, Wainwright examines the spatial or geographical dimensions of Karatani’s thoughts, and suggests ‘that transcritique is essentially a postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism’. In my commentary here, I examine this suggestion and its place in the debates regarding third world development and its alternatives.</p>
<p>The dialogue between economic geographers on the relationship between their work and development economics in the first issue of <italic>Dialogues in Human Geography</italic> (March 2011) provides a useful entry point. Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820612436931">Sheppard (2011a</xref>) initiates that dialogue by remarking on geography’s place in questioning [capitalist] development’s teleology. In his response to his colleagues (about the overlaps and disjunctures between geography and economics), Sheppard acknowledges that geographers are not the only critics of development, and concludes by asking:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612436931">1</xref>
</sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>How resilient is capitalist globalization <italic>tout court</italic>? Under what conditions will a persistent failure to deliver the goods to the bulk of people and places (not to mention the more-than-human world) arouse and connect variegated contestations across the global South … to mobilize alternative imaginaries and practices in ways that make a difference? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820612436931">Sheppard, 2011b</xref>: 101)</p>
</disp-quote>
A clue to Karatani’s response to these questions may be read in the Preface to <italic>Transcritique</italic> where he notes ‘[Marx’s] <italic>Capital</italic> does not offer an easy exit from capitalism; rather only by its very exitlessness does it suggest a possibility of practical intervention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436931">Karatani, 2003</xref>: ix) Karatani’s intervention is grounded in a non-teleological and transcritical engagement of Marx’s critique of capitalism. Unlike scientific and revolutionary Marxists, he argues that Marx neither predicted the collapse of capitalism nor advocated communism as an alternative to it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820612436931">2</xref>
</sup> Rather he traces capitalism’s dynamism and resilience through a retrospective focus on value theory in <italic>Capital</italic>.</p>
<p>To follow Karatani’s transcritical logic is to trace the intricate footwork of his thoughts, a task that Wainwright facilitates through probing questions. Karatani revisits Marx’s analysis of how value is produced under capitalism to flag its relative or relational nature. If the value of commodities is only determined relative to the value of other commodities, then not only the social relations of production but also the acts of exchange under capitalism deserve analytical and political scrutiny. Following this insight, Karatani argues that we might more productively see capitalism as a mode of exchange, and not just as a mode of production, and one that is global from the onset. Subsequently, he traces how a world economy based on commodity exchange emerges in relation to other modes of exchange and is consolidated through its tight linkages to the nation state.</p>
<p>Karatani abstracts from the history and geography of various social formations and relations of exchange to think about the possibility of a world beyond nation-state-capital. The outlines of a different world-system, one where other forms of exchange (pre-capitalist, free and reciprocal gift exchange) might prevail, may be imagined in his discussion of the mode of exchange X (Figures 1, 2 and 4) and the new associationist movements. That is, Karatani’s transcritique of the status quo is accompanied by a focus on alternatives, including a recovery of <italic>communism</italic> as a liberatory practice and thought. But this communism bears no relation to communism or state-socialism as they actually existed. Still less should his discussions of the associationist mode of exchange be confused with the popular and romantic proposals of <italic>postdevelopment</italic> and their promises of non-western utopias. In short, Karatani’s alternatives are neither revolutionary nor romantic. Rather as Wainwright reminds us ‘the grasp for associationism beyond the trinity of capital-state-nation is aporetical’. Facing this aporia opens the possibility of a practical intervention in the field of development through an ethico-economic critique.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2043820612436931">3</xref>
</sup> A brief sketch of the trajectory of development theory should clarify why such a critique is necessary.</p>
<p>The post-Second World War period is regularly and mistakenly taken as the beginning of development in the third world. Such is the ahistorical and uncritical view of ‘modernization’, the first formal ‘theory’ of third world development that emerged in the 1950s largely from US social sciences. Development and modernity’s close linkages to colonial expansion, Enlightenment ideals of progress through reason, and capitalism disappear in this telling. Colin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612436931">Leys (1996</xref>) explains that this early development theory ignores Marx and critical political economy because of its pragmatic and technocratic orientation, its ideological stakes in the cold war, and the centrality of the Bretton Woods institutions in fostering national economic growth. In the narratives of modernization theory and its twin, development economics, capitalist expansion along strictly patrolled national borders was the path to economic growth. The benefits of this growth were supposed to ‘trickle-down’, and lead to development and democracy. When ‘underdevelopment’ and poverty continued to plague the third world, its causes were traced to such ‘internal’ roadblocks to national capitalist accumulations as corruption and pesky, persistent ‘traditional values’. Needless to say, faith in rationality and capitalist modernity remained unshaken among modernization theorists. This faith in rationality also persists in their post-cold war successors and self-appointed world changers such as Jeffrey Sachs and Mohammed Yunus, whose millennium development goals and strategies to empower-through-microcredit are premised on a view of capitalist development as a solution, rather than a generator of inequalities.</p>
<p>In contrast, dependency and world-systems theorists such as Fernando Cardoso and Enzo Faletto, Andre Gunder Frank, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Samir Amin drew on their intellectual debt to Marx to argue that capitalist expansion depended on complex and unequal connections – between colonies, nations, and world markets. Furthermore, such capitalist development always expands unevenly, enriching some areas and impoverishing others, or forming ‘cores’ and ‘peripheries’. These critiques were also anti-colonial in their premise that imperial expansion was necessary for capitalist accumulation, and grew out of the persistent crises of capitalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820612436931">Wallerstein (1976</xref>) argues that the capitalist economy was not an aggregate of national economies but a ‘world-system’ that depended on global markets from the onset. Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612436931">Cardoso and Faletto (1979</xref>) also mobilized non-orthodox readings of Marx to contest ‘scientific’ models of development and structural explanations of economic inequality. However, the radical insights of such critiques all but disappeared when institutionalized in official development policy (as economic nationalist solutions such as Import Substitution Industrialization), as well as in the socialism advocated by those with a more political persuasion.</p>
<p>Radical analyses of underdevelopment also emerged from feminists. For example, Maria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612436931">Mies (1982</xref>) showed how capitalist accumulation (both colonial and national) necessarily depends on subsistence production and women’s labor. But this gendered contribution is invisibilized in the narratives of commodity production. Feminist analyses of gender and gendered relations of power were, and are, similarly absent from broader development and critical theories.</p>
<p>Marx is no more than a ghostly presence in the poststructuralist inspired ‘postdevelopmentalist’ critiques of development that emerged in the 1990s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2043820612436931">4</xref>
</sup> Arturo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612436931">Escobar (1995</xref>), the author most often associated with postdevelopment positions, draws on the work of Foucault and Said to trace the discursive productions and representations of the third world and its peoples as ‘underdeveloped’ objects and subjects in need of intervention. He maps the operations and effects of ‘third world development’, and argues that what undergirds them is the Eurocentric, western rationality inherited from colonial moves. The core of his critique is that colonial practices and the national economic development measures that followed after the end of formal colonialism erased or marginalized other cultural and economic logics. His solution is to recover subaltern ‘difference’ and reject development in favor of alternatives that emerge from outside its hegemonic reach. While Escobar’s postdevelopmentalism gestures at a postcolonial reading of third world development, he sidesteps Marx as being Eurocentric and thus does not engage in a serious critique of capital.</p>
<p>While necessary, this critique of Eurocentrism is inadequate for at least two reasons. First, it is logically inconsistent with postcolonial insights that the ‘West’ and the ‘Rest’ constitute each other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2043820612436931">5</xref>
</sup> Second, notwithstanding its desires for alternatives to capitalism, it cannot explain why they are not immanent. The rampant and violent expansion of capitalism in the 21st century indicates that capitalism remains ‘sticky’. Accounting for and critiquing the inequalities it engenders requires a serious engagement with the postcolonial insight that capitalist development emerges <italic>in relation to</italic>, and not just against, other logics.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612436931">Wainwright (2008</xref>) also remarks on these failures of postdevelopment and argues for a postcolonial Marxist critique of development, specifically ‘one that examines its power, its sway as an aporetical totality’ (p. 10).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2043820612436931">6</xref>
</sup> The aporetical totality of development is that ‘it was only development –not civilization, not modernity, not progress – that was universally taken up after the end of colonialism to define and organize the nation-state-capital triad everywhere’ (p. 12). The aporetical challenge of development is that ‘We cannot <italic>not desire </italic>development. Development remains an absolutely necessary concept <italic>and</italic> also absolutely inadequate to its task’ (p. 10). Wainwright proposes the concept of <italic>capitalism qua development</italic> to examine how capitalism comes to masquerade as development and why development solicits itself to address its failures. The questions of Europe and the nation state are critical to this examination: the former because of the linkages between European colonialism and capitalist expansion; and the latter because of its production as a seemingly natural and necessary unit of analysis of capitalism qua development.</p>
<p>As with Karatani’s transcritique and Wainwright’s other interlocutors (among whom he counts Marx, Gramsci, Derrida, Spivak, and Said), his critique of development is ethico-political. It is also explicitly postcolonial in at least two related senses. Wainwright does not take the subjects and objects of analysis as given or having an a priori existence. Instead he reads how they come into being in relation to other institutions and practices, and especially in relation to colonial discourses. It is in this register that one should read his question of ‘territory’. Territory here is neither simply a disciplinary geographer’s unit of analysis, nor yet the pre-existing space where capitalist development unfolds. Rather it is the spatial-ontological condition of possibility for the existence of capital-nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436931">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820612436931">Wainwright, 2008</xref>). He contends that if such a proposition were true then imagining an alternative to capitalism would mean transcending territory. In their conversation, he invites Karatani to consider transcritique as a postcolonial critique of Eurocentrism in its attempt to make a world ‘that is not spatially organized in the territorial form that has become dominant since the spread of the European empire’.</p>
<p>Karatani responds by way of Wallerstein’s world-system theory and Marx’s <italic>Grundrisse </italic>to note that the European world-economy became world capitalism in relation to other historical world-systems (such as world empires and systems of ‘tribal’ exchange). He highlights uneven geographies such as those of power and wealth prevalent in each of these world-systems, and the lack of uniformity in the way capitalism spread across the globe. This answer suggests that the postcolonial nature of Karatani’s critique of Eurocentrism is implicit. Also implicit, but no less relevant, a critique of Eurocentrism, may be read in Karatani’s attention to the importance of relations of exchange in Marx’s critique of capitalism. The focus on relationality means that neither a return to Europe (or in this case capitalist development) nor to a pre-capitalist non-West can emerge as a possible alternative to the capital-nation-state, and indeed Karatani does not suggest either. Attention to relations of exchange can contribute to a critique of Eurocentrism through an interrogation of the forms of knowledge and modes of exchange that were brought into being during the <italic>longue durée </italic>of colonial rule and which continue into the present. Reading Karatani via Spivak, and Spivak via Karatani, is key here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2043820612436931">7</xref>
</sup> That transcritique is part of my homework.</p>
<p>Follow-up tasks also emerge from two illustrations of exchange that remain unelaborated. Karatani makes a tantalizing reference to Marx’s writing on the relations between humans and nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436931">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>) to note that relations of exchange are fundamental to Marx’s critique. This relationality is also evident in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820612436931">Raymond Williams’ (1980)</xref> contention that a world beyond capitalism needs different relationships between humans and the environment. Following Karatani, transcending current relationships between human nature and natural history to imagine different relationships necessarily involves wandering the labyrinth of questions about the theory of value, the value of nature, and how that value emerges relationally. It may be unnecessary to add that such alternative relationships cannot be found in ecofeminist ecotopias.</p>
<p>Karatani’s implicit engagement with feminism is the second moment of exchange that I want to draw attention to. In <italic>Transcritique</italic>, Karatani flags how household labor became labeled ‘unproductive’ by industrial capitalism and the modern nation state, and quickly became gendered under commodity production and exchange. He also flags that male-centric revolutionary moments are limited in that they lack countermeasures to this gendered division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612436931">Karatani, 2003</xref>: 294). Karatani’s observations here echo those of a long line of unnamed social feminists, including Maria Mies, even though he does not share their analytical or political paths. For possible countermeasures to these gender, ethnic and environmental inequalities, Karatani’s proposal is associational exchange. Perhaps his cautions against romantic dreams (pp. 282–283) of pre-capitalist or agrarian societies might serve as a reminder to him (as to us) that gendered relations of power and unequal divisions of labor can and do prevail in all modes of exchange. That is, women are just as likely to bear the unequal burdens of labor in gift and exchange economies (say those based on love or affect) as in commodity exchange, albeit in different ways. As with Karatani’s postcolonialism, his understanding of power and violence in modes of exchange is mostly implicit.</p>
<p>There is much else that is implied in Karatani’s critique of the capital-nation-state triad. For instance, Karatani argues that the world empires that preceded world capitalism expanded only as far as their military power allowed. In contrast, he notes that the capitalist world economy expands indefinitely. What he does not note is that the infinite expansion of world capitalism everywhere has been, and continues to be, accompanied by violence. That the violence of military power facilitates and seems necessary for such expansion is evident all over the world. Beyond the most obvious cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, one can cite several recent examples from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. But to be fair, Karatani acknowledges in the Preface to <italic>Transcritique</italic> that his analyses of state and nation, and those of underdevelopment and developing countries, are yet to be developed.</p>
<p>I read Wainwright’s conversation with Karatani as an invitation to geographers, and by extension those in the field of development, to read third world development transcritically. That task is not without challenges, not least because a transcritical reading of development is inseparable from critiques of metaphysics and ideology. Development studies could be said to share with metaphysics a concern with morals or the need to struggle towards a more just world. But the former is a field that remains bound to its practical orientation, where normative rationality remains unquestioned. Furthermore, as many of its critics have pointed out, it repeatedly proposes apolitical technical solutions to the political problems of social and economic inequalities – inequalities that are inherent to capitalist development. There is an explicit teleology, and a hidden ideology and hubris, to the logic that ‘reason’ (call it science, technology, subjectivity, agency) can lead to development, a good life, and a just world. This teleology and Eurocentric hubris are also evident in structural critics of development who seek in Marx a systematic repudiation of capitalism, and an alternative to it. We cannot not strive for a more just world. But as Gayatri Spivak repeatedly reminds us, to strive for development and justice is to move beyond ‘benevolence toward others’, and perhaps toward ‘something that secures human dignity’, which is how Karatani defines communism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612436931">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>). These are the impossibly difficult and necessary ethico-economic tasks that entail contending with the limits of human reason. That is, changing the world will require not only agility and patience, but also wisdom and love.</p>

Like Karatani, Desai contends that Marx did not predict the collapse of capitalism and the rise of socialism. But unlike Karatani, Desai distinguishes between Marx’s early philosophical writings and his later political economic ones, reading the latter as Marx’s ‘scientific’ analysis of capitalism as a dynamic, resilient system.
