            <p>It is the purpose of this article to illuminate the phenomenon of unitary pattern through a review of theoretical literature. Unitary pattern is a phenomenon of significance to the discipline of nursing because it is manifested in and informs all person-environment health experiences. Unitary pattern was illuminated by: addressing the barriers to understanding the phenomenon, presenting a definition of unitary pattern, and exploring Eastern and Western theoretical literature which address unitary pattern in a way that is congruent with the definition presented. This illumination of unitary pattern will expand nursing knowledge and contribute to the discipline of nursing.</p>

   <body>
      <p>The phenomenon of unitary pattern is the configuration of inherent wholeness. It is the dynamic, evolving shape underlying all reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447568">2008</xref>). The unitary perspective of wholeness and pattern is not well understood or defined in the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber, 2000</xref>), yet understanding unitary pattern is crucial to person-environment-health (Newman). <italic>The Oxford English Dictionary</italic> (Simpson, 2010) describes pattern as: order or form discernible in things, actions, ideas, and a design often repeated and the basis for predictions. From a unitary perspective (Newman), this definition does not account for the unpredictable, innovative, continuously dynamic aspect of unitary pattern. Nor does it account for reality as a patterned inherent wholeness, which is manifested in the phenomenal world. According to Newman, all phenomena or forms are unique pattern manifestations of the underlying inherent whole and resonate with the pattern of the whole. For example, the dis-ease pattern of a single person or single aspect of the environment is a resonance or dissonance that both reflects and influences the underlying pattern of the whole. Thus, the experience of dis-ease by an individual, such as a cardiac problem, as well as environmental disease such as an oil spill, is resonant patterned information about the health of the inherently whole person-environment.</p>
      <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman (2000)</xref> health is expanding consciousness, and occurs as a process of recognition of pattern. A unitary perspective of pattern is consistent with the unitary transformative nursing paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447568">Newman, Sime, Corcoran-Perry, 1991</xref>). It is important that nurses recognize patterns of health of person-environment as information about the unitary pattern, in order to participate in addressing the health concerns that are persons’ lived expressions of underlying wholeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447568">Cowling, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447568">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447568">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447568">Rogers, 1970</xref>). Other persons have also addressed the importance of attention to pattern as a life sustaining process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447568">Ferguson, 1980</xref>); and pattern recognition as a way to grasp wholeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894318412447568">Wheatley, 1999</xref>). Ferguson suggested that pattern-seeing is a survival skill for the 21st century and Wheatley pointed out that humans must tap into their innate ability to see and recognize patterns in order to understand life’s complex unity. Consistent with these ideas of the importance of unitary pattern for the health of person-environment, it is the purpose of this paper to clarify the unitary transformative paradigm by exploring a core phenomenon underpinning this worldview which is unitary pattern.</p>
      <p>The author here will address the phenomenon of unitary pattern as it emerged as a phenomenon of interest significant to the discipline of nursing, followed by a brief discussion of the barriers to understanding the phenomenon in Western society, and finally the phenomenon will be illuminated through a review of philosophical, new science, and nursing theoretical literature. Identifying a unitary approach to addressing persons’ health concerns was one of the reasons that this phenomenon emerged as a focus of interest for the author.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447568">
         <title>Phenomenon of Interest: Emergence and Significance</title>
         <p>Unitary pattern emerged as a phenomenon of interest for the author through personal experience, in academic studies, and in private nursing practice. Clients in the author’s private practice in health and wellness counseling indicated that addressing their health concerns from a unitary pattern perspective was beneficial. It differed from previous situations in healthcare during which they experienced fragmentation. Working with clients in a partnership with techniques such as movement and guided imagery facilitated recognition of personal pattern. This brought about improvement in their specific health concerns and in their life experiences as a whole. The resultant awareness changed the manner in which the persons participated in life.</p>
         <p>For example, the author worked with a woman who had been dealing with an issue of an adult child leaving home. The client came to a session presenting an immediate concern of having just lost a valuable watch. From a unitary pattern perspective, this became the focus of the work for the session with the understanding that the immediate pattern could be a reflection of the deeper pattern. A focusing technique was used to help the client relax and attend to herself. Her attention was directed to the experience of the watch and its loss. The author sat in silent presence as the client focused on this situation. As she attended to the watch and her wrist, she spontaneously made a connection between the situation of the watch and the situation of her son. She recognized her pattern of fear of letting go of what was meaningful to her. She cried with this awareness and said it was a breakthrough for her. Subsequently she changed her relationship with her son, and let him go with love, experiencing a greater connection with him and a sense of wholeness. Through self-reflection, the author was also transformed in the process by recognizing her old pattern of fear of trusting that awareness can emerge from silent presence. In this situation she experienced the shift to a new pattern by feeling her fear, and remaining in silent presence with her client in spite of it.</p>
         <p>As this example indicates, it is through attention to their experience of unique life patterns that clients can become more aware of the underlying pattern of their inherent wholeness and in this deeper awareness make transformative changes. Through the nurse-client relationship, the nurse may also transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>). According to Newman, “the new paradigm of health, essential to nursing, embraces a unitary pattern of changing relationships” (p. 13). The phenomenon of unitary pattern is significant to nursing because it is manifested in person-environment-health experiences such as the client example indicates. Newman posited that nurses embody nursing theory, and in authentic presence as in a partnership with a client, the theory is active. Through personal experience of unitary pattern awareness in the nursing process, it was discovered that the more aware the nurse is of what they embody, the greater the perception of wholeness by nurse and client, and the greater the potential in both persons for transformation and healing. Understanding unitary pattern enhances the nursing process, yet unitary pattern can be difficult to understand (Newman).</p>

         <title>Barriers to Understanding Unitary Pattern</title>
         <p>Although the individual concepts of wholeness and pattern are common in Western literature, particularly from a systems perspective, the unitary perspective of pattern as inherent wholeness is not well understood in the Western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318412447568">Wilber, 1979/2001</xref>). Barriers to understanding unitary pattern exist in the predominant science paradigms and in finding ways to perceive unitary pattern. In terms of scientific paradigmatic barriers, a mechanistic view of reality dominates the classical natural sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447568">Capra, 1975/2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber, 2000</xref>) presenting a perspective of pattern as a static or fixed configuration of discrete, repeated elements. The mechanistic view of wholeness is that it is a reducible totality equal to the sum of the parts. The systems perspective, which is prevalent in the human sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447568">Capra, 1975/2000</xref>), presents the pattern of the whole as a dynamic, irreducible configuration of interconnected but discrete elements in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Both the mechanistic and systems views of the pattern of the whole allow for the reality of separate parts that have either reducible connections (mechanistic) or irreducible connections (systems). From these perspectives, wholeness is a non-unitary composite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447568">Bohm, 1980</xref>) in which the perceived phenomenal world is viewed as primary reality. When persons are described as whole from these perspectives, the way in which a nurse interacts with them and the patterns identified in relation to their health may be limited by these views because they do not perceive the person-environment-health pattern as a reflection or manifestation of the inclusive underlying context and primary reality of <italic>inherent</italic> wholeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318412447568">Rogers, 1992</xref>). Regarding perceptual barriers to understanding unitary pattern, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318412447568">Wilber (1979/2001)</xref> indicated that unitary pattern cannot be grasped in its entirety through words, because the words themselves are linear manifestations and not the reality of the whole. Wilber indicated that while the literature presents ideas about what underlying reality is like, what it is not, and how to reach it; it does not say what <italic>it is</italic>. Similarly, nurse theorists have referred to unitary pattern as an unobservable abstraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318412447568">Rogers, 1992</xref>) and as ineffable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447568">Newman, 1999</xref>).</p>
         <p>The difficulties of grasping the unitary perspective were also reflected in a nursing analysis of the concept <italic>unitary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447568">Cobb &amp; Bean, 2006</xref>). In Cobb and Bean’s analysis, they indicated that the term unitary means an indivisible whole, but they described this from a system’s perspective. “The concept unitary exists when a total is comprised of elements coming together” (p. 56). Neither the mechanistic view nor the system’s view accounts for wholeness as primary nor do they account for reality as an underlying pattern of uniquely configured features of the whole.</p>
         <p>In spite of these barriers it is important to pursue a study of the phenomenon of unitary pattern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318412447568">Rogers (1992)</xref> contended that the future demands flexibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447568">Koplowitz (1984)</xref> suggested that the unitary view provides the most flexible means of accounting for the complexity, unpredictability, and continuous innovations that occur in the natural world. Given that pattern-seeing may be necessary for survival in modern times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447568">Ferguson, 1980</xref>), and a view of reality as inherently whole possibly being the most flexible way of addressing the increasing complexity and diversity of the world; understanding unitary pattern is increasingly important.</p>

         <title>Definition of Unitary Pattern</title>
         <p>In order to facilitate unitary pattern awareness as related to persons’ health concerns, it is important that nurses have clarity in defining unitary pattern. In defining unitary pattern, theoretical literature was reviewed and a modification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894318412447568">Smith’s (1999)</xref> concept clarification process was applied. Smith developed and used the concept clarification process to arrive at essential meanings of a concept as a process of synthesis rather than as an analytic process. The meaning of the concept emerges from a theoretical context rather than as an absolute meaning. This approach to defining a concept was utilized because it is congruent with a unitary paradigm and with HEC as a unitary nursing theoretical context of the concept of unitary pattern. Three essential meanings or aspects of unitary pattern were found by the author to be the basis of a definition of unitary pattern. These aspects were a) inherent wholeness, b) movement, and c) configuration. Unitary pattern is defined in this paper as a <italic>dynamic configuration of inherent wholeness</italic>. Each of these three are explored further in light of the theoretical literature.</p>
         <p>There was a plethora of authors who described one or two aspects of unitary pattern, but not all three. <italic>Inherent wholeness means that wholeness is the foundational reality from which manifest phenomena emerge. Movement is the process whereby the configuration of the whole changes continuously. Configuration is the everchanging shape of the whole</italic> and is reflected in the manifest world of physical and mental phenomena. Here only those authors’ works that described all three aspects of unitary pattern are included. While all definitions of unitary pattern congruent with these aspects described it as inherently whole, there were variations in the emphases and in the perspectives of the movement and configuration aspects of unitary pattern. Each of the three aspects (wholeness, movement, and configuration) of the definition are addressed in the theoretical literature presented here in order to illuminate the phenomenon of unitary pattern. A search of the extant literature indicated that no thorough exploration of the phenomenon of unitary pattern had been conducted to date.</p>

         <title>Theoretical Literature on Unitary Pattern</title>
         <p>While most of the literature did not use the term <italic>unitary pattern</italic>, many concepts and contexts expressed were congruent with the definition of unitary pattern that included the three foundational aspects. These concepts were the expressions of diverse thinkers, pointing the way to a re-emergent understanding of the phenomenon that has only recently been termed unitary pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447568">Rogers, 1970</xref>). Although unitary pattern as a whole cannot be captured in words, enduring aspects of the phenomenon emerged in Eastern and Western literature.</p>
         <p>Unitary pattern was identified both explicitly and implicitly in the literature. The phenomenon was <italic>explicitly</italic> identified by the term <italic>unitary pattern</italic> only in the nursing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447568">Cowling, 2000</xref>; Newman, 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447568">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318412447568">Rogers, 1992</xref>). Unitary pattern was <italic>implicitly</italic> referred to in the philosophy and spirituality literature by terms such as: <italic>ultimate reality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318412447568">Upanishads, n. d./1978</xref>), <italic>the void</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318412447568">Suzuki, 1968</xref>), the <italic>One</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318412447568">Plotinus, 250 A.C.E./1992</xref>); and in new science physics as <italic>holomovement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447568">Bohm, 1980</xref>).</p>

            <title>Eastern Philosophy and Spirituality</title>
            <p>Some of the most ancient discussions of the phenomenon of unitary pattern emerged in Eastern spiritual-philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447568">Bhagavad Gita, n. d./1973</xref>; I Ching, n. d.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318412447568">Upanishads, n. d./1978</xref>). The literature conveyed similarities and differences in Eastern worldviews in the discussions of unitary pattern. The similarities were the beliefs that: there is a basic unity of the universe, all phenomena are manifestations of this unity, the unity is perceived through non-rational awareness, and the experience is indescribable in rational terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447568">Chattopadhyaya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318412447568">Suzuki, 1968</xref>). There were differences in emphasis regarding the attributes of unitary pattern such as an emphasis on configuration in Hinduism (Chattopadhyaya), inherent wholeness in Buddhism (Suzuki) and rhythmic movement in Taoism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447568">Chuang Tzu, 286 B.C.E /1974</xref>). The Eastern systems of spiritual philosophy addressed in the literature for this review were Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism.</p>
            <p>Hindu scriptures are some of the most ancient literary sources identifying and clarifying unitary pattern themes. Hindu beliefs are contained in ancient scriptures written by anonymous sages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894318412447568">Upanishads, n. d./1978</xref>). Hindu literature identified unitary pattern in terms of Brahman as inherent wholeness, maya as relative configuration, and karma as evolutionary action of the whole. The primary wholeness of unitary pattern was found in the teaching that specifies that the multitude of things and events are different manifestations of the same ultimate reality called Brahman. “The Unity of Brahman . . .expresses itself . . .in the patterned or law-governed multiplicity of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447568">Chattopadhyaya, 2002</xref>, p. 32). The configuration of inherent patterned wholeness is manifested as maya. Maya refers to the illusion that perceived shapes, structures, things, and events are realities rather than concepts of measuring and categorizing. Reality is the underlying unity. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447568">Bhagavad Gita (n. d./1973)</xref>, the movement aspect of the total universe is called karma. Karma occurs as an evolving process of awareness occurring through many incarnations. It is a liberating process of seeing through the illusion of maya, realizing that all of the phenomena perceived with the senses are part of the same underlying reality.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the Hindu emphasis on the configuration of maya, Buddhist literature emphasized the inherent wholeness of underlying reality, conveyed in later Buddhist sutras as the Body of Being (Darmakaya) similar to Brahman in Hinduism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447568">Capra, 1975/2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894318412447568">Suzuki (1968)</xref> stated that the ancient Avatamsaka Sutra in Buddhist literature depicted the unity of ultimate reality. Buddhism and Hinduism each have various traditions of beliefs about inherent wholeness as being differentiated versus non-differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber, 2000</xref>). Although not emphasized, there is a configuration aspect of the whole represented in the Buddhist metaphor of Indra’s net. Indra’s net is said to be a network of pearls such that if you look at one you see all of the others reflected in it. Buddhism describes the movement of underlying reality as dynamically evolving action known as samsara, which is similar to the Hindu concept of karma. In Buddhist literature the unitary pattern aspect of inherent wholeness is reflected in the concept of the Body of Being, configuration is represented as a network of pearls, and movement occurs as samsara.</p>
            <p>Another Eastern spiritual philosophy, Taoism emphasized the movement aspect of unitary pattern. Chinese philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447568">Chuang Tzu, (286 B.C.E./1974)</xref> referred to reality as the Tao, which means the Way, or the movement of the universe as ever-changing. Configurations of the Way emerge spontaneously from the underlying primary unity, and change cyclically with each becoming its opposite. Similarly, Chinese literature also depicted unitary pattern aspects in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447568">I Ching (n. d./1967)</xref>, a book that described a way of understanding reality as based on complementary aspects of the underlying unified reality, the everchanging configurations of yin and yang (polarities such as dark and light, feminine and masculine). They represent the Tao and the cosmic unified pattern of each moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894318412447568">Wilber, 1977</xref>). In Taoism, unitary pattern’s inherent wholeness is the primary unity of reality. The configuration aspect is expressed as complementary polarities of yin-yang, and the movement of unitary pattern is a continuous cycling of polarities into each other.</p>
            <p>Inherent wholeness, movement and configuration aspects of unitary pattern were identified in the literature of the Eastern spiritual philosophies of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. The literature of Western philosophy and spirituality also described all aspects of unitary pattern although less extensively than in the Eastern literary sources.</p>

            <title>Western Philosophy and Spirituality</title>
            <p>Whereas in the East the ideas of inherent wholeness, and dynamic movement of the pattern of underlying reality have been an integral aspect of spiritual philosophies since ancient times, in the West these ideas have emerged sporadically and have not gained widespread acceptance. A search of Judeo-Christian and Islamic spiritual literature did not reveal a belief in these religions in all three of the aspects of unitary pattern. In particular, wholeness was not identified as primary with the phenomenal world as a manifestation of inherent wholeness. Generally the Western spiritual perspectives are dualistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447568">Pagels, 1995</xref>), presenting God as a being who created a separate and real phenomenal world. Those mystics who had experiences of wholeness often described the experience from a dualistic perspective as union <italic>with</italic> God. They could see God <italic>in</italic> all, but not necessarily <italic>God as All or All as God</italic>.</p>
            <p>The earliest Western literature suggesting unitary pattern was that of the Greek philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894318412447568">Plotinus (250 A.C.E /1992)</xref>, who conveyed that all existence emanates from the unity of the One and that the One could not be known through rational processes, but only through contemplation. The world of spirit and phenomena are of one divinity that empties into the world as manifestations of Spirit, or One into Many. The manifested configurations of Many then return to the One of Spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber, 2000</xref>). Plotinus referred to the cyclic movement of One and Many as efflux and reflux. Plotinus’ unitary view of reality differed from 4th century B.C. Platonic and Aristotelian perceptions of reality as a duality perceived through discursive reason. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318412447568">Plato (n. d./1997)</xref>, posited that pattern was a unifying form underlying essentially different spirit and matter, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447568">Aristotle (n. d./1943)</xref> viewed form or pattern as immanent in matter and matter as primary or atomistic. These philosophies formed the foundation for Western cultural views of reality for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447568">Capra, 1975/2000</xref>).</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894318412447568">Plato’s (n. d./1997)</xref> dualism and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447568">Aristotle’s (n. d./1943)</xref> atomistic views prevailed in science and philosophy until the German Romantic Movement in the late eighteenth century, when philosophers and scientists again expressed a value for wholeness in the natural world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894318412447568">Schelling (1800/1978)</xref> indicated that it is necessary to move beyond reason in order to discover that mind and nature are different movements of one absolute Spirit, manifesting itself in successive stages of unfolding. He contended that Spirit is the underlying reality that empties itself into manifest form which is Spirit as Form. He posited that Nature is objective Spirit, and Mind is subjective Spirit. Spirit evolves through manifest existence in nature to self reflection in mind, and to self-realization of itself as Spirit having complete autonomy and complete wholeness. Thus Shelling addressed unitary pattern aspects of inherent wholeness as absolute Spirit, movement as evolving or unfolding and configuration as Form.</p>
            <p>More than a century after Schelling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894318412447568">Wilber (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318412447568">1979/2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">2000</xref>), a modern philosopher focusing on Eastern and Western psychological and spiritual development, drew on the work of Schelling and others to extensively describe a phenomenon congruent with unitary pattern. He indicated that reality is inherently whole or <italic>non-dual</italic> and is a Ground of Being from which the patterned phenomenal world emerges as a construction of mind. Wilber pointed out that manifestation does not emanate <italic>from</italic> Oneness which implies separation, but <italic>is</italic> Oneness or Mind. As human consciousness erroneously perceives manifest phenomena as <italic>real</italic> the evolving movement is initiated as an evolving return to awareness of inherent wholeness and to an Eternal Moment in which there is no evolution because evolution is related to the dualistic construct of time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber (2000)</xref> referred to the <italic>pattern of manifestation</italic> that “embodies a creative drive to greater depth, greater consciousness, greater unfolding . . .ultimately unfolding . . .into its own infinite ground in pure Emptiness” (p. 205).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894318412447568">Wilber (2000)</xref> contributed to the philosophical discussion of the nature of reality with a view of the movement of the whole as process that he described as <italic>transcending and including</italic>. In this process new manifestations appear to transcend, and include existent forms in a new pattern of ever increasing complexity/diversity. He called these configurations “the organic pattern of the Tao” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894318412447568">Wilber, 1979/2001</xref>, p. 41).</p>
            <p>Many Eastern and a few Western philosophers illuminated unitary pattern as inherently whole, dynamic, and shaped. Just as there were some western philosophers who were able to accept and articulate the idea of reality as unitary in spite of living in the midst of mechanistic or systems worldviews, there were some scientists who pursued unitary concepts within their disciplines.</p>

         <title>New Science</title>
         <p>In the realm of science, discoveries regarding relativity and quantum physics have opened the eyes of many scientists to the idea that reality is an irreducible whole rather than composed of discrete particles. In order to better understand irreducible wholeness a number of Western scholars turned to the philosophies of the East which had described this for millennia. Numerous books have been written drawing parallels between the new discoveries of Western sciences and Eastern spiritual philosophies particularly regarding reality as whole, everchanging, innovative, and unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447568">Capra, 1975/2000</xref>). Many scientific disciplines such as physics and biology, contributed concepts that increased understanding of the dynamic and configured nature of underlying reality, but they have not gone so far as to suggest that the underlying reality is a primary whole. Yet even this move in the sciences toward systems wholeness was viewed as radical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447568">Bohm (1980)</xref> reflected the leap of faith that this shift entailed for scientists when he said, “To take undivided wholeness seriously is to make an incredible journey, abandoning everything that is familiar and comfortable” (p. 99). This awareness of underlying wholeness, particularly in the natural sciences was referred to as <italic>new science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894318412447568">Wheatley, 1999</xref>).</p>
         <p>Among the many theories of wholeness and pattern identified in the theoretical literature from a new science perspective, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447568">Bohm (1980)</xref> described all aspects of unitary pattern. In new science physics, Bohm developed a theory of wholeness as primary that he called the implicate order, and described the phenomenal manifest realm, which he called the explicate order, as an abstraction from the implicate order. This unbroken wholeness is a dynamic process called holomovement in which “new wholes are continually emerging” (p. 157) through a process of unfolding and enfolding, and the configuration of the whole appears as ever-changing ensembles. What is manifest has relevance as it is “lifted into attention so that it stands out ‘in relief’” (p. 151). Bohm addressed configuration as differentiation that creates the texture of the whole. In other words, the explicate order phenomena are not essentially different from the implicate order, but are different aspects of the implicate order, brought to awareness based on the attention given to them. He further clarified his idea of unitary configuration as “a new notion of structure . . .in which aspects of different degrees of implication can be arranged in a certain order” (p. 153). Within any explicate structure the “whole implicate order is present” (p.154). Bohm suggested that a unitary approach in science would reverse the current approach. “When one works in terms of the implicate order, one <italic>begins</italic> [emphasis added] with the undivided wholeness of the universe and the task of science is to <italic>derive the parts through abstraction</italic> [emphasis added] from the whole” (p. 179). Unitary nursing theorists drew on the work of new scientists such as Bohm in articulating an overall unitary perspective of the discipline and a key aspect that is unitary pattern.</p>

         <title>Nursing</title>
         <p>The most extensive, cohesive, and explicit source regarding the phenomenon of unitary pattern was the nursing literature. Unitary pattern emerged in the nursing literature in the latter half of the 20th century in nursing theories and models that described similar and diverse understandings of unitary pattern. In order to illuminate the phenomenon of unitary pattern in the discipline of nursing the definitions and unique perspectives of unitary pattern were compared and contrasted in three unitary nursing models or theories which are: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447568">Rogers (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894318412447568">1992)</xref> model called the science of unitary human beings (SUHB), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447568">2008)</xref> theory of health as expanding consciousness (HEC), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447568">Parse’s (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447568">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318412447568">2007)</xref> humanbecoming school of thought (HBT).

Although theory-based nursing practice and education addressed unitary pattern, it is beyond the scope of this paper to detail those writings. The author here clarifies unitary pattern explicated in the theoretical nursing works of Rogers, Newman, Parse, and Cowling.</p>
         <p>While pattern has been viewed as meaningful in many disciplines, from a unitary perspective pattern was addressed as meaningful only within the nursing theoretical literature. Each of the three unitary nursing theoretical perspectives identified pattern as a key component of the theory or model because it was meaningful in light of unique health experiences and meaningful with regard to the inherent wholeness of all lived experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447568">2008)</xref> referenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447568">Rogers (1970)</xref> in suggesting that the meanings of disease and non-disease processes are equally valued expressions of one life process and their meaning comes from an experiential, intuitive recognition of the whole patterning of a person. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447568">Parse (1998)</xref> stated, “The meaning signified is one’s patterns of relating” (p. 40). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447568">Cowling (1990)</xref> also indicated that pattern information is meaningful when “constructed within a unitary context” (p. 56).</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894318412447568">Rogers (1970)</xref> was the first to address the importance of pattern within a unitary framework. In her seminal and visionary work the phenomenon of unitary pattern was introduced to nursing. Rogers’ theoretical view of reality as inherent wholeness was one of, and possibly the first among presentations in Western literature of a unitary perspective of reality. Her nursing model of the science of unitary human beings began the movement of nursing toward a new paradigm of wholeness and was the impetus for the development of the unitary nursing theory of health as expanding consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447568">Newman, 1979</xref>) and the humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447568">Parse, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447568">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894318412447568">2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>All three unitary nursing frameworks are similar in incorporating the defined aspects of unitary pattern, which are inherent wholeness, movement, and configuration. There are also congruent theoretical perspectives of each of these aspects. Mutual understandings of the wholeness of unitary pattern were that wholeness is primary or foundational, there are no separate parts, and the whole is different from the manifest aspects. All of these theorists concur that underlying wholeness is dynamic. The movement aspect of unitary pattern is similarly described by all theorists as continuous, innovative, unpredictable, and rhythmic. Within the movement of underlying wholeness all the theorists described pattern configurations as shapes that provide both ongoing identity and everchanging diversity. All theorists noted that underlying pattern in itself is non-observable and abstract, but it is indirectly observable as manifestations or phenomena. Each theorist, however, furthered understanding of unitary pattern in light of her unique theoretical perspective. A brief overview of some of the unique perspectives and variable emphases regarding the three aspects of unitary pattern occurring within each unitary nursing theory are indicated as follows.</p>

SUHB presents wholeness as pandimensional, meaning “a non-linear domain without spatial or temporal attributes” (p. 29); with the unifying feature of wholeness being the energy field. The movement aspect of unitary pattern is an evolving process. Rogers’ emphasized that change as evolution is accelerating and she posited that as pattern evolves the past is incorporated as new patterns emerge.</p>

Newman briefly mentioned Rogers’ concept of fields but incorporated other concepts of primary wholeness into HEC such as Bohm’s implicate order as “an unseen multidimensional pattern that is the ground or basis for all things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447568">Newman, 2000</xref>, p. 10) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447568">Bentov’s (1978)</xref> reference to the concept of the Absolute to describe the unitary nature of reality.

The wholeness aspect of unitary pattern is multidimensional according to the HBT and is underpinned by the SUHB (1992) postulate of pandimensionality. The HBT perspective of the configuration aspect of unitary pattern is that pattern configurations are coconstituted in relationship as “a unity of apparent opposites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894318412447568">Parse, 1998</xref>, p. 22).</p>

He (Cowling, 1992) concurred with Rogers’ definition of pattern as “the distinguishing characteristic of an energy field perceived as a single wave” (p. 29). Additionally, he indicated that pattern is the pathway to knowing wholeness and that pattern awareness is a healing process of “realizing, knowing and appreciating an inherent wholeness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447568">Cowling, 2000</xref>, p. 23). This awareness comes about through exploring manifestations of pattern that convey the essence of pattern and therefore bring one to awareness of one’s wholeness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447568">Cowling (1997)</xref> explicated the configuration aspect of unitary pattern which is “expressed in many forms” and human forms are “experience, perception and expression” which occur “simultaneously as a singular continuous event” (p. 133).</p>
            <p>Newman, Parse, and Cowling expanded Rogers’ seminal conceptualization of unitary pattern. In their areas of similarity and areas of difference these nursing conceptualizations illuminated unitary pattern as enduring yet ever-changing.

They contributed to the Western literature in presenting unitary paradigmatic perspectives of pattern in specifically describing unitary pattern. And finally they illuminated a core phenomenon of unitary nursing theory.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Awareness and understanding of unitary pattern is important for health of the inherently whole person-environment, and as such is a significant phenomenon of focus for the discipline of nursing. A search of the extant literature indicated that no thorough exploration of the phenomenon of unitary pattern had been done to date. The review of theoretical literature demonstrated that although there are barriers, particularly in Western culture, to understanding unitary pattern, discourse regarding the phenomenon, particularly in the discipline of nursing has been eroding the barriers and illuminating the phenomenon.</p>
         <p>Unitary pattern was identified in Eastern and Western philosophical literature, new science, and nursing. While each of these disciplines were similar in identifying aspects of unitary pattern as inherently whole, dynamic, and configured, each discipline also described unique perspectives of the aspects of unitary pattern. There was no single common description across disciplines or between East and West, yet the differences reflected meanings of unitary pattern that contribute to an understanding of the phenomenon as a whole.</p>
         <p>Across the literature the aspect of unitary pattern that was most consistent was inherent wholeness. Although different terms were used to signify this, the underlying unity was always primary. Unitary pattern was described as abstract, expressed through manifested forms. The aspects of movement and configuration although generally similar, differed within and among literary perspectives. Similarities of the dynamic aspect were rhythmicity and ongoing change. There were two main differences of the movement aspect of unitary pattern that were described as an evolving process or as a cyclical process. Within the evolving process perspective, the movement was noted to be unidirectional and occurs in either multiple dimensions or in a pandimension. Within the cyclical process perspective the dynamic nature of unitary pattern was nondirectional, described as complementary change as in the Tao and Yin Yang movement, and as pattern preferences in Parse’s description of paradoxical rhythmicities. Similarities of unitary pattern configuration descriptions were that it is increasingly diverse, an identifying aspect of the underlying unity, meaningful, pointing the way to experiencing wholeness. The configuration aspect of unitary pattern had the most variety in descriptions.</p>
         <p>In the exploration of theoretical literature unitary pattern was illuminated as a phenomenon having diversity within unity. As such it is a phenomenon relevant to global culture and to the discipline of nursing, both of which also manifest diversity in unity. The lack of previously detailed exploration of the phenomenon in extant theoretical literature indicates the importance of providing an exploration and clarification of the phenomenon of unitary pattern. As a nursing phenomenon of significance, continued elucidation of unitary pattern will enhance health, healing, and quality of life in mutual nurse-person-environment relationships, and will provide an important contribution to the discipline of nursing.</p>
