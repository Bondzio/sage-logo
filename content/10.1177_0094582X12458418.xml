<p>In September 1989, the best-selling book <italic>Los zarpazos del puma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12458418">Verdugo, 1989</xref>) documented the Caravan of Death—the trail of executions of Allende supporters ordered by General Arellano Stark as he helicoptered from province to province in the month following the 1973 coup. In June 1990 the well-preserved, mutilated bodies of 21 “disappeared” were unearthed by human rights activists at Pisagua in Chile’s northern desert. Thirty years after the coup, the film <italic>Machuca</italic>, which depicts the coup through the eyes of two schoolboys of different social classes, became a blockbuster. These are some of the “memory knots” highlighted in Steve J. Stern’s <italic>Reckoning with Pinochet: The Memory Questions in Democratic Chile, 1989–2006</italic>. This volume completes his comprehensive trilogy <italic>The Memory Box of Pinochet’s Chile</italic>, which offers a multifaceted analysis of struggles over memory since the military dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet brutally crushed Chile’s brief experiment in creating a democratic transition to socialism.</p>
<p>The first and shortest of the three volumes, <italic>Remembering Pinochet’s Chile: On the Eve of London, 1998</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12458418">2004</xref>), introduces the premises and concepts that Stern develops in the subsequent books. He recognizes memory as a central terrain of political and cultural struggle that involves not merely the recollection of historical facts but the subjective meanings given to these occurrences by individuals who experience them in different social locations and through different ideological lenses. To analyze the complex interplay between individual and social memory-making in a politically polarized society, he introduces the concepts of loose versus emblematic memory and memory knots. Memory knots are “sites where the social body screams.” They include sites of humanity (such as human rights activists and investigative journalists,) sites in time (politically charged anniversaries such as September 11, the date of the coup), and sites of physical matter or geography (such as torture centers and mass graves) that serve to project issues of memory into the public domain. They are key moments or nodes in the ongoing social struggle between competing ways of understanding the major events of recent Chilean history (the Allende government, the coup, and the dictatorship) that shape the ways in which loose (personal) memories become integrated into broader frameworks of social understanding (emblematic memories). <italic>Battling for Hearts and Minds: Memory Struggles in Pinochet’s Chile, 1973–1988</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12458418">2006</xref>) involves a more detailed examination of the dictatorship’s struggle to achieve politico-cultural legitimacy by portraying the coup and military regime as the salvation of Chile from Marxist ruin. How this effort to establish a hegemonic emblematic memory was contested by the diverse forces that gradually coalesced into the victorious Coalition for the No in the 1988 plebiscite on Pinochet’s continued rule is the central drama of this volume.</p>
<p><italic>Reckoning with Pinochet</italic> encompasses the lengthy period between Pinochet’s defeat in the 1988 plebiscite and his death in 2006. Examining the political and social dynamics of the Concertación era, Stern insists on recognizing the complexities and nuances of memory struggles, rejecting as simplistic the dichotomy memory versus forgetting. His narrative weaves together a broad societal overview of the changing correlation of forces over almost two decades and the intensely personal accounts of Chileans of differing experiences and opinions in an analysis that emphasizes the interplay of top-down and bottom-up forces in shaping both collective memory and public policy. He argues that, as the democratic transition began, Chile experienced a “culture of memory impasse” when grassroots demands for justice collided with the realities of military power and government desire for stability and <italic>convivencia</italic> (social harmony). Although the Concertación’s political legitimacy required an official response to human rights abuses, this was limited to “justice to the extent possible,” a policy exemplified in the Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig) Commission of 1990–1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12458418">Chile, Comisión Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliación, 1993</xref>), which officially recognized 2,115 cases of political execution and disappearance but whose scope of inquiry excluded torture unless it resulted in death and whose mandate, significantly, excluded justice. President Aylwin’s dramatic televised acceptance of state responsibility and apology to the relatives of the victims legitimated two of the memory frameworks that challenged the military’s “salvation” frame—what Stern identifies as “cruel rupture” and “persecution and awakening.” Their increased presence in collective memory did not break the impasse but moved it onto new terrain in what Stern terms a “mobile” or “rolling” impasse that evolved over time as new memory knots occupied the public sphere and the threat of renewed military intervention receded. For the next few years, each limited advance for human rights advocates constituted a wedge that expanded the boundaries of the possible and pressed for further gains. Stern emphasizes the ongoing “conflictive” or “frictional” synergy between the government and civil society characterized by an uneasy mix of collaboration and protest. Despite the social demobilization promoted by the Concertación, demonstrations, books, television reports, and other memory knots forced public confrontation with truths that many Chileans would have preferred to lock inside a closed memory box. Indeed, that closure was the fourth memory framework competing for hegemony as significant social sectors, especially those that had not been personally affected by human rights abuses, considered the horrors of the dictatorship best left in the past. The remainder of the first half of the book traces the ebb and flow of memory struggles from 1991 through 1997. Stern argues that from that date forward momentum on human rights issues had been lost and the impasse had apparently been frozen.</p>
<p>Since Pinochet personified the dictatorship, his arrest in London in 1998 was what Stern sees as a shift that began to unravel the memory impasse. The protracted legal battle in England constituted a memory knot that thrust human rights issues and Pinochet’s personal responsibility for them onto center stage in Chile. In addition, new legal initiatives were under way in Chile accusing Pinochet and other high military officials of genocide, homicide, kidnapping, and other crimes. A related “barrage of memory knots,” notably an upsurge in critical and independent media and the initiation of <italic>funas</italic>, carnivalesque street actions that “outed” human rights violators, created a new memory environment. As this bottom-up momentum grew, elites responded with a top-down initiative for a Mesa de Diálogo (Dialogue Table) with the military that would offer immunity in return for information on the fate of the disappeared. Stern considers this new attempt at <italic>convivencia</italic> as the introduction of an innovative memory frame—shared tragedy—with the potential to bridge the older, irreconcilable frameworks. By 2000, although Pinochet had been allowed to return to Chile for medical reasons, he faced 158 criminal complaints there and had been (temporarily) stripped of immunity in the Caravan of Death case. Thus Stern argues that in 2001 Chile had reached a new crossroads with a familiar choice—push the struggle for justice forward or retreat to a less confrontational solution that offered closure. However, he notes the irony that as many obstacles to moving from memory to justice crumbled, new ones appeared, especially the growing proportion of young people for whom the social issues of the dictatorship were irrelevant.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book examines the 2002–2006 period ending with Pinochet’s death, with a brief consideration of the post-Pinochet Bachelet era. It includes analysis of the legal cases against Pinochet and other military officials, the failure of the Dialogue Table to produce reliable information, and the work of the Valech Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12458418">Chile, Comisión Nacional sobre Prisión Política y Tortura, 2005</xref>), which finally took up the long-suppressed issue of torture. By the time of Pinochet’s death, Stern argues, the “salvation” memory framework had collapsed with the discovery that Pinochet and his family had engaged in corruption and money laundering, compounding the discrediting due to human rights issues. He concludes that Chileans’ memory work remains unfinished and points to the paradox that “a capacity for unprecedented advance went hand in hand with greater risk of marginalization.” He further argues that the memory question has been stretched to include issues of socioeconomic justice originating under Pinochet but perpetuated by the Concertación.</p>
<p>In June 2012, street clashes in Santiago between supporters and opponents of Pinochet on the occasion of the premiere of a pro-Pinochet documentary confirm that Chile’s memory struggles show no signs of abating. Stern’s work offers valuable insights into the dynamics underlying them.</p>
