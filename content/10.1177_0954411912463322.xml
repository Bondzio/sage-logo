<abstract>
<p>Paraspinal muscle forces were derived computationally based on the hypothesis that the intervertebral disc has a transducer function and the muscle is activated according to a sensor-driving control mechanism. A three-dimensional finite element model of the musculoskeletal system, which consisted of a detailed whole lumbar spine, pelvis, simplified trunk model, and muscles, was developed and combined with an optimization technique to calculate muscle forces in isometric forward flexed and erect standing postures. Minimization of deviations in the nucleus pressure and averaged tensile stress in the annulus fibers at five discs was used for muscle force calculations. The results indicated that all the muscles were properly activated to maintain posture and stabilize the lumbar spine. The nucleus pressure difference was decreased during the iterative calculations and its resulting value at the L4/L5 level was consistent with in vivo measurements. Muscle activation produced vertebra motion, which resulted in a relatively uniform stress distribution in the intervertebral discs. This can minimize the risk of injury at a specific level and increase the ability of the spine to sustain a load.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal stability is controlled by two inter-related systems: the spinal column including ligaments and the muscular control system. Instability results when single or multiple components fail or when there is a malfunction in either of the two systems. Paraspinal muscles not only produce moment balance but also generate compression on the spinal column. These factors increase the intrinsic stability of the spine, while providing mobility. Several studies have been conducted to identify the role of muscle in spine stability.</p>
<p>The problem with in vivo experimental studies of the muscle is that they are invasive, costly, and limited. Therefore, numerical analyses have become indispensable tools in understanding the muscle forces and responses in the spinal components. Muscle force could be derived by comparing the moment and force balances that stabilize the spinal motion segment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912463322">1</xref></sup> In this case, the solution of the equation for muscle and joint force would be indeterminate because there are more unknown variables than independent equations. To overcome the kinetic redundancy problem, various techniques including the reduction method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912463322">2</xref></sup> optimization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912463322">3</xref></sup> electromyography (EMG)-assisted approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912463322">4</xref></sup> or hybrid optimization-EMG assisted model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912463322">5</xref></sup> have been proposed for maintaining equilibrium at a single level. To circumvent the shortcomings of a single-level model, in which equilibrium was not maintained at the remaining levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912463322">6</xref></sup> multi-level models along with optimization to resolve the kinetic redundancy have been introduced. The wrapping of muscles along the curvature of the spine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912463322">7</xref></sup> change in the posture (pelvic tilting and lordotic angle change),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912463322">8</xref></sup> intra-abdominal pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463322">9</xref></sup> or kinematic configuration of the lumbar spinal column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912463322">10</xref></sup> have been further utilized for more reliable muscle force prediction. The kinetic constraints of the spinal motion segment or muscle stress were generally adapted during the optimization procedure, which allowed for the development of a relatively simple segment model. A beam element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912463322">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912463322"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912463322">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912463322">10</xref></sup> or stiffness matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912463322">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912463322">11</xref></sup> has generally been adopted for this segmental model in which only overall stiffness of the motion segment was incorporated.</p>
<p>The spinal column has a structural function and a transducer function; the former provides stiffness to the spine and the latter, in the spinal components, provides the information needed to characterize the spine posture, vertebral motions, and spinal loads. This information can be acquired through the innumerable mechanoreceptors present in the ligament, facet capsules, and disc annulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912463322">12</xref></sup> In addition, a recent study demonstrated the presence of mechanoreceptors in the nucleus pulposus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912463322">13</xref></sup> However, no previous study has dealt with muscle force prediction by considering the sensory information in the spine.</p>
<p>The existence of mechanoreceptors supports the previously suggested notion that the joint must play an active role in determining the manner in which the forces are distributed through the spine. This role could be attained by the stress sensors in the joint and the muscles could activate to execute the task while taking into account the information given by the stress sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912463322">14</xref></sup> This notion forms the basis for a hypothesis that there is a sensor-driving control mechanism in the musculoskeletal system of the spine and the paraspinal muscles would be activated in such a way as to maintain spine stability. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a sensor driving control mechanism for predicting the paraspinal muscle forces during erect standing and forward flexed postures.</p>

<title>Lumbar spinal column and trunk finite element (FE)model</title>
<p>The response in the specific spinal component in which the mechanoreceptors were embedded can be derived through a detailed finite element spinal column model. A whole lumbar spine model was developed based on the previously validated one-motion segment model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912463322">15</xref></sup> This one-motion segment model was further modified in its shape, based on the Man8 data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912463322">16</xref></sup> and in its number of elements. This model was used for artificial disc application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912463322">17</xref></sup> Based on this model, the annulus that was composed of ground matrix and reinforced tension-only truss elements was further upgraded by incorporating the regional difference of the tensile modulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912463322">18</xref></sup> Twelve different groups of nonlinear material properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912463322">Table 1</xref>) were assigned to the truss element in the annulus model. The stress–strain curves of the annulus layer model were found to be well matched with their multi-layer specimens harvested from four different regions of a disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912463322">Figure 1</xref>). The responses in the upgraded motion segment (i.e. load–displacement relationship, nucleus pressure, facet contact force, and ligament strains) were also similar to our previously validated models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912463322">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912463322">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912463322">19</xref></sup></p>

Similar to our previous one-motion segment model, a three-dimensional isotropic solid was applied to the cancellous bone and posterior bony element. For the cortical bone of the vertebral body and the endplate, which are thin sheets, shell elements were used. A tension-only truss element with bi-linear behavior was used for ligament modeling. The capsular ligament connected the circumferences of the joining articular facet joints, being perpendicular to the surface of the joints, and the remaining ligaments were oriented along the ligament fiber direction. The three-dimensional gap elements were selected for the simulation of facet contact. The same material properties used in our validated model were assigned to complete the model. The pelvis and sacrum were modeled as a rigid body. The constructed model produced an erect standing posture and the initial lordosis angle between the superior endplates of L2 and S1 was 43°<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912463322">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912463322">Figure 2</xref>). The whole model contained 26364 nodes and 38173 elements. The spinal column model that we developed was validated by comparing it with the previously reported experimental and FE analysis results.

<p>The simplified beam elements were used to construct a trunk model that was composed of 12 thoracic vertebrae, 12 pairs of ribs, and shoulder girdles. The trunk was considered to be one rigid body, which was connected to the L1 vertebra. The spinous and transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae, also modeled with beam elements, were included at the thoracic spine to provide the muscle attachment points. The trunk model has a height of 665 mm and a chest breadth of 300 mm. It was assumed that 400 N of upper body weight was concentrated at the mass center in the trunk. The mass center of the trunk was located superiorly at 458 mm from the perium along the axis (<italic>z</italic>-axis) established as a line passing through the proximal centroid (the center of the exposed spinal cord at the level of the imaginary first cervical vertebra) and the distal axis point (a point located on the perineum in the mid-sagittal plane), and 83 mm anteriorly along the axis (<italic>x</italic>-axis), which was perpendicular to the <italic>z</italic>-axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411912463322">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>An isometric forward flexed model was further developed using the constructed erect standing posture model. According to Arjmand and Shirazi-Adl’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912463322">1</xref></sup> measurements, trunk and pelvic rotation from the neutral standing posture with skin markers indicated that the pelvic tilt was 39%–43.5% of trunk rotation during 41°–62° flexion. Granata and Sanford<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411912463322">27</xref></sup> recorded lumbar and pelvic motion from 18 subjects while performing an isokinetic lifting task. The lumbar/pelvic angle ratio was 2.37 in the trunk flexion range of 0°–30°. Based on these measurements, a flexed FE model could be generated by pelvic tilting the erect position model by one-third of the total flexed angle and then translating the trunk to the proper distance to generate two-thirds of the total flexed angle.</p>

The model included 62 local muscles. Two groups of deep muscles (20 multifidus and 10 psoas major) and four groups of superficial muscles (10 longissimus thoracis, 12 iliocostalis lumborum, 4 spinalis thoracis, and 6 rectus abdominis) were incorporated. The imaginary muscles were connected between the origin and insertion points by connector elements, and a local coordinate was assigned between these two points of muscle attachment, which were to provide the acting direction of the muscle forces in accordance with the modified skeletal configurations. Muscle forces could be derived along these local coordinate directions.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned hypothesis, the muscle would be activated in accordance with the information in the sensory elements. However, the inter-relationship between each sensory element and muscle activation was not identified. In this analysis, the intervertebral disc was chosen to be a sensory element because it sustains most of the load especially in the erect standing posture and during the small range of motions. All ligaments were assumed to be passive elements despite their transducer function. Depending on this selection, the intervertebral disc will play an active role in determining the manner in which the stresses in the intervertebral discs are uniformly distributed through the spine, which reduces the risk of injury at a specific level.</p>
<p>In the calculation procedure, the finite element method combined with an optimization technique was applied. The stress level in each disc was incrementally evaluated using the nonlinear finite element model. These stress values were inputted into a separate optimization program that calculated muscle forces at each state based on the instantaneous configuration of the lumbar spinal column generated at the previous iteration. The muscle forces were the independent unknowns in the optimization steps, which were calculated by minimizing the cost function. The standard deviation of the nucleus pressure and averaged tensile stress in the annulus fibrosus at five discs were chosen for the cost function. The multi-cost function was formulated as the weighted sum of the two components as presented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954411912463322">equation (1)</xref>. The weighting factors, α and β, are the relative weights of the standard deviation in the averaged tensile stress of the annulus fibers and pressure in the nucleus, respectively. Proper weighting factors were chosen to reflect the equal contribution of each component.</p>

<p>The trunk movement in the anterior–posterior direction while maintaining the prescribed flexion angle was chosen as the constraint. The upper bound of muscle stress was assumed to be 0.6 MPa based on the previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411912463322">31</xref></sup> The initial values of muscle force for the optimization procedure were chosen to be 15%–30% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) based on the normalized EMG activities of the superficial muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912463322">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Newly calculated muscle forces were fed into the FE program to update the stress and pressure level of each intervertebral disc. This iterative approach, which could be considered to be a sensor-driving control mechanism, was continued until convergence was achieved.</p>
<p>The analyses were conducted in the erect and isometrically flexed postures (10° and 20°) under two loading conditions (i.e. 400 N of upper body weight only or upper body weight + 100 N weight in the hand). The 100 N weight in the hand was applied at the shoulder joint position in the trunk model, and its force direction was matched to the case where a weight was placed in the front close to the body while it was in the erect posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912463322">Figure 4</xref>). Its direction should be adjusted to the gravitational direction in the flexed posture. Abdominal pressure was not considered in this analysis.</p>

<p>The FE program, ABAQUS (version 6.10; Hibbit, Karlsson &amp; Sorensen Inc, Pawtucket, RI, USA) was used to carry out nonlinear structural analysis on the detailed lumbar spinal column model, while the modified method feasible directions (MMFD) optimization procedure was performed using the VisualDOC (version 6.0; VR&amp;D, Inc, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) program.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The optimization results show that all the muscles were properly combined to maintain the posture and stabilize the lumbar spine. Because of muscle activation, the maximum shear stress in the annulus, which is known to be the most dominant factor in disc tissue failure, tended to be equalized during the iteration step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912463322">Figure 5</xref>). The contour plot of maximum shear stress shows that relatively high stress was generated in the upper level at the initial stage. The proper muscle activation reduced and equalized the stress level, but on the other hand, a relatively high stress was produced at L5/S1. Similar to the stress change, the nucleus pressure at each level was also dramatically equalized especially for the flexed posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912463322">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The activity of each muscle group maintained the posture while reducing the pressure and stress difference in the disc. The activities of the iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus were significant in the erect standing posture and followed those of the psoas major and longissimus thoracis. Flexed motion markedly increased the activities of the longissimus thoracis and multifidus, whereas a reverse change was detected in the psoas major. An additional weight of 100 N in the hand further magnified this trend, especially in the longissimus thoracis. The detailed contribution of each muscle is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912463322">Table 2</xref>.</p>

In contrast to those levels, 0.26°, and 3.07° of flexion motion were calculated at the L1/L2 and L5/S1 levels, respectively. The additional weight in the hand changed the activation of deep muscle, and accordingly, the configuration of the lumbar spinal column was further modified. The segmental angle change relative to the erect standing posture shows that trunk flexion produced segmental flexional motion in most of the lumbar spine and a relatively large rotation was generated at the L4/L5 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912463322">Figure 7</xref>). Because of these segmental angle changes, the lumbar spinal column tended to be straight and the lordotic angle was slightly increased (e.g. from 47.32° to 48.29° in the erect standing position and from 30.67° to 31.1° in 20° flexed posture).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most important result of this study was the derivation of the paraspinal muscle forces based on the hypothesis that the intervertebral disc has a transducer function and the paraspinal muscles could react according to a sensor-driving control mechanism. Recent experimental studies support our hypothesis. A comparative study of the trunk muscle recruitment patterns showed that they were different in healthy control subjects than in patients with chronic low back pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411912463322">33</xref></sup> Other experimental findings, that mechanical stimulation of the ligaments and discs excited the muscle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411912463322">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411912463322">35</xref></sup> also verified that spinal structures are well suited to monitor sensory information as well as to control the spinal muscles.</p>
<p>The calculated muscle forces indicated that the iliocostalis lumborum, longissimus thoracis, multifidus, and psoas major muscles provide fairly even resisting force to the flexion moment generated by the trunk weight in the erect posture. We did not measure the EMG, and instead, previously reported EMG data were adopted to compare with our calculation results. Kingma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411912463322">36</xref></sup> measured six back muscles while they were isometrically resisting flexion moment. For the case of 50 Nm moment generation at the L3/L4 joint, they measured the EMG of the global muscles, including the longissimus thoracis, to which EMG surface electrodes were attached at approximately 30 mm lateral to the midline at T10, the iliocostalis thoracic (60 mm lateral to the midline at T11), iliocostalis lumborum (60 mm lateral to the midline at L2), multifidus (20 mm lateral to the midline at the L4/L5 height), and rectus abdominis (30 mm lateral to the umbilicus). The results showed 13%–15%, 7%–14%, 10%–14%, 22%–26%, and 1%–3% of MVC, respectively. In our model, the trunk weight generated a 47.7 Nm moment at the same level when the trunk flexion angle was 20°. Proximately located muscles in the model corresponded to the second longissimus (long2), first iliocostalis (ilio1), fourth iliocostalis (ilio4), fourth multifidus (multi_t4), and third rectus abdominis (rectus3). The simulated results produced MVC values of 26.5%, 12.8%, 12.4%, 24.2%, and 1.3% as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411912463322">Table 2</xref>. El-Rich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411912463322">37</xref></sup> measured the EMG activity of the iliocostalis (60 mm lateral to the midline at L1) and longissimus (30 mm lateral to the midline at L1) in standing posture with or without a 90 N weight in front via a bar. The normalized EMG (percentage of MVC) measurements without 90 N weight were 19±16% and 18±9%. The MVC values of 6.1% generated in ilio5 and 8.8% in long5 in this study were smaller than El-Rich et al.’s measurements, but were within their experimental standard deviation interval. In their experiment, holding an anterior weight produced a noticeable increment in the activities of the longissimus thoracis and iliocostalis, whereas there was no significant change in the abdominal muscles. These measurements also matched our simulation results. However, our simulation results did not show uniform fascicle contractions in some muscle groups. This difference resulted from the limited number of muscle fascicles included in the modeling for considering the computation time. An increment in the muscle fascicles will produce more uniform activation of fascicles in each muscle group. A restriction on the activation of each fascicle, which was assigned arbitrarily in some of the previous analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912463322">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411912463322">38</xref></sup> as a constraint, is the other technique to produce even more uniform activation in muscle fascicles.</p>
<p>Because of the activation of paraspinal muscle, appropriate vertebrae motions were produced. During the erect standing posture, a total extension motion of 4.39° was generated at the L2/L3 to L4/L5 levels, which was close to the in vivo measurement (4.8°) of Wood et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411912463322">39</xref></sup> in which the motion change was calculated while moving from a supine to a standing posture for asymptomatic volunteers. In contrast to this result, flexion motion of 0.26° was produced at the L1/L2 level, while the extension was 0.5° in their experiment, and a relatively large flexion motion was generated at L5/S1 (2.93° vs. 0.4°). This discrepancy probably resulted from the simplified modeling of the T12/L1 and thoracic levels, which were modeled together as one rigid body and the fact that possible pelvic tilting produced by weight loading was not included in our modeling. Even though the supine position cannot be exactly compared with the unloaded status of this study, simulation results show that muscle activation effectively controlled the shape of the lumbar spinal column after body weight loading.</p>
<p>During the desired task, those changes in the intervertebral motion segment angle equalized the pressure/stress in the intervertebral disc, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912463322">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912463322">6</xref>, which tended to reduce the risk of disc injury at a specific level. The calculated nucleus pressure at the L4/L5 level in the erect standing posture was 0.59 MPa, which was very close to the 0.5 MPa value measured in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411912463322">32</xref></sup> The pressure increased to 0.88 MPa with the addition of the 100 N weight in the hand, while the pressure was experimentally determined to be 1.1 MPa for a 200 N weight in vivo. Leaning forward while standing substantially increased the intradiscal pressure to 0.83 MPa. Good agreement was also observed for the case of 20° trunk flexion (0.97 MPa) in the model. Compared with the other levels, relatively high pressures were generated at the L1/L2 and L5/S1 levels, and this could be explained by the aforementioned vertebra motion.</p>
<p>In this study, the whole intervertebral disc was assumed to be a sensory element to check the feasibility of our idea; however, the receptors within a given intervertebral disc are not uniformly distributed and the distribution of the receptors on the surface of the annulus changes with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411912463322">40</xref></sup> Further study will be required for considering the nerve-ending system in the intervertebral disc and muscle activation changes with respect to other possible sensory elements. Through such a method, analysis of muscle recruitment pattern changes caused by an intrinsic source of pain that originates from the mechanical disturbance would be possible. According to Panjabi’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912463322">12</xref></sup> hypothesis, it is expected that the disruption of mechanoreceptors due to injury or surgery will lead to corrupted transducer signals, and therefore, an inappropriate muscle response pattern can be produced that will generate secondary problems.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to the biomechanical model used in this study. We included only 62 muscle fascicles in the model, and therefore, intersegmental or multi-segmental muscle actions were not fully analyzed. The wrapping of global muscles was neglected and activation of the abdominal wall muscles associated with intra-abdominal pressurization, which is thought to reduce spinal loading as well as to stabilize the spine, were not considered in this analysis. More detailed muscle modeling will be required to overcome such limitations. During the optimization process, a local minimi-zation technique was used and, therefore, selection of the initial condition could slightly alter the final results; however, changes in the contribution of each muscle group were not noticeable.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study confirmed the applicability of the sensor-driving control mechanism in the musculoskeletal system of the spine for deriving paraspinal muscle forces. The proposed method allowed for the inter-relation of realistic muscle recruitment and angular motion of the spinal column. It is, hence, an ideal method for the muscle recruitment pattern changes caused by an intrinsic source of pain or degeneration.</p>
<p>Transducer function in the ligament that was not sufficiently considered in this study will also affect the muscle recruitment pattern. Further elucidation of its role in spine stability will lead to a better understanding of how spine stability is maintained under several different loading conditions.</p>
