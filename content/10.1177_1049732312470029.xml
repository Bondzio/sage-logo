<abstract>
<p>In this article I use Social Positioning Theory to explore the experiences of women as they interact with and make sense of evolving health information mediated by formal and informal sources. I investigate how women position themselves within their accounts of information seeking, and the influence of positioning on interactions with health professionals (HPs). Interviewed women gathered and valued information from a range of sources, and were likely to position themselves as autonomous, rather than collaborative or dependent. Faced with evolving health information, women felt responsible not only for information seeking, but also for making sense of gathered and encountered information. Participants did, however, value information provided by HPs and were likely to view decision making as collaborative when HPs fostered information exchange, appeared to appreciate different types of knowledge and cognitive authority, and supported women in their quests for information. Implications for shared decision making are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Many health professionals (HPs) and consumers presume that health decisions are, or should be, based on empirically derived information that constitutes an objective entity which can be found, understood, and used in clinical practice and in everyday life. A brief consideration of medical history (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312470029">Genuis, 2005</xref>) and recent media reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312470029">New research, 2006</xref>), however, lends support for the view that health evidence represents “a transient moment in an indeterminate process of stabilization and destabilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312470029">Wood, Ferlie, &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998</xref>, p. 1730). This notion—that health evidence is provisional, emergent, and incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312470029">Upshur, 2001</xref>)—presents a challenge for HPs striving toward the ideals of evidence-based practice and shared decision making (SDM). The challenge, however, is magnified for consumers who are frequently making sense of health information which is mediated not only by HPs, but which is also incidentally encountered and deliberately sought via informal sources.</p>
<p>There is an increasing tendency for consumers to rely on health information mediated by both formal and informal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312470029">Suter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312470029">Warner &amp; Procaccino, 2004</xref>). The Internet and media, for example, have become important health information providers for escalating numbers of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312470029">Fox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312470029">Grilli, Ramsay, &amp; Minozzi, 2009</xref>). At the same time, there is an emerging consensus that patients should participate in SDM, particularly in situations of medical uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312470029">Müller-Engelmann, Keller, Donner-Banzhoff, &amp; Krones, 2011</xref>). This presents a dilemma for HPs who are encouraged to engage patients in SDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312470029">American Medical Association, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312470029">Canadian Medical Association, 2010</xref>), but do not retain control of the information that informs patients. Furthermore, researchers have neglected the mutual influence of HPs and patients on decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312470029">Hansen, 2008</xref>). Deeper understanding of patients’ perspectives as they make sense of health information mediated by formal and informal sources is, therefore, critical to facilitating constructive patient–HP interaction and SDM.</p>
<p>In this article I use Social Positioning Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312470029">Davies &amp; Harré, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312470029">van Langenhove &amp; Harré, 1994</xref>) to address the overarching question, How do women make sense of and use evolving health information mediated by formal and informal information sources? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312470029">Genuis, 2012</xref>). In particular, I explore the ways women positioned themselves within their accounts of information seeking and decision making, and the influence of that positioning on interactions with HPs. A case study in which medical evidence is explicitly evolving—health management during the menopause transition—provides context for this article.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312470029">
<title>Changing Practices: Management of the Menopause Transition</title>
<p>In 2002 the routine acceptance of hormone therapy (HT) for the prevention of long-term disease in healthy menopausal women was challenged by the publication of unanticipated results from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312470029">Rossouw et al., 2002</xref>). The WHI findings were subsequently discussed and debated by authors in hundreds of articles and editorials published in the scientific and popular press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312470029">Genuis, 2006</xref>). This stimulated dramatic changes in the prescribing and use of HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312470029">Peterson, Thacker, Corso, Marchbanks, &amp; Koplan, 2004</xref>) and significant uncertainty for women seeking to make sense of HT-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312470029">Rigby, Ma, &amp; Stafford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312470029">Sawka et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Approximately 10 years after initial publication of the WHI results, uncertainty in this area of health management is ongoing. This is exacerbated by the lack of agreement between “experts” with respect to HT recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312470029">Ettinger, Barrett-Connor, Hoq, Vader, &amp; Dubois, 2006</xref>). Authors of a National Institutes of Health press release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312470029">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2008</xref>), for example, stated, “Five years of combination hormone therapy is harmful” (para. 7). In contrast, the author of guidelines on the European Society of Gynecology’s Web site asserted, “There should be no concern associated with [HT] use for at least 5 years in healthy postmenopausal women younger than 60” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312470029">Pines, 2009</xref>, para. 3). Not surprisingly, confusion about menopause management has resulted in the view that HPs are not meeting women’s needs for information and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312470029">Ma, Drieling, &amp; Stafford, 2006</xref>), and women are turning to and relying on other sources of health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312470029">Archer, 2007</xref>). This raises critical questions about women’s self-positioning as information seekers and the influence of that positioning on health decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732312470029">
<title>Information Seeking</title>
<p>Accounts of information seeking have been commonly represented as “relatively unambiguous pathway[s] to actions, beliefs and actual events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312470029">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 2001</xref>, p. 200). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312470029">Tuominen, Talja, and Savolainen (2005)</xref>, however, were not alone in suggesting that personal narratives “produce and build . . . experience, emotions, identities and social worlds” (pp. 328-329). Moreover, scholars have noted that discursive practices have constitutive force through which identities are developed and subject positions are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312470029">Given, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312470029">McKenzie, 2002</xref>). It is these views of self, situated in relation to others, which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312470029">Davies &amp; Harré (2001)</xref>, provide the contexts within which people exercise agency by making choices between contrasting influences and actions. Furthermore, cognitive authority—the notion that cognitive strategies are used to determine and justify information sources as authoritative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312470029">Wilson, 1983</xref>)—has been used to explore the influence of information sources, including the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312470029">Rieh, 2002</xref>), media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312470029">Savolainen, 2007</xref>), and public bioethics committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312470029">Kelly, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312470029">McKenzie (2003)</xref> extended this notion by exploring how information-seeking pregnant women used positioning to construct biomedical, experiential, and individual authority.</p>
<p>In this article, I use Social Positioning Theory to illuminate the dynamic nature of patient–HP interactions and to facilitate understanding that moves beyond women’s accounts of information behavior as transparent representations of experience. This framework provides a metaphor for exploring how women identify themselves in relation to information sources and how meaning is made of evolving health information and between people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312470029">
<title>Social Positioning</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312470029">Van Langenhove and Harré (1994)</xref> described social positioning as “the use of rhetorical devices by which oneself and other speakers are presented as standing in various kinds of relations” (p. 362). These relations exist reciprocally and include relations of power, knowledge, and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312470029">Davies &amp; Harré, 2001</xref>). The concept of positioning contrasts with the more static and formal concept of role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312470029">Davies &amp; Harré, 1990</xref>), and allows exploration of changing relationships within an evolving storyline.</p>
<p>Positioning can be illustrated by a hypothetical encounter in which the physician tells a woman, “You are to begin taking this medication as soon as you have picked up the pills.” This represents “first order positioning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312470029">van Langenhove &amp; Harré, 1999</xref>, p. 22). The physician is situated as someone who is in a moral position to tell the woman what to do. The woman is reciprocally positioned as one who follows instructions. Although first-order positioning is usually unintentional, it might be intentionally questioned within the encounter itself (second-order positioning) or when recounting the incident (third-order positioning). The woman might, for example, reposition herself as an active participant in decision making: “I think I’m going to do a bit of reading about this before I decide if I’m going to fill this prescription or not” (second-order positioning). She might also demonstrate third-order positioning by describing the interaction to a third party and adding, “It’s my body. I’m going to do a bit of reading before deciding whether or not I’ll take the medication.” In this article, participants’ accounts represent first-order positioning within the participant–interviewer encounter and, as participants related stories about their interactions with HPs and others, third-order positioning.</p>
<p>Although scholars have effectively used Social Positioning Theory as a lens for exploring the multiple storylines that are used to construct identity within social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312470029">Julien &amp; Given, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312470029">McKenzie, 2002</xref>), explicit use of this approach is limited in health research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312470029">Matusek &amp; Knudson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312470029">Ziółkowska, 2009</xref>). Positioning is, however, evident in the medical literature itself. In pre-WHI literature, postmenopausal women were positioned as unhealthy patients in need of medical intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312470029">Genazzani and Gambacciani (2001)</xref>, for example, stated, “At this time [during menopause] a series of biological transformations takes place and each of those will interfere with the lifestyle and well-being of the last period of a woman’s existence” (p. S49). During the same time period, medical writers positioned women as noncompliant recipients of recommended HT treatment (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312470029">Thompson, 1995</xref>). This contrasts with post-WHI accounts, which have tended to position menopausal women as active participants in SDM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312470029">Schonberg, Davis, &amp; Wee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The unexamined, implicit positioning evident in published articles raises concerns. Decision-making stances are presented in much of the literature as stable patient traits. Authors of a recent systematic review, for example, suggested that, based on perceived patient or population characteristics, HPs are deciding who will prefer or benefit from SDM and are shaping clinician–patient interaction accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312470029">Légaré, Ratte, Gravel, &amp; Graham, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, scholars and researchers have tended to focus on what HPs do to involve patients in decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312470029">Légaré et al., 2008</xref>); few have explored what patients do to engage in and influence SDM. This ignores a fundamental supposition: “If a decision is shared, [patients] decide to share it just as much as the physician does” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312470029">Hansen, 2008</xref>, p. 1368). In this article I seek to address this gap in the literature by considering women’s experiences and self-positioning as information seekers and decision makers.</p>

<title>The Study</title>
<p>The protocol on which this article is based received approval from the Health Research Ethics Board and the Education, Extension, Augustana Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta. It also received Covenant Health Administrative Approval for menopause clinic recruitment. I emailed information letters to participants following initial contact; letters were reviewed before beginning interviews. Participants read and signed consent forms indicating that they understood the voluntary nature of participation.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312470029">
<title>Sampling and Recruitment</title>
<p>Between February and November 2009 I conducted semistructured interviews with a sample of (a) women (<italic>n</italic> = 28) who had been or were engaged in menopause-related information seeking and/or decision making, and (b) HPs (<italic>n</italic> = 12) acting as information providers for this population of women. Population selection and sampling was theoretically informed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312470029">Creswell (1998)</xref> noted that when using theoretical sampling, data from initial interviews with a primary homogeneous sample (women navigating changing information related to the menopause transition) can be illuminated by subsequent interviews with a smaller heterogeneous sample (HPs). In this article, I focus on the themes and findings that emerged from interviews with the primary participants (women); interviews with HPs illuminated and augmented these findings.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732312470029">
<title>Sample 1, women</title>
<p>Sampling was purposive: recruitment occurred in the community (<italic>n</italic> = 18) and at a publically funded, hospital-based menopause clinic (<italic>n</italic> = 10). This allowed me to gather data from women taking a variety of approaches to menopause management. Notices were placed in health food stores, physicians’ offices, and were handed out or mailed from the menopause clinic. Participants were also recruited by word of mouth (women were invited to share recruitment information with other women), and participants were residents of a single Canadian province. Interested women contacted me by email or telephone. At that time, inclusion criteria were confirmed and, if appropriate, information letters were emailed and interviews scheduled.</p>
<p>Interviewed women were 43 to 72 years of age, with the majority (<italic>n</italic> = 19) being between 45 and 59. Six women were in their 40s; 13 were in their 50s; 6 were in their 60s; and 1 was in her 70s. Based on the latest available census data at the time of the interviews (2006), participants were better educated than average Canadian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312470029">Statistics Canada, 2011</xref>). Three participants had immigrated to Canada from other continents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312470029">
<title>Sample 2, HPs</title>
<p>I recruited HP participants from two multidisciplinary menopause clinics through personal contacts and by referral. Sampling was purposive: a range of disciplines as well as both clinic and the community contexts are represented (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312470029">Table 1</xref>). The interviewed physicians and the alternative health practitioner treated a range of patients, including women experiencing this life transition. The remaining practitioners worked in the menopause clinic context and/or were certified by the North American Menopause Society as “menopause practitioners.” All of the interviewed HPs worked directly with women seeking information and assistance as they navigated the menopause transition.</p>

<title>Interviews</title>
<p>All participants took part in one audio-recorded interview, which occurred in a mutually agreeable location (work spaces, participants’ homes, or public spaces). In addition to interview guides, I used qualitative strategies (e.g., neutral agreement, asking for additional information, summarizing and paraphrasing) to encourage dialogue and clarification. I completed field notes within 24 hours of each interview.</p>
<p>In-depth interviews with women participants lasted 40 to 80 minutes (mean, approximately 60 minutes). I utilized a narrative approach, which afforded women “scope to articulate their experiences in their own terms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312470029">Petersen, 2006</xref>, p.34). This approach also facilitated constructive processes as women related information-seeking strategies, interactions with information sources, and the stories of their menopause experiences. During the latter part of each interview I used “in the moment” elicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312470029">Johnson &amp; Weller, 2002</xref>, p. 492). Chosen on the basis of national readership information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312470029">Canadian Media Directors’ Council, 2008</xref>), three articles containing contrasting information about Vitamin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312470029">Calcium, vitamin D, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312470029">Take vitamin D, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312470029">Vitamin D lowers, 2007</xref>) were presented sequentially to the women. This facilitated insight into women’s emotive reactions and tacit understandings of evolving and media-mediated health information.</p>
<p>HP interviews began after the completion of 17 interviews with the primary participants. These semistructured interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes, and during that time I focused questions on the themes arising from the women’s interviews. HPs discussed women’s information seeking and their own roles as information providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312470029">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were transcribed verbatim. I used NVivo 8 computer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312470029">QSR International, 2008</xref>) to facilitate data organization, identification of emerging themes, and coding. Interviews were theoretically guided. Analysis incorporated both directed content analysis guided by theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312470029">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>) and grounded theory’s constant-comparative method, interactive close reading, and examination of texts for conformity and variation from emerging themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312470029">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). I viewed interviews as sites for social construction and meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312470029">Holstein &amp; Gubrium, 1995</xref>). Descriptive, interpretive, and discursive approaches (I focus on the latter approach in this article) were incorporated as I analyzed transcripts.</p>
<p>Analytic rigor was enhanced through the use of robust sample size and triangulation. The latter served to “corroborate, elaborate or illuminate the research in question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312470029">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2006</xref>, p. 202). Findings were triangulated in three ways. I used two interview approaches (narrative and elicitation) to facilitate in-depth examination of women’s experiences; two data sources (women and HPs) to augment primary findings; and, theory triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312470029">Patton, 1999</xref>) to illuminate analysis. In this article I focus on findings related to Social Positioning Theory. In addition to triangulation and data interpretation from descriptive, interpretive, and discursive perspectives, I took the following measures to strengthen credibility: (a) identification and exploration of negative instances, (b) discussion and debriefing with peers, and (c) careful documentation at all research stages.</p>

<p>Based on qualitative analysis of women’s menopause experiences, I determined three positions which represent how women identified themselves in relation to formal and informal information sources and which provide insight into women’s sense making. In the following sections I discuss these primary positions (autonomous, collaborative, and dependent), as well as insights provided by interviews with HPs. I also explore primary factors influencing the women’s fluid movement between positions and the tendency toward provisional decision making. In a final section I discuss the implications of these findings for SDM between women and HPs.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312470029">
<title>Women’s Autonomous Positioning</title>
<p>When asked at the beginning of their interviews how they would go about exploring a concern about health or well-being, 25 of the 28 interviewed women immediately provided a personal heuristic for health information seeking. Close examination of responses demonstrated that women described a familiar series of interlinked steps which moved fluidly between multiple sources. Thirteen women stated they would begin investigations with an independent exploration of sources (e.g., Internet or books), 6 began with interpersonal sources (e.g., mothers or friends), and the remaining 6 said they would begin by consulting a HP. This indicates that the majority of the women were prepared to autonomously initiate health information seeking.</p>
<p>I found three additional themes that were indicative of autonomous positioning. First, many women adopted biomedical language to establish their authority (“I’m probably my own general practitioner”). Second, women explicitly asserted personal accountability for health management (“I’m responsible for my health”). Finally, during the interviews women recounted specific instances of directing investigation and/or treatment of menopause concerns (“I insisted, ‘You have to give me an ultrasound because I feel it’s not going away and I am concerned’”).</p>
<p>Almost all of the women who primarily positioned themselves as collaborative or dependent intermittently adopted autonomous positioning. For example, a subset of these women demonstrated autonomy by using over-the-counter products and/or alternative therapies. In fact, a number of participants explicitly expressed reliance on biomedical authority and information from physicians but, without telling their HPs, they sought treatment from alternative health practitioners.</p>
<p>Consistent with the literature, participants were largely unaware of positioning practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312470029">Davies &amp; Harré, 2001</xref>). When explicitly asked about their roles in personal health management, however, almost every woman positioned herself as an autonomous decision maker. Unequivocal positioning occurred even when the women clearly indicated collaborative or dependent positioning. When asked about primary responsibility for personal health, for example, one woman quickly answered, “Oh, me.” This contrasted markedly with earlier statements in which this participant related that if she was wondering about the severity of a health concern she would talk to her physician’s receptionist and “they decide if I should come in.”</p>
<p>A small group of women positioned themselves as autonomous, but demonstrated ambivalence toward this positioning. This finding was exemplified by the account of one participant who situated herself as an independent, motivated information seeker: “From the beginning of my menopause, I kind of was my own doctor.” Later in the interview, however, she stated, “I wish that [menopause information] was given to us when you reach a certain age.” This finding is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312470029">Henwood, Wyatt, Hart, and Smith (2003)</xref>, who found that patients did not necessarily wish to independently seek health information.</p>
<p>Women primarily drew on individual authority when relating accounts that demonstrated autonomous positioning. That is, they “relied on themselves as cognitive authorities, using their own reasoning, bodies, or experience as evidence against which to test the authority of other sources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312470029">McKenzie, 2003</xref>, pp. 281-282). A prominent finding was that individual authority was derived from women’s positions as unique interpreters of their own bodies and physical experiences. This is illustrated by the following emphatic statements by two of the interviewed women: “No one knows your body better than you do.” “If I’m the least bit skeptical, I’m going to pursue it. It’s my body. It’s my health.”</p>
<p>By positioning themselves as autonomous, women in this sample reciprocally constructed HPs as either “trusted guides” or “hired consultants.” In the following quotation, for example, the participant positioned her physician as a guide:
<disp-quote>
<p>[The doctor] said, “This is the information. It’s completely your choice.”. . . So I felt like I was engaged with somebody who would really be patient with my own decision-making process and yet was able to kind of stand up to that still and say, “But here are the things that you might gain from [HT].”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of HPs as consultants was explicitly presented by other participants: “The doctor is someone that I pay to help me.” “[That physician] and I are no longer in a consultant relationship.” The latter statement alludes to another theme: participants who positioned themselves as autonomous (and in some cases, collaborative) tended to view HPs as replaceable. Other participants illuminated this finding: “I will easily find another physician if we can’t establish rapport.” “I dropped him [the physician] like a hot potato.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312470029">
<title>HPs and Autonomous Positioning</title>
<p>Many of the interviewed HPs drew on biomedical authority and reported that they tried to “help put things in perspective” for women. Some of the interviewed HPs, however, supported the notion of autonomous positioning. One HP explained that she tried to balance her own beliefs while providing information and trying to understand women’s beliefs. This HP suggested that women could then “make the most informed decision for themselves, because I don’t know what that is.” Another HP supported the notion of HPs as consultants: “[Women are] consulting me as far as what’s best for them.” This HP subsequently, however, suggested that autonomy was discretionary from the perspective of HPs:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s no hard and fast answer. If [women are] really distressed and depressed and then you might have to say, you might have to be more aggressive as far as your treatments go. But for women who are looking for something for symptom relief and being uncomfortable, I think just give them the options and let them make the final say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion that autonomy is an HP-authorized phenomenon was supported by other interviewed HPs: “It takes such a skilled practitioner to allow that—that patient preference to dominate, and not get frustrated.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312470029">
<title>Women’s Collaborative Positioning</title>
<p>The second position I distinguished was that of women as collaborative information seekers and decision makers, with HPs reciprocally positioned as cocollaborators. Participants positioned themselves as collaborative by using words such as <italic>equal</italic> or <italic>partnership</italic> to describe relationships with HPs. Collaborative positioning demonstrated by the women incorporated varying degrees of personal vs. HP involvement and is in keeping with literature demonstrating that women seek information sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312470029">Brown, Carroll, Boon, &amp; Marmoreo, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Unique contributions I found within this data were two key features which were critical for women participants’ collaborative self-positioning: information exchange, and mutual appreciation for different types of knowledge and cognitive authority. A number of women, for example, described their exchanges with HPs as a “conversation.” This finding was demonstrated by the account of one woman when she spoke of her relationships with HPs at a menopause clinic: “That conversational thing, yeah, that is important to me. . . . It’s not a receptor only.” Another woman alluded to the notion of information exchange when she explained that HPs helped her understand the medical aspect of health management, while she contributed experiential expertise.</p>
<p>Participants who demonstrated collaborative positioning perceived that HPs valued not only biomedical authority, but were interested in other forms of knowledge. One woman, for example, valued a HP who did not “discard the fact that I want to use supplements.” Another highlighted a collaborative relationship with a physician who was willing to act on concerns derived from lived experience: “[The doctor] said, ‘I’m not concerned. But if you’re concerned, let’s follow up.’ Bingo! That’s what I want, because she’s honoring my concern.”</p>
<p>Women were also more likely to relate accounts demonstrating collaborative positioning if they perceived that HPs viewed them as collaborators. This theme is strongly supported by the women’s interviews. Support is also demonstrated by the account of an interviewed HP who related that on one occasion she had criticized celebrity-mediated health information. She acknowledged that her explicit criticism had inadvertently devalued information that women brought to the patient–clinician interaction. This HP observed,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m going to learn from that and I’m not going to be so critical. I’ll just take out of it the positive aspects and go from there, so that women will remain open when they’re listening to what [I] have to say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When women participants encountered HPs who did not foster information exchange, value experiential knowledge, or view the clinical encounter as a collaborative endeavor, they were less likely to value biomedical expertise. One woman, for example, related a conversation she had with a family doctor after she began using an over-the-counter remedy: “[The doctor] said, ‘Well, that needs more study. We need the facts.’ I said, ‘The facts are that my cholesterol came down from 9 to 5.2.’” In this exchange the HP drew on knowledge entitlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312470029">Tuominen &amp; Savolainen, 1997</xref>) and asserted that the remedy’s efficacy was not based on “facts.” The woman responded by drawing on authority offered by cholesterol figures. Even though this HP’s concern might have been valid, his reported comments devalued the patient’s knowledge and inhibited information exchange. The woman related that she consequently disregarded this HP’s biomedical expertise. She later began seeing an HP who fostered information exchange. When discussing this relationship, she positioned herself as collaborative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312470029">
<title>HPs and Collaborative Positioning</title>
<p>Interviewed HPs acknowledged the importance of collaborative relationships. One HP, for example, noted, “Women buy into their treatment a lot more if it’s a partnership approach.” Although many HPs explicitly positioned themselves as collaborators, they commonly drew on biomedical knowledge and knowledge entitlement to establish their authority. For example, HPs used the word <italic>evidence</italic> as a warrant for the factual nature of the information they provided: “I’ll give information as far as what supplements kind of have backing and what ones really don’t have the evidence to show that they’re beneficial.” “Our practice is based on evidence-based guidelines from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.” In the latter quotation, the HP used category entitlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312470029">Potter, 1996</xref>), the notion that practice is trustworthy because it is based on a culturally available category that carries with it shared meaning. In this case “evidence-based” carries inferences of accepted authority.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312470029">
<title>Women’s Dependent Positioning</title>
<p>A small number of interviewed women positioned themselves as dependent on HPs for information and decision making. This was demonstrated by deference to biomedical authority and/or category entitlement. One interviewed woman, for example, stated, “I take two of those because my doctor said.” For this participant, the doctor belonged to a category of people with the moral authority to dictate behavior.</p>
<p>The majority of women who discursively positioned themselves as dependent, however, did so indirectly by relating accounts in which they were passive recipients of HPs’ actions. For example, “My doctor definitely said—I was—we were going to stop it immediately.” Furthermore, dependent positioning tended to be evident for a specific reason or period of time. One participant told me, “At that point I decided to put my faith in that doctor.” This comment described the participant’s perspective at the end of a long and self-directed search for relief from severe menopause symptoms. After finally finding a physician she believed could help her, the participant related that she decided to stop looking for information and rely on the recommendations of that physician.</p>
<p>Although dependent positioning was uncommon in women’s stories of their menopause experiences, half of the interviewed women indicated that they would seek input from HPs to make sense of the information within the elicitation articles. This suggests that women were interested in authoritative biomedical input when confronted by conflicting media-mediated health information and when sense making was desired immediately. Women’s dependent self-positioning reciprocally positioned HPs as prescribers and decision makers: “My gynecologist put me onto a replacement patch.” A few women expressed a desire for HPs to provide explicit recommendations. The following comment, made by one woman struggling to understand HT risks, is representative of those wishing explicit treatment recommendations: “We discussed risk again and I said, ‘You know what? I don’t know what other people are doing, but I need some sort of recommendation.’”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312470029">
<title>HPs and Dependent Positioning</title>
<p>Interviews with HPs supported the notion that some women seek explicit direction from HPs. One HP observed, “There’s some women who want to be told what to do still. There are some who, given the options, they say, ‘Well, you pick.’” Although the majority of HPs positioned themselves as collaborators, focus on biomedical authority and “factual” information inadvertently positioned women as dependent on HPs for accurate information. This is illustrated by the HP who stated, “If [women have] a misconception or [incorrect] information, it’s straightening that out, too.” Another HP, however, observed that professional literature discursively constructs women as dependent. She noted that guidelines from health associations tend to communicate, “Why don’t people understand that this is the right [information]?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312470029">
<title>Dynamic Positioning</title>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312470029">van Langenhove and Harré’s (1999)</xref> assertion that it is not fixed roles but fluid positionings which are utilized as people seek to cope with life situations, I found that women moved fluidly between autonomous, collaborative, and dependent positions. Primary factors influencing dynamic positioning were (a) interactions with HPs and (b) personal context—particularly the experience of symptoms. Associated with women’s fluid positioning was a strong tendency to view decisions about menopause management as provisional.</p>
<sec id="section18-1049732312470029">
<title>Interaction with HPs</title>
<p>The perceived nature and quality of interactions with HPs influenced women’s self-positioning and played a primary role in movement between positions. For example, women’s narratives demonstrated that they were influenced toward autonomous self-positioning by interactions with HPs who did not engage with them as collaborators and/or did not engage with the information they brought to the patient–HP encounter. One participant, who tended to position herself as dependent, reflected on an interaction that temporarily changed her self-positioning: “My doctor was talking about putting me on medication. I wasn’t fond of that idea. . . . I suppose that was probably the catalyst.” Reluctance to accept positioning that, according to her narrative, made her the object of action (“putting me on medication”), thus became the catalyst for adopting autonomous positioning. This woman rejected the advised treatment and found a new physician.</p>
<p>Similarly, another participant positioned herself as a collaborator with an HP who shared information but, when reporting interaction with a second HP who did not foster two-way communication, she positioned herself as autonomous:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is the reason that I like Dr. [Q]: because he gives you information. He’s open with you. . . . He shows you the lab [laboratory] results. Other doctors, they just—like I went to the doctor here in the medical center, Dr. [R], and he checked my blood pressure. I said, “How high is it?” “Oh, it’s okay.” A bit old fashioned. So next time I go to the medical center, I’ll go to the other [doctor].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The final two sentences in this quotation demonstrate third-order positioning. The HP did not engage with the patient’s question and responded vaguely. In the context of the interview, the participant positioned the HP as out of date and repositioned herself as having an active role in personal health management.</p>
<p>Scholars recognize that patient preferences with respect to HPs’ decision-making roles vary and that clinicians should assess patient preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312470029">Rodriguez-Osorio &amp; Dominguez-Cherit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312470029">Salkovskis &amp; Rees, 2004</xref>). Most interviewed HPs, however, did not appear to appreciate their influence on women’s positioning, or how they might positively influence patient–HP collaboration. This lack of awareness is exemplified by the following quotation drawn from one of the HP interviews:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult to say how they make decisions because you can hear from women saying, “Well, I want to hear from you, doctor, that’s why I came to see you.” And [others] say, “By the way, I’m not going to take any medications because I believe in [blank].”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By demonstrating an interest in the knowledge brought by patients to the clinical encounter, however, HPs positioned themselves as collaborators, and women were likely to respond by positioning themselves reciprocally. This was illustrated by one of the interviewed HPs:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t see myself as much as “the doctor with all the knowledge and I’m going to tell you what to do.” Maybe I did at one point. But right now it’s more, “Okay, here’s some information. Let’s work through it together. I don’t have all the answers. We’re going to figure out the answers together.” And people find some information that sometimes I don’t know about. And then they bring it to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although HPs’ influence on patient positioning might appear self-evident, my examination of the data indicates that explicit consideration of women’s self-positioning will provide insight into information-seeking and decision-making stances. This consideration will, in turn, allow HPs to actively facilitate collaborative positioning by encouraging information exchange and demonstrating appreciation for the knowledge women bring to the clinical encounter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312470029">
<title>Personal context</title>
<p>A second theme emerging from the data was that women’s changing contexts were associated with fluid movement between positions. This theme was highlighted both by women who moved away from and those who moved toward autonomous positioning. The influence of personal context is exemplified by the account of one participant who, when challenged by ongoing, life-disrupting menopause symptoms, adopted dependent positioning: “I went to a gynecologist and I told him, ‘This is what’s happening. What do you suggest?’ . . . So he put me on hormone replacement.” Unlike other portions of this participant’s interview, these sentences do not demonstrate information gathering from multiple sources, information checking, or involvement in decision making. Instead, the participant provided context for positioning herself as a passive recipient of therapy:
<disp-quote>
<p>If my youngest child was fifteen or twelve at the time, and I didn’t have more responsibility for younger children, I could have coped with [symptoms]. But I took on raising my grandson . . . I went back to getting up at night. Changing his diaper, bottles at night, and the full care of the kind of thing I was used to doing in my twenties . . . that made me realize that I didn’t have the energy or the strength to look after a super-active toddler.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other women moved toward autonomous self-positioning as a result of their symptom experience. This is illustrated by a participant who reported that she had been a passive recipient of health care for most of her life. When she began experiencing challenges including severe menopause symptoms, however, that changed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I reached a point in my life where it was time for changes. And health was just one of the things that needed to be dealt with . . . and the only person that could fix it was me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Context, therefore, influenced but was not predictive of positioning</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312470029">
<title>Provisional decision making</title>
<p>Unlike HPs who tended to view the clinical encounter as a linear interaction leading to a treatment decision, women viewed their decisions about menopause management as provisional. In particular, the decision to use HT represented a provisional decision that was situated within a context of ongoing information seeking about treatment dosage and duration. This is exemplified by the account of one long-time HT user who explained that she had a “great” doctor on whom she relied for management of menopause symptoms. Recently, however, she had encountered friends who described their experiences discontinuing HT. The participant consequently discontinued therapy: “I just thought that maybe it was time and I wanted to give it a try.” According to the participant, her physician responded, “Well, we’re done here. . . . Now you can go back to your own family doctor.” During the retelling of the incident in the interview context, the participant reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was like I turned [decision making] over to the doctor and then decided to take it back. And that wasn’t a good thing. You know, just from the way that she reacted to that. And really, I guess I didn’t even—when I decided to go off [HT]—I didn’t even think, “What would the doctor think about this?” I thought it was okay making my own decision.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the quoted participant had at one time been strongly in favor of using HT to manage her symptoms, she was representative of other interviewed women in that she viewed her decision as provisional. By independently changing her approach to menopause management, she moved from dependent to autonomous positioning. This had an unanticipated result: the attending physician was reciprocally repositioned from decision maker to consultant.</p>

<title>Implications for Shared Decision Making</title>
<p>These findings have implications for SDM, a common phrase which has connotations of active involvement by both HPs and patients. Although authors of a systematic literature review indicated that the definition and use of this phrase is contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312470029">Moumjid, Gafni, Brémond, &amp; Carrère, 2007</xref>), SDM has come to represent a midpoint between “paternalistic” and “informed choice” models of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312470029">Elwyn, Edwards, &amp; Kinnersley, 1999</xref>). In the former, patients provide consent for treatments advocated by physicians; in the latter, information is transferred from HP to patient, thus enabling independent decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312470029">Charles, Gafni, &amp; Whelan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312470029">Elwyn et al., 1999</xref>). SDM, however, is characterized by a patient and HP who share information and agree on management decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312470029">Müller-Engelmann et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The trend toward SDM has been shaped by sociocultural discourses related to women’s, patients’, and consumers’ rights (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312470029">Tomes, 2007</xref>). This has discursively constructed perceptions of autonomy and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312470029">Charles et al., 1997</xref>), with SDM becoming embedded in notions of patient-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312470029">American Medical Association, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312470029">Canadian Medical Association, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, SDM has been identified as particularly suitable in situations of chronic illness and uncertainty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312470029">Müller-Engelmann et al., 2011</xref>), and in the context of menopause management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312470029">Légaré &amp; Brouillette, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Parallels can be drawn between women’s self-positioning and decision-making models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312470029">Table 2</xref>). Women who positioned themselves as autonomous resembled those adhering to the informed-choice model. These women presumed personal responsibility and viewed HPs as consultants or guides who provided formal health information, which women then utilized in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>I found, however, that whereas the “informed patient discourse” is limited by the one-way transfer of health information from HPs to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312470029">Henwood et al., 2003</xref>), interviewed women who positioned themselves as autonomous tended to utilize information from multiple sources. Faced with uncertain information, women who assumed autonomous positioning felt responsible not only for information seeking, but also for making sense of conflicting and evolving menopause-related information. To make sense of uncertainty, interviewed women sought and were empowered by a plethora of sources, perhaps most significantly by the Internet. Women regularly gathered information from HPs and from the Internet before making health management decisions. Furthermore, participants valued both established consumer health Web sites and a range of more informal Web-based resources. A typical example was provided by one participant who valued both information on hospital Web sites and “testimonials from individuals that have been impacted by that medication or by that herb that they’re using.”</p>
<p>Participants who positioned themselves as collaborative decision makers frequently viewed their own contributions as being related to personal experience, characteristics, and/or context. They looked to HPs for biomedical expertise. Writers addressing SDM in the literature, however, tend to focus on “transferring technical information, making sure patients understand this information, helping patients base their preference on the best evidence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312470029">Légaré &amp; Brouillette, 2009</xref>, p. 170). This perspective contrasts with that of interviewed women who positioned themselves as collaborators. These women emphasized the importance of HPs who engaged in information exchange as opposed to information delivery, and who were open to hearing about other sources of information.</p>
<p>Only a small number of study participants positioned themselves as dependent, thus adopting a “paternalistic” decision-making model. Evidence of this model in narratives was commonly indirect or evident for a finite period of time. Moreover, most of the women who explicitly adopted a decision-making model wherein they provided consent for treatments advocated by HPs based this positioning on trust established with specific HPs.</p>
<p>Just as sociocultural discourses have shaped notions of SDM, these same discourses have discredited paternalistic decision making in health care. The discursive construction of patients’ rights has brought issues of choice to the foreground. The former “doctors know best” discourse has been replaced by the discursive construction of the HP as an enabler of patient choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312470029">Hvas &amp; Gannik, 2008</xref>). This was supported by interviewed women and HPs. An interviewed HP noted, “It’s really about the options, so that [women] understand that there’s a range of options [they] can choose.”</p>
<p>Despite this emphasis on choice, HPs in this sample focused primarily on information and options they provided; they were leery of information originating from informal sources. One of the interviewed HPs, for example, noted that when women gathered information about treatment prior to consulting HPs, “Then we have to try to take things a step back and reexplain, and maybe sort of help them see the truth in some of the messages.” This highlights a notable dilemma: although patient participation in decision making appears to be an important goal for HPs, the balance between physician and patient input remains unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732312470029">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Before concluding it is important to note that although this study was limited by its context, ongoing ambiguity with respect to menopause management was, for both women and HPs, representative of information seeking and decision making in the context of uncertainty. Participation might have had greater appeal for women experiencing health challenges, because these women might be more likely to self-identify as information seekers. Similarly, those HPs self-identifying as information providers might have been more likely to participate in interviews. There are, therefore, limitations associated with sampling. Finally, data gathering occurred in a setting in which health care is publicly funded, potentially limiting generalizability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732312470029">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a thought-provoking editorial, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312470029">Hansen (2008)</xref> suggested that there is critical need for research that builds understanding of the mutual influence of consumers and HPs on decision making. In this article I have brought attention to decision making as a joint patient–HP venture by highlighting women’s dynamic positioning as information seekers and by bringing focus to specific factors that influence women’s positioning as decision makers. I have also demonstrated that although Social Positioning Theory has received limited attention in the health literature, this theory provides a promising lens for examining patient–clinician interaction.</p>
<p>The findings also have practical implications. This life transition presented a unique context: women were not only interacting with formal and informal health information, they were also aware of the uncertainty of menopause information. My exploration of positioning through the lens of decision-making models indicates that although there was a strong tendency for women to position themselves as responsible for decision making, their preferred approach fell between SDM and the informed-choice model. Most participants valued information from, advice given by, and information exchange with HPs. They also, however, valued information from other sources and believed that they should make decisions about managing this life transition. Furthermore, women indicated that collaborative decision making can be deliberately fostered by HPs. Women were likely to view decision making as a joint venture with HPs who fostered two-way communication, appeared to appreciate different types of knowledge and cognitive authority, and supported them in their quests for information.</p>
<p>HPs are faced with a challenge as they strive to balance women’s notions of autonomy, women’s need for health expertise, and HPs’ own moral and potentially legal responsibility to provide what they perceive to be optimal patient care. Particularly in areas in which health information is uncertain or emergent, collaborative patient–HP relationships will be facilitated by mutual information sharing and consideration of knowledge and treatment options that are introduced by patients. Although HPs might not always be in agreement with the decisions women make, acknowledging the emergent nature of biomedical knowledge will allow acceptance of provisional decisions based on women’s current contexts, will leave the door open for future collaboration, and will enhance patient-centered care.</p>
