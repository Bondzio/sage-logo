<abstract>
<p>By examining the perception of a responsible gambling strategy, this study developed an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) with respect to the behavioral intentions of casino visitors. The results of the EMGB, which uses structural equation modeling, indicate that desire had the strongest relationship with casino visitors’ intention to gamble, followed by positive anticipated emotion, perceived behavioral control, perceptions of a responsible gambling strategy, negative anticipated emotion, and attitude. The perception of a responsible gambling strategy was also a significant predictor of both desire and behavioral intention, as casino visitors had positive perceptions of casinos that implemented responsible gambling strategies. Casino managers should consider a responsible gambling strategy as an important long-term business activity to increase casino visitor’s intention to gamble.</p>

<p>Although gambling is still controversial in many countries, the gambling industry is expanding at a rapid pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511418365">Lee et al. 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511418365">Cook (1992)</xref> stated that casino gambling has transformed into a mainstream activity, which many people see as fundamentally similar to many other recreational activities. Consistent with this change in the casino industry, it is essential that casino visitors be assured of appropriate safeguards, through responsible gambling strategies, to protect them from the harm of casino gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511418365">Monaghan 2009</xref>). Recognizing the need for the casino industry to have a code of ethics, many casino managers and operators now seek to incorporate casino visitors’ emerging requests about responsible gambling into their marketing strategies. Specifically, casino managers are interested in managing their casino operations in a socially acceptable manner and in implementing socially sound practices. Altering their casino operations to be sustainable (i.e., reducing negative impacts from casino gambling) is becoming a necessity for attaining noticeable improvements in their industry competitiveness.</p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, research on casino gambling has flourished because of the widespread legalization of casino gambling in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>). Most studies have focused on the economic and social impacts of casinos in specific locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287511418365">Carmichael, Peppard, and Boudreau 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511418365">Chadbourne, Walker, and Wolfe 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511418365">Cozzetto 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511418365">Giacopassi and Stitt 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511418365">Long, Clark, and Liston 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287511418365">Stephenson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287511418365">Stokowski 1996</xref>). However, research on understanding casino visitors’ behavioral intentions, using a theoretical framework, has been neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>). One appropriate way of addressing this shortcoming and expanding the body of knowledge in casino-related studies is to employ a sound theoretical framework. Understanding the reasoning process of casino gamblers is important to sustaining rapid growth in the casino industry and to developing effective marketing strategies. Employing a new theoretical framework in the casino context can provide a clear understanding of the complicated process by which casino gamblers form their behavioral intentions.</p>
<p>Although it is not an easy task to understand the complex decision-making processes of tourists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511418365">Lam and Hsu (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511418365">2006)</xref> asserted that intention to visit a tourist destination is a significant clue to understanding their decision-making processes. Tourists form behavioral intention through their own thinking processes, and the derived behavioral intention plays an essential role in leading actual visiting behavior. In this regard, the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB) could be valuable as a new theoretical framework for explaining the behavioral intention of casino visitors. The MGB, first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi (2001)</xref>, is an alternative approach to the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The MGB has recently received attention as a means to understand a variety of human behaviors, such as brand-related behavior, drinking alcohol, digital piracy, and information search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511418365">Bagozzi and Dholakia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287511418365">Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287511418365">Taylor 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287511418365">Taylor, Ishida, and Wallace 2009</xref>) because of its superior predictive ability. In spite of the usefulness of the MGB, this model has not been tested or applied in the context of casinos.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand casino visitors’ behavioral intentions using an extended MGB that adds the new construct of the perception of a responsible gambling strategy to an original MGB. Although studies have explored individual behavioral intention to gamble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511418365">Cummings and Corney 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287511418365">Moore and Ohtsuka 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287511418365">Walker, Courneya, and Deng 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287511418365">Wood and Griffiths 2004</xref>), earlier studies were limited to an examination of gambling behaviors without considering the effect of motivation and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511418365">Bagozzi, Dholakia, and Pearo 2007</xref>). Because gambling behaviors reflect a high expectation to win money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287511418365">Platz and Millar 2001</xref>), the gambling behavior of casino visitors is likely to result mainly from habitual, motivational, and emotional factors, including cognitive factors in the TPB. Therefore, a more advanced model, like the MGB, is necessary to consider these various factors to help researchers and managers better understand the gambling behavior of casino visitors.</p>

<title>Responsible Gambling Strategy</title>
<p>Casinos have long been controversial in many countries. While the casino is a recreational activity for many people, for some people it sometimes leads to serious negative consequences, including financial and personal losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511418365">Lee et al. 2009</xref>). In other words, casinos have very distinctive characteristics, generating both positive and negative outcomes. For the sustainable development of the casino industry, many local governments and casino companies have tried to reduce the risk and severity of adverse consequences associated with casinos through various activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511418365">Hing 2003</xref>). For example, many casino companies in Las Vegas have attempted to change their casino operation styles from gambling-only casinos to integrated resort casinos targeting the general public. Integrated resort casinos increasingly provide visitors with a variety of entertainment options, including theme parks, a variety of gambling options, and bustling convention centers. A Gaming Control Board or the local government has the authority to approve licenses, regulate policies, and supervise casino operations. Casino operators should keep guidelines set by the Gaming Control Board to minimize adverse impacts, such as problem gambling. The Alberta Health Services (the former Alberta Alcohol Drug Abuse Commission) in Canada provides counseling, day treatment, and residential treatment, including short-term and long-term treatments for problem gamblers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511418365">Alberta Health Services 2011</xref>). The Alberta Health Services also develops education and promotion programs aimed at the prevention of problem gambling.</p>
<p>One recently created code of ethics in the world’s casino industry is the formation of a responsible gambling strategy, which seeks to minimize the harmful effects associated with gambling for both the customers and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511418365">Hing 2003</xref>). In other words, responsible gambling strategy is an action or policy taken by casino operators to minimize the harmful effects of gambling on casino visitors and maximize the benefits of gambling for the local community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511418365">Monaghan 2009</xref>). Casino managers worldwide have begun to embrace this approach as a strategy for long-term sustainable development. With respect to the casino operators’ responsible gambling strategies, it is possible for casino visitors to perceive a casino operator’s responsible gambling strategy using their knowledge, information, and experiences (following the definition of perception as an individual’s cognitive process with respect to his or her response to objects, behaviors, and events that are filtered through the person’s knowledge, information, and experiences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511418365">J. R. Anderson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287511418365">Oliver 1997</xref>). As casino visitors become aware of the casino’s responsible gambling strategy, they are likely to form and change their attitudes, interests, and opinions regarding the casino in question. Some scholars have stated that a definite level of perception of objects, behaviors, and events is related to an individual’s decision-making process regarding a specific behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287511418365">Oliver 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287511418365">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511418365">Oliver and Swan 1989</xref>). However, despite the relationship that may exist between the perception of a responsible gambling strategy and behavioral variables, no study has yet attempted to explore their relationship because previous studies have been exploratory in nature, without specific theoretical frameworks. In other words, no empirical research has been conducted to examine whether such strategy influences the casino visitors’ intention-formation process. Thus, this study explores the effect of responsible gambling strategy on casino visitors’ behavioral intentions.</p>

<title>MGB and Extended MGB</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi (2001)</xref> proposed the MGB to address the limitations of the TPB. In the MGB, although all original antecedents (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) of the TPB are included, the role of each is redefined. In other words, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control affect behavioral intention indirectly in the MGB through desire, while these variables influence behavioral intention directly in the TPB. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi (2001)</xref> also claimed that to better understand human behavior, motivational and affective processes and past behavior should be included in the model. Their approach was based on three ideas. First, desire can be a critical factor in explaining a person’s decision formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>). Second, anticipated affective reactions to a specific behavior can be imperative variables in decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511418365">Conner and Armitage 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287511418365">Van der Pligt and De Vries (1998)</xref> also stated that anticipated affective reactions to the performance of a behavior might be an important determinant of intention. Third, past behavior or habit can be a significant determinant of human decisions or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511418365">Bentler and Speckart 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287511418365">Ouellette and Wood 1998</xref>). Therefore, the MGB incorporated desire, positive and negative anticipated emotions, and past behaviors in addition to the original variables of the TPB. Because of its superior predictive ability against the TPB, the MGB has recently been used to explain a variety of human behaviors, including brand-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511418365">Bagozzi and Dholakia 2006</xref>), drinking alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287511418365">Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling 2008</xref>), drinking soft drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287511418365">Richetin et al. 2008</xref>), digital piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287511418365">Taylor, Ishida, and Wallace 2009</xref>), fruit intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287511418365">Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling 2008</xref>), and information search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287511418365">Taylor 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511418365">Ajzen 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>) have emphasized the necessity of revising existing sociopsychological theories to include new constructs that are considered critical in a certain context or that alter existing paths among latent variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi (2001)</xref> described this process as the broadening and deepening of a theory, which can enhance the predictive power of specific human behaviors in specific contexts by providing a better understanding of the theoretical mechanism of sociopsychological theories.</p>
<p>In this regard, the current study proposes a model that expands the MGB by incorporating a new construct, perceptions of responsible gambling strategy, which is deemed an important construct in the casino visitors’ intention-formation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511418365">Blaszczynski, Ladouceur, and Shaffer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511418365">Hing 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511418365">Monaghan 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationships among attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, desire, and intention</title>
<p>In the MGB, the following terms are used: Attitude is redefined as “a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511418365">Eagly and Chaiken 1993</xref>, p. 1); subjective norm refers to the perceived social pressure to perform a specific behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>); and perceived behavioral control refers to an individual’s confidence in or ability to execute a specific behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511418365">Ajzen 1991</xref>). Researchers agree that an individual’s attitude and subjective norm have a significant influence on desire and that these variables do not directly affect his or her intention to perform a behavior. However, they affect intention indirectly through desire in the MGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287511418365">Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287511418365">Taylor 2007</xref>). In addition, previous studies about the MGB verified that perceived behavioral control significantly affects an individual’s desire and both directly and indirectly reinforces his or her intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511418365">Carrus, Passafaro, and Bonnes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287511418365">Prestwich, Perugini, and Hurling 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship between anticipated emotions and desire</title>
<p>In a situation of uncertainty, people may have forward-looking emotions toward future behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511418365">Gleicher et al. (1995)</xref> identified these anticipated counterfactuals as prefactuals, which can affect both intention and behavior. In the MGB, anticipated emotions, along with the original variables of the TPB, are assumed to predict desire in that these emotions lead to the dynamic self-regulatory process implied by the appraisal of success or failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511418365">Carver and Scheier 1998</xref>). Regarding the relationship between anticipated emotion and desire, many researchers have found that the anticipated emotion for a target behavior exerts a significant influence on the individual’s desire-related target behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287511418365">Richetin et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287511418365">Taylor, Ishida, and Wallace 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Although the original model of TPB does not consider the influence of past behavior, several attitude and behavior studies have found that past behavior has an effect on individual intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511418365">Bagozzi and Warshaw 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287511418365">Taylor, Ishida, and Wallace 2009</xref>).

<title>Relationship between desire and intention</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511418365">Bagozzi (1992)</xref> claims that the key factor omitted in the TPB is desire, a motivation-based variable linked to behavioral intention. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511418365">Bagozzi (1992)</xref>, desire is a proximal cause of intention, whereas other variables in the MGB are regarded as distal causes in which influence is completely mediated by desire. In the MGB, attitudes are typically regarded as evaluative appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>). If these evaluations are strong enough, attitudes will influence a person’s intention to enact or not enact a specific behavior. However, evaluative appraisals cannot activate intention without desire because they do not usually entail motivational commitment. The inclusion of desire makes up the TPB by reinterpreting the role of the original variables in the TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287511418365">Taylor, Ishida, and Wallace 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Various approaches have been conducted by scholars to assess gamblers’ awareness, perceived adequacy, and perceived effectiveness with regard to responsible gambling strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511418365">Blaszczynski, Ladouceur, and Shaffer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511418365">Hing 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511418365">Monaghan 2009</xref>). The possible relationships among the perception of a responsible gambling strategy, desire, and intention are supported by some scholars in the field of marketing who have used similar terms for analyzing corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility is conceptually similar to responsible gambling in that corporate social responsibility is defined by managerial activities that, based on the concept of sustainable development, protect consumers and contribute to the development of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287511418365">Murray and Vogel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287511418365">Turban and Greening 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive corporate images, implemented by corporate social responsibility strategies, are likely to directly affect customer attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511418365">Brown and Dacin 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287511418365">Wansink 1989</xref>). The positive relationships among corporate social responsibility, consumer attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511418365">Berens, Riel, and Bruggen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287511418365">Lee and Shin 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287511418365">Ross, Patterson, and Stutts 1992</xref>), and purchasing intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511418365">Klein and Dawar 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287511418365">Sen and Bhattacharya 2001</xref>) have been demonstrated in past studies. In this respect, this study posits that the perception of a responsible gambling strategy has either a direct or an indirect positive effect on a casino visitor’s desire and intention to gamble, as the following hypotheses suggest:</p>

<title>Construct Measurement</title>
<p>All constructs in this study, except past behavior, are measured with multiple items because a set of measures tends to be more reliable and valid than any single measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511418365">Churchill 1979</xref>). Multiple indicators to measure theoretical constructs can also enhance validity, covering various facets of the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287511418365">Kline 2005</xref>). A preliminary list of measurement items was generated after an extensive review of the literature pertaining to the behavior of tourists, casino gambling, and the theories of human behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511418365">Ajzen 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511418365">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511418365">Ajzen and Madden 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511418365">Bagozzi, Baumgartner, and Pieters 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511418365">Bentler and Speckart 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511418365">Carrus, Passafaro, and Bonnes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511418365">Lam and Hsu 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511418365">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511418365">Perugini and Bagozzi 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287511418365">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287511418365">Young and Wohl 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In particular, measurement items associated with a responsible gambling strategy were generated from the current responsible gambling policy of the Kangwon Land Casino in South Korea, the research site of this study. Next, tourism scholars and casino managers were asked to clarify the generated items and comment on whether or not these items were appropriate for evaluating casino visitors’ behaviors. Also, all items were pretested with casino managers and dealers and graduate students. Through these processes a final questionnaire was developed and refined (all measurement items are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287511418365">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Questionnaires were administered at a temporary booth near the main exit of the Kangwon Land Casino, which is the only casino for domestic Korean people in South Korea. The Problem Gambling and Prevention Center for Kangwon Land Casino allowed researchers to interact with gamblers. This research team was given an opportunity that is exceedingly rare in the literature on gambling studies—that is, an opportunity to interview casino gamblers on-site in a live gambling situation. To collect a more representative sample of casino gamblers, and because gamblers’ profiles were likely to be different depending on weekdays and weekends, the survey was conducted with on-site casino gamblers on both weekdays and weekends in the third week of December 2009. Gamblers voluntarily came to the survey booth, where field researchers outlined the purpose of the research project and invited these gamblers to participate in the survey. On approval, a self-administered questionnaire was presented to each respondent.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were completed in the presence of the field researchers, allowing for rigorous monitoring of the data collection process. A small gift of chocolate was provided to those who completed the survey questionnaire. A total of 515 questionnaires were gathered from the survey, but after a thorough examination, 60 questionnaires were eliminated from the analysis because of missing and patterned data. Finally, 455 questionnaires were coded and used for analysis.</p>

<sec id="section13-0047287511418365">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Collected data were analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287511418365">SPSS 2001</xref>) and EQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511418365">Bentler and Wu 1995</xref>). As a first step, an exploratory factor analysis was executed to identify the structure of factors and systematically purify measured indicators of constructs. As a second step, a two-step approach was employed to analyze the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511418365">Anderson and Gerbing 1988</xref>), in which a measurement model for the original MGB variables was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis, and then structural relationships among original MGB variables were estimated. Once an extended model of goal-directed behavior (EMGB) was developed by including the new construct of perception of a responsible gambling strategy, EMGB was compared to the original MGB to determine whether or not EMGB was the best model for understanding casino visitors’ intention formation when considering the perception of a responsible gambling strategy.</p>

<title>Testing for Measurement and Structural Models, Reliability, and Validity</title>
<p>For estimating SEM, maximum likelihood estimation is generally used under the assumption of multivariate normality for collected data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511418365">Byrne 2006</xref>). To confirm whether or not the data in the study violated the assumption of multivariate normality, Mardia’s standardized coefficient was employed. Because Mardia’s standardized coefficient for the measurement model (42.44) was greater than the criterion of 5, it was considered that the data in the current study were multivariate, non-normally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511418365">Byrne 2006</xref>). Therefore, the robust maximum likelihood method was used to estimate structural equation modeling in the study. This method, based on Satorra-Bentler (S-B) chi-square, can provide more robust and valid chi-square values, standard errors, and other fit indices when the data violate the multivariate normality assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511418365">Byrne 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511418365">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511418365">Bentler and Wu 1995</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511418365">Table 2</xref>, the proposed measurement and structural models were found to fit the data well, with a good fit to the data for the measurement model (normed fit index [NFI] = .929, non-normed fit index [NNFI] = .954, comparative fit index [CFI] = .961, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .046) and structural model (NFI = .920, NNFI = .946, CFI = .954, RMSEA = .053).</p>

However, the other two methods, which used confidence intervals and constrained models, supported the discriminant validity levels. Specifically, the confidence interval of the correlation between desire and behavioral intention (.980, .652), plus or minus two standard errors of correlation between the constructs, did not include the criterion of 1.0, based on a confidence interval method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511418365">Anderson and Gerbing 1992</xref>).

<p>Overall, five constructs (positive anticipated emotion, negative anticipated emotion, attitude, the perception of a responsible gambling strategy, and the frequency of past behavior) played an essential role in explaining the formation of casino visitors’ desire to gamble, and three constructs (desire, perceived behavioral control, and the perception of a responsible gambling strategy) performed an important role in predicting visitors’ behavioral intention to gamble. It is interesting to note that the perception of a responsible gambling strategy was also a significant predictor of both desire and behavioral intention. This finding indicates that a responsible gambling strategy is closely related to the casino visitor’s gambling behavior.</p>
<p>The total effect of the study’s variables on intention was examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287511418365">Table 6</xref>, desire was found to be the most important factor, with the largest total impact (.725) on behavioral intention, followed by positive anticipated emotion (.272), perceived behavioral control (.215), the perception of a responsible gambling strategy (.196), negative anticipated emotion (.194), and attitude (.168).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The perception of a responsible gambling strategy is likely to affect the casino industry positively. Little research has examined how it influences casino visitors’ intention-formation process. This study aimed to examine the effect of the perception of a responsible gambling strategy on the casino visitor’s intention to gamble at a casino by developing the EMGB. The perception of a responsible gambling strategy had a positive effect on both desire and behavioral intention and increased the variance of the EMGB. This finding supports the predictive validity of perception of a responsible gambling strategy.</p>
<p>Desire as a sufficient impetus for intention formation was the most important construct among antecedent constructs in the EMGB. In the model, the more important determinants of desire were emotional factors, specifically positive anticipated emotions. The importance of emotional factors to casino visitors might explain why they are more likely to gamble because of emotional rather than other cognitive factors. This might be attributable to the fact that gambling behaviors are likely to be motivated by high expectations of making money, which are related to emotional decision making but not rational decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511418365">Lee et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511418365">Neighbors et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287511418365">Platz and Millar 2001</xref>). This finding would not have been discovered if we had employed only the TPB.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy in this study that there were no unique cause–effect relationships among subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and desire, but attitude was a significant predictor for desire among the original variables of TPB. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511418365">Lam and Hsu (2004)</xref> stated that Asians tend to rate self-monitoring highly and struggle with undertaking a specific behavior because of other people’s attention and opinions for that behavior, the results of this study did not support that conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511418365">Han, Hsu, and Sheu 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511418365">Lam and Hsu 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287511418365">Sparks and Pan 2009</xref>). This insignificant relationship between the subjective norm and desire might be attributable to the characteristics of the study sample. Casino games are not popular leisure activities, and some people have negative perceptions of casino gambling in Korea. This means that casino visitors have unique characteristics compared to other people who enjoy other leisure activities, and they are not likely to use others’ opinions as sources of information when making the decision to gamble. In addition, the insignificant relationship between perceived behavioral control and desire indicates that people usually do not consider their resources or opportunities to gamble at the stage of forming a desire, but they do consider those things at the stage of forming an intention.</p>
<p>The current study using EMGB as a new theoretical framework has both theoretical and practical implications. First, the EMGB accounted for more variance in behavioral intention than the MGB did, which indicates slightly better predictive validity for the EMGB. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511418365">Ajzen’s (1991)</xref> assertion that scholars should consider additional factors and relationships among latent variables to explain a substantial proportion of the total variance in intention. A simultaneous examination of the EMGB not only contributes to enhancing understanding of the intricate mechanism that forms the behavioral intention to gamble but also avoids potential misspecifications that may include unimportant variables or omit important variables in the model. Second, it was found that positive anticipated emotion, negative anticipated emotion, attitude, the perception of a responsible gambling strategy, and the frequency of past behavior were important factors when determining desire. Desire, perceived behavioral control, and the perception of a responsible gambling strategy were found to be significant factors in affecting behavioral intention. Consistent with previous studies of MGB (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511418365">Bagozzi and Dholakia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511418365">Carrus, Passafaro, and Bonnes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287511418365">Taylor 2007</xref>), the results of the current study demonstrate that three additional factors (desire, anticipated emotions, and past behavior) largely enhanced the predictive power of a specific human behavior in the context of casino gambling. Although all antecedent variables in the EMGB cannot make a considerable contribution to behavioral intention to gamble, this is not problematic because the relative importance of individual antecedent variables in the model may differ based on given contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287511418365">Sparks and Pan 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, according to previous research, which proposed possible relationships among perceptions of a responsible gambling strategy, desire, and intention, the perception of a responsible gambling strategy was a significant predictor to determine desire and behavioral intention to gamble in casinos. The finding suggests that the perception of a responsible gambling strategy increased desire and behavioral intention to gamble, as casino visitors had a positive image of casino companies that implemented responsible gambling strategies.</p>
<p>Therefore, casino operators may need to promote responsible gambling strategies because they have a positive effect on desire and behavioral intention. Kangwon Land Casino in Korea needs to continue to provide counseling services for potential problem gamblers at the Problem Gambling and Prevention Center. It is also a good responsible strategy that Kangwon Land Casino restricted by law the residents of the four surrounding communities from visiting the casino more than once a month because the residents are susceptible to problem gambling. Restrictions on general domestic Korean visitors to Kangwon Land Casino to a maximum of 15 times a month should be continuously implemented to minimize adverse impacts of casinos, such as problem gambling. Kangwon Land’s responsible gambling strategy of closing for a few hours a day, thus not being a 24-hour casino, is also effectively minimizing social costs. This responsible gambling strategy helps players not get addicted to casino gambling all day long.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511418365">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> studied casino market segmentation, recommending that the light and multipurpose gambling seekers were responsible gambling segments. Thus, casino operators may need to attract the market segments that enjoy casino gambling as a social and leisure activity. Casino operators may need to encourage family visitors to buy tour packages for surrounding tourist sites by linking casino gambling with local tourism attractions (e.g., local cultural events, museums, and themed villages) as part of their implementation of a responsible gambling strategy. These implications are associated with international trends, in which the casino industry is building integrated resorts, such as those in Las Vegas and Singapore. Casinos in Las Vegas provide more leisure and recreational activities, such as shows, restaurants, and entertainment, to attract pleasure and family tourists. The findings of this study suggest that these types of casino visitors would be more desirable for casino businesses in the long run.</p>
<p>In other words, casino operators should consider a responsible gambling strategy as an important business activity because this strategy provides visitors with a positive image and minimizes social costs in the long run. Therefore, casino operators’ responsible gambling strategies not only help them build positive relationships between casino companies and casino visitors but also provide an effective marketing tool for differentiating them from competitors. A responsible gambling strategy should be continuously expanded as an important long-term business activity to enhance casino visitors’ positive images of casino companies and their behavioral intentions to gamble. This strategy will contribute to minimizing adverse social impacts, such as problem gambling, in the long run. Casino operators should promote materials associated with a responsible gambling strategy to casino visitors, so that they can learn about this information.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations that may be addressed in future studies. First of all, the results of the current study may not be generalized to other jurisdictions because data from this study were collected from visitors at Kangwon Land Casino, which is the sole casino for domestic Korean customers. Therefore, additional research using the EMGB is recommended to generalize the findings from this study to those of other jurisdictions, although the results of this study were generally consistent with those of previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511418365">Bagozzi and Dholakia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511418365">Carrus, Passafaro, and Bonnes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511418365">Oh and Hsu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287511418365">Taylor 2007</xref>). Because the international casino industry has expanded rapidly, cross-cultural studies with different geographical locations would also be useful for increasing external validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287511418365">C. K. Lee et al. 2010</xref>). Second, future researchers may include more important variables not considered in this model when explaining the casino visitors’ intention-formation process. For example, more responsible gambling strategies in the model that would minimize adverse social impacts resulting from gambling activities may include information on self-exclusion and self-limit programs as well as help lines, clocks in the casinos, and decreased access to ATMs.</p>
