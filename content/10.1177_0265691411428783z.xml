<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783z"><title>Ruth Harris, <italic>The Man on Devil’s Island: Alfred Dreyfus and the Affair that Divided France</italic>, Allen Lane: London, 2010; xvii + 542 pp., 67 illus.; 9780713997309, £30.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The tale of Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish officer wrongly convicted of treason, and the way in which the question of Dreyfus’ guilt or innocence became a question of what France itself should be, is well-covered territory in historiographical terms. Indeed, the question must be asked as to whether there is anything left to uncover, or any aspect of the story left untold. Ruth Harris believes that there is, but her wide-ranging account of the Affair, painstakingly reconstructed and scrupulously referenced, is ultimately unsatisfying.</p>
<p>The title itself is a misnomer: as Harris herself notes, the Dreyfus Affair was not about Alfred Dreyfus, so much so that when he returned to France to be re-tried in Rennes in 1899, his arrival was an anti-climax. There was no way that this reserved military man could live up to the passion that his advocates and opponents had all invested into the argument over his role. Indeed, the title underscores the irony of the Affair; that Alfred Dreyfus, as Harris puts, it, may well have been the only Frenchman who had no awareness of the Dreyfus Affair.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. The first and last sections are driven by the narrative: part one covers the events surrounding Dreyfus’ arrest, trial and incarceration. Part four picks up the story upon his return to France, including his retrial in Rennes, and his exoneration. Harris presents a highly evocative narrative. The story, of course, lends itself beautifully to this type of telling. Harris’ skill is clear, as she brings the protagonists to life and makes clear the drama of events. At times, however, poetic licence is stretched a little too far: for example, Harris describes how ‘Voltaire’s anticlericalism touched [Joseph] Reinach’s and [senator Auguste] Scheurer-Kestner’s hearts’ (96); or that a photograph of Emile Zola and his first wife Alexandrine ‘suggests an irrepressible sadness’ (108). French Jews, she tells us, did not welcome those Russian Jews who came to France escaping the pogroms; rather, they ‘were repelled by their nasal Yiddish, food taboos, black hats and sidelocks’ (191).</p>
<p>Parts two and three turn from the narrative to explore the principal actors in the Affair. In part two, Harris focuses on people. She looks at the life-path and external influences that led figures such as the novelist Maurice Barrès, the Jesuit Père Stanislas du Lac, and the brothers Théodore, Salomon and Joseph Reinach to choose to become Dreyfusards or anti-Dreyfusards: who were these people, and what was their vision for France? How was the Affair tied in to this? Her examination of these men tells us much about the stakes involved in defining Frenchness. She argues that we cannot take anti-Semitism or Catholicism for granted in people’s choices; that not all anti-Dreyfusards were anti-Semitic, or Catholic. She also explores discordances on both sides of the Dreyfus divide, such as the hostility between Drumont and the Catholic deputy, de Mun, for example, and argues that we equally cannot take for granted the notion that Dreyfusards or anti-Dreyfusards constituted a united bloc.</p>
<p>Harris sets the players in their times, arguing for the significance of beliefs, such as fascination with the occult, that infused the society that chose to believe in Dreyfus’ guilt. She points to the importance of the trauma of the defeat of 1870–71, and its link to the refusal to believe that the military might be anything other than honourable. She does not pursue this, however, which is disappointing in this discussion that argues for the centrality of context and belief in shaping players and directing choices. Similarly, in part three, where Harris focuses on groups or phenomena that were central to the Affair, such as the Ligue des Droits de l’Homme, established in mid-1898, or the Salons, she begins to think through the role and significance of anti-Semitism during the Affair. She argues that it must be taken seriously as ‘a potent language of hatred’ (244). What was it about the times that generated such powerful hatred? While this is raised as an issue, again it is left unexplored, and ultimately in her thirteenth chapter she simply concludes that anti-Semitism must win out in a ‘dubious competition’ of hatred over anti-militarism (293).</p>
<p>This is symptomatic of the weakness in the book: it tries to do too much. Harris presents an evocative re-telling that will attract the general reader, but looks also to place her work in the historiography through groundbreaking research and analysis. From the perspective of a review that seeks to judge the work on the basis of the second count, while Harris’ research is impressive, and while she raises interesting and important perspectives, ultimately she does not explore these in satisfying depth.</p>
