<abstract>
<p>Most of us focus on one or a few retirement income programs and a single retiree health benefit plan at a time, as benefit professionals, policy makers, current or future recipients of these benefits or scholars. We seldom step back and view the larger picture. We often see the trees and miss the forest. And in doing so, we also miss the extraordinary complexity and interrelatedness of the numerous laws and programs that comprise the U.S. retirement benefit structure. This article is an overview of retirement benefit laws and programs. It examines their origins, evolution and, to some extent, their current requirements. It portrays the collage of retirement benefits that now exists in an effort to provide perspective.</p>

<body>
<p>After conducting a recent program on retirement income in the United States, I was asked by an elderly woman from another country, “Why is this so complicated?” That is a question that those of us who have grown up in the system seldom if ever ask. We are used to it. Yet, when viewed from a distance, we undoubtedly have the most complicated and confusing array of retirement benefit plans in the world. Why do we have so many plans and where did they come from?</p>
<p>No one actually created the retirement benefit system that we have in the United States. It evolved piecemeal in response to various needs at various times. Most advanced countries have a retirement system consisting of one or a few large pension plans and a national health program that is available to all citizens and residents. Many were established or reestablished after World War II under left-of-center governments. They have relatively generous benefits and many of these counties are now having trouble funding them. Some employers sponsor supplemental retirement plans that complement the governmental plans.</p>
<p>The United States fashioned its retirement benefit system in a number of steps over many years. Military pensions were adopted early in our history, at least one in colonial times. There were also a number of private sector plans established before and after World War I that pretty much disappeared after 1929. Social Security emerged from the Great Depression as a major element of the New Deal. It is now <italic>the</italic> most important federal government program to the vast majority of Americans. Government pensions had different origins associated with civil service reform early in the 20th century and the peculiar needs of some public employers. Private sector defined-benefit (DB) pensions emerged as a mass phenomenon after World War II, and the various and numerous defined-contribution (DC) plans were added in an effort to encourage retirement savings for particular groups of employees to supplement DB plan benefits as well as for those without access to the corporate plans.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368713485035">
<title>Social Security</title>
<p>The Social Security Act was passed in 1935, and <italic>monthly</italic> retirement benefits were first paid in 1940. Since then it has been amended many times to extend coverage to additional employer and employee categories (e.g., self-employed, military, clergy and federal employees).</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s, about 70% of state and local government employees (other than police officers and firefighters) gained Social Security retirement and disability coverage via Section 218 agreements between the employer and the Social Security Administration. Such agreements required employee approval through a referendum. The 30% of state and local government employees who do not have Social Security coverage are largely police officers, firefighters and public school teachers in the 14 states that have not joined the system: Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio and Texas</p>
<p>Medicare was added to the Social Security Act in 1965 to provide health insurance to those 65 years and older and to the disabled after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance benefits for 2 years (and to a few other medical categories). The related needs-based Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income programs were added to the Act in 1972.</p>
<p>To most of us “Social Security” means the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. Medicare is a separate but related entity. Combined, they provide a near-universal program of modest retirement income and partial health benefits for the elderly.</p>
<p>Social Security was never intended to provide a comfortable retirement for everyone. Rather, it is one leg in the proverbial “three-legged stool” of Social Security, private or public sector DB pensions and other retirement savings and accumulated assets. For a large number of Americans, OASDI (enhanced by Supplemental Security Income) is their only retirement income.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368713485035">
<title>Private Sector Defined-Benefit Pension Plans</title>
<p>Private sector DB pension plans are largely the result of two interrelated developments. One was the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 and its important Taft–Hartley Act amendments of 1947. The law allowed and encouraged workers to unionize and gave them an effective procedure to do so. It also established a “duty to bargain” in Section 8(a)(5) and delineated a “mandatory subject of bargaining as “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment”? in Section 8(d).</p>
<p>The other development was the rise of the labor movement as a potent force in the United States, beginning in the 1930s and peaking in the 1950s. After the passage of the NLRA, competition between the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) resulted in a massive growth in membership. By the time they merged in 1955 and became the AFL-CIO, organized labor represented about 30% of the U.S. workforce.</p>
<p>During World War II, many employers adopted pension and other employee benefit programs to attract and retain employees in a tight labor market subject to wage and price controls. After the war, a question arose as to whether employer-sponsored pension plans were a mandatory subject of bargaining as defined in Section 8(d) of the NLRA. That is, were they “wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment?” In 1947, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that they were. In 1949, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari and effectively agreed with the Second Circuit. The court’s decision was written in such a way as to apply to employee benefits in general.</p>
<p>The labor movement demanded and won pension and health care benefits for its members. Many nonunion employers voluntarily followed suit, in part to improve their chances of remaining union free. By the mid-1950s, pensions and other employer-sponsored benefits were a fact of life throughout much of the economy.</p>
<p>Retirement benefits were almost always awarded retroactively to current employees even though few if any funds had been set aside to pay for them. This commitment created a substantial overhang of legacy costs. Employers could do this by amortizing such unfunded liabilities over a very long period. That ended with the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. It required full funding of pension (but not health care) plans within 40 years. New plans and improvements to existing plans had 30 years. Strengthening the full funding requirement and reducing the allowable amortization period amount to the same thing. It is now generally 7 years in the private sector.</p>
<p>From the 1950s through the mid-1980s, private sector single-employer and multiemployer DB pension plans became the dominant retirement income vehicle. This is not to imply that they covered everyone. Far from it. Beginning about 1985, traditional DB pensions started to decline in both the number of plans and the number of active participants. Today there are far fewer <italic>traditional</italic> pension plans than there were.</p>
<p>In 1985, there were 167,911 traditional single-employer DB pension plans. By 2010, there were 45,072. Multiemployer plans had a similar contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368713485035">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many private sector traditional DB pension plans have been replaced with DC Section 401(k)-type or hybrid cash balance (CB) plans. The latter operate more like a DC than a traditional DB plan. Many of the remaining <italic>nominal</italic> DB plans have been frozen and have been unavailable to new hires since the freeze date, and employers have ceased contributions for existing employees. Currently, numerous sponsors of such plans are engaged in “derisking” by cashing out participants in frozen pension plans.</p>
<p>Private sector pension (and welfare) plans are governed by the many requirements of the ERISA. They include minimum standards of participation, vesting, funding, disclosure and fiduciary duties. They are also covered by many provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and subject to the promulgations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.</p>
<p>The ERISA also created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure vested benefits of failed DB plans, within limits. The single-employer plan maximum benefit for a worker retiring at age 65 in 2013 is $57,500 per year. That is not the case. For those in mid-career, the benefit is frozen at the time the plan was “trusteed” and there are no cost of living adjustments thereafter. The limits are much lower for multiemployer plans. The maximum guaranteed benefit for a retiree with 30 years of service in 2013 is $12,870.</p>
<p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is funded primarily by a premium on single-employer plans of $42 per participant, plus $9 for every $1,000 in unfunded vested benefits (with a cap of $400 per participant). Multiemployer plans pay $12 per participant per year and are subject to different rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368713485035">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ERISA specifically exempts governmental and church plans. Such plans remain subject to various provisions of the IRC, especially Section 401(a).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886368713485035">
<title>Private Sector Defined-Contribution Plans</title>
<p>Section 401(k) was added to the IRC by the Revenue Act of 1978 to control deferred income arrangements that favored highly compensated employees (HCE). It requires discrimination testing. The actual deferral percentage and the actual contribution percentage tests limit the extent to which 401(k) and other qualified plans can benefit HCEs.</p>
<p>By 1981, when the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations, it had been discovered that the way to allow HCEs to continue to benefit from 401(k) plans was to encourage non-HCEs to participate by providing employer matching contributions.</p>
<p>Section 401(k) plans became widely popular among employees as more and more employers sponsored them. They now represent the overwhelming majority of private sector pension plans and participants. Originally, 401(k) plans served mainly as supplemental savings arrangements that augmented traditional DB pension plans. They have, however, to a large degree, replaced private sector DB plans and now often represent the employer’s primary or only retirement income vehicle. In such cases, much of the cost and all of the risk have shifted from employers to participants. The long-term consequences of this development are not good for most long-service future retirees. Short-term employees and “job hoppers” may be better off since they can take the 401(k) plan assets from job to job.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368713485035">
<title>Public Sector Defined-Benefit Pension Plans</title>
<p>Public sector pension plans were adopted mainly in the 1920 and 1930s, in part to address a problem resulting from the earlier civil service reforms. Once government jobs were protected from the “spoils system” and the undue meddling of elected officials and party bosses, it became necessary to develop an arrangement to get superannuated public servants, who could still go through the motions of doing the job, to move on. The governmental DB pension plan was the answer. It allowed or required a graceful exit at a reasonable age.</p>
<p>Police officers and firefighters were typically the first government employees to be covered by a pension. Because of the physical demands and hazards of the work, relatively early retirement was deemed desirable by all concerned. Teachers were the other early beneficiaries of public pension plans. Many were unmarried women who had devoted their lives to this worthy cause. Numerous school districts dismissed a woman teacher who got married, on the assumption that she now had a husband to support her. As a consequence, during the Depression, many women teachers chose to forgo marriage because they were often the main support of elderly parents and other relatives.</p>
<p>Although public sector employee associations have a long history, government labor unions and the right to collective bargaining largely emerged during the 1960s following the passage of state laws patterned on the NLRA. State and local government unions usually did not have the lawful right to strike. That does not mean that they did not strike on occasion.</p>
<p>The federal government equivalent was Executive Order 11491 issued in 1969. It was not as strong as many state laws and local ordinances because of its effective denial of the right to strike by federal employees.</p>
<p>With the advent of strong unions in many jurisdictions and the lawful or unlawful use of the strike (or strike threat), and perhaps even more important, organized labor’s involvement as adept lobbyists, campaign workers and fund raisers, state and local pension plans and retiree health benefits became more generous. Many state and local governments are now having trouble paying for the promises made but not adequately funded. The decline of traditional DB pension plans and the more recent curtailment of health benefits in the private sector have made these benefits appear to many as overly generous. As a result, they are now under attack in many jurisdictions throughout the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368713485035">
<title>Public Sector Defined-Contribution Plans</title>
<p>Defined-contribution retirement savings are more complicated in the public sector than in the private sector. They include “grandfathered” 401(k) plans established prior to May 6, 1986, Section 403(b) plans and Section 457(b) plans. Section 401(k) plans became available in 1981. During the period 1981 through May 1986, state and local governments were allowed to sponsor 401(k) plans, and many did.</p>
<p>Section 403(b) plans are older. Their antecedents go back to the early 20th century. A precursor of Section 403(b) was added to the IRC in 1942. It allowed only tax-sheltered annuities for investments. In 1958, Section 403(b)(7) custodial accounts were added. They allow investments in mutual funds as well.</p>
<p>Section 403(b) plans are available to public sector education (including public colleges and universities) and other 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations (including religious organizations and Indian tribal governments in existence as of 1995). Section 403(b)(9) allows ministers who have had church-provided housing during their career a special tax-favored housing arrangement.</p>
<p>The other major DC retirement savings arrangement found in the public sector is the Section 457(b) plan. It is available to state and local governments and to certain nonprofit organizations. Section 457(b) plans are especially suited for government agencies that employ police officers and fire fighters, occupations in which relatively early retirement is necessary because of the demands of the job. There is no penalty for withdrawals before age 59½. Section 457(b) plans are sometimes coupled with a Section 401(a) Money Purchase Plan and become the employer’s primary retirement income plan.</p>
<p>There is also a 457(f) plan available to certain groups (executives and managers) of tax-exempt not-for-profit organizations. Section 457(f) and other executive compensation arrangements have recently been complicated by the addition of Section 409A to the IRC.</p>
<p>At one time, 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans were very different in terms of elective deferrals, employer contributions and other matters. In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act made them quite similar to each other. Public sector DC plans continue to serve as tax-favored retirement savings plans that augment a traditional DB pension plan to a much greater extent than in the private sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368713485035">
<title>Retiree Health Benefits</title>
<p>Health benefits and related programs (dental care, vision care and prescription drug coverage) also became a mandatory subject of bargaining in 1949. Their extension to retired employees in the private sector paralleled the expansion of DB pension plans. And their decline beginning, in the mid-1980s, also paralleled that of pensions.</p>
<p>In the private sector, the percentage of “early retirees” with access to employer-provided health benefits dropped from 28.9% in 1997 to 17.7% in 2010. The percentage of “Medicare eligible” (age 65 years and older) retirees with such access dropped from 25.4% to 15.9% during the same period. The numbers were much smaller for employers with fewer than 1,000 employees than for those with large numbers of employees. In 2010, only 6.2% of “all employers” provided health benefits to “early retirees” and 5.8% to those who were Medicare eligible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368713485035">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Public sector employees have fared better, so far. In 1997, the 50 state governments provided retiree health benefits to 76.3% of “early retirees.” By 2010, that number had dropped to 70%. During the same period, the numbers had declined from 68.9% to 63.2% for “Medicare-eligible” retirees. Large local governments (10,000 or more employees) had a similar experience, although the numbers were higher.</p>
<p>Almost all public sector jurisdictions are in financial difficulty, mainly because of the Great Recession. Many state and local governments have cut back on both pensions and retiree health benefits. Pensions are prefunded: albeit, not fully so. Their trust funds as of this writing are about 80% funded. As the financial markets and interest rates continue to improve, and as property and other taxes continue to grow, pension “funded ratios” (assets ÷ liabilities) will recuperate. Public sector retiree health benefits have long been financed on a pay-as-you-go basis from the governments’ general funds. Since there are no or very few assets in these trust funds, public sector retiree health benefit funding will not benefit from the rising equity and other markets. Their availability will likely continue to decline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886368713485035">
<title>Small Business Retirement Programs</title>
<p>Policy makers and others have long been concerned with the failure of small business to sponsor retirement plans. This should not be surprising. Not only is the funding of retirement benefits costly but the administrative and regulatory expenses and hassles are significant. In addition, most employees prefer health benefits to pension plans. As a practical matter no employer should sponsor a pension plan until after it has provided its employees with a health benefit plan.</p>
<p>Over the years, Congress has attempted to remedy the retirement income situation with a number of programs directed at small business, often defined as employers with 100 or fewer employees. They include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368713485035" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Keogh Plans</italic>: In 1962, Congress enacted the Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act that created Keogh plans, also known as HR(10) plans. They allowed the self-employed to adopt a tax-favored retirement plan for themselves and their employees.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Simplified Employee Pensions</italic>: The Revenue Act of 1978 allowed an unincorporated business or partnerships to establish Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans. They consist of an employment-based Individual Retirement Account (IRA) for each eligible employee. An “eligible employee” is one who has attained the age of 21, worked for the employer in at least 3 of the past 5 years and earned at least $550 per year. The employer is required to contribute the same percentage of income for all eligible employees. Contributions are immediately vested, and employees have investment control. For 2013, the employer may contribute up to $51,000 and employees up to $5,500. An important feature of a SEP is that the employer is allowed to reduce contributions during a bad year.</p>
<p>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA ’86) allowed employees to contribute to their SEP through a salary reduction agreement. Such plans were known as “SARSEPs.” This arrangement was repealed by the Small Business and Jobs Protection Act of 1996. Employers, but not employees, may continue to make contributions to former SARSEPS. Penalty-free distributions from a SEP may be made after age 59½. Withdrawals before that age are subject to a 10% penalty and taxed as ordinary income in the year received. Loan provisions are not allowed in SEPs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Savings Investment Match Plan for Employees</italic>: The Small Business and Jobs Protection Act of 1996 created a new arrangement for small business employees called the Savings Investment Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE). It is available to employers with 100 or fewer employees who do not maintain another employment-based pension plan. The employer may sponsor either a SIMPLE IRA or a SIMPLE 401(k) plan.</p>
<p>In a SIMPLE IRA, the employee makes an elective contribution expressed as a percentage of income up to a maximum of $12,000 in 2013 (indexed in $500 increments).</p>
<p>Employers must adopt one of two contribution formulas: (a) Match employee contributions dollar for dollar for the first 3% of income. A special rule allows the employer to reduce this for all employees, but not below 1%. (b) Make a 2% nonelective contribution for each eligible employee.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>SIMPLE 401(k) plans are deemed nondiscriminatory if the employee makes an elective deferral of up to $12,000 and the employer matches it dollar for dollar up to 3% of the employee’s income <italic>or</italic> makes a 2% nonelective contribution to all eligible employees. Employees are immediately and fully vested in the employer’s contribution.</p>
<p>SIMPLE 401(k) plans are required to file an annual Form 5500. Because of that, most employers that have sponsored a SIMPLE have opted for the SIMPLE IRA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886368713485035">
<title>Individual Retirement Accounts</title>
<p>Individual Retirement Accounts originated in the ERISA. Employees who did not have Internal Revenue Service qualified employer-sponsored pension plans were allowed to contribute up to $1,500 of earned income to an IRA and deduct that amount from their income taxes. That amounted to contributing with pretax dollars.</p>
<p>In 1974, employees were allowed to establish an employment-based IRA to which an employer could contribute. Alternately, the employer could establish and contribute to an IRA for each of its employees. An employer could also set up a payroll deduction arrangement for the employees to make contributions. Note that this is different from the SEP and SIMPLE IRAs discussed above.</p>
<p>In 1981 IRAs were made available to <italic>all</italic> workers, including those with a qualified pension plan. IRAs suddenly became extremely popular, especially among those employees with enough discretionary income to make the contributions. Those employees often had a traditional DB pension plan as well. From a tax policy perspective, the wrong people were getting the tax advantage.</p>
<p>The TRA ’86 limited the IRA tax deduction to individuals and families in which neither spouse had an employment-based pension plan and to low-income families <italic>with</italic> a pension plan. Even though TRA ’86 allowed nondeductible contributions and continued to defer earnings on IRA assets, IRAs were now much less attractive to those people who could afford to make contributions. IRA contributions declined significantly.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act resurrected the tax-deductible IRA, increased the contribution limits and added a catch-up provision for workers 50 years and older. The contribution limits and catch up arrangement were made permanent and indexed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For 2013, the contribution limit is $5,500 and the age-50 catch-up is $1,000. Eligibility was limited to those without an employer-sponsored pension plan and those with a pension plan with an income below $55,000 for an individual or $89,000 for a couple. Such plans are now referred to as “personal IRAs” or “traditional IRAs.”</p>
<p>In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act allowed for the adoption of Roth IRAs in which contributions can be made with after-tax dollars. Contributions and earnings on the accumulated assets that have been “parked” for 5 or more years are not taxed on withdrawal. There are also rollover IRAs and conduit IRAs that allow the transfer of funds from other retirement plans.</p>

<sec id="section9-0886368713485035">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What have we wrought? Why have we created such an alphanumeric Byzantine collage of laws and programs designed to provide retirement income and health benefits for the elderly. There are several reasons.</p>
<p>One is that once the Supreme Court agreed that pensions and other employee benefits were a mandatory subject of bargaining and the unions negotiated such benefits for their members, the political pressure of organized labor for crafting a more generous and comprehensive Social Security system lessened. This left a substantial portion of low-wage and small business workers with only Social Security benefits. Congress responded with IRAs to permit employees to save for their retirement under favorable tax conditions and other programs designed to encourage small employers to sponsor pension plans. None of these arrangements has been very successful. Low-income employees seldom have the discretionary income needed to make significant contributions to IRAs and other such programs. Understandably, low-income employees and their families have a more pressing need for of health benefits today than pension benefits someday. Also, many small employers, especially <italic>very</italic> small employers, were financially unable or unwilling to commit to benefits.</p>
<p>As organized labor declined in the private sector, as its political power waned correspondingly and as employer funding requirements became more stringent, traditional DB pension plans disappeared. They have been replaced by 401(k) and CB plans. DC plans are now the predominant retirement plan in the private sector.</p>
<p>Federal, state and local government employees have fared better. They overwhelmingly still have traditional DB plans often augmented by tax-favored 401(k), 403(b) and 457(b) plans. Many of these governmental DB plans are now underfunded, and state and local governments are moving in the direction of hybrid DB/DC arrangements. If history is any guide, the pension landscape of the United States is about to become even more complicated.</p>
<p>A typical benefits professional will deal with from one to three retirement income plans and one retiree health benefit plan beyond Social Security and Medicare. He or she will know a lot about those plans and less about the plethora of other arrangements available. Those of us who have studied and taught employee benefits for years or decades have absorbed the many new programs and expansions to existing programs piecemeal as they occurred. For someone entering the field and encountering the array of retirement benefit plans anew, it must be a formidable challenge. Indeed, it is likely to become more formidable. As federal and state governments endeavor to make retirement income and retiree health benefits more widely available, employee retirement benefits promise to become even more challenging.</p>
