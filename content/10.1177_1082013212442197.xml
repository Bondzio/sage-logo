<abstract>
<p>Chickpea protein isolate was hydrolyzed using Flavourzyme immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose beads by multipoint covalent attachment. This Flavourzyme-glyoxyl derivative, produced after 1 h of immobilization at 4 °C followed by 5.5 h at room temperature, presented approximately 51% of the endoprotease activity of Flavourzyme but was around 700 times more stable than soluble enzyme. Chickpea protein hydrolysates ranging from 1% to 10% degree of hydrolysis were produced and their chemical composition was very close to that of protein isolate used as starting material. Solubility, oil absorption, emulsifying activity and stability, and foaming capacity and stability were determined. All protein hydrolysates showed higher solubility than intact proteins, especially at pHs near isoelectric point of native chickpea proteins. Moreover, all hydrolysates had better functional properties, except emulsifying activity, than the original protein isolate.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212442197" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Functional properties of proteins are those physicochemical properties that govern their performance and behaviour in food systems during their preparation, processing, storage, and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212442197">Kinsella and Whitehead, 1989</xref>). A number of strategies have been suggested to improve the functional properties of proteins, including chemical and enzymatic modifications. Enzymatic hydrolysis may be preferable to chemical treatments because of milder process conditions, higher specificity, and minimal formation of by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212442197">Mannheim and Cheryan, 1992</xref>). To improve functional properties is generally admitted that a limited hydrolysis, between 1% and 10%, is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013212442197">Vioque et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The products of enzymatic proteolysis frequently present a bitter taste due to the presence of hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212442197">Kukman et al., 1995</xref>). Flavourzyme, produced by Novozymes, is a nonspecific protease obtained by fermentation of a selected strain of <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> and contains both endoprotease and aminopeptidase activities. Using Flavourzyme, protein hydrolysates without bitter taste can be obtained. The optimal pH for the enzyme complex is in the range of 5.0–7.0 and the optimal temperature is around 50 °C.</p>
<p>Up to now, most studies on enzymatic hydrolysis to improve functional properties of proteins report the use of soluble enzymes. The main drawback of using soluble enzymes from an industrial point of view is that they cannot be reused. This can be overcome by employing membrane reactors, special solvent systems, or immobilization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442197">Giorno and Drioli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212442197">Okahata and Mori, 1997</xref>). So far most efforts have focused on immobilization, of which many approaches are known including adsorption on appropriate supports or covalent attachment to such materials as well as encapsulation in polymers or in sol–gel materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2007</xref>). A second limiting factor for the implementation of enzymes as industrial biocatalysts is stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212442197">Haki and Rakshit, 2003</xref>). Although several procedures have been employed to achieve stabilization of enzymes, coupling immobilization to stabilization has the advantage of facilitating both recycling and stabilization requirements. In this sense, it has been reported that glyoxyl-agarose beads constitute a good substrate for the immobilization/stabilization of proteins via multipoint covalent attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2006</xref>). The active glyoxyl groups found in these supports are aldehydes moderately separated from the bead surface that form reversible and relatively weak Schiff bases with amine groups in enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442197">Guisán, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2006</xref>). The Schiff bases can be later stabilized by reduction to amine bonds. Many enzymes have been stabilized using this technique, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase A, esterase, thermolysin, catalases, and lipases from different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442197">Guisán, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212442197">Pedroche et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to stabilization, the use of immobilized enzymes onto glyoxyl-agarose beads implies that inactivation of enzyme is not needed because the biocatalyst can be easily removed from the reaction medium. This is especially important in limited hydrolysis, where the time needed to reach inactivation conditions may accelerate the reaction rate, making difficult the control of desired degree of hydrolysis (DH).</p>
<p>In the present paper, we describe the chemical composition and some functional properties of limited chickpea protein hydrolysates (CPHs) obtained hydrolysing chickpea protein isolate (CPI) by means of Flavourzyme immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose beads.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1082013212442197"><title>Obtaining of Flavourzyme immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose gel</title>
<p>The immobilization method chosen was the multipoint covalent attachment of Flavourzyme (through amino groups) to glyoxyl-agarose beads. This method has been successfully used to achieve immobilization/stabilization of several proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2006</xref>). In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013212442197">Yust et al., 2007</xref>), we have optimized the process concluding that the best derivative was obtained with an enzymatic load of 22 µL commercial Flavourzyme/g glyoxyl-agarose gel and after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C followed by 5.5 h at room temperature. The endoprotease and aminopeptidase activities of this biocatalyst are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212442197">Table 1</xref>. Due to immobilization process, both activities decreased, which is a usual result when enzymes are immobilized by multipoint covalent attachment to glyoxyl-agarose beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212442197">Pedroche et al., 2002</xref>). This drop of enzymatic activity was especially high for aminopeptidase whereas endoprotease activity was 50% of the commercial Flavourzyme, a typical value in protease immobilization to glyoxyl supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442197">Mateo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212442197">Pedroche et al., 2002</xref>).

<p>Stability of Flavourzyme-glyoxyl derivative was studied at pH 7 and 50 °C because these were the conditions to be used in the hydrolysis of CPI. The stabilization achieved through immobilization was very high, especially in endoprotease activity whose <italic>pt</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was 676 times higher than that of soluble Flavouryzme. This improvement may be attributed to several factors including prevention of autolysis and protection of enzymes from structural rearrangements due to multipoint attachment to the support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442197">Ferreira et al., 2003</xref>). The high stability achieved offsets the loss of activities, making this derivative an appropriate catalyst to be used in protein hydrolysis on an industrial scale.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1082013212442197"><title>Production and characterisation of chickpea protein hydrolysates</title>
<p>Protein hydrolysates were obtained from CPI using Flavourzyme immobilized onto glyoxyl-agarose as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. At different times, aliquots were withdrawn, removing the biocatalyst by filtration. The variation of DH versus time is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212442197">Figure 1</xref>. The hydrolysates obtained after 20, 75, 120 and 300 min had DH 1, 3, 5, and 10%, respectively, and were selected to study their functional properties.

<p>The chemical composition of the hydrolysates was very similar to chickpea isolate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212442197">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Solubility is one of the most important characteristics of proteins because it is not only important by itself but it also influences other functional properties. The protein solubility profiles of CPI and CPHs as a function of pH are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212442197">Figure 2</xref>. Intact CPI had very low solubility between pHs 4 and 6, with a minimum at pH 4.3 (isoelectric point of chickpea proteins), where approximately 95% of the proteins precipitated. Similar solubility patterns were reported in other legume protein isolates such as soy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212442197">Fuhrmeister and Meuser, 2003</xref>), cowpea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212442197">Ragab et al., 2004</xref>), and bean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212442197">Makri and Doxastakis, 2006</xref>). Hydrolysis increased the solubility at all pH values in this study, except for DH = 1%. The main differences between solubility of CPI and the hydrolysates were observed around isoelectric point. When DH increased, a quick rise of the solubility around this pH could be observed, especially from DH = 3% to 5%. These results are similar to that obtained after hydrolysis of CPI with Alcalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013212442197">Yust et al., 2010</xref>), although CPH 3% obtained with Flavourzyme had lower solubility at acidic pHs than CPH 3% obtained with Alcalase. Therefore, the increase in solubility not only depends on DH but also on specificity of proteases.

<p>As a consequence of enzymatic hydrolysis, oil absorption capacity of chickpea proteins was doubled, which may be due to the fact that the hydrolysis of proteins exposes non-polar side chains that bind hydrocarbon moieties of oil, contributing to increase oil absorption. The hydrolysate with DH = 3% presented the highest oil absorption capacity (660 g oil/100 g sample) and if the DH increases further, the oil absorption capacity decreases, what may be attributed to the major exposure of ionic groups after hydrolysis. This result is better than obtained in the hydrolysis of CPI with Alcalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013212442197">Yust et al., 2010</xref>) where the highest oil absorption was found in DH around 5% (628 g oil/100 g sample).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1082013212442197"><title>Emulsifying activity and emulsion stability</title>
<p>In principle, emulsifying properties of proteins should be improved by limited hydrolysis, due to the exposure of hydrophobic amino acid residues that may interact with the oil while the hydrophilic residues interact with water. But it has also been described that peptides, smaller than intact proteins, cannot form the same molecular interactions than larger proteins, resulting in a less-stable emulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013212442197">Panyam and Kilara, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013212442197">Singh and Dalgleish, 1998</xref>). Limited proteolysis with the Flavourzyme-glyoxyl derivative had none or little effect on emulsifying properties of CPI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212442197">Table 4</xref>). Only CPH 1% showed higher emulsifying activity than CPI, but emulsion stability decreased.</p>
<p>In some cases, a direct relationship between nitrogen solubility and emulsifying properties of proteins has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212442197">Narayana and Narasinga Rao, 1984</xref>). But in our research, although CPHs had improved nitrogen solubility, they showed poor emulsifying properties; therefore, the ability of proteins to form stable emulsions may ultimately depend upon a suitable balance between the hydrophilic and lipophilic residues and do not necessarily increase as a protein becomes more soluble. In fact, reduction of emulsion-forming ability after hydrolysis has been reported for soy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212442197">Tsumura et al., 2005</xref>) and whey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013212442197">Van der Ven et al., 2001</xref>) among others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1082013212442197"><title>Foaming capacity and stability</title>
<p>Foam capacity of proteins depends on several factors such as the type of protein, degree of denaturation, pH, temperature, and the method used to produce the foam. Partial hydrolysis of CPI with immobilized Flavourzyme improved foaming capacity to a great extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212442197">Figure 3</xref>). In fact, CPI did not show foaming capacity whereas hydrolysis of only 1% led to foam capacity of 126%. This property increased as long as hydrolysis progressed, reaching maximum at DH = 5%. The same pattern was observed in the partial hydrolysis of CPI by Alcalase immobilized on agarose beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013212442197">Yust et al., 2010</xref>) although foam capacities of CPHs obtained with were lower than the corresponding to CPHs obtained with Flavourzyme. This improvement in foaming capacity for enzymatically hydrolyzed food proteins has been reported for other pulses such as soy and rapeseed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212442197">Pizones Ruiz-Henestrosa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212442197">Tsumura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013212442197">Vioque et al., 2000</xref>). With regard to foam stability of chickpea proteins, it was also increased after partial hydrolysis with immobilized Flavourzyme, and the highest value was shown by CPH 3%, which preserved approximately 60% of foam after 60 min at room temperature. Considering the two foaming properties studied, the best way to improve CPI characteristics is by hydrolysing proteins up to DH = 3%.

</fig></p>
<p>In conclusion, the partial hydrolysis of chickpea proteins with Flavourzyme immobilized on glyoxyl-agarose beads is a successful strategy to improve some functional properties of intact proteins, such as solubility (especially at acidic pHs), oil absorption, and foaming capacity and stability. Besides, the improvement of functional properties depends not only on degree of hydrolysis but also on specificity of the enzyme. The chickpea protein hydrolysates could be an alternative for other protein ingredient sources that are being used in the food industry.</p>
