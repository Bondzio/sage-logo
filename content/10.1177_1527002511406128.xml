<abstract>
<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) has a fixed salary schedule that allows us to examine this labor market to understand the incentives for players to enter the draft. Previous studies have focused on labor as a choice from the team’s perspective. Early entry into the NBA draft is similar to the decision to exercise an American style put option early; the draftee sells his remaining time in college early. Using mock draft and actual draft data, the authors find early exercise to be rational for all class ranks; though the early exercise boundary is considerably different for freshmen and juniors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following Duke University’s win in the 2010 NCAA basketball championship game over Butler University, two key players from that game, Kyle Singler and Gordon Hayward, had an important decision to make: return to school or enter the NBA draft as early entry candidates. Both players had performed exceptionally well during the NCAA tournament and their draft stock had risen so much that each player had the potential to be a first round pick in the draft. However, their draft position was not guaranteed and the players needed to make an optimal choice from the information available to them. That is, exercise their option to enter the draft early and forgo their collegiate eligibility or return to school for another year to improve their draft stock. We believe that the predictions from option pricing theory could be used to help players like Singler and Hayward make a rational decision to stay in school or go pro.</p>
<p>Academics and practitioners have long recognized the usefulness of option pricing theory as a tool to explain behavioral decisions. In the labor literature, the option framework has been used to explain the decision of the firm to hire risky workers. However, the applicant is also a decision maker, and likewise has an option that they may exercise, the right to sell their labor. We formalize this option decision framework for the applicant and using data for the NBA draft we examine the perspective of the draftee as an exerciser of this option. This perspective is complementary of the existing theories of hiring by the firm, which are reviewed in turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1527002511406128">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>From the perspective of the firm there are several theories that describe hiring practices, including (a) the Human Capital model, (b) the Option Value model, and (c) the Statistical Discrimination model.</p>
<p>The Human Capital model is based on work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002511406128">Becker (1993)</xref>. In this framework, applicants enter the market when they have achieved the necessary skill level to succeed. If an applicant does not have the necessary skills, an employer will pay for training only if they can recoup the investment.</p>
<p>The Option Value model of hiring is based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002511406128">Lazear (1995)</xref>. In it, applicants from high-risk groups can be valuable to the hiring firm if the firm can capture the upside potential. As with traded options, the uncertainty (volatility) has value.</p>
<p>The Statistical Discrimination model of labor hiring is examined in several studies. As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527002511406128">Phelps (1972)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002511406128">Akerlof (1976)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002511406128">Borjas and Goldberg (1978)</xref> study the effects of group signals on the hiring process. In the Statistical Discrimination model, job opportunities for applicant groups that have the same productivity may be different due to different levels of efficiency of the signal. The applicant group with the inefficient signal will be at a disadvantage in the hiring process. In this case the uncertainty has a negative impact.</p>
<p>Professional sports franchises provide interesting settings to study the various theories of labor hiring, as the applicants are competing for relatively homogeneous jobs, and there is often rich comparative information regarding the applicants. With respect to sports franchises, the Human Capital model implies that teams would be willing to sign a player to a contract if they believe the cost of the contract is less than or equal to the value of the contribution the player will make to the team. More experienced players will have more value. At the professional level the franchises can look at the performance of the player through the college years as a signal of their experience. Also, colleges and universities serve as a cost-free training program for professional teams. The only way a team will hire a player whose contribution is less than their cost is if they can recoup the investments at a later date. All things being equal lower salaries and/or longer contracts would encourage the signing of younger less experienced players.</p>
<p>The Option Pricing framework implies that risky players are preferred to safe ones, for a particular wage, because risky players have an upside potential (similar to a call option). In order for a sports team to capture the upside potential, they must have some advantage over other franchises such as (a) costly mobility for the player and/or (b) private information about the player’s ability. Otherwise, the player can capture the option value by shopping around. Sports franchises that can lock players into contracts at their behest can restrict the mobility and capture the upside potential; all things equal the longer the contract period the greater the ability to capture upside potential.</p>
<p>The Statistical Discrimination model would suggest that group signals, such as team and/or team conference would provide signals, beyond those of individual ability, which could influence the decision to hire a player. Players from stronger conferences or from colleges or universities with strong reputations would have an advantage in the hiring process over those from weaker conferences or schools.</p>
<p>Several studies have examined the aforementioned theories using professional sports franchise data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511406128">Hendricks, DeBrock, and Koenker (2003)</xref> analyze the impact of uncertainty on the hiring process in the National Football League. They examine two frameworks (a) statistical discrimination and (b) option value in the hiring process. Both frameworks focus on the relationship between information signals and the outcomes in the hiring process. They find broad support for both models using data from the National Football League. Players from less visible colleges or universities have an informational disadvantage and pay for it through lower salaries, reflecting statistical discrimination. In later rounds of the draft, teams were willing to take chances on marginal (by their measures) non-division IA athletes more often than they were on division IA athletes, consistent with the option value model.</p>
<p>In addition to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527002511406128">Hendricks et al. (2003)</xref> findings on the option model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511406128">Bollinger and Hotchkiss (2003)</xref> find evidence in support of the option value model of labor hiring. They examine the performance of Major League Baseball (MLB) players (excluding pitchers) from 1987 to 1993. They find an increase in the variance of a player’s performance (uncertainty or volatility) raises the player’s salary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis, Hill, and Perri (2007)</xref> examine two models that predict team hiring of talent to explain early entry of players into the NBA draft, where early entry is defined as not completing college. The two models are (a) the human capital model and (b) Lazear’s option value model. In the former, players enter the draft once they have achieved a certain skill level; highly skilled players will enter earlier because they do not need the extra time in college to develop skills through experience. In the latter, experience in college is viewed as a signal; players that enter early have a more varied signal. The model shows that teams choose players where they feel they can manage the downside risk and capture the upside potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al. (2007)</xref> test the first model using a regression of salary on performance statistics, years of experience, and rookie status. Their results support the human capital model; first year rookies tend to be paid more than their experience would warrant while third and fourth year rookies are paid less than their experience would warrant allowing firms to recapture training costs, which justifies the decision to draft underclassmen. To test the option value model they estimate the likelihood of an early entrant being on the “all star” team as a way to measure whether the player has high upside potential. Their estimation shows some support for the option value hypothesis.</p>
<p>While the various theories and previous research can help explain why teams might hire players that have not completed college, they all take the perspective of the firm. The players themselves also decide to enter the labor market. Since we see players deciding to enter the market before completing college (entering early), their motivations are also important. The NBA draft with its fixed salary schedule and contract length for first round draftees provides a nice market to examine the draft from the player’s perspective.</p>
<sec id="section3-1527002511406128">
<title>Background on the Draft</title>
<p>The NBA holds a draft each year to allow teams to acquire the rights to new players entering the league. The rules of the draft are determined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NBA, the 30 NBA teams and the NBA Player’s Association. In addition to setting the rules for the draft, the CBA governs other aspects of the labor market including player contracts and team salary caps. CBAs typically lasts 4–6 years and the current CBA was negotiated and ratified in 2005 and is in effect through the end of the 2010-2011 season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511406128">NBA Players Association, 2005</xref>). Under the current CBA, players drafted in the first round receive a contract that guarantees 2 years of pay along with two consecutive 1-year team options. Players selected in the second round are not guaranteed contracts or roster spots with the NBA team.</p>
<p>To be selected in the draft, players must be eligible in accordance with the CBA. Under the current CBA, players who are automatically eligible for the draft include collegiate players who have exhausted 4 years of collegiate eligibility and international players who are at least 22 during the calendar year of the draft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511406128">NBA Players Association, 2005</xref>). Players who are not automatically eligible but want to be drafted have to declare their early entry eligibility no later than 60 days before the draft. To be considered an early entry candidate, a player must be at least 19 years of age during the calendar year of the draft and be either at least 1 year removed from the graduation of his high school class or be defined as an international player. After declaring early entry eligibility, players have an opportunity to impress NBA teams through individual workouts and predraft combine workouts. During this time period, NBA followers talk to NBA team scouts and use this inside information to produce mock drafts that give players a good indication of their potential draft position. If an early entry candidate is not happy with their potential draft position, the player has the choice to withdraw their early entry request anytime up to the 10th day before the draft is scheduled. College players who withdraw their early entry request can return to college and maintain their collegiate eligibility if they have not signed with an agent and international players can return to their international teams. Starting in 2010, the NCAA mandated an earlier withdrawal date for collegiate players to maintain eligibility that is typically 6 weeks earlier than the NBA’s withdrawal date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527002511406128">Hughes, 2010</xref>). This timeline for prospective draftees is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527002511406128">Figure 1</xref>

</fig>
<p>Along with their potential draft positions, players also have to consider the rookie pay scale when deciding whether to stay in the draft. The rookie pay scale, which was introduced in the 1995 CBA and establishes the set amount a player can receive during each year of his rookie contract based on his draft position, was instituted to help teams add young talent at a reasonable starting price and to satisfy veterans who were unhappy with the larger contracts being given to unproven rookies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). With the set contract amounts, the rookie pay scale has significantly reduced the bargaining power of rookies in the contract negotiation process and negotiations are now minimal compared to before the fixed salary schedule was adopted. In 1994, the year prior to the implementation of the rookie pay scale, the first overall pick, Glenn Robinson, was drafted in June but held out until one day before the season started in November in an attempt to negotiate a larger contract. While not getting the $100 million over 13 years he asked for, Robinson did end up with the largest rookie guaranteed contract in history, $68.15 million over 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002511406128">Bauman, 1994</xref>). In 2009, Blake Griffin was chosen first overall during the draft held on June 25, 2009. Two weeks later, Griffin was signed by the LA Clippers for the rookie scale amount of $10.3 million over 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527002511406128">NBA.com, 2009</xref>). The CBA does allow some room for negotiation as the NBA team is allowed to pay the player anywhere between 80% and 120% of the rookie scale amount. Because the actual dollar amount is nominal, NBA teams typically contract for 120% of the scale amount. Of the 112 players who were drafted in the first round and signed NBA contracts from 2006 to 2010, analysis of salary data indicates 98% signed contracts for 120% of the rookie scale amount. For first round draft picks, the first 2 years of their rookie contract are guaranteed under the CBA with the NBA team holding the option to renew the contract for a set amount in both the third and fourth years of the contract.</p>
<p>Athletes have a limited number of years in which they can physically compete and player turnover in the NBA is very high. At the start of the 2009-2010 NBA season, 257 of the 434 or 59% of the players on opening day rosters had 5 or less years of NBA experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002511406128">Collegiate Basketball News, 2010</xref>). Thus, players who are typically underpaid in their rookie contracts enter the draft early to maximize the time in their post rookie free agent contracts that are not scaled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). Before the 1995 draft and the introduction of the rookie pay scale, only 17% of the players selected in the first round were early entry candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). For the most recent CBA period (2006-2010), the percentage of first round picks who were early entry candidates has risen to 75%. Of these players, 28% were juniors with one year of eligibility left, 25% were sophomores with 2 years of eligibility left and 22% were freshmen with 3 years of eligibility left. These results suggest the rookie pay scale achieved its intended purpose of distributing more salary to veterans but it also changed the composition of the draft to include a greater percentage of risky players who were younger and more inexperienced but had upside potential.</p>
<p>From the player’s perspective, it may not always be in the player’s best interest to declare early for the draft. While NBA teams use the rookie scale as protection against investment losses in drafting unproven players, players are not afforded the same protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). Players are only guaranteed 2 years and if the player does not prove himself, the team can cut the player with minimal financial damage to the team but potentially substantial financial damage to the player in the form of career earnings potential. In addition, declaring too early and being drafted lower in the first round can have salary implications for a player. Analyzing the 2010 rookie pay scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406128">Rishe (2010)</xref> discovered the median salary of the top 10 players in the draft over the next 4 years will be 79% greater than for picks 11–20 and 161% greater than picks 21–30. In addition, dropping one spot in the draft amongst the top 10 picks will cost players an average of $1.24 million per season while dropping one pick in the 11–20 range will only cost an average of $311,000 per season and $116,500 for dropping one position in the 21–30 range. However, the last player in the first round of the draft (pick 30) will earn roughly five times less salary than the first pick in the draft over the next 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002511406128">Rishe, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For players, making a rational decision regarding early entry into the draft requires identifying and appropriately weighing the alternatives based on the information available. Most players take advantage of the opportunity to test the waters for their draft position in order to gather relevant information but many withdraw prior to the draft deadline. From 2006 to 2010, 476 players declared as early entry candidates and 226 or 48% withdrew their names prior to the withdrawal deadline. The majority of the players who withdrew their names were either juniors (74%) or sophomores (20%) suggesting they were testing the waters to get a feel for their draft potential and picking up information from NBA scouts on their weaknesses as players. However, for most of these players, that additional information did not help. In subsequent drafts, only 8% of the players who had withdrawn their early entry application were picked in the first round with most not getting drafted at all (80%). The numbers are especially discouraging for players who declared after their freshman year. From 2006 to 2010, of the 16 players who have tested the waters with 3 years of eligibility left, only one, Rodrigue Beaubois was drafted in the first round in a subsequent draft. The encouraging news is that for the 8% drafted in the first round of a subsequent draft, 94% of these players improved their draft position by delaying entry into the draft. Unfortunately, some players make seemingly irrational decisions and leave their names in the draft despite signals that their draft stock is not rated highly. From 2006 to 2010, 137 of the 250 early entry players or 55% were not drafted in the first round and in fact 96 (38%) went undrafted entirely.</p>
<p>The challenge for players in deciding whether to stay in the draft is to calculate the optimal choice from the information available. While the factors that influence the decision will be different for different players (e.g., ability, educational aptitude, and economic situation), a theoretical boundary position may exist which can help players make a rational decision. Top agents like David Falk, who was Michael Jordan’s agent throughout his career, advise players to return to school unless they are projected as a top 10 pick or have dire financial needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511406128">Garcia, 2010</xref>). Thus there may be a theoretical boundary position like top 10 that can be tested using option theory. Option pricing theory analysis can also be used to determine if the boundary position is the same for each class of early entry players (i.e., freshmen, sophomores, and juniors), which will be helpful for potential early entry draft players and could be used to advise players to stay in school.</p>

<sec id="section4-1527002511406128">
<title>American Style Put: The Draftee’s Perspective</title>
<p>While earlier studies provide various theories to describe the team’s choice in hiring, the perspective of the player is not well represented. This study focuses on the rationality of the player’s decision to enter the draft early. The choice to enter the NBA draft early is similar to the decision to exercise a put option before maturity. In the case of a put option on a stock, the owner of the option has the right to sell the stock (the asset) at a predetermined price at or before the maturity date. As the stock falls in price the put gains value. With respect to the athlete, the asset he owns is his collegiate eligibility (and the associated knowledge, skills, and experiences that come with it). If this remaining collegiate time has little value (will not help improve his draft position in the NBA), it may be worth forgoing it and entering the draft early. This study examines the player’s perspective using this framework.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511406128">1</xref></sup> In the next section we review the factors that affect the early exercise decision of an American style put and discuss the NBA draft as an American put. Following that we discuss the data and use of the binomial model for American put option pricing to study the rationality of the early exercise decision; we analyze the draft and estimate the early exercise boundary (draft level for which early exercise is rational). Finally, we conclude with some policy implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527002511406128">
<title>Conditions for Early Exercise of American Put</title>
<p>From the owner’s perspective, an option is a right, not obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) some asset at a predetermined price (strike or exercise) on or before a predetermined date (maturity date). The purchase or sale of the asset through the option is known as exercise. If that exercise takes place only on the maturity date, the option is considered European style. If the option can be exercised on or before the maturity date it is considered American style. At maturity the owner of the option would rationally choose to exercise if the option is “in-the-money.” Call (put) options are in-the-money if the underlying asset price is above (is below) the strike price.</p>
<p>It may be rational to exercise an American style option early. The decision to exercise early is influenced by several factors, including (a) how deep in-the-money the option is, (b) how much time to maturity remains, (c) how volatile the underlying asset is, (d) the interest rate, and (e) whether the asset pays a cash flow during the life of the option. In the case of call options the fifth condition is necessary for early exercise but is not so for put options.</p>
<p>If an American style put option is sufficiently deep in-the-money (the asset has lost sufficient value) it should be exercised before maturity. We will refer to the point at which the put is sufficiently deep in-the-money as the early exercise boundary, which is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527002511406128">Figure 2</xref>

</fig>
<p>For stock prices below B, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527002511406128">Figure 2</xref>, it is optimal to exercise the put early. For stock prices above B, the put option has more value alive than exercised. This boundary B will move up and to the left with increasing asset volatility, increasing option maturity, and with decreasing interest rates.</p></sec>
<sec id="section6-1527002511406128">
<title>Entering the Draft—American Put Model</title>
<p>From the player’s perspective, entering the draft is equivalent to exercising the option to sell their labor to the NBA. A choice to enter the draft before finishing college is an example of early exercise. With put options, early exercise will only occur when the underlying asset is sufficiently deep in-the-money, which is influenced by the factors discussed above. From the perspective of the athlete, the asset he owns is his collegiate eligibility. The collegiate eligibility is a chance for the athlete to improve his basketball skills and knowledge through training and game experience. If this remaining time in college holds little value for the athlete in terms of improving his position in the draft, then it may be worth forgoing his remaining eligibility and entering the NBA draft early. The difficulty facing the draftee is knowing whether they are sufficiently deep in-the-money (determining the value of the remaining eligibility).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002511406128">2</xref></sup> 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1527002511406128">Figure 3</xref>
illustrates the draft as a put option. As the first 30 positions are guaranteed a salary, they are all in-the-money. However, for players with time remaining in college it would be rational to exercise, and enter the draft, only if they will be one of the draft positions to the left of the rational early draft boundary (<italic>n</italic>) indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1527002511406128">Figure 3</xref>. At these draft positions the option to remain in school has no value. Above the boundary the value to remain in school is positive.</p>

<p>Until the draft actually takes place the draftee will not know his position; however, before the draft he has information that allows him to make an educated guess as to his draft position. Some of this information is private and comes through discussions with teams through the player’s agent; other information is public, such as mock draft information done by draft analysts. As the salary schedule for the first 30 draft positions is fixed and known, the indications of a likely draft position have meaningful value for the player. The best (highest) draft position, number 1, is equivalent to being as deep in-the-money as possible on a put option (when the asset, the remaining collegiate eligibility has no value).</p>

<title>Early Draft Boundary Estimate</title>
<p>Using option theory to calculate an early draft boundary estimate is beneficial for players. The draft boundary position is calculated based on publicly available information and players have additional private information they can use to strengthen their decision-making process. For example, if our results indicate the boundary position for a freshman to make a rational decision to stay in the draft and not leave substantial contract value on the table is pick 13 and a player is told by the team picking at pick 10 that they are interested then it makes sense to stay in the draft.</p></sec></sec>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The goal of this article is to examine the early entry draft decisions from a player’s perspective. While the 1995 CBA instituted the rookie salary scale, the 2005 CBA mandated a minimum age limit of 19 or 1 year removed from high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511406128">NBA Players Association, 2005</xref>). To best focus on the decision-making process of the players under the same conditions, we gathered data from drafts conducted under the 2005 CBA, which include the years 2006-2010. The variables of interest in this study are the actual draft position of the players, the salary slotted for the player’s draft position and the pre-early entry deadline information available to the players. The data for the actual draft positions of players are from nba.com, a website run by the NBA. The rookie salary scale data were accumulated from the most recent CBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527002511406128">NBA Players Association, 2005</xref>). As for the pre-early entry deadline information, it is not possible to gather all of the information available to the players because most of it would be kept confidential between the NBA teams and the individual players. We can, however, gather some publicly available information from the mock drafts composed by draft analysts using inside information obtained from NBA scouts and teams. Because the sources of information for each draft analyst can vary, the positions of players may vary slightly on different mock drafts composed by each analyst. Trying to control for this variability, we collected mock draft information from multiple reputed sports information sources, <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic>, <italic>Sporting News</italic>, and ESPN. As more information becomes available, draft analysts produce new mock drafts and we gathered multiple mock drafts from each source as available to control for the change in information. The draft data are used to value the remaining collegiate eligibility (the asset values that are analogously equivalent to stock prices) for each draft rank. Also, the salary schedule and mock draft information is used to construct strike prices and estimate asset volatility. The student’s class standing is used to calculate maturity. In addition to the draft data, U.S. Treasury data are collected to be used as the interest rate input into the option pricing model. These elements are used in the calculation of the player’s option value.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 there were 93, 84, 92, 104, and 103 players declaring early for the draft, respectively. Of those, slightly more than half each year withdrew from the draft, leaving 46, 38, 44, 48, and 74 players participating in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. If participating in the draft is similar to exercising an American style put then we should see a higher proportion of underclassmen in the early draft positions (1 to <italic>n</italic>) relative to those in the later draft positions (<italic>n</italic> to 30). If not we should see roughly equal percentages of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors at all draft positions. As a starting point we examine the class composition, on average, for the first 15 draft positions, the second 15 draft positions, and the second round (where there is no guaranteed salary, only a chance at making the team). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511406128">Table 1</xref>

<italic>Note:</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511406128">Table 1</xref> shows the class composition on average for the draft positions in the first and second rounds. Data were compiled from official NBA website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.nba.com">www.nba.com</ext-link>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>This table only examines those that participated in the draft, but it is consistent with what would be expected if draftees act as if they are exercising a put option. The proportion of underclassmen is much higher in the first 15 draft positions than in the next 15 or in the second round. Draft position 15 is an arbitrary cut-off and may or may not correspond to the actual early exercise boundary (which will be largely affected by volatility and maturity) but was chosen for convenience.</p>
<p>We employ the binomial model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511406128">Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979)</xref> to estimate the option value by draft position. The inputs to their model are (a) the stock price, (b) the strike price, (c) the risk-free rate, (d) the time to maturity, and (e) the volatility of the underlying asset’s returns. For the draftee, the corresponding inputs will be (a) the draft position equivalent stock price (the value of the remaining collegiate eligibility), as discussed below (b) the salary for the first draft position, as discussed below (c) the risk-free rate, (d) the time remaining to graduation, and (e) the volatility of the draft equivalent stock price.</p>
<p>The asset value and strike price are based on the draft position and the given 4-year salary schedule (at 120% of the listed contract value for the draft position). We use the 120% level of the draft salary as, previously noted, 98% of all draft picks received 120% of the scheduled salary. The NBA CBA has established a salary increase from Year 1 to Year 2 of 7.5%, and from Year 2 to Year 3 of 7% for all draft ranks, for rookie contacts signed between 2006 and 2010. From Year 3 to Year 4, the salary increase varies by draft position. Those drafted number one overall receive an increase of 26.1% but the salary increase rises to a value of 80.5% for draft position 30 (again for 2006-2010 contracts). We discount the salaries for Years 2–4 by the maturity matched Treasury yield (which we describe later in this section) to calculate the present value of the 4-year contract by draft position. To create the asset value for a particular draft position, we use the logic that the best (highest) draft position, Position 1, is equivalent to being as deep in-the-money as possible; that is draft Position 1 is equivalent to the asset, the remaining collegiate eligibility, having a value (analogous stock price) of zero. If exercised, a put option on a stock priced at zero returns the strike value. Therefore, the strike is equivalent to the present value of the 4-year salary on draft Position 1 for a given year. Using this strike price, we then construct equivalent stock prices for the remaining draft Positions 2–30 for each of the year’s drafts 2006-2010. In short, the equivalent stock prices are calculated simply by subtracting the 4-year salary level for each lower pick from the salary for the first pick in the draft. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511406128">Table 2</xref>

<p>In the option pricing framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002511406128">Cox et al. (1979)</xref> the volatility input is the annual standard deviation of returns for the underlying stock. Commonly the volatility for a stock option is calculated one of two ways, either as (a) the annualized standard deviation of historical stock price returns or (b) the implied volatility from other traded options, using an option pricing model (volatility is set so that the model value equals the traded option’s price). In either case data are usually plentiful. In the case of the NBA draft we have a relatively small amount of data on the value of each draftee’s remaining collegiate eligibility (the analogous stock price). In order to get some sense of volatility we use the mock draft and actual draft positions, and the constructed equivalent stock prices to create a short series of returns for each player. The return is calculated as the percentage change from two successive mock drafts (the final return is calculated from the last mock draft to the actual draft). The first mock draft date usually has more than one mock draft estimate. In that case we use the nearest integer to the average mock draft position as the first estimate. The standard deviation of the return series is then calculated. In practice we would like to have a volatility number for each athlete, but due to relatively few mock draft values this is not possible; therefore we average these estimates across players in the first round. As such the volatility number represents the average volatility of the value of the remaining collegiate eligibility for the players drafted in the first round. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511406128">Table 4</xref>

The volatility estimates range from 16% to 31% depending on the year and the number of players in each sample. For example, in 2006, of the 30 draft choices in round 1, only 10 were included in all 9 of the mock drafts, and they had an average standard deviation of returns of 30.90%. In 2008, 23 players were included in at least 5 drafts and they had an average standard deviation of returns of 16.91%. The overall weighted average standard deviation (across all 5 years) when using those players in all the mock drafts is 22.4% (not presented in the table). When using those players in at least half the mock drafts, the overall 5-year weighted average standard deviation is 19.3%. We understand that these estimates are much less precise than those used in standard stock option pricing (and represents an average across the players), but they do give us a sense of the underlying volatility of the draft.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the option framework provides a way of viewing the draft from the player’s perspective, the underlying pricing theory used to derive the pricing models is based on an assumption that the option’s value can be “replicated” using the primary securities. In the case of stock options, the option is replicated using combinations of the underlying stocks and risk-free bonds. The validity of the model relies on this assumption and the ability to trade in all three securities. In the case of a player, the ability to “replicate” the option, let alone trade it, is not as clear. Private insurance markets do exist however for valuable athletes and could in theory be a basis for replicating portfolios, though the data for such contracts are not easy to obtain.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The key question we are interested in examining is whether it is rational to exercise early from the perspective of the draftee. Obviously if the player is certain to be drafted number one overall, he should not wait, as there can be no improvement in his draft position. In theory any other draft position requires an evaluation of potential improvement in future drafts (assuming remaining eligibility). Past results indicate players can improve their positions in the draft by delaying their entry for a year. Approximately 94% of the players who withdrew their early entry request from one draft and were subsequently drafted in the first round of a later draft improved on their draft positions based on mock draft information increasing their salaries over the 4-year rookie contract term. In the option pricing framework, this opportunity to improve the salary received is reflected in the “live value” of the option. The live value, or value above and beyond the exercise value, quantifies the value to waiting. This is also known as time value. The “live” or “time” value of the option reflects the chance of improvement in the underlying price to the benefit of the option holder. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511406128">Tables 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1527002511406128">10</xref> present the live value for juniors, sophomores, and freshmen for the first 30 draft positions in each year. The live value is calculated as the put option value, using the inputs described above, minus the intrinsic value (the value of the strike price less the equivalent stock price). The intrinsic value is equal to the exercise value when the option is in the money (the asset price is less than the strike price). When the put value equals the intrinsic value the live value will be zero; it would be rational to exercise as there is no remaining value to waiting for a later draft. If the live value is positive it suggests that there is value to waiting; the draftee should not exercise. Where the live value is positive, we also include the live value as a percentage of the 120% contract value, in parentheses next to the live value. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511406128">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1527002511406128">6</xref> present the live values for juniors at two different volatility input levels, 20% and 30% (chosen based on the estimates presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511406128">Table 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1527002511406128">Tables 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1527002511406128">8</xref> present the live values for sophomores, again using 20% and 30% as the volatility inputs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511406128">Table 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1527002511406128">10</xref> present the live values for freshman.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>At 20% volatility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511406128">Table 5</xref>), the early exercise boundary ranges from the 16th draft position in 2010 to the 30th draft position in 2006 and 2007. Given that juniors have 1 year of remaining eligibility (1 year maturity), the effect of the interest rate is not insubstantial on the live value. Maturity matched Treasury rates in 2006 and 2007 were close to 5%, but with the recession of 2008 and 2009 dropped considerably. The monthly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury rate from 1995 to 2005 was 4.14%. However, even in years 2008, 2009, and 2010 for which there are live values above zero, the live value is not a substantial amount compared with the contract value. All of the live values are less than 5% of the contract values.</p>
<p>At a volatility of 30% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1527002511406128">Table 6</xref>), the early exercise boundary drops to between Draft Positions 8 and 18. The higher volatility input, not unexpectedly, has a significant impact on the early exercise boundary. At this higher volatility, there is a substantial number of lower draft positions where the live value is a considerable portion of the contract value, especially in 2008, 2009, and 2010 where the interest rate input is low.</p>
<p>For sophomores, the additional maturity (2 years of remaining college eligibility) reduces the boundary (the draft position where it is rational to exercise early) relative to that of juniors. At the 20% volatility level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1527002511406128">Table 7</xref>), the early exercise boundary is between draft position 14 (2009) and draft position 30 (2006 and 2007). At lower interest rates (2008, 2009, and 2010), early exercise that results in low draft placement can result in the player leaving value on the table. In 2009, for example, Draft Positions 25–30 have live values greater than 5% of contract value.</p>
<p>At a volatility of 30% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1527002511406128">Table 8</xref>), the early exercise boundary drops to between Draft Positions 7 and 15. These results are similar to those of juniors at 30% volatility, even given the additional year of maturity over that of juniors. However, in those cases where there is live value the amounts are much larger as a percent of contract value than in the case of juniors at this volatility level.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1527002511406128">Table 9</xref> presents the live values for freshmen at an input volatility of 20%. The early exercise boundary is highest in 2009 at Draft Position 14 and lowest in 2006 at Draft Position 28. We note that for 2007 and 2008, the live value as a percent of contract value is generally less than 5%. The monthly average 3-year constant maturity Treasury rate from 1995 to 2005 was 4.65%. Even greater than the effect with sophomores, when interest rates are relatively low compared to their recent history, there is a substantial number of lower draft positions for which the live value is a significant portion of contract value.</p>
<p>At a volatility of 30% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1527002511406128">Table 10</xref>), the early exercise boundary for freshmen drops to between Draft Positions 7 and 14. Interestingly, at very low interest rates (2009 and 2010) the highest boundary, Draft Position 7, is the same as that of sophomores. While any draft position below the boundary would technically be irrational to exercise, when examining the live value as a percent of contract value positions beyond roughly 20 are giving up substantial amounts of value if exercised early.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511406128">Table 1</xref> we document the class composition of Draft Positions 1–15, 16–30, and the second round. This table is consistent with what would be expected if draftees act as if they are exercising a put option, however it is not a test of rationality on a case by case basis. Of course players have additional information and motivations that we are not privy to. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1527002511406128">Tables 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1527002511406128">12</xref>

, we test the model against the actual drafts for the players selected in the first round using the mock draft information. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1527002511406128">Table 11</xref>, we use the average early exercise boundary estimates, by class rank, based on 20% volatility, and examine the number of players that receive mock draft information that would be consistent with rational exercise. We look at the player’s best mock draft signal (and his average mock draft signal) and compare these to the average early exercise boundary. The table presents the number of players in the top 30 by class along with the percentage that had a best mock draft (average mock draft) signal better than the average early exercise boundary. At 20% volatility, the majority of players (at least 77% for the entire set of underclassmen) received at least one mock draft signal consistent with early exercise.</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1527002511406128">Table 12</xref> presents the same test for the 30% volatility level. Even with this very high volatility level (recall <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511406128">Table 4</xref> had only one estimate near this level), more than half of the overall set of underclassmen seem to be making rational choices.</p>
<p>Also, it should be noted that the early exercise boundary is where there is no “live” value. In many cases the draft positions just past the early exercise boundary had only slight live values. As the overall weighted average standard deviation of returns is closer to 20%, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1527002511406128">Table 11</xref> suggest that most players are making reasonable choices. However, there are still some players that seem to be entering the draft in the face of information that would suggest they do otherwise.</p>
<p>We also can test the model against the decisions made by early entry players who were not drafted in the first round. These players either appeared in at least one mock draft (33) or did not appear in any mock drafts in our data set (84). Using the average early boundary positions by class found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1527002511406128">Table 11</xref> for 20% volatility and the best mock draft position for each player, the model predicts 101 of the 117 players should have withdrawn from the draft. Four players did withdraw but the other 97 players made costly decisions to stay in the draft and either went undrafted (84) or were drafted in the second round (13) supporting the results of our model. For 30% volatility, the average early boundary positions by class from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1527002511406128">Table 12</xref> indicates 114 of the 117 players should have withdrawn and with only 9 withdrawing, the model correctly predicted the live value of the option to stay in school for the other 105 players.</p>
<p>While previous studies have documented the value of drafting an underclassman from the team’s perspective, it is clear that players may also be benefiting and making rational choices, even though the goal of the NBA contract was to keep more of the overall team salary in the hands of existing seasoned players.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1527002511406128">
<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>While it appears the rookie salary scale achieved its goal of controlling financial risk for NBA teams, it has also forced them to take chances on unproven players who are not ready for the NBA game. In addition, the rookie salary scale created an incentive for NBA players to enter the draft early and learn on the job in order to maximize their career earnings potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). While there is incentive, the players do hold the option to declare for the draft early and this option has value that can be estimated because the rookie pay scale is set. Using option pricing theory, we have shown it is not always in the player’s best interest to declare early. With lower volatility estimates, the results suggest it is rational for players that have signals suggesting a spot in the top 20 to exercise early. Even at low interest rates, with a volatility estimate of 20% it is likely rational for all juniors to enter the draft if they have any signal that they will make the first round, as even in those cases where there is “live” value it is a very small percentage of the contract value.</p>
<p>The results suggest the incentive for players to leave early is not aligned with the incentives for NBA teams making the selection. Players want to learn on the job in order to maximize career earnings but NBA teams, especially those picking in the early part of the first round, need help immediately and may not be able to afford picking a player who cannot contribute. NBA teams may be forced to draft based on a player’s career potential instead of current playing ability. Policy changes to the draft may be needed to counteract the added incentive the rookie salary scale provides players to leave early. One potential change is to raise the age limit for players to declare for the draft to 20 or 2 years out of high school. The extra year of college will give the players more experience and teams more information to reduce draft position volatility. In addition, option theory suggests not much difference between the early draft boundary positions for a sophomore (pick 15) compared to a freshman (pick 14) at a lower volatility rate.</p>
<p>A better alternative for a change in the draft may be to adopt the draft eligibility rules used by MLB in which high school players can be chosen in the draft but must choose between entering college and playing professionally. If a player chooses college, he must commit to a college for a minimum of 3 years. In an analysis of the career earnings potential of drafted high school baseball players, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527002511406128">Winfree and Molitor (2007)</xref> found those players drafted in higher rounds should enter professional baseball immediately while those drafted in the lower rounds have higher expected earnings if they attend college. Option theory results predict similar consequences for drafted high school basketball players. Those high school players who are ready to play in the NBA and who would be drafted within the rational early exercise boundary as defined by option theory (i.e., top 14) should start their NBA career and maximize their career earnings potential. For the other players who fall below the early boundary threshold, there is value in taking the option to attend college, which allows them to gain valuable experience playing at the collegiate level without providing an incentive to leave early. The additional 3 years of playing experience will allow NBA teams to better evaluate players and should lower the volatility of the mock draft rankings for players. With this lower volatility, players will have the option to declare after their junior year and option theory suggests it will almost always be rational for players to enter the draft if they feel they are ready. For NBA teams, this takes away the need to pay players to learn on the job and brings the new entrants into the NBA closer in skill to the other labor option for the team, free agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The NBA rookie salary scale was instituted in 1995 to control investment risk for NBA teams and shift the distribution of salary away from unproven rookies to seasoned veteran players. While the rookie salary scale achieved both of these objectives, it has also provided players with an added incentive to declare for the draft early to maximize their post rookie contract amounts. This added incentive has led to unraveling in the labor market as teams select riskier workers with potential instead of established college players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002511406128">Groothuis et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the added incentive, it is not always clear that players are making rational decisions by entering the labor market early. Players hold an option of when to enter the labor market and option theory suggests they should only declare early if they are deep in the money. Using an option theory framework, we are able to calculate theoretical draft boundary positions to better inform players of the consequences of selling their labor early.</p>
<p>Our analysis supports the advice of some top agents that is to enter the draft only if the projected draft position is within the top 10 picks. Our results show that the decision to enter the draft early is almost always rational for juniors. These players are experienced and NBA teams have a good idea of their skills so there is not much to be gained by staying in school for their senior year if they are projected to be drafted in the first round. If, however, there is higher volatility in the draft positions of players, which can happen when the players are not able to distinguish themselves from others, the boundary pick drops. In this case, it might be in the best interest of a junior projected to be drafted near the end of the first round (picks 25–30) to stay in school for another year as the value of his option is a considerable portion of the contract value (approximately 12%). For sophomores, the early exercise boundary position is slightly lower than juniors as these players have two additional years to prove themselves at the collegiate level. These additional years however do not translate into value unless the sophomore is projected to be a low first round draft pick in which case he is leaving substantial value on the table by declaring for the draft early. In drafts with higher volatility, the boundary pick for sophomores drops significantly and they leave a much larger percentage of the contract value on the table than do juniors suggesting they need another year of experience to differentiate themselves from the competition. For freshmen, the information set is the most incomplete leading to the lowest rational exercise boundary. The difference for freshmen is in the later projected picks (20–30) as they leave a substantial amount of money on the table (up to 31% of the contract value) by declaring early for the draft.</p>
<p>So what does option theory predict for our two players, Kyle Singler and Gordon Hayward, who were making the decision whether to enter the draft following the 2010 NCAA championship game? For Singler, who was a junior and predicted by mock drafts to be chosen in the late first round or the second round, option theory indicates there is value in his option to return to school. However, for the sophomore Hayward who was projected to be picked in the 10–15 range by most mock drafts, there is no option value in returning to school and waiting for another draft. Both players seemed to reach the same conclusions as the option model as Singler decided to withdraw from the draft and return to Duke but Hayward declared as an early entry candidate and was selected with the ninth pick in the draft by the Utah Jazz.</p>
<p>Our findings also have implications for NBA draft policy. To better align the incentives of draftees to NBA teams in the labor market, changes restricting the ability of players to enter the draft may be needed. Our findings suggest restricting the ability of players to enter until the age of 20 or 2 years out of school is one viable option. The other more attractive option our findings support is to adopt the MLB draft structure in which players either declare for the draft straight out of high school or only after their junior year in college. Option theory predicts players who leave school after their junior year are not leaving any significant money on table by declaring for the draft.</p>

<p>The concept of optimal time to harvest a natural resource may provide an alternative framework to analyze the draft from the player’s perspective. The question is often posed as how much of a resource should be harvested during the present time period and how much should be left for future time periods? The question of when and how much to harvest is often viewed as balancing current and future costs and benefits using methods of dynamic optimization where some measure of value is maximized, see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002511406128">Brown (2000)</xref>. In the case of the athlete, the idea of maximizing the present value of future income could be examined in such a framework, where the choice to harvest is equivalent to the choice to enter the draft although the athlete does not have the option to harvest only part of his resources (i.e., his option to enter the NBA draft). We leave it to other researchers to examine this alternative.</p>
