<p>This is the first issue of the <italic>British Journal of Pain (BJP)</italic> that publishes a greater proportion of original studies. Mick Serpell and I had intended to produce a ‘Nature and Nurture’ issue, but as we had a number of studies ready for print we decided to delay this themed issue. <italic>BJP</italic>’s call for papers has generated a great deal of interest from potential authors, but as an editor you can never have enough papers from all the members of the multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome our new members of the editorial board. The appointment of Roger Knaggs as Deputy Editor has been a great support to me. Roger was a contributing author to the recently published <italic>Guidance on the Management of Pain in Older People</italic> document that was a joint publication of the British Geriatric Society and the British Pain Society (BPS), with publication supported by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. In this issue of <italic>BJP</italic> we publish a summary of this guidance document. A working party is currently reviewing the literature on pain assessment in older people and the final document will include evidence for the use of tools in patients with cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Our publisher, SAGE, produces an annual report that not only details the potential publications we have received (and proportions that we subsequently publish), but also provides information about the geographical location of visitors to the website. It is pleasantly surprising to see that we have a large number of visitors from North America and Australasia.</p>
<p>One problem that I face repeatedly is a lack of reviewers for potential publications. Although authors are asked to identify potential reviewers when uploading their submissions, only a small proportion of those contacted actually agree to undertake a blinded review. This is particularly a problem for papers from psychologists, so if there are any budding reviewers out there I would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Papers accepted for publication in <italic>BJP</italic> that have been copy-edited and approved by the editorial team are published on the website under the tab OnlineFirst before being published in print. <italic>BJP</italic> content will remain accessible online through the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bjp.sagepub.com">bjp.sagepub.com</ext-link> portal to non-BPS members for the immediate future.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the evolution of <italic>BJP</italic> from its original format as <italic>Reviews in Pain</italic>. We intend to strengthen the content by not only continuing to publish original papers and reviews, but also commissioning systematic reviews on topics of interest to the diverse BPS membership. If you have undertaken any projects or studies that you think might be suitable for publication please get in touch.</p>
