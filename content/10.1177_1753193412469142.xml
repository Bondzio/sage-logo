<abstract>
<p>A total of 120 patients were examined for the presence of symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome after surgical treatment of a distal radial fracture. The patients were assessed at six weeks and 71 of them were also assessed at 12 weeks. The International Association for the Study of Pain criteria and the complex regional pain syndrome severity score were used to make the diagnosis. At six weeks, ten patients (8.3%) met the criteria of complex regional pain syndrome in both the International Association for the Study of Pain and complex regional pain syndrome scores. At 12 weeks six patients (8.4%) met International Association for the Study of Pain and two (2.8%) patients the complex regional pain syndrome severity score criteria. Only one of the patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome required treatment for the complex regional pain syndrome. In all the other patients the features of complex regional pain syndrome settled spontaneously. Our results suggest that complex regional pain syndrome after distal radius fractures occurs less frequently than was previously reported. The International Association for the Study of Pain criteria and the complex regional pain syndrome severity scores showed similar sensitivity in early diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome, but both are poor indicators of the need for treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a descriptive term for a complex of symptoms and signs that includes spontaneous pain, swelling, tenderness and regional vasomotor instability. It is often accompanied by significant functional impairment of the hand or the entire limb. CRPS may develop after a variety of incidents, but occurs most frequently after injury or surgery. The severity of pain and disability in CRPS exceeds the expected clinical course of the inciting event in both magnitude and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469142">Merskey and Bogduk, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469142">Veldman et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Diagnosing CRPS may be difficult for several reasons: (a) there is great variability in the presence and severity of specific symptoms and signs; (b) the syndrome comprises a broad spectrum of clinical forms, i.e. acute, chronic, causalgia, shoulder–hand syndrome and sympathetically mediated pain. These forms differ with respect to the symptomatology, treatment modalities and prognosis; and (c) the acute and chronic forms are very different. Acute CRPS is characterized by pain at rest, swelling, redness, increased temperature of the hand and reduction of movement because of the pain. Chronic CRPS is characterized by pain, tenderness, hyperpathia/allodynia, pallor, reduced temperature, hyperhydrosis and digital stiffness. Even these patterns are inconsistent.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of CRPS is based on clinical grounds and the presence of a specified constellation of symptoms and signs is required to make the decision. The presence of pain is considered obligatory to the diagnosis. No specific test is known to confirm or exclude CRPS diagnosis and imaging such as radiography, bone scintigraphy, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have limited influence on decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469142">Field, submitted</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469142">Marshall and Crisp, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193412469142">Żyluk 2001</xref>). To date, no formal standardized diagnostic criteria for CRPS have been widely accepted. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria of diagnosis, both the original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469142">Merskey and Bogduk, 1994</xref>) and the modified forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469142">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 2007</xref>) have recently attracted increased popularity and are frequently used in scientific studies. In the authors’ department, a CRPS severity score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469142">Table 2</xref>) was introduced and was found useful both in practice and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469142">Zyluk 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469142">Żyluk and Puchalski, 2008</xref>). This set of criteria was a modification of a scale proposed earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412469142">Gibbons and Wilson (1992)</xref>.</p>

<p>Early diagnosis of CRPS and initiation of treatment appears beneficial, because early CRPS is relatively easy to treat, its prognosis is good and full recovery can be expected within a reasonable time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412469142">Field and Atkins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412469142">Goris, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412469142">Koh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469142">Żyluk and Puchalski, 2008</xref>). In contrast chronic CRPS is – in most cases – a disabling condition with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469142">Marshall and Crisp, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469142">Veldman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469142">Zyluk and Puchalski, In press</xref>).</p>
<p>Among patients with CRPS there is a milder self-limiting form that does not require specific treatment. This is particularly frequent in patients after fractures of the distal radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469142">Bickerstaff and Kanis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469142">Dijkstra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469142">Field, submitted</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 1998</xref>). This group of patients causes confusion and controversy particularly in research studies. Inclusion of these patients potentially overestimates the incidence of CRPS and makes it difficult to assess the true efficacy of various treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469142">Bickerstaff and Kanis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412469142">Marshall and Crisp, 2000</xref>). To date, no diagnostic criteria allow an appropriate, scientifically justified classification of this ‘borderline’ group of patients.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study were to: evaluate the incidence of early CRPS in patients after operative treatment of a fracture of the distal radius; and compare the accuracy (reliability) of the IASP criteria and the CRPS severity score in early detection of CRPS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412469142" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted between May 2008 and December 2010 in the senior author’s unit. We chose an injury with a high incidence of CRPS (fracture of the distal radius). We assessed 120 patients with displaced fractures of the distal radius who were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with K-wires performed under brachial plexus block anaesthesia. All patients were operated on within three days of injury; the vast majority on the day of the accident.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193412469142">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Patients were assessed twice for the symptoms and signs of CRPS: at a mean of 6 weeks (range 5–7); and 12 weeks (range 11–14) after the operation. A total of 120 patients participated in the first assessment and 71 patients participated in the 12-week assessment. A total of 49 patients (41%) did not attend the second follow-up. At least one attempt was made to contact these patients by telephone but with no response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193412469142">
<title>Assessments</title>
<p>We used two sets of diagnostic criteria to assess for symptoms and signs of CRPS: the modified IASP criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469142">Table 1</xref>); and the CRPS severity score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469142">Table 2</xref>). The modified IASP criteria consist of three domains characterizing (1) pain, (2) subjective symptoms reported by the patient, and (3) objective signs assessed by the examiner. Moreover there should be no other diagnosis that could explain these symptoms and signs any better. To facilitate comparison of scores and statistical analysis, the descriptive IASP criteria were converted into numerical scores, which assigned one point for each positive criterion in all three domains. Thus, a minimum total score of seven fulfilled the requirements of modified IASP criteria for the diagnosis of CRPS (one point in domain 1, four in domain 2 and two in domain 3). As IASP criteria require the presence of continuing pain (domain 1), disproportionate to any inciting event, we assigned a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score of greater than or equal to five as meeting this criterion.</p>
<p>In the CRPS severity score, one point is assigned for a strong expression of most of the features listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193412469142">Table 2</xref>, half a point for moderate expression and no point if the feature is absent. Severe pain at rest and reduction of finger flexion greater than 6 cm is assigned two points and nail/hair growth changes and shoulder pain are assigned only half a point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 2003</xref>). Patients with a total score of four or more were considered to have CRPS. The maximum total score of ten indicates the worst degree of the condition. Unlike in the IASP criteria, the presence of severe pain at rest is not a prerequisite condition of the diagnosis, therefore the pain score is only an element of a total score.</p>
<p>All patients who met the CRPS criteria of diagnosis at six and 12 weeks were interviewed by phone at a mean of 16 months (range 5–29) after the first assessment and asked about the presence of any continuing features of CRPS, hand function and whether they had received any treatment for CRPS. Fourteen of the 15 patients diagnosed with CRPS at six weeks, and all six patients meeting the diagnosis criteria at 12 weeks, were available for telephone interview.</p>
<p>We also assessed hand function using the patient evaluation measure (PEM) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412469142">Macey and Burke, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412469142">Forward et al., 2007</xref>), pain with a VAS (0–10) and grip strength with a Jamar dynamometer expressed as a percentage of the affected/unaffected side.</p>
<p>All calculations and decision making about the CRPS diagnosis were performed after completion of the study based on analysis of the collected records. Therefore, the results had no influence on the potential treatment of any patients.</p>
<p>All the examinations were performed by the second author (therapist), who was not involved in the treatment of the fractures and in the eventual treatment of the CRPS. Statistical analysis included comparison of variables (age, pain, grip strength and PEM score) in the CRPS and non-CRPS groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant).</p>
<p>The approval of the Bioethical Council of the local Medical University was obtained in order to conduct this survey and informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrolment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412469142" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the original 120 patients there were 96 women (80%) and 24 men (20%) with a mean age of 57 years (range 20–86). Seventy-three (61%) of the fractures were on the left. In the 71 patients available for review at 12 weeks there were 58 women (82%) and 13 men (18%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 20–83), with 49 (69%) of the fractures on the left. In the 49 patients who did not return for review there were 40 women and nine men with a mean age of 56 (range 28–86) years, with 24 (49%) of the fracture on the left.</p>
<p>At the six-week assessment, 15 of the 120 patients met the IASP or CRPS severity score diagnosis criteria: ten patients met the IASP criteria; ten met the CRPS severity score criteria; and five patients met both sets of criteria. As the diagnosis is made based on one set of criteria, the number of patients diagnosed as having CRPS at six weeks was 10 (8.3%) for either scale. The mean IASP score was 7.5 (range 7–9) and the mean CRPS severity score was 4.5 (range 4–7).</p>
<p>At the 12-week assessment 14 of the 15 patients diagnosed with CRPS on the above two scales at six weeks were assessed. Six (8.4%) patients continued to meet the IASP criteria and two (2.8%) the CRPS severity score criteria, who also met the criteria of both scales. Thus, the incidence of CRPS at the 12-week assessment was 6/71 (8.4%) (IASP) and 2/71 (2.8%) (CRPS severity score). Of the 15 patients who met the criteria for CRPS at six weeks, only three met the criteria at 12 weeks (two IASP criteria and one on both scales). Three other patients developed positive criteria in the period between the assessments (two IASP criteria and one on both scales). These results show that of the 7/10 patients meeting the IASP, and the 9/10 meeting the CRPS severity score diagnosis criteria at six weeks, none met the criteria at 12 weeks, i.e. most symptoms and signs of CRPS resolved spontaneously in the intervening six weeks.</p>
<p>Phone interviews were conducted at a mean of 16 months after the first (at six weeks) assessment, with 14 of the 15 patients meeting the CRPS diagnosis criteria at six weeks and with all six patients meeting the diagnosis criteria at 12 weeks. Only one of these patients (who fulfilled the IASP and CRPS severity score criteria at both assessments) had received specific treatment for CRPS after the assessment at 12 weeks. In the remaining patients most CRPS symptoms and signs resolved spontaneously. Twelve of the 14 patients diagnosed with CRPS at 12 weeks continued to report occasional mild/moderate pain (VAS 3–4) in the affected hand, mainly with lifting and weather changes. Four reported mild cold sensitivity, three had incomplete finger flexion and two suffered from numbness of some of the fingers in the affected hands.</p>
<p>Other assessments are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1753193412469142">Table 3</xref>. As would be expected, the patients meeting the CRPS criteria experienced statistically greater pain than those not meeting the criteria, at both the six- and 12-week assessments. Functional impairment as measured by the PEM questionnaire was significantly greater in CRPS patients at both assessments. Grip strength was weaker in CRPS patients, but this was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that although not requiring treatment, patients meeting the CRPS criteria of diagnosis showed significantly greater dysfunction than those without a diagnosis of CRPS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Diagnosing CRPS is associated with substantial doubt and confusion owing to the lack of commonly accepted diagnostic criteria. This results in considerable discrepancies in the reported rate of the CRPS after fractures of the distal radius (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753193412469142">Table 4</xref>). In older studies the diagnosis was based on total disability of the hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412469142">Böhler, 1956</xref>) or the presence of pain, swelling and limited motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412469142">Lidström, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412469142">Frykman, 1967</xref>). In earlier studies by British authors, the diagnostic criteria for CRPS were more clearly defined and included the presence of pain in the hand, tenderness in the fingers, swelling, vasomotor instability and finger stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412469142">Atkins et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469142">Bickerstaff and Kanis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412469142">Field, submitted</xref>). These authors reported a high incidence up to 37% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1753193412469142">Table 4</xref>). The criteria of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193412469142">Veldman et al. (1993)</xref>, which had attracted moderate popularity in the 1990s included the presence of diffuse pain, swelling, vasomotor instability and reduction of movement. These symptoms and signs should increase after use (load) of the hand and be distributed regionally in the extremity (usually distal to the site of injury). The IASP diagnostic criteria, both the original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469142">Merskey and Bogduk, 1994</xref>) and the modified criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412469142">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 2007</xref>) are used frequently in scientific studies. Although considered the most reliable and valid (mainly by anaesthetists and neurologists), they are far from ideal, mostly because of inadequate specificity and the high rate of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412469142">Galer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 1999</xref>). Systematic modification and validation of this system has resulted in improvement its diagnostic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412469142">Harden, 2010</xref>). The CRPS clinical severity scoring system developed in the authors’ institution had been used in several clinical studies, however, it is not formally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193412469142">Puchalski and Zyluk 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193412469142">Żyluk and Puchalski, 2008</xref>). This study is the first attempt to validate this system by direct comparison with the IASP criteria.</p>

<p>The results of this study show that at six weeks after surgery 15 patients met the IASP or CRPS severity score diagnosis criteria of the syndrome. However, six weeks later only three of these patients still had sufficient symptoms and signs to meet these criteria. This indicates that early diagnosis of CRPS using both scales is associated with substantial overestimation. This over diagnosis of CRPS at six weeks may be explained in part by patients’ discomfort associated with their original injury and the presence of the K-wires (the K-wires were removed routinely six to seven weeks after the operation). However, none of these patients had any particular complications such as pin-track infection or irritation of the superficial sensory branches of the radial nerve.</p>
<p>The assessment at 12 weeks showed that only six patients fulfilled the CRPS diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, the longer-term (mean 16 month) assessment of 14 of the 15 patients diagnosed as having CRPS at six weeks (including all six patients diagnosed for CRPS at 12 weeks) showed spontaneous resolution of most symptoms and signs in all but one patient. Only one patient sought medical advice because of pain and functional impairment of the hand and received treatment specific for CRPS (mannitol combined with dexamethasone). This indicates again considerable overdiagnosis of CRPS within three months of a fracture/operation. Spontaneous resolution of most symptoms and signs of CRPS in patients after fractures of the distal radius was reported in earlier studies, but was noted over 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412469142">Bickerstaff and Kanis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193412469142">Żyluk, 1998</xref>). The results of our study show that spontaneous recovery occurs much faster in milder cases.</p>
<p>‘Overdiagnosis’, i.e. high sensitivity for CRPS may be good clinically as overtreatment of CRPS is probably better than undertreatment. For research, specificity is more important than sensitivity, since it identifies the ‘true’ disease, and minimizes the risk of including non-CRPS patients in the study group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412469142">Harden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193412469142">Zyluk and Puchalski, in press</xref>). The results of our study show poor reliability of both diagnostic criteria as a discriminator of the disease requiring specific treatment.</p>
<p>In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412469142">Goris et al., (2010)</xref> compared the usefulness of Veldman’s and the IASP criteria in the early (two months) detection of CRPS in 114 patients after fracture of the distal radius treated operatively or conservatively. A total of 16 patients (14%) met the diagnostic criteria, of whom 13 (11%) met those of Veldman and 10 (9%) the IASP criteria. Re-assessment of 89 patients at one year, revealed the presence of CRPS features in four subjects (4.4%), of whom three (3.3%) met the IASP and three also met Veldman’s diagnosis criteria. None of these four patients diagnosed with CRPS at one year, had met the diagnostic criteria at two months implying that the condition developed subsequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412469142">Goris et al., 2010</xref>). The results of this study are largely consistent with our findings although we did not perform a late review on the patients who were not diagnosed with CRPS at six or 12 weeks, so we may have missed patients who developed later onset CRPS.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469142">Dijkstra et al. (2003)</xref> reported an incidence of 1% for CRPS after fractures of the distal radius treated conservatively. The condition developed in one of 88 patients, at seven weeks after fracture and this patient received specific treatment for CRPS. The authors used non-modified IASP diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412469142">Merskey and Bogduk, 1994</xref>). Phone interviews were performed one year after fracture with 71 of 88 patients and revealed no features of CRPS in any of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412469142">Dijkstra et al., 2003</xref>). Again our results are in agreement with the findings of these authors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469142">Birklein et al. (2001)</xref> analysed differences in the presence of symptoms and signs attributed to CRPS in 24 patients diagnosed as having early (lasting a mean of five weeks) CRPS and in 22 patients at one week after operative treatment of distal radius fractures. The original IASP diagnostic criteria were used. No differences were found between the groups in the intensity of pain, tenderness, swelling and vasomotor signs. Sensory and motor disturbances, hyperhydrosis as well as hair and nail changes, were more frequent in patients diagnosed with CRPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412469142">Birklein et al., 2001</xref>). The results of this study show that early CRPS and the ‘normal’ symptoms in the post-traumatic/operative period display may be very similar, but may be interpreted differently.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. There is a 41% loss of patients’ at the 12-week follow-up, which is a considerable proportion of non-responders. The concern is that these people might have developed CRPS but it is very unlikely. Our department is well known as a reference unit for CRPS not just locally and, therefore, it is very unlikely that patients who were operated on in the department and sought medical advice because of CRPS, did not return to us.</p>
<p>We did not perform a late review on the patients who were not diagnosed with CRPS at six or 12 weeks, so we may have missed patients who developed later onset CRPS. However, based on our institutional experience and data from the literature, we can definitively state that the development of the CRPS later than three months after the fracture of the distal radius is extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>The results of our study show that CRPS after fractures of the distal radius treated operatively occur less frequently than was previously reported and typically settles without specific treatment within 2–3 months (shorter than previously reported). They also show that the IASP and CRPS severity score criteria display similar sensitivity in early detection of the condition, but both are poor indicators of the need for treatment. Our results do, however, show that patients who meet the CRPS criteria of diagnosis at 6/12 weeks have a less good outcome with greater functional impairment of the hand at late review. Further investigations are needed to gain more information about reliability of contemporary diagnostic criteria for CRPS after fractures of the distal radius.</p>
