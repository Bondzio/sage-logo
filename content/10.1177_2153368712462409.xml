<abstract>
<p>Numerous studies document the positive ramifications of locally based crime prevention efforts, but also reveal that neighborhoods are not equally positioned to engage in such efforts. The same social–structural correlates of high crime rates also make locally based initiatives less likely to emerge and more difficult to sustain. Opportunities for organized anticrime work are therefore unequally allocated across neighborhoods. In this article, I adapt the differential opportunity structures framework to explore an additional dimension of unequal opportunities for crime prevention: those that exist within organizations themselves. Using an intersectional lens to analyze 3 years of ethnographic data on civilian-run anticrime efforts in a small east coast community, my findings illustrate how processes groups use to train and teach their members, the day-to-day realities of their work, and the contours of social interaction within a group all impact participation. Social status factors like race, gender, and age impact access to learning and performance structures associated with anticrime work at the local level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Communities have increasingly become the focus of serious attention from scholars and practitioners interested in crime prevention. Modern policing practices emphasize community engagement and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2153368712462409">Mazerolle &amp; Ransley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2153368712462409">Wood &amp; Dupont, 2006</xref>). Grant programs invest in communities as meaningful spaces for crime prevention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2153368712462409">U.S. Department of Justice, 2011</xref>). Sociological and criminological research, where concepts like collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>), social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368712462409">Coleman, 1988</xref>), and civic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Bartkowski, 2004a</xref>, 2004b) appear frequently, reflects this trend as well. Numerous studies document the positive effects of local crime prevention efforts. They also point out that neighborhoods are not equally positioned to engage in such efforts. Social structural conditions correlated to crime (like poverty, unemployment, and residential instability) also make neighborhood-based initiatives less likely to emerge and more difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Ironically, this means that the communities who could most use organized responses often do not have them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan (1989</xref>) uses Cloward and Ohlin’s (1960) concept of differential opportunity structures to analyze this phenomenon. Identifying opportunity structures for resident involvement in anticrime efforts is an important dimension of research on communities and crime. Which communities are more likely to have anticrime organizations is only part of the story, however. It is not safe to assume that when and where groups exist, equal opportunities for all community members to participate will exist as well. In-depth analysis of local organizations’ internal dynamics is necessary to fully understand differential opportunity structures for anticrime work. Social processes such as training, recruitment, and interaction within groups also impact the chances people have to participate.</p>
<p>Drawing on 3 years of ethnographic research in Gardner Village,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2153368712462409">1</xref>
</sup> a small east coast community, I analyze differential opportunity structures for community-based anticrime efforts that exist within organizations. Using an intersectional lens to understand patterns of interaction in a local crime watch reveals that even when individuals are motivated to volunteer and there are groups to volunteer with, participation opportunities are unevenly allocated. Examining how Gardner Crime Watch (GCW) educated its members and shaped their participation generates new knowledge on how social status factors like race, class, age, and gender influence a person’s access to learning and performance structures for community-based anticrime activism.</p>

<title>Community Involvement in Social Control</title>
<p>Over the past 30 years, community-based crime control methods have garnered a great deal of attention in scholarly, professional, and policy-making circles. A number of forces contributed to this phenomenon. Privatization of public services and increased emphasis on individual responsibility associated with the shift from a welfare state to a neoliberal state led to growth in private, civilian responses to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2153368712462409">Braithwaite, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2153368712462409">Wacquant, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2153368712462409">2009</xref>). The “punitive turn” in public sensibilities and crime control policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2153368712462409">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2153368712462409">Hughes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2153368712462409">Klein, Luxenburg, &amp; King, 1989</xref>) and modern policing trends emphasizing community–police partnerships and resident involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2153368712462409">Mazerolle &amp; Ransley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2153368712462409">Pennell, Curtis, Henderson, &amp; Tayman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2153368712462409">Wood &amp; Dupont, 2006</xref>) also encouraged increased investment in community-based and private security solutions. Emphasis on community involvement in social control is also present in the research literature. Over the past two decades, concepts like neighborhood social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462409">Browning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2153368712462409">Rosenfeld, Messner, &amp; Baumer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2153368712462409">Sampson &amp; Graif, 2009</xref>), civic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2153368712462409">Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Bartkowski, 2004a</xref>, 2004b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>), and collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2153368712462409">Maimon &amp; Browning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2153368712462409">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Earls, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>) have pervaded studies of communities and crime.</p>
<p>Many of these studies are rooted in or draw on social disorganization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2153368712462409">Shaw &amp; McKay, 1942</xref>). As reformulated in the systemic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368712462409">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>), this theory suggests that neighborhoods characterized by residential stability, population homogeneity, and dense network ties at the private, parochial, and public levels are better prepared to exercise informal social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368712462409">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2153368712462409">Kasarda &amp; Janowitz, 1974</xref>). Network connections are central to this perspective because of the collective benefits (otherwise known as <italic>community social capital</italic>) they potentially confer to the community. High levels of social capital alone (i.e., networks endowed with specific characteristics that facilitate collective action, like trust) cannot reduce crime, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368712462409">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2153368712462409">Putnam, 1993</xref>). Research indicates that residents must also be willing and able to engage in collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462409">Browning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368712462409">Carr, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2153368712462409">Hutchinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2153368712462409">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</xref>). In other words, community social capital is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for effective neighborhood social control processes.</p>
<p>Studies of collective efficacy and negotiated coexistence illustrate this pattern perfectly. Collective efficacy, which has been conceptualized as a form of social capital, emerges when neighborhood social networks are characterized by trust, solidarity, shared conduct norms, and willingness to intervene and it is correlated to lower levels of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462409">Browning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>). On the other hand, some studies suggest that the same strong social ties between neighbors that facilitate efficacy can also produce contrary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368712462409">Browning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2153368712462409">Kubrin &amp; Weitzer, 2003</xref>). Browning’s (2009)“negotiated coexistence” model, for example, reveals how network overlap and reciprocated exchange between law-abiding residents and criminally involved residents can lead to toleration of deviance in exchange for relative stability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2153368712462409">Pattillo’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2153368712462409">1999</xref>) ethnographic work reveals similar findings. At various points in both neighborhoods, resident gang members monitored and regulated criminal activity in the area and in exchange, residents tolerated (at least to some degree) their existence.</p>
<p>Both efficacy and negotiated coexistence occur largely as a result of network connections at the private level (affective bonds between friends and kin) and/or parochial level (“weak ties” between neighbors and acquaintances). Other studies indicate that parochial- and/or public-level ties can also be instrumental in reducing crime and disorder in a neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368712462409">Bursik &amp; Grasmick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368712462409">Carr, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2153368712462409">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2153368712462409">Pattillo’s (2007)</xref> study of North Kenwood-Oakland, for example, reveals how neighbors utilize ties to each other and to decision makers and resource holders outside their neighborhood to make change. Carr’s (2003, 2005) ethnography of Beltway  reveals a hybrid of public- and parochial-level connections being leveraged for the sake of neighborhood social control that he calls “the new parochialism.” He argues that this type of control is increasingly common in urban spaces and that it can be effective at combating crime and disorder.</p>
<p>Looking across these studies, it is clear that certain types of network connections facilitate social control and that some neighborhoods are better positioned to engage in these processes. Collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>), community social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368712462409">Coleman, 1988</xref>), civic engagement and strong civic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2153368712462409">Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Bartowski, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2153368712462409">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>), and anticrime organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1989</xref>) are all more likely to exist in structurally advantaged communities. Concentrated disadvantage (i.e., high levels of poverty, joblessness, single-parent households, and residential instability) is related to higher crime rates and to a lower likelihood of effective social controls being present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2153368712462409">Krivo &amp; Peterson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2153368712462409">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2153368712462409">Peterson &amp; Krivo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2153368712462409">Wilson, 1987</xref>). In other words, though the network connections and community dynamics that support locally based control mechanisms can occur in disadvantaged neighborhoods and help keep crime rates low, they are more likely to exist alongside structural privilege.</p>

<title>Differential Opportunity Structures</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan (1989</xref>) uses the concept of “differential opportunity structures” to capture and describe this disproportionate concentration of organized anticrime activities in certain neighborhoods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368712462409">Cloward and Ohlin (1960</xref>) originally defined differential opportunity structures as socially situated variations in the availability of legitimate and illegitimate means to reach proscribed cultural goals. They argued crime is best explained by motives or pressures to achieve cultural goals and access to learning and performance structures for legitimate and/or illegitimate paths to those goals. Though the concept has primarily been utilized in analyses of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9a-2153368712462409">Becker &amp; McCorkel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2153368712462409">Matsueda, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2153368712462409">Messner &amp; South, 1986</xref>), its flexibility makes it useful for analyses of other social phenomena as well. In his work, Skogan argues most people can individually purchase alarms or avoid dangerous spaces, but participating in collective anticrime activities largely depends on having organizations in one’s community (1989, p. 438). Areas with more homeowners, higher income and education levels, and single-family homes are more likely to be “densely organized around crime problems,” providing residents “wider opportunities to participate” (1989, p. 449).</p>
<p>Individual-level studies also indicate variance in ability to engage in organized anticrime actions. Neighborhood Watch is the most common organized anticrime activity in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2153368712462409">Garofalo &amp; McLeod, 1989</xref>). Long-term residents, homeowners, educated persons, financially stable younger people, retired persons, White people, and men are more likely to be involved in the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2153368712462409">Ren, Zhao, Lovrich, &amp; Gaffney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1989</xref>). In some neighborhoods, residents move beyond traditional watch activities to practices like civilian patrols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2153368712462409">Carr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2153368712462409">Garofalo &amp; McLeod, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2153368712462409">Ren et al., 2006</xref>). Inasmuch as that requires additional commitment, it is likely that those with the time to volunteer and money to donate participate more frequently.</p>
<p>In sum, individual- and community-level factors interact to create differential opportunity structures for organized anticrime activity. Individual resources like time and money and community-level resources like the existence of organizations to volunteer with and/or the network connections between neighbors that facilitate taking action access to learning and performance structures for anticrime work. In this analysis, I move Skogan’s use of the differential opportunity structures framework one step further by examining them in community context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1989</xref>). Looking closely at the internal dynamics of one Crime Watch program reveals that there is another layer to differential opportunity structures for collective social control: that which exists inside local organizations.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that even when opportunities to participate exist and a person has the resources to do so, motivation affects participation. In original formulations of the concept, “culturally and structurally induced ‘motivation [is] an intervening mechanism through which structural constraints usually become effective,’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368712462409">Blau, 1990</xref>, p. 147; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2153368712462409">Merton, 1995</xref>, p. 17). Like other studies in this tradition, I focus on “structural conditions as the crucial explanatory concept” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2153368712462409">Merton, 1995</xref>, p. 17). Social structural factors like race, class, and gender impact whether or not individuals are likely to perceive the opportunity to be part of Crime Watch as legitimate and/or desirable, even if it is open to them. Research reveals that factors like race, class, and gender are correlated to two factors that facilitate participation in this type of collective action: faith in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462409">Brunson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462409">Brunson &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368712462409">Carr, Napolitano, &amp; Keating, 2007</xref>) and support for formal, punitive criminal justice interventions that prioritize arrest and/or incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368712462409">Applegate, Cullen, &amp; Fisher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368712462409">Barkan &amp; Cohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2153368712462409">Cohn, Barkan, &amp; Halteman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2153368712462409">Russell-Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2153368712462409">Unnever, Cullen, &amp; Jones, 2008</xref>). So though this analysis focuses on intraorganizational factors and opportunities to participate among those who are able and motivated, I also include discussion of broader social–structural factors that potentially influence individual involvement at the community level.</p>
<p>At the parochial level, bonds between neighbors and ties neighbors have to powerful actors facilitate formal collective action to combat crime like Neighborhood Watch programs, civilian patrols, block groups, public safety committees, and community–police partnerships. I take an in-depth look at one such organization operating at the parochial level of social control (or that embodies “the new parochialism”) to reveal the differential opportunity structures that exist inside local organizations and that affect patterns of participation among those who are motivated, able, and have groups to volunteer with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368712462409">Carr, 2003</xref>). I utilize an intersectional lens to analyze how a resident’s social status—his or her race, gender, and age, for example—impacts the access he or she has to learning and performance structures for anticrime work in such groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2153368712462409">
<title>Intersectionality</title>
<p>Originally, the differential opportunity structures concept relied primarily on analysis of how social class affects opportunities. In the 1950s, however, “status set” (or race, class, gender, and other aspects of social status) became part of how the concept was understood and applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2153368712462409">Merton, 1995</xref>, pp. 76–77). Adopting the modern intersectional lens for analysis can help us see how these parts of a “status set” work together to produce differential opportunity structures for anticrime work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368712462409">Collins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368712462409">Crenshaw, 1991</xref>). The intersectional approach allows researchers to move beyond static discussions of how singular aspects of inequality impact social life to talking about how they act on and with one another simultaneously to produce qualitatively different outcomes for diverse people in diverse contexts.</p>
<p>Since its inception, intersectionality has been defined and utilized in a variety of ways. Most scholars who adopt the approach value “inclusion of the experiences of multiply marginalized persons and groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368712462409">Choo &amp; Ferree, 2010</xref>, p. 131). Others use the concept to illustrate how race, class, gender, and other aspects of social status operate together in a “nonadditive process” to produce “a transformative interactivity of effects” (p. 131). Scholars also “differ in how willing they are to give institutional primacy to one or more sites for producing social inequalities” (p. 131). How researchers define and articulate “intersectionality” impacts how they use it in analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368712462409">Choo &amp; Ferree, 2010</xref>). The study this article emerges from involved interrogating processes privileged residents used to control people they saw as dangerous or threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2153368712462409">Becker, 2008</xref>). As such, the approach to intersectional analysis I utilize here focuses not on inclusion of marginalized voices, but instead on how aspects of social status work together in a nonadditive fashion to produce opportunity structures for anticrime activism. This approach is process-based and conceptualizes intersectionality “as relational rather than locational” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368712462409">Choo &amp; Ferree, 2010</xref>, p. 146). In other words, it centers on processes like education of members or patrolling rather than specific social statuses like wealthy White women or poor Black men. For each process (or type of anticrime work), I examine how both marked <italic>and</italic> unmarked social categories affect opportunities to participate. When looking at how group members cast women as symbolic crime victims, for example, I identify who perpetuates and benefits from such constructions and who does not.</p>
<p>This approach is an important extension in how the differential opportunity structures concept is applied in research on anticrime activism. Ethnographic data analyzed with an intersectional lens provide an intricate view of organizational-level processes and how those processes are tied to (and potentially challenge and/or reproduce) privilege and disadvantage. The study of anticrime activism in Gardner Village shows how aspects of social status like race, class, gender, and age interact to produce an opportunity structure working at the level of interaction. This builds on research documenting differential opportunities to participate at the community level, where some neighborhoods are better positioned for collective action and/or have preexisting groups to volunteer with. It also builds on research that documents individual-level differences in participation, where resources and/or motivation affect who can and does take part in anticrime work. In short, by honing in on the local, this approach provides a new lens through which to see opportunity structures for crime prevention efforts.</p>

<title>Studying Gardner Village: Context and Methods</title>
<p>Gardner Village is a small east coast vacation community with approximately 1,300 year-round residents. The majority of residents are White, but nearly 25% are Black or Cape Verdean.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2153368712462409">2</xref>
</sup> It has a picturesque public beach, a quaint locally owned coffee shop, and a landscape peppered with bed and breakfast inns, bars, restaurants, single-family cottages, and condominiums. It appears idyllic, but harbors a lingering reputation as a “bad” area. While doing research, I heard residents from a variety of backgrounds conjure strikingly similar images of Gardner as a dangerous place. Adults who grew up nearby frequently referenced its street reputation. Almost every time it came up in conversation, someone—usually a White man—responded with a put-on “gangsta” imitation. They would change their posture, repeat the community’s nickname (“Yeah, <italic>G-Vig</italic>!”), put their hands up as if holding a gun, cross their arms and scowl like a “thug,” or make mock gang signs. “Back when I was in high school,” one asserted, “you didn’t even <italic>drive </italic>through Gardner unless you were looking for a fight.”</p>
<p>Gardner’s negative reputation is a recent development. For most of its early history, it enjoyed a healthy economy and a good reputation as a vacation spot. In the 1970s, economic downturn, intensified by construction of a highway bypass diverting traffic from the village, negatively affected the village. Businesses closed, buildings sat vacant, unemployment and crime rates rose, and Gardner gained a reputation as a local “ghetto.” It was not a true ghetto, by any means. It had a stable year-round population, a thriving Cape Verdean community, and crime and unemployment levels more comparable to a small town than to a deeply underprivileged urban neighborhood. In comparison to nearby towns, however, Gardner stood out. This, rather than a surge in crime, led to its quick acquisition of a bad reputation.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Gardner’s reputation lingered. Property values remained lower than comparable beachfront areas. Business investors recognized the opportunity. Soon, Gardner had a new condominium complex, golf course, country club, and a village association that beautified the area and created family, music, and cultural events to attract visitors and homeowners. Storefronts were refaced, the village common refurbished and replanted, sidewalks repaved, and public parks and benches renovated. Between 1990 and 2000, home values rose by about 20% in Gardner while they stagnated in two towns nearest the village, Harbordale and Crystal Lake. From 2000 to 2005, the average value of a Gardner Village home went up 106% to over $250,000, but its “ghetto” reputation lingered. Three anticrime organizations emerged in this context: the Public Safety Committee, Gardner Neighbors’ Group, and GCW. GCW, a civilian patrol and Neighborhood Watch program with over 100 members, was the most active group. GCW held monthly meetings, patrolled in marked cruisers, trained members on topics like drug awareness and home protection, and worked closely with police.</p>
<p>I spent over 3 years (2005–2008) and nearly 400 hr doing field research in Gardner. I attended GCW meetings, went on patrol, assisted at local events, attended grant writing seminars and award banquets, and spent countless hours reading e-mails and talking on the phone with members. Being a young White mother and university-affiliated researcher and student undoubtedly facilitated my access to GCW. Outsiders were treated with deep suspicion, but I was accepted almost immediately. After a background check, one monthly meeting, and a handful of patrols, Eddie, the president, asked me to serve on the board of directors—a position reserved for the most trusted and dedicated members. Managing my role took effort, however. As a young White woman, members often saw me as naïve and vulnerable, but as a university-affiliated researcher, I was also a “qualified” individual giving an opinion. I therefore tried to maintain as neutral a role as possible. I stayed quiet unless someone directly asked me what I thought. Otherwise, I repeated people’s statements—saying something like, “It sounds like you’re pretty upset about that”—asked questions, or remained noncommittal. I also abstained from important votes and/or held my vote until last to avoid influencing others.</p>
<p>Data collection involved taking extensive field notes and doing short impromptu field interviews with organization members, police, and other town officials and area residents. I recorded extensive written and/or audio notes during or immediately after periods of observation. Early on, I took notes during meetings, but limited how much I wrote because group members’ comments made it clear that my note-taking made them nervous. So when the opportunity to be secretary came up, I volunteered in hopes that it would alleviate any mistrust my jotting notes generated. Data analysis took place in five stages. First, I organized data into categories (meetings, phone conversations, patrols, volunteer activities, public encounters, newspaper articles, e-mails, etc.). Second, I read through documents, reflecting on findings and making note of observed patterns. Third, I developed code categories based on a list of emergent patterns and topics. Next, I read and coded all my field notes and documents. Finally, I reviewed incidents, statements, and observations for each coding category and looked for disconfirming cases. Throughout, I utilized memo-making (on codes, themes, and methods) as an analytical tool.</p>

<sec id="section6-2153368712462409">
<title>Differential Opportunity Structures for Anticrime Work</title>
<p>When I started fieldwork in 2005, GCW had almost 40 members. By 2008, the number had nearly tripled. When compared with the village population, GCW was disproportionately composed of older White men. The village’s population of approximately 1,300 year-round residents was about 25% Black or Cape Verdean, approximately 20% at or above retirement age, and a little over half (52%) women. GCW, however, was less than 5% Black or Cape Verdean, about 30% at or above retirement age, and 55% men. At an average Crime Watch meeting, men were the slight majority and all but two or three people there were White. GCW’s membership composition is likely related to how the group trained, educated, and encouraged members to participate. In this sections that follow, I use the concept of differential opportunity structures and an intersectional lens to analyze how these processes worked.</p>
<p>Differential opportunity structures involve access to learning and performance structures for achieving a specific goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368712462409">Cloward &amp; Ohlin, 1960</xref>). Learning structures for anticrime work in GCW were embedded in how the group trained and educated its members. In GCW meetings, members constructed a particular vision of crime, criminals, and victims. Performance structures for anticrime work were closely tied to their view of the crime problem. Finally, the actions members took reflected their assumptions about victimization and criminality.</p>
<p>Close examination of these learning and performance structures reveals that differential opportunities for anticrime work in GCW are evident in (1) blocked opportunities (e.g., young women not being allowed to patrol) and (2) patterns of self-selection (e.g., some members choosing not to go on patrol). Blocked opportunities are frequently used to operationalize the concept of differential opportunity structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9a-2153368712462409">Becker &amp; McCorkel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2153368712462409">Simons &amp; Gray, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1990</xref>). After all, if people are barred from participation, they cannot access the opportunity structure. However, as Merton argues, one basic sociological theorem is “often neglected” in the study of opportunity structures: the idea that “[A]ccess to a designated portion of the opportunity structure need not mean realization of that opportunity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2153368712462409">Merton, 1995</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Using Merton’s definition of opportunity structure as “the scale and distribution of conditions that provide various probabilities for acting individuals and groups to achieve specifiable outcomes” (1995, p. 25), I argue that while blocked opportunities are a crucial part of differential opportunity structures, social structural conditions that affect people’s choices are also important to consider. They may not block people from realizing a goal, but they do affect the likelihood that a person will perceive an opportunity as desirable or available to them and that they will therefore reach that goal. As such, they are part of the overall opportunity structure. In the sections that follow, I illustrate how <italic>learning structures</italic> for anticrime activism existed at the institutional level (within the group) and at the societal level (in popular beliefs about crime). Though hypothetically open to all members, their content helped produce differential access to <italic>performance structures</italic> for anticrime activism in GCW that I discuss in the next section.</p>
<sec id="section7-2153368712462409">
<title>Learning Structures for Anticrime Activism</title>
<p>Prior to learning tactics for specific types of anticrime activism, group members learn a great deal about how GCW leaders, local authority figures, and fellow members view the crime problem. In meetings, tutorial sessions, and informal discussion, members get messages about who is dangerous, who is vulnerable and likely to be victimized, and who is capable of protecting fellow residents. I explore these constructions of danger, risk, vulnerability, and victimization and argue that when put together with broader cultural understandings of criminality, dangerousness, and vulnerability, they comprise a pivotal part of the anticrime learning structures within GCW.</p>
<sec id="section8-2153368712462409">
<title>Constructing danger and risk</title>
<p>Discussion of suspicious persons or crimes that <italic>could </italic>happen in the village if GCW was not vigilant frequently took place in meetings and in informal conversations. In these discussions, members framed men—especially men of color—as criminals. Given the racialization of images of crime in the United States, it is unsurprising that group members (who were overwhelmingly White) linked men of color with criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368712462409">Chiricos &amp; Eschholz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). Similar to most talk about race in the United States, they did this using coded references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2153368712462409">Myers &amp; Williamson, 2002</xref>). Group members made openly racist comments on occasion, of course. One retired White man, for example, said the village “used to be nice,” but was “ruined” by all the “niggers and Cape Verdeans” who moved in. And an elderly White woman once claimed the village’s current problems were the result of Cape Verdean residents “deciding they were Black” during the civil rights movement. However, comments like these were very rare. Instead, people used coded language to talk about race.</p>
<p>The first code for race involved referencing locations in town associated with people of color: Corner Bridge and downtown. Corner Bridge is a residential area on the village’s Main Street peppered with single-family homes and old houses renovated into apartments. On hot summer days, residents frequently sat and socialized on their porches. Once a majority-White area, Black and Cape Verdean residents moved into two houses renovated into apartments in 2005. After that, when residents of Corner Bridge sat on their porches, most were Black or Cape Verdean rather than White. So when GCW members suddenly started referring to this area as problematic, it was clear whom they were talking about. As one middle-aged White man complained, “I drive by there every night and I have to stop right there in the road with my son in the car so that they can do their drug deals.” At another meeting, Jeff, a middle-aged White GCW director, made a similar claim:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Tonight is a perfect example. There were four drug deals going on tonight as I was going up the street to get here. They were out there with their Corvettes all lined up. There were drug deals going on right there [in Corner Bridge].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>GCW members also used references to downtown as code for talk about race. Youth socialized downtown in racially segregated groups. White teens sometimes stood with Black and Cape Verdean teens (and vice versa), but normally two or more distinct groups of teenagers stood in different spots. A group of White youth—skateboarders, kids with dyed hair wearing black jeans and hoodie sweatshirts—hung out near the gazebo or coffee shop. Youth who dressed in (as one group member put it) “athletic <italic>costumes</italic>” associated with urban hip-hop style hung out in front of or closer to the pizza parlor. So when people implicated the kids in front of the pizza parlor, it is likely they were referencing youth of color (or, even if they were not, that their audience will think they were).</p>
<p>For example, Eddie, a White retired man who served as GCW President, once suggested parking the group’s cruiser in front of the pizza parlor. “They’re standing right in front of [the pizza parlor] brazenly selling drugs. And I know for a <italic>fact</italic> that if we parked the cruiser there, they would go somewhere else.” At another meeting, Jeff used a hypothetical situation at the pizza parlor to teach members about when to call 911 and when to call the nonemergency line:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There are emergencies and nonemergencies. Nonemergencies would be a dog running around the street. Or maybe there’s a dope dealer. You could say, “<italic>Hey there’s a dope dealer. I know he’s dealing dope but he’s not doing it right now.</italic>” Those things are not emergencies. They can get the information later. But if there are gunshots fired, that’s something you want to call the police for. “Hey there were gunshots fired down at [the pizza parlor]. Somebody’s possibly wounded.” They want to know that so they can get there right away.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As these examples reveal, talk of location allowed group members to communicate whom they saw as problematic without acknowledging the role race played in that construction.</p>
<p>Members also used style as a code for race. At one meeting, for example, an elderly White man stood up and said, “I went by [Corner Bridge] with [my wife] last week. And there’s a big BMW there with the trunk up and some guys there that I’ve never seen dressed in athletic <italic>costumes</italic>—because they weren’t really athletes.” The crowd burst out into laughter. “And they had a towel around their neck,” he said. “That’s a sign! That’s a gang sign!” called out a middle-aged White woman in the back of the room. “And that’s supposed to mean something,” he continued. “The only person that didn’t know what the towel meant was me.” The crowd roared with laughter. “[My wife] tells me what it means. I’m thinking: ‘Where’s she spending her time when she’s not with me?’” When the laughter faded, he concluded, “It’s disconcerting that that trade, that street talk, <italic>she now knows</italic>. She shouldn’t know. None of you should know.”</p>
<p>Group members occasionally acknowledged race impacted whom they saw as problematic. Far more commonly, however, talk of athletic costumes; youth carrying towels around their necks; and references to Corner Bridge or the pizza parlor served as code for who people saw as dangerous. Just like modern “race talk” (or private discussions about race) perpetuates racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2153368712462409">Myers &amp; Williamson, 2002</xref>), GCW members’ use of coded language allowed them to avoid any charge of bias or racism while simultaneously reproducing those biases and using them as a basis for anticrime action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368712462409">Bonilla-Silva, 2002</xref>). Men of color’s virtual absence and women of color’s limited presence in the group helped to reinforce these messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2153368712462409">Greene, 1990</xref>). After all, if men of color did not participate and women of color who did agreed with (or did not object to) group members’ perspectives, it could not be racist. In addition, sitting through meetings like this had different implications for Black or Cape Verdean residents than it did for White residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2153368712462409">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2153368712462409">Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2153368712462409">
<title>Constructing vulnerability and victimization</title>
<p>In GCW meetings, members regularly cast women as potential victims in talk about actual and hypothetical crimes. For example, at one meeting, members discussed an incident where a church campground resident went into the public bathroom and found a woman passed out. The resident’s husband called the police and Crime Watch. Eddie explained: “I did end up going in there, but I didn’t actually see the woman. I’ll tell you what, though. What I did see was a <italic>terrible security situation</italic>.” He then said the building’s long, dark hallways and exits on opposite sides of the structure meant someone could easily get in and out without being detected. Eddie reiterated, “ . . . that situation is a <italic>terrible </italic>security situation. Someone could go in and light a fire, for example.” Two of the older White women who lived there turned to each other and nodded, one saying, “See? I told you so.”</p>
<p>Jeff interrupted to add his thoughts, pausing for dramatic effect as he spoke:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ll give you an example. A friend of mine stopped in a place like that with his wife to go to the bathroom. They were driving cross-country. They stopped in Chicago at a park. She went into the bathroom. She never [pause] came out [pause] again [pause]. Something like that could happen, a murder could happen. I’m glad he’s telling you about that, a situation like that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Later that evening, campground residents thanked Eddie and Jeff profusely. One White woman said they had been “trying for <italic>years</italic>” to tell the campground committee the meeting hall was a security hazard but they did not listen. Now she <italic>had </italic>to get them to listen. She asked Eddie to attend a meeting and “say what [he] just [said]” so they would understand. “I’d be happy to,” Eddie said. “That whole thing is a nightmare. If I were a woman, I’d be scared to go in there.”</p>
<p>At another meeting, Jeff led a “training session” with the theme of “misdirection.” He told people about a “new scam” where carjackers put a piece of paper on car windshields and steal the car when the driver gets out to remove the paper. The point is to misdirect your attention, he said. “Lots of other crimes are similar. This one is going on a lot now. They are starting to work together in groups and they are particularly targeting women.” Jeff slowly scanned the room, making eye contact with the women in attendance and warning them to be on the lookout for this crime. After the meeting, Jeff brought it up again with Marina, an older Cape Verdean woman, and me. Marina said, “I’ll have to tell my daughter.” Jeff said she should warn her daughter because, “They are doing that one a lot up where I’m from in malls and such.”</p>
<p>Two years later, Jeff brought this case up again in discussion with Larry, a middle-aged White man. Larry expressed concern about his wife’s safety while he was out of town. When Jeff brought up the carjacker story, Larry said he had heard it before. Jeff nodded, adding that they particularly target women, “and most women will leave their pocketbook there and the car running.” Larry looked at Jeff doubtfully. He said he had read about the scheme on the Internet and was not sure it was true. Jeff responded confidently: “It happened here. It happened here.” Between 2005 and 2007, Jeff’s carjacker story changed. In 2005, it was happening near where he lived 30 miles away. With Larry, he said it happened right there in town. As Larry suggested, however, the case is an urban myth (“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2153368712462409">Carjacking,” 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether in e-mail, one-on-one discussion after meetings, a training seminar, or a video, women were frequently characterized as potential crime victims. Sitting through meetings was therefore a qualitatively different experience for women. Unlike men, women could easily walk out of meetings with an enhanced sense of fear rather than an enhanced sense of empowerment. This is especially significant when considering women’s already higher levels of fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2153368712462409">May, Rader, &amp; Goodrum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2153368712462409">Pain, 2001</xref>) and the overemphasis on female victims that exist in mainstream television shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2153368712462409">Cavender, Bond-Maupin, &amp; Jurik, 1999</xref>) and in American’s perceptions of criminals, victims, and vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-2153368712462409">Hollander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). The group’s construction of victimization tapped into these sentiments and reproduced popular ideas about women’s vulnerability to crime.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2153368712462409">
<title>Performance Structures for Anticrime Activism</title>
<p>All members had access to the learning structures for anticrime activism that were embedded in GCW meetings and informal discussions. Part of the group’s education and training process involved learning how members viewed the crime problem. Put together with broader societal patterns in beliefs about criminality and vulnerability to crime, these gendered and racialized constructions defined who was dangerous, who was vulnerable, and who was capable of protecting themselves or others. These beliefs influenced the actions GCW took to protect people and/or prevent crime in the village. In addition, they helped produce differential access to anticrime performance structures. Whether people self-selected specific types of action or faced blocked opportunities, aspects of members’ social status like gender, race, and age, affected their access to performance structures for anticrime activism in GCW.</p>
<sec id="section11-2153368712462409">
<title>Protecting potential victims</title>
<p>Men—especially White men—disproportionately occupied a teacher and/or protector role in GCW. White men were the overwhelming majority of male members and leaders in the group. As such, they were more likely to run meetings or training sessions and to pass on information, warning stories, or advice and to engage in actions like going on patrol. In fact, in my 3 years of research with the group, a woman or person of color <italic>never</italic> led or organized a meeting and all patrol drivers were White. This meant White men had greater power to shape the organization’s agenda and discussions in a way that reflected their interests and perspectives and to occupy the role of “protector.”</p>
<p>For example, one summer after an ex-employee stole money from a local bar, the man in charge called on GCW for help. He had asked bartenders to take the money home at night rather than leaving it there. As Eddie explained, “So the bartenders, who are usually women, are reluctant to leave at night because whomever broke into the place will know that they’re taking it home.” The manager asked if GCW patrollers could go there four nights a week “and watch these women get to their cars.” Eddie said:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I told him that we could do this, we could go down there and watch them get into their cars, but they could still—whoever did this could watch and see that they’re doing this and follow them out of there and follow them to their home.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Matt, a White man in his late thirties, added, “Yeah, and then it’s an armed instead of an unarmed robbery because they see the cruiser there.”</p>
<p>Later in the evening when the subject came up again, the group’s only Cape Verdean board member, Marina, commented, “I tell you what, we all know from being out there that when you walk out to your car at night it’s really dark. <italic>Really</italic> dark.” Theresa, a retired White woman who served on the board, added, “It’s scary. It’s scary.” Marina continued, “And I know cuz I know some of the women who work there. One of the women has her husband come out and walk her to her car at night.” Eddie explained that if GCW agreed to do it, it would be every night but Fridays and Saturdays. “I’m not sure why they don’t want us on Fridays and Saturdays. I thought that those would be the busier nights, but [pause].” Joe, a White man of retirement age who sat on the board, added, “Maybe they have a man working on those nights.”</p>
<p>Gender and race also affected who acted as a protector and who occupied the role of potential victim in a second practice: GCW members’ insistence that men in the group walk women to their cars after meetings. Women were regularly told they had to accept a walk to their car after GCW meetings. This practice communicated and reinforced the message that women are vulnerable, less capable of handling potential danger, and in need of men’s protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-2153368712462409">Hollander, 2001</xref>). Because so few men of color belonged to the group and its images of criminality were racialized, it also communicated the familiar message that White men, in particular, are a source of that protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2153368712462409">Cavender et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The practice of walking women to their cars was not extended equally, however. White women were more frequently offered (or told they had to accept) walks to their cars after meetings. On several occasions, Black women walked to their cars alone or in pairs without anyone offering to accompany them. This rarely happened for White women. In fact, when a White woman declined a walk to the car after a meeting, she was almost always told her refusal was unacceptable and members vehemently insisted she wait for a man to walk her out. What this meant is that in meetings, women of color were subjected to the same messages White women got about their potential victimization, but were less likely to be extended the physical protections White women were. Pervasive cultural stereotypes about Black women’s aggressiveness and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368712462409">Collins, 2004</xref>) and White women’s vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-2153368712462409">Hollander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>) likely helped fuel these practices. At the same time, the practices reproduced inequalities in protection from crime and stereotypes about women’s (especially White women’s) vulnerability, Black women’s independence or ability to “handle their own,” and men’s (especially White men’s) role as women’s protectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2153368712462409">
<title>Patrolling</title>
<p>Social status was also tied to who patrolled for the group. On a typical patrol, two GCW members drove the cruiser in a repeated loop around town. Very few women went on patrol. None drove the cruiser. All GCW patrol drivers were White men. A few women like Eddie’s wife Theresa and Angie, a middle-aged White homeowner, occasionally went out as passengers. Most of these women were White. Group members rarely discussed <italic>why</italic> more men than women or more White members than Black or Cape Verdean members went on patrol. The absence of any conversation about women and people of color being unlikely to patrol (and, alternatively, the fact that White men patrolled more) maintained the normality of the practice. Like lack of discussion about privilege reproduces it, silence around who did or did not patrol helped sustain the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2153368712462409">Applebaum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2153368712462409">Fine, 2004</xref>). It also perpetuated the dominant status of White men in the group by letting them continue to be the ones to serve in this highly valued and rewarded role.</p>
<p>Members occasionally joked about women’s lack of patrolling work. At one board meeting, for example, Jeff asked, “Are there any women drivers?” Eddie replied, “no.” Theresa, following up on a joke someone made earlier about discrimination, said, “That’s discrimination, too.” Jeff asked if we could get a female driver. Eddie replied, “I gotta tell ya. We don’t have any females in our group that I would want to ask to be a driver.” The women directors looked wide-eyed at each other across the table. I scoffed, “Thanks a lot!” Eddie sat still with his arms crossed and a matter-of-fact expression on his face. Marina said, “I don’t go in the patrol car. You’re busy,” she said to me. She repeated, “I don’t go in the patrol car.”</p>
<p>Though Eddie did not elaborate, his comment and the silence that followed suggest group members accept stereotypes about women as bad drivers. Historically, such stereotypes relegated women to a position of relative disadvantage in terms of access to transportation, ability to self-determine daily schedules, and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2153368712462409">Berger, 1986</xref>). In GCW, the stereotypes blocked women from access to the valued membership role of the patroller. When Jeff moved the conversation forward by joking about Rose, a White woman and the group’s oldest, most petite member, he built on these gendered stereotypes even further. First, he made a wisecrack about Rose driving the patrol car. Then others jumped in. “That’d be the best thing to do,” said one. “We’d scare crime right out of town,” laughed another, poking fun at the idea of a short 80-something-year-old White woman driving the car. Nick added, “Yeah . . . [it would be] in the paper: ‘We saw the cruiser driving around town with no driver and two cadets sitting in the back!’” These comments reinforce ageist and sexist stereotypes and the idea that women (especially older women) should not drive the cruiser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2153368712462409">Minichiello, Browne, &amp; Kendig, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>People of color were also underrepresented among patrollers. Given that they are less likely to have a history positive interactions with the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462409">Brunson, 2007</xref>), are disproportionately subject to intrusive law enforcement practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462409">Brunson &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2153368712462409">Rice &amp; White, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2153368712462409">Russell-Brown, 2007</xref>), and are more likely to distrust police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368712462409">Carr et al., 2007</xref>), their reluctance to patrol makes sense. GCW members rarely acknowledged this subject, however, and when they did, it was not jokingly. Marina, the one woman of color in a leadership position in the group, for example, refused to go on patrol. “You’re asking the wrong person,” she said with a stern face on one occasion, “I don’t even go out on patrol.” Though she did not say why, Marina often hinted that she preferred to talk with people one-on-one instead. Her long list of experiences confronting young people bore testimony to her comfort with the approach. For example, one summer evening, a teenager used a stick with a nail in the end of it to demand free coffee and donuts from a local store. GCW members radioed the police and chased him, but he got away. Marina bumped into him while walking home that night. She said she saw him standing with the stick planted in the ground and asked, “What the hell are you doing with that stick, you little shit?” He replied, “I’m Kunta Kinte” and banged it on the ground. While telling the story, Marina leaned in to demonstrate how she had gotten close to the boy, looked him in the eye, and put her hand near his face when she replied, “Oh yeah? Well, you’d better take your ass back to Africa before I shove that stick up your ass.”</p>
<p>Marina’s status made this approach both possible and preferable. As an older resident and business owner with a long history of activism in the Cape Verdean community, she was a respected civic leader. In fact, people often joked about her being the unofficial “mayor” of Gardner. If she talked to a young person, they were likely to know her or to at least take her seriously because she knew their parents. Unlike most people of color who were GCW members, Marina lived in a single-family home in a “good” neighborhood where most of her neighbors valued GCW rather than resenting it. This made it possible for her to directly confront youth with little fear of retaliation. Though working alongside police meant she probably trusted them herself, she undoubtedly had to reconcile her participation in GCW with other Black Americans’ higher levels of distrust for the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368712462409">Carr et al., 2007</xref>). This was likely part of why she preferred to talk with people directly rather than patrolling around in the GCW cruiser.</p>
<p>Other Cape Verdean and Black GCW members were hesitant to patrol for different reasons. One or two, for example, were initially unwilling, fearing retaliation from neighbors, but later agreed to go out in other neighborhoods. Like Marina, they had to contend with distrust for the police in their community. Unlike Marina, however, their social class meant they had to manage that phenomenon in a residential area with higher levels of violent crime and more resentment of “snitching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2153368712462409">Rosenfeld, Jacobs, &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>). Offering to patrol elsewhere therefore made sense for them, especially since Eddie said he would have other volunteers patrol their neighborhoods in exchange. There was little to no follow-through on that promise, however. GCW leaders used “bad” neighborhoods as justification for Crime Watch’s existence, but avoided patrolling there. As Eddie said in response to the police chief’s suggestion that GCW members do foot patrols in a public housing complex, “I don’t want our people doing foot patrols in there. You could get stabbed. You’re risking your life by going on patrol in there.”</p>
<p>Age and gender also affected who patrolled. In 2006, the board recruited student members and ended up with 33 ROTC-affiliated high school students as GCW cadets. Age and gender intersected to impact whether cadets got regular opportunities to patrol. While debating cadets patrolling, Joe, a White man past retirement age, asked: “Here’s a question—would all of you, would you be comfortable driving around with just you and a female recruit in the car?” Others responded simultaneously in near unanimous agreement that it was a bad idea. Joe asked, “well, what about<italic> two</italic> girls?” Jeff said, “That’s a bad idea.” Rhet, an older White man, agreed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because you get two girls and they gang up on ya and tell stories. That’s just the way things are these days. For that matter, you wouldn’t want to go out with one male in the cruiser, either, with the way things are these days.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rhet’s characterization of young women as likely to “tell stories” is characteristic of popular sexual assault myths associated with backlash against the women’s movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368712462409">Berns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2153368712462409">Faludi, 2006</xref>). His assertion that young men would do the same reveals a similar (but homophobic) reaction to the visibility and gains of gay rights activists.</p>
<p>Rather than objecting to Rhet’s assertion, people nodded and murmured. Snorting with laughter, Eddie joked, “Wait until you see some of these girls, though. They’re manlier than we are. Some of them are manlier than we are.” Theresa pressed for a decision: “Okay, so just two recruits—doesn’t matter if the are male or female, just two recruits.” Eventually, the board decided that when members patrolled with cadets, they should take one young woman and one young man and <italic>she</italic> should sit in back. This choice, while tied to the assumption that girls would make false accusations, also served to put girls in a less powerful position while on patrol—the backseat of the car. In practice, however, it was insignificant because girls almost never patrolled. GCW recruiting students from the ROTC program meant that very few young women became cadets. When girls did patrol, another cadet had to be there because they might “claim sexual harassment.” This made their shifts more difficult to schedule. The same rule applied to boys at first, but within weeks, male cadets were going on two-person patrols with an adult. The additional obstacle for girls meant that GCW cadet awards, recommendation letters, and the job training and volunteer experience associated with patrolling were less accessible for them.</p>
<p>Women, people of color, and girls were less likely to go on patrol because of the practices and assumptions that stood in their way. This had two implications. First, White men were better able to occupy the relatively powerful position of GCW patrollers, who were perceived as more serious and committed than other volunteers. As such, their voices held more credibility in meetings and during decision-making processes. Members who did not patrol were often second-guessed in policy debates and were far less likely to be asked to serve as a director or officer. Second, patrolling practices and the beliefs that undergirded them also reproduced existing assumptions about women and older people as incapable drivers, women of color as better at “handling themselves,” and men (especially White men) as competent drivers and “protectors” for potential crime victims.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With a strong, active anticrime organization in Gardner, motivated residents should have had equal opportunities to participate in anticrime work. In practice, however, there were differential opportunities for participation. Examining learning structures (where members constructed gendered and racialized images of victims, risk, and danger) and performance structures (where members employed specific antipractices) reveals how social status impacted people’s access to opportunity structures for anticrime work in Gardner. Race, gender, and age affected how people participated and the consequences their participation generated.</p>
<p>White men from secure social class backgrounds enjoyed the widest set of participation opportunities with GCW. They drove the patrol car, served as directors, ran meetings, taught fellow members, and protected others both symbolically and materially. Most of the men who did this day-to-day work were retired police officers, security guards, and businessmen from middle or working-class backgrounds. Wealthier White men who owned land or businesses in Gardner were far less likely to volunteer. Instead, they influenced GCW via donations. Providing services to businesses for donations was prohibited by guidelines for tax-exempt organizations, but big donations to GCW were frequently followed by small favors like patrolling more frequently near donors’ homes or parking a cruiser near their business to deter teens from hanging out there. White men’s roles in the group are similar to other social institutions. The roles they played were more diverse and more highly valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2153368712462409">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368712462409">England, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2153368712462409">Maher, 2000</xref>). People who went on patrol, for example, enjoyed a greater right to speak, to make decisions about GCW’s activities, and to occupy leadership positions. As such, White men disproportionately had higher status in the group, made more decisions, and had few negative consequences associated with their involvement with GCW.</p>
<p>White women’s experiences with GCW were characteristically different. In discussion of hypothetical events, training sessions, and meetings, women were repeatedly cast into a victim role, much like they are in the popular imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). Whether it was because of their vulnerability, criminals’ alleged preferences for female victims, or their naiveté, women were held up as disproportionately likely to be victimized and more in need of protection than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-2153368712462409">Hollander, 2001</xref>). Women were also seen as less capable than men when it came to group activities like safety patrols. No women drove the cruiser. Very few went on patrol. When they did it was always with a man. Because patrolling was a sign of serious involvement and was more highly rewarded, this also had the effect of limiting women’s influence on the actions GCW took to address the problems residents brought to the organization’s attention.</p>
<p>Like White women, women of color were exposed to stories and warnings that cast them as symbolic and potential victims. One qualitative difference, however, was that these women were often seen as able to handle the threat of crime and danger, as stereotypes about Black women suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2153368712462409">Beauboeuf-Lafontant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368712462409">Collins, 2004</xref>). The perception that these women could “handle themselves” and were “tough cookies” kept them from getting extended the same physical protection White women got. Black or Cape Verdean women’s public safety concerns also got different reception than White members’ did. Violent incidents, suspected drug dealing, and property crime in the public housing complexes and/or less privileged parts of the community that many of these women lived in were frequently discussed in GCW meetings. They were regularly utilized as justification for why the community needed GCW, why people should donate, or why the police should support their work. When it came to taking action, however, these areas got less attention than other parts of town. GCW patrollers regularly drove through donors’ and White members’ neighborhoods, but avoided public housing facilities and poorer sections of the village for fear of violent attack. So women of color who became GCW members, especially those who lived in these areas and went on patrol, extended themselves with greater risk and less protection than White men and women did. Finally, because women of color occupied “token” status in GCW, their presence functioned to legitimize GCW practices and to insulate White members from accusations of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2153368712462409">Flores, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2153368712462409">Greene, 1990</xref>). Some women of color resisted GCW practices (e.g., by not going on patrol), but that resistance rarely got the attention that their endorsement of GCW did.</p>
<p>Some of these patterns applied to men of color as well. Like women of color, they were underrepresented in the GCW membership. The town was nearly 25% Black or Cape Verdean, but the group had only two Black or Cape Verdean men and a handful of Black or Cape Verdean women on its roster of over 100 members in 2008. Second, both men and women of color risked occupying token status in the group because they were one of very few people of color who were GCW members. Beyond that, however, the experiences of men of color who belonged to the group were different. None of them lived in public housing or a part of town that had more crime, so they did not express fear of retaliation from neighbors for being in GCW. They rarely went on patrol, however. Like White men, men of color were able to occupy the “protector” role via activities like walking women to their cars, but their lack of presence at meetings made this a rare occurrence. Underrepresentation in leadership positions meant they were less likely than White men to lead sessions, teach others about crime in the area, or make decisions for the group. Finally, as is typical of public discourse on crime, people of color also faced regular racialized messages about crime and danger where people like them were held up as threats to public safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368712462409">Chiricos &amp; Eschholz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). As research on racial stereotypes suggests, sitting through this would impact people of color differently than White people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2153368712462409">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2153368712462409">Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002</xref>). This experience was likely particularly poignant for men of color, whose younger counterparts frequently occupied the symbolic role of a criminal.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Research documents the potential positive effects of local crime prevention efforts, but also makes it clear that communities are not equally positioned to engage in such efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2153368712462409">Lee &amp; Bartkowski, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1990</xref>). Structural conditions correlated to high crime rates also make neighborhood-based initiatives more difficult to create and sustain. This means communities who could most use organized responses often do not have them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2153368712462409">Skogan (1989</xref>) characterizes this phenomenon using the concept of differential opportunity structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368712462409">Cloward &amp; Ohlin 1960</xref>). Identifying which communities are better able to engage in organized responses to crime is an important dimension of research on communities and crime. Another layer of differential opportunity structures for anticrime activism exists at the intraorganizational level, however. Ethnographic data analyzed with an intersectional lens in the case of Gardner Village illustrates how even when there are groups to volunteer with, individuals do not have equal opportunities to participate. Social status produces differential access to learning and performance structures for anticrime work that exist within local organizations.</p>
<p>This study suggests privileged residents enjoy greater chances to engage in anticrime action. That finding has three implications that deserve further consideration. First, civilian anticrime activities potentially reproduce existing structures of inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2153368712462409">Risman, 2004</xref>). In GCW, members largely reinforced (rather than challenging) existing assumptions about social status attributes like gender, race, and age. GCW activities and group dialogues drew on deeply gendered and racialized constructions of danger and risk (Chiricos  &amp; Eschholz, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). They reinforced stereotypes about Black women’s essential toughness and White women’s vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368712462409">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44a-2153368712462409">Hollander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2153368712462409">Madriz, 1997</xref>). GCW group processes also reproduced inequality via unequal allocation of resources. Men—especially White men—were more likely to experience payoffs of participating in GCW. They gained social–psychological resources like respect, a sense of safety, and a feeling of being tied to the community. They also got access to leadership roles and influence within the community.</p>
<p>Uneven payoffs of anticrime work were also observable at the group and/or neighborhood level in Gardner. Research indicates that anticrime initiatives are more difficult to establish and maintain in the high-crime neighborhoods that could most benefit from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2153368712462409">Skogan, 1990</xref>). In Gardner, a similar theme emerged. Local residents were not struggling to establish a new organization or to sustain an existing one. GCW was active and thriving, but benefited groups of people and neighborhoods unequally. The organization used higher-crime neighborhoods as justification for its existence, but did little to address the concerns of members who lived in those spaces. Instead, they avoided patrolling there. This meant that the spaces in town that arguably could have used GCW’s help the most—and the people who lived there—got less out of the group than other, more advantaged persons and neighborhoods did.</p>
<p>A third implication is the impact differential opportunity structures for anticrime work have on broader patterns of social control. Social status influences who engages in organized anticrime efforts, whether or not they have a voice in discussion, hold a leadership position, and/or have their input taken seriously. The interests and perspectives of privileged persons are therefore more likely to be embedded in local anticrime organizations, impacting the approaches these groups utilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2153368712462409">Sasson, 1995</xref>). White people are more likely to see crime in racialized terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368712462409">Barkan &amp; Cohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2153368712462409">Chiricos, Welch, &amp; Gertz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2153368712462409">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2153368712462409">Quillian &amp; Pager, 2001</xref>). In fact, research suggests that even within the same neighborhood, White and Black residents frequently perceive the “crime problem” quite differently. While White residents frequently use race (and/or men of color) as a blanket sign of danger when navigating their neighborhood, people of color are more likely to develop the ability to identify and manage specific threats to their safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368712462409">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2153368712462409">Carvalho &amp; Lewis, 2003</xref>). White people and men—especially those who are conservative, fundamentalist, Southern, and/or less educated—are also more likely to support punitive solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368712462409">Applegate et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2153368712462409">Cohn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2153368712462409">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2153368712462409">Mitchell, 2004</xref>). White support for punitive measures is most strongly related to racial bias while Black support is most strongly related to fear of crime (Cohn, et al., 1991). White people are also less likely than Black people to support solutions that address the root causes of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2153368712462409">Unnever et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Models for anticrime action built on such beliefs are potentially limited in their effectiveness. Traditional neighborhood watch programs have little effect on violent crime and a relatively limited impact on some types of property crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9b-2153368712462409">Bennett, Holloway, &amp; Farrington, 2006</xref>). In addition, decades of critical analysis of modern criminal justice approaches indicate the limited crime-reducing capacity of harsher sentences, longer prison terms, and/or the sweeping up of larger numbers of individuals into the criminal justice “net” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2153368712462409">Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2153368712462409">Clear, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368712462409">Doob &amp; Webster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2153368712462409">Kovandzic, Sloan, &amp; Vieraitis, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2153368712462409">Lee, 2008</xref>), high levels of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2153368712462409">Hutchinson et al., 2009</xref>), and collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2153368712462409">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>) have been consistently linked to lower crime levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9b-2153368712462409">Bennett et al., 2006</xref>). Each of these approaches also has community-building side effects. Anticrime initiatives built on White residents’ understandings of crime and punishment, however, are less likely to realize those benefits because they potentially undermine community solidarity.</p>
<p>Civilian-run detection and prosecution efforts that focus disproportionately on one segment of a community’s population (as GCW did) work against community-building efforts—especially in racially, ethnically, and/or economically heterogeneous communities. Further dividing a community along racial lines by making a minority population subject to increased surveillance and control for minor acts of deviance or perceived disorder could easily lead to increased interracial tension, especially when those executing these controls are disproportionately White, wealthy, and privileged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368712462409">Brunson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368712462409">Brunson &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). If one part of a town or neighborhood’s population feels alienated or unfairly targeted, they are less likely to feel like they belong to the “community.” This moves localities further from effective social controls like collective efficacy that rely on neighborhood social solidarity.</p>
<p>Future research should build on the current study by examining each of these implications more closely and by utilizing different methodologies to assess differential opportunity structures for anticrime work in variant contexts. A large-scale survey of local groups like Garofalo and MacLeod’s (1989) review of Neighborhood Watch, for example, could assess how social status shapes organizational participation and how groups recruit and train members, define the crime problem, and work to address it. Other studies might utilize ethnographic methodologies to look at anticrime work in communities that are structurally different from Gardner Village. Such work would help determine if differential opportunity structures for crime prevention work vary by context. In addition, future research should examine the frequency with which civilian anticrime activities reproduce (or challenge) existing inequalities. Finally, scholars should also continue utilizing an intersectional lens in order to devote critical attention to the ways anticrime groups address the needs of diverse groups of residents and/or various geographical areas of the community. This is especially crucial because it allows for a better understanding of how or why these efforts work to reduce crime and disorder by assessing the fit (or lack thereof) between what community-based anticrime organizations are doing and what research says about effective forms of social control.</p>
