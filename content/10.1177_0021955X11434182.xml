<abstract>
<p>Polylactic acid (PLA)/polybutylene succinate (PBS) and the PLA/PBS/montmorillonite (MMT) composites were prepared by melt extrusion. The morphology structure, mechanical, thermal, and dynamic rheological properties of the composites were characterized, as well as foaming extrusion behavior of the composites was also studied. The results showed that MMT particles were intercalated into the PLA/PBS matrix forming an ‘intercalation’ structure. The toughness of PLA could be improved by blending with PBS. The comprehensive evaluation of mechanical properties of PLA/PBS was further improved by adding MMT. MMT could play the role of heterogeneous nucleation to improve the crystallization effect of PLA/PBS composite. The melt strength of PLA could be significantly increased by the synergies of MMT and PBS. Meanwhile, MMT could act as a compatibilizer to enhance the interfacial interaction between PLA and PBS. The synergies of PBS and MMT effectively reduced the density of PLA blend foam products, and increased their cell density, uniformity of cell size, and shape distribution.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X11434182" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polylactic acid (PLA) is a kind of fully biodegradable, environmental friendly thermoplastic aliphatic polymer. PLA foam products are widely used in food, packaging, pharmaceuticals, etc., replacing the commercial plastic foam products which are extensively used currently, to reduce the huge environmental impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X11434182">1</xref></sup> But the significant disadvantages of PLA are low toughness and low melt strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X11434182">2</xref></sup> The use of small molecule plasticizers in PLA has a fine toughening effect, but with the change of temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions, these small molecule additives may migrate from the inside of PLA products to the surface continuously, which will lead to the performance degradation of the products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X11434182">3</xref></sup> Polybutylene succinate (PBS) could be formed by the polycondensation of succinic acid and butanediol. The melting point of PBS is about 115°C, the crystallinity is about 40%, and PBS has better toughness than other biodegradable polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X11434182">4</xref></sup> The fully biodegradable polymer alloy blended PLA with PBS could not only effectively improve the toughness of PLA, but also improve the mechanical properties of PBS and ensure the degradation performance of polymer alloys. In the PLA/PBS blend, PBS was dispersed in PLA matrix as spherical particles generally, which could improve the ability to cold crystallization and crystallization of PLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X11434182">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X11434182">6</xref></sup> The compatibility of PLA and PBS could be significantly improved by the joint the small molecule compatibilizer or macromolecular copolymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X11434182">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X11434182">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nano montmorillonite (MMT) could improve the mechanical properties and thermal performance of PLA. Moreover, the melt strength and biodegradation rate of PLA could be improved by the addition of MMT. A good stress transfer and reasonable optimization of the overall mechanical properties could be obtained when MMT was added to 3 wt%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X11434182">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X11434182">14</xref></sup> While in foaming process, MMT could play the role of nucleating agent, and could prevent the blowing agent from diffusing outside of the PLA melt, so as to improve the effect of foaming process of PLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X11434182">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X11434182">17</xref></sup> Actually, batch foaming method was employed in most studies on PLA foam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X11434182">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X11434182">20</xref></sup> which was quite different from the continuous extrusion method commonly used in the actual foam production. However, some studies showed that using nanoparticles such as MMT or other biodegradable polymers to modify PLA could be effective ways to make PLA suitable for foaming extrusion process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X11434182">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X11434182">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>PLA/PBS and PLA/PBS/MMT composite materials were prepared by the melt extrusion method in this article and their morphology structures, mechanical properties, thermal performance, dynamic rheological properties, and extrusion foaming behavior were also studied.</p>

<p>MMT was dried at 90°C for 6 h, PLA and PBS were dried at 50°C for 6 h in oven. PLA, PBS, and MMT were weighed according to desired formula, and then were mixed in a high-speed mixer (GH-200DY, Beijing Yingte Plastic Machinery Ltd) for 5 min at 960 rpm; the pre-mixture was extruded in the twin-screw extruder and pelleted, cooling tank could not be used during the process in order to prevent PLA and PBS from hydrolyzation. The process temperature was 170°C and screw speed was 100 rev/min. After the PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN composites were dried at 50°C for 6 h, vulcanizing press (LP-S-50, LAB Tech Engineering Company Ltd) at 180°C was used to prepare specimen with thickness of 2 and 4 mm for performance characterization and testing.</p>
<p>The prepared PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN were used as the matrix, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (Beijing Luyang Tianzheng Gas Development Ltd) as blowing agent, foaming extrusion experiments were processed in a single-screw extruder tandem extrusion foaming line, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X11434182">Figure 1</xref>. CO<sub>2</sub> was transmitted and measured by a membrane pump and a proportion valve. The process was well controlled to avoid appearing the phenomenon of pre-foaming in a set of single-single screw series extruders with the temperature range from 145°C to 180°C, the pressure range of the extruder between 15 and 22 MPa. The screw speed of the first extruder was 50 rev/min and the second was 10 rev/min. The foam products were rapid cooled by an air cooling system which was connected to an air compress pump and intercepted a part randomly for performance testing.

<sec id="sec6-0021955X11434182"><title>Morphology of PLA/PBSCN3 composite materials</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X11434182">Figure 2</xref> shows the XRD curves of I.34TCN and PLA/PBSCN3 nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction peaks of PLA/PBSCN3 composites have shifted to left when compared with that of I.34TCN, meaning the angle of the diffraction peak decreased. According to Bragg’s equation, 2dsinθ = λ, the distances between MMT layers in the composite were increased, indicating that the molecular chain of PLA and PBS had been inserted into the organic modified MMT layers, PLA/PBSCN3 blends, forming the ‘intercalation’ structure.
<fig id="fig2-0021955X11434182" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>X-Ray curves of I.34CN and PLA/PBSCN3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11434182-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The peak diffraction angle of PLA/PBS40CN3 and PBS20CN3 corresponding to 2θ<sub>1</sub> = 2.42° and 2θ<sub>2</sub> = 2.54° respectively, suggested the layer spacing of MMT to be similar. But the intensity of the diffraction peak of PLA/PBS40CN3 was lower than that of PLA/PBS20CN3, indicating that the intercalated effective of MMT in PLA/PBS20CN3 was better than in PLA/PBS40CN3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021955X11434182"><title>Mechanical properties of PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN3</title>
<p>With the content of PBS increasing, the tensile strength of PLA/PBS decreased continuously, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X11434182">Figure 3</xref>. The tensile elongation at break of PLA/PBS blends increased gradually with increasing PBS content. The tensile strength of PLA/PBS40CN3 increased to 42 MPa, but the tensile strength of PLA/PBS20CN3 decreased by 16 MPa compared with that of PLA/PBS20. This phenomenon was possibly due to synergistic effect occurring markedly in PLA/PBS40CN3, and MMT acting as compatibilizer increasing the tensile strength of PLA/PBS40. However, this kind of synergistic effect would not have happened notably at the ratio of PLA/PBS (80/20); consequently, the tensile strength of PLA/PBS20CN3 decreased, and the reasons would be explored in the further research. After the MMT joint, the tensile elongation at break of PLA/PBS20CN3 was 1% higher than PLA/PBS20, and the elongation at break of PLA/PBS40CN3 increased up to 4.1%.
<fig id="fig3-0021955X11434182" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Tensile strength and elongation at break of PLA, PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11434182-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The impact strength of PLA was improved by the addition of PBS. After adding 3% of MMT, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11434182">Figure 4</xref>, the impact strength of PLA/PBSCN3 composite materials increased compared with that of PLA/PBS.
<fig id="fig4-0021955X11434182" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Impact strength of PLA, PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11434182-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The toughness, the elongation at break, and impact strength of PLA/PBS and PLA/PBSCN3 composites were better than those of PLA obviously, while their tensile strength decreased. This was mainly because the crystallinity of the composites increased, when PBS content increased to a certain amount, thus inhibiting the movement of molecular chains. The improved toughness of PLA/PBS composites was the result of PBS itself having good toughness; PBS dispersed in PLA matrix could act as the center of stress concentration which induced crazing and shear, consuming a large amount of external energy, and controlling the development of crazes, thereby improving the toughness of PLA. In addition, MMT particles had a larger surface area, and formed a structure ‘intercalation’ and ‘exfoliation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X11434182">Figure 5</xref>) with the molecular chains of PLA and PBS intercalated into the layers with strong interaction, thus limiting the movement of macromolecular chains, and creating rigid particle toughening effect when the materials suffered impact, resulting in the mechanical properties of PLA/PBSCN3 better than those of PLA/PBS.
<fig id="fig5-0021955X11434182" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The structure of “intercalation” and “exfoliation” composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11434182-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>According to the above results, it could be concluded that PBS adding into the PLA would increase the toughness of the blend. When 3% MMT was added into PLA/PBS at the ratio of 60/40, the tensile elongation at break and impact strength of the PLA/PBS/MMT composite were dramatically increased compared with those of pure PLA, implying that the toughness was enhanced obviously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021955X11434182"><title>Thermal properties of PLA/PBS/MMT composites</title>
<p>DSC curves of PLA/PBSCN3 composites at a heating rate of 10°C/min and a cooling rate of 10°C/min were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11434182">Figure 6</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11434182">Figure 6</xref> shows that MMT could induce the cold crystallization of PLA, but cold crystallization was offset immediately by the PBS melt peaks, with the content of PBS increasing, the melt peak of PBS strengthening gradually and the melt peaks of PLA weakening. In addition, small ladders were observed in the melt peaks of PLA and this phenomenon might be attributed to melting recrystallization of some defective grains, which were formed during the cold crystallization in the composite. In the cooling process, no crystalline peak occurred in the curve of PLA, but PLA/PBS20CN3 had a very weak crystallization peak, and there was a high and narrow crystallization peak in the curve of PLA/PBS40CN3. This strong peak of DSC curve was a typical PBS crystallization peak. It could be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11434182">Figure 6(b)</xref> that there was no obvious crystallization peak in PLA and PLA/PBS20CN3 samples. The weak crystallization peak of PLA/PBS20CN3 was due to relatively lower PBS content in blend. However, MMT acted as a nucleating agent and accelerated the crystallization process of PBS in PLA/PBS40CN3.

<p>Crystallization of PLA did not occur during the cooling process, but PLA/PBS20CN3 had a very weak crystallization peak, proving that MMT played the role of heterogeneous nucleation.

And after adding 3% of MMT, the radius of relaxation ring of the Cole–Cole curve of PLA/PBSCN3 expanded significantly indicating that the relaxation time of the internal structure increased dramatically, which was caused by the enhanced interaction of the interface between the two phases. This showed that MMT played a role of interface compatibilizer between PLA and PBS.

<p>Due to the formation of the ‘intercalated’ and ‘exfoliation’ structure, MMT limited the movement ability of molecular chains of PLA as well as PBS. Molecular chains of PBS and PLA intercalated into the MMT layers enhancing the entanglement of the chains and the MMT particles dispersed in the polymer further limiting unwrapping of the entanglement point. On the other hand, the organic active groups carried on the MMT layers could strongly interact with the molecular chains of PLA and PBS therefore improving the interface interaction between the PLA and PBS, and then substantially improving the melt strength of the PLA.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11434182">Figure 9</xref> shows the SEM photographs of the foaming extrusion samples listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X11434182">Table 3</xref>. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X11434182">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11434182">Figure 9</xref>, densities of PLA/PBS foam products were lower than those of PLA foam with the increased content of PBS, but the cell size of PLA/PBS foam products was larger than that of PLA foam products. The cell shape and the size distribution of PLA foam were superior to PLA/PBS. This was because the melting point of PBS was lower than PLA, after the melt composites were extruded from the nozzle die, the cooling time of PLA/PBS was longer than that of PLA. The melt strength of polymer was strongly influenced by temperature; lower the temperature, higher the viscosity, and greater the melt strength. The control of the viscosity of polymer was the key control of bubble growth bubble shaping. The shaping of PLA/PBS foam consumed longer time, thus the bubbles which were excessive grew would be merged or deformation. After the introduction of 3% MMT, the density of PLA/PBSCN3 foam products decreased, the number of cells increased, and the cell distribution was more uniform. This was because the synergies of PBS and the MMT enhanced the melt strength of PLA more effectively than single PBS, especially the melt elasticity. MMT played the role of compatibilizer between PLA and PBS. The MMT particles were also helpful in improving the gas barrier properties of PLA/PBS as it extended the gas diffusion path (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11434182">Figure 10</xref>), thus preventing the blowing agent to diffuse outside from the melt. This phenomenon was addressed in the process of the extrusion foaming of some polymers by a number of researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X11434182">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X11434182">27</xref></sup>

<p>The density of PLA/PBS40CN3 foam was the lowest in all samples, and it got more number of cells, more uniform distribution cell size and shape than those of PLA/PBS20CN3. This was also consistent with the result of dynamic rheological test, which was that the melt elasticity of PLA/PBS40CN3 was significantly improved. In addition, the crystallinity of PLA/PBS40CN3 was high and the crystallization rate was fast, which also helped their melt to shape quickly and form good cell structure.</p>

<list-item><p>The elongation at break and impact strength of PLA were significantly improved by blending PBS. The PLA/PBS/MMT composites prepared by the addition of PBS and 3% MMT had the best mechanical properties evaluation in all formulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>MMT could play the role of heterogeneous nucleation and promote the crystallization properties of PLA/PBS. When 3% MMT was added, the crystallization rate of the composite with 40% PBS content was faster than that of 20% PBS.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the increased content of PBS, the loss modulus and loss factor of PLA/PBS decreased gradually, indicating that the addition of flexible PBS could improve the melt elasticity of PLA. The synergistic effect of MMT and PBS could greatly increase the melt strength of PLA according to the analysis of Cole–Cole curves, indicating that MMT could play the role of compatibilizer between PLA and PBS.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The good synergistic effect of PBS and MMT could effectively improve the cell shape, increase the cell density, and reduce the cell size of PLA and PLA/PBS foaming extrusion products, while reducing the density of foam products effectively.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In summary, the disadvantage of poor toughness of PLA could be effectively improved by blending PBS, resulting in the improved melt elasticity of PLA. MMT and PBS could improve the melt strength of PLA by synergistic effect and could greatly improve the foaming ability of PLA. Well shape-controlled, uniform cell distributed, and lower density PLA foaming extrusion products could be prepared by this modified method and appropriate foaming extrusion process.</p>
