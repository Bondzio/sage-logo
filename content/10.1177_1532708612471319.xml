<abstract>
<p>In this essay, I argue for a hearing of and listening for Benjamin’s concept of aura as an attributed and aural quality that is situated in the various intertwining contexts of performers, performances, and audience members. As an example, I consider specifically how the music performance of trumpet player Miles Davis comes to life for me in the spaces and the gaps that surround the various contextual clues I gather. This essay offers an example and reading of aura that can be extended to the criticism and understanding of music performances as events that happen in and beyond context.</p>

<body>
<p>I step forward to the replica ’55 Shure microphone. I turn to my right and look over my shoulder at the drummer and the bass player: “A one . . . (snap) . . . a two . . . (snap) . . . a one . . . two/(snap) . . . three . . . (snap).” The band starts playing the song “All of Me” by Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons. I turn back to face the microphone and begin to sing.</p>
<p>The eight-piece swing band played at restaurants, private parties, and wedding receptions. As the trumpet player, I sang a few songs with the band, including the tune, “All of Me.” I was still learning how to play and improvise solos on the trumpet, and so I collected and purchased books with transcriptions of trumpet solos with the hopes of learning how to be a better musician and improviser.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612471319">1</xref></sup> One of the books I bought had transcriptions of Miles Davis solos, and one of the transcriptions in that book is listed as the solo for “All of Me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612471319">Isacoff, 1979</xref>). However, the transcription cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612471319">Cole Porter (1954)</xref> as the author of the song and references the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612471319">1964</xref> Miles Davis recording <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic>. “All of Me” is not on this recording, but the Cole Porter song “All of You” is.</p>
<p>I did not realize this was a typo until after I stopped playing with the swing band. Now, slightly embarrassed, I realize why I could not figure out how to play a solo for “All of Me” on the trumpet from this transcription. Now, I find myself listening for connections between my performance of “All of Me” and Davis’s performance of “All of You.” Now, I find myself listening to the live recording of Davis playing “All of You” at the Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City on February 12, 1964, over and over again. I hear a muted trumpet transforming and challenging my practice as a listening musician, scholar, and student.</p>
<p>Now, I find myself listening for typos, inconsistencies, and other disruptions as potentially meaningful and instructive performative moments. Now, I find myself entering into what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612471319">Pollock (2007)</xref> refers to as a performance space, where my desires (to improvise and to hear Davis) might become possible through the logic of “what if” (p. 247). Now, I find myself listening for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471319">Benjamin’s (1969)</xref> notion of aura in this recorded performance (p. 222). I hear the possibility for applying this concept of aura, what Benjamin refers to as a unique quality of presence held by an aesthetic phenomenon, to the unlikely example of a recorded music performance (p. 223). I hear the possibility for developing an argument about listening for aura, and about the role of the audience in shaping and creating music performances as historically and politically significant communicative interactions. Now, I find myself listening, and I am lost in the spaces between me and you.</p>
<p>The live audio recording of “All of You,” includes Davis on trumpet, George Coleman on tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony Williams on drums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471319">Chambers, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532708612471319">2</xref></sup> On the track, the song begins with applause from an audience of presumably like-minded individuals in support of the civil rights movement. This particular concert was a benefit, supporting voter registration drives in Louisiana and Mississippi sponsored by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Congress of Racial Equality, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612471319">Monson, 2007</xref>). Davis begins the song on trumpet playing a variation on the melody. Hancock and Carter play chords in the spaces between the phrases of the melody. As the melody progresses, the rest of the quintet joins in playing, but the trumpet remains the focal point of the song. Davis takes the first solo, which lasts almost 5 minutes on the almost 15-minute long number. Coleman takes the next solo, and then Hancock plays a solo before Davis plays a final extended variation on the melody to end the tune.</p>
<p>The recording of the performance on the album <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic> was first released by Columbia in 1965.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612471319">3</xref></sup> <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic> is a collection of all the ballads played during the February 12th concert. The album <italic>Four and More</italic>, also released by Columbia, contains the up-tempo songs played at the concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471319">Carr, 1982</xref>). Dividing the concert into two different albums based on tempo means that the songs on <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic>, like “All of You,” are taken out of the chronological context in which they were played during the concert. This detail, though seemingly minor, is exactly the kind of detail that I want to consider for the ways it functions as a disruption and reminder of the contextual and complex nature of listening to music performance. This is not to say that there may be an authentic performance that might be listened to, or an authentic way of listening, but it is to say that the possibilities of listening for and to these kinds of disruptions are worth considering because they point to and reveal the expectations that always already shape our expectations as listeners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612471319">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a trumpet player, I am a student learning from Davis’s music and life story. My listening to his music, and this particular recording, is as a student. And though I approach this recording eager to learn, there is a distance between Davis and me in both time and space (not to mention culturally, musically, and racially). There are 40 years between our performances, and apart from the recording of the performance all I can do is reach and search for clues. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612471319">Holman Jones’s (2007)</xref> listening for Edith Piaf, the lessons I learn from Davis are created in and by my performance of listening (pp. 46-47). This listening is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612471319">Pelias (2010)</xref> describes performance, a kind of opening. More specifically, he explains, “It is an opening where ghosts find form, linger, and haunt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612471319">Pelias, 2010</xref>, p. 173). This listening opens up, for my hearing, Davis’s performance.</p>
<p>The initially unnoticed typo serves as a reminder of how easy it is to overlook (or overhear) the potential lessons offered specifically in the music and life story of Davis, and even more generally in performance and communication. Attending to this typo teaches me to hear lessons in my listening, as well as, to hear listening as a creative and performative act. Listening in this way, functions to enable what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612471319">Madison (1998)</xref> calls a “performance of possibilities” that works toward “creation and change” (p. 277). Listening as a performance of possibilities is an attempt to recognize our connections and dependence on others and is as Madison explains subjectivity: “It is the move beyond the <italic>acknowledgement</italic> of voice within experience to that of actual <italic>engagement</italic>” (p. 279). Performative listening therefore works to actively engage and create relationships with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612471319">McRae, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In this essay, I create a framework for understanding, and hearing, a specific performance of Davis based on my personal context as a listener, and based on the historical contexts of his performance in order to make the case for hearing the significance in between the gaps, spaces, “wrong notes,” and typographical errors of performance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612471319">5</xref></sup> I build this framework first from an extended play on and with the material effects and sounds of Davis’s muted trumpet. I next apply this discussion of Davis’s muted performance to the question of and practice of contextualizing the performance. I then add to this contextual framework my reading of Benjamin’s discussion of aura specifically in terms of the political consequences of this concept. Hearing Davis’s performance in terms of the metaphor of a muted trumpet and Benjamin’s notion of aura highlights the significance of focusing on the gaps inherent in the act of listening to or “audiencing” any performance.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532708612471319">
<title>Muted Performance</title>
<p>During the performance of “All of You,” Davis plays the trumpet through a Harmon mute with the stem removed and directly into a microphone, this softens his tone and creates a slightly tinny quality to the sound. There is a simultaneously distant and piercing effect to the quality of the sound. Davis’s use of the Harmon mute in this way creates a sound that is easily identifiable as the “sound of Miles Davis” because it is a technique he frequently used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612471319">Merod (2001)</xref> explains the use of the Harmon mute as an experimental method in terms of amplified sound on recordings, and also as a strategy Davis used to positively emphasize his limited range on the trumpet (p. 80). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471319">Brofsky (1983)</xref> identifies the use of the Harmon mute as a technique that also marks Davis’s individuality from other trumpet players who recorded the same songs (p. 26). These interpretations of Davis’s choice to play a muted trumpet point to Davis’s unique sound. In his autobiography, Davis explains the importance of developing an individual sound during his first experiences sitting in with Charlie Parker’s band. Davis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471319">Davis &amp; Troupe, 1989</xref>) says, “So I just didn’t play those licks that I knew I couldn’t play, because I realized early on that I had to have my own voice—whatever that voice was—on the instrument” (p. 69).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532708612471319">6</xref></sup> Davis’s use of the Harmon mute not only highlights his unique sound on the trumpet but it also provides a useful metaphor and frame for hearing this particular performance both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>In order to explain the literal and figurative value of the Harmon mute it is useful to first draw comparisons to the sound of a trumpet without a mute, and to the sound of a trumpet with a straight mute. When I first started playing the trumpet, I did not actually own a trumpet. My first horn was a cornet, which is similar to a trumpet, but slightly smaller. Because I did not own a “real” trumpet, my parents came up with several arguments in order to help persuade me to believe that a cornet was just as good, if not better than a “real” trumpet. The two most convincing arguments were that the cornet has a warmer tone than the trumpet, and that Louis Armstrong used to play the cornet. However, as a beginning trumpet player there was virtually no difference between the sounds I produced on the cornet, and the sounds the other beginners made on their trumpets in the school band (and virtually no similarity between the sounds I produced on the cornet and the sounds of Louis Armstrong). Needless to say, the sounds of a trumpet without a mute, can take on a wide variety of tones and colors, and these sounds are highly contextual and dependent on the experience and style of the person blowing air into and through the horn.</p>
<p>Playing the trumpet with a mute, then, changes the already highly contextual sound of the trumpet. The cone-shaped straight mute has strips of cork that are glued around the outside of the mute in order to hold the mute in place in the bell of the horn. There are gaps and spaces between the strips of cork which direct the air flow out of the bell of the horn and around the outside of the mute. Some of the air may be directed into the mute itself, but the bottom of the mute is sealed off. The sound of the air moving from the bell of the horn, between the corks, and alongside the mute, is a direct airstream from the horn that is only changed by what is in its way. The straight mute, therefore, softens and changes the sound of the trumpet slightly.</p>
<p>The cylinder-shaped Harmon mute, unlike the straight mute, has a single solid strip of cork around the open end of the mute that is inserted into the bell of the trumpet. This seals the connection between the mute and the bell of the horn in a way that allows no air to escape directly from the bell of the horn without first passing through the hollow opening of the mute itself. This mute also has a removable stem that can further alter the sound of the airstream as it flows through the mute. In comparison with the straight mute or the trumpet with no mute, the Harmon mute transforms the airstream that moves through the horn because no air comes directly from the horn without first going through the mute. The transformed airstream functions literally and figuratively in my thinking about and listening to Davis’s performance.</p>
<p>Literally, the mute raises questions of technology as a mediating factor in music performance. The sound of Davis on the trumpet is always mediated by the Harmon mute on “All of You.” Other mediating factors include the microphone, the recording, and the speakers on which I listen to the recording. According to <italic>The Harvard Dictionary of Music</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471319">Randel, 2003</xref>), a mute is “A device for reducing the volume and or altering the tone color of an instrument.” This musical definition of the mute is significant because it highlights the fact that the mute alters or changes the sound of an instrument. The mute, and I would argue all of the mediating factors, mutate the sound in some way. Even the reduction of volume is a mutation, not a muting or silencing. This is also significant because what is mediated and what is altered is never an original or unmediated sound but is always dependent on various contextual factors such as who is playing, when they are playing, where they are playing, and so on.</p>
<p>Figuratively, the mute operates as a heuristic for coming to know and experience this performance. It is in the gaps and spaces of the mute that enable the experience of this performance. The performance is always muted, and it is only through this muting that I can begin to hear Davis. As with communication, these gaps and spaces, or contexts function as a starting place for me to develop my interpretations and experiences of the performance. The difference between the gaps and spaces of the Harmon mute and the straight mute also apply figuratively. The Harmon mute is an addition to the horn itself, and the gaps and spaces are inside the mute. The mute is inseparable from the hearing of the performance. The gaps and spaces of the straight mute create the illusion of a direct unchanged or even authentic airstream from the trumpet. But I can never have the direct experience of the performance, and even if I had been alive and at the concert in 1964 there was never a singular direct performance to witness. Just as the mute changes the sound of the trumpet, the performance is also always changed by the various contexts that surround the performance. Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612471319">Holman Jones (2010)</xref> argues of the music of and her listening to and writing of torch singers and songs, each repetition of this particular song is always changing and moving (p. 284). In the following section, I discuss the specific historical and research contexts from which I attempt to situate my listening to Davis’s always moving and changing performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532708612471319">
<title>Contextual Performance</title>
<p>Contextualizing Davis’s performance historically and through various performances of research is an act of listening for and hearing Davis’s muted performance as one that continues to sound new possibilities. Context matters in terms of audiencing or listening to a performance, but in gathering the clues and fragments that surround this particular recording of Davis I am not necessarily working for a fuller or more “complete” understanding of his music. Instead these contextual clues function like the mute, to transform the experience of listening to the sounds of the performance: from an exhaled breath to a culturally recognizable and political musical form, from a typo in a book of transcribed solos to a critical and performative reflection, from a singular performance event to multiple listening opportunities. The mutations enabled by the following context clues at times point to larger systems and structures of power, and at other times these clues work to obfuscate rather than clarify a performance.</p>
<p>I understand the relationship between context and performance to be not unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612471319">Jones’s (1993)</xref> explanation of the process of sound recording. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612471319">Jones (1993)</xref> explains, “Sound recording thus captures ambient sound, or put another way, the sound of the space surrounding the sound source” (p. 241). Gathering and listening for contextual clues can only reveal what surrounds a performance. Like the rhythm section setting the groove for a solo, the following fragments and historical context clues create the spaces within which a performance of listening to and experiencing this particular musical performance might take place.</p>

<title>Clues en Concert</title>
<p>An advertisement from <italic>The New York Times</italic> on February 4, 1964 reads,
<disp-quote>
<p>Miles Davis</p>
<p>Benefit Concert for Voter Registration in</p>
<p>Louisiana * Mississippi</p>
<p>On Lincoln’s Birthday</p>
<p>Wednesday, Feb. 12, 8:30 P.M.</p>
<p>At Lincoln Center</p>
<p>Philharmonic Hall</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The performance is not separate from the political climate of the United States. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and Lyndon B. Johnson is the current President at the time of the concert. Johnson is running for office in the coming November. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee sponsor the concert to raise funds for the voter registration drives in the South where large numbers of Black people are still not registered to vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471319">Chambers, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Davis’s political commitments remain implicit. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471319">Chambers (1998)</xref>, “Davis, as expected, neither acknowledged the political motive of his concerts directly nor observed it in any overt way, choosing instead to use the occasion to run through his regular repertoire in rapid succession” (p. 67). So, apart from the music there is no recorded acknowledgment of the function of the concert as a political event by Davis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532708612471319">7</xref></sup> However, the audience must surely be aware of the political implications of their ticket purchase (seats listed in the advertisement for $3.00, $5.00, $10.00, $25.00, $50.00). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471319">Cook (2007)</xref>, prior to going on stage Davis informed the band that because the concert was a benefit they would not be paid for the performance (p. 154). Ron Carter is quoted in Cook as saying, “I said I thought it was unfair that after being off for two or three weeks, he expected us to play for free at the first job back” (p. 154). Davis finally agreed to pay the band, but the musicians were unhappy (p. 154).</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Davis acknowledges the financial concerns of his band mates and explains the tension that evening from his perspective:
<disp-quote>
<p>We had been off for a while as a band, each doing other things. Plus it was a benefit and some of the guys didn’t like the fact that they weren’t getting paid. One guy—and I won’t call his name because he has a great reputation and I don’t want to cause him no grief, plus he’s a very nice guy on top of everything else— said to me, “Look, man, give me my money and I’ll contribute what I want to them; I’m not playing no benefit. Miles, I don’t make as much money as you do.” The discussion went back and forth. Everyone decided that they were going to do it, but only this one time. When we came out to play everybody was madder than a motherfucker with each other and so I think that anger created a fire, a tension that got into everybody’s playing, and maybe that’s one of the reasons everybody played with such intensity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471319">Davis &amp; Troupe, 1989</xref>, p. 266)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Davis’s remarks indicate this concert was an intense performance for an intense political movement, with a complicated relationship between money and performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471319">Carr (1982)</xref> provides insight about the reaction of Herbie Hancock to the performance itself, who reflects,
<disp-quote>
<p>That was my first time playing at the Philharmonic Hall and that was, like, a big deal, because the new Carnegie Hall was the Philharmonic Hall. Just from the prestige standpoint I really wanted to play good—the whole band really wanted to play good because that was the whole band’s first time playing there . . . although Miles had played at Carnegie Hall before . . . but it was really a special concert. Only the New York Philharmonic plays there . . . and I tell you something . . . it was really funny . . . When we walked away from that concert, we were all dejected and disappointed. We thought we had really bombed . . . but then we listened to the record–it sounded fantastic! (p. 138)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This observation by Hancock about the reaction to the performance is matched by Davis’s own reaction who bluntly states in his autobiography, “We just blew the top off that place that night. It was a motherfucker the way everybody played—and I mean everybody” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471319">Davis &amp; Troupe, 1989</xref>, p. 266). So, in addition to a rather tense feeling before the performance, these quotations suggest that after the performance there was a general positive feeling about the concert, or at least the recording, by the musicians.</p>
<p>Other writer’s comments and observations about the performance are suggestive about the reception of the album, but not necessarily the concert itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471319">Carr (1982)</xref> does connect his criticism about the album directly to the concert in his observation when he says,
<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic> album from that concert is one of the very greatest recordings of a live concert. The rapport between the large audience and the quintet is as close and immediate as if the event were taking place in a small club, and the charged atmosphere enhances the inspired creative act. There is here a kind of complicity between audience and musicians, a unity which is quite rare. (p. 138)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This interpretation of the audience at the concert is an interesting insight, and apart from the polite applause on the recording, Carr’s justification for this statement is unclear.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471319">Cook (2007)</xref> specifically comments on the quality of the album, but is more critical of the decision to release the concert on separate albums than anything else. He says,
<disp-quote>
<p>Columbia decided to follow a bizarre course by programming one album of ballads and one of fast pieces, which resulted in one visit to the sepulchre being balanced by a speedfreak’s delight. Taken together, as they should be, the music remains compelling. (p. 154)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This praise for the music is mirrored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612471319">Siders’s (1965/2007)</xref> review from <italic>Downbeat</italic> in 1965, “As far as the instrumental quality of what is included, fast or slow, this album ranks with the best of Davis’ recorded efforts” (p. 240). Siders also mentions “All of You” specifically saying, “‘All of You’ shows Davis’ penchant for tags, and they, in turn, elicit some muscular plucking from Carter. His glissandi behind Hancock’s solo sound like a tailgating trombone” (p. 240). This reference to the musicians is also situated in an observation made by Siders regarding the live concert atmosphere, “No happier circumstances can exist in recording than to have an ensemble of instrumentalists who have something to say and an unhurried atmosphere in which to say it” (p. 239).</p>
<p>These various critiques and reviews of the album, along with the reactions from the performers, inform my listening. From the political implications of the concert, to the reactions of the musicians about the performance, to the reviews by music critics and scholars, a frame for how I hear the concert starts to take shape. In addition to the direct references about the performance, I also can begin to make other connections to the historical context of the performance by reading around the concert advertisement from <italic>The New York Times.</italic> Announcements for other upcoming performances at various venues in New York City including Nina Simone at the Village Gate, “In White America” at the Sheridan Square Playhouse, the Trojan Women at Circle in the Square, “A Man for All Seasons” at the New York City Center, and “The Boys from Syracuse” at Theatre Four. I am not initially familiar with many of these advertised performances, performers, or locations, but as I begin to research these titles, performers, and directors the performance scene and politics of 1964 in New York City takes on additional meaningfulness for my understanding of Davis, the other band members, and the audience at the Philharmonic Hall.</p>

<title>Clues in Research</title>
<p>The Archives Assistant, Jillian Matos, at Lincoln Center for Performing Arts, Inc. offers to search for confirmation of the performance, and she apologetically informs me via e-mail that the time and date of the performance are the only archived record of the event. She sends me the booking information for the concert (J. Matos, personal communication, October 14, 2008). The record, a copy of a lined page from a calendar of events, has performances written in for the week of February 9, 1964 through February 16, 1964. On Wednesday, February 12, at 6:00 there is an illegible event that is scratched out. Written in around the crossed-out event reads,
<disp-quote>
<p>6:00</p>
<p>D-Stein</p>
<p>Miles Davis</p>
<p>Jazz Concert</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My reaction to this archival record is excitement. My heart beats faster. This handwritten booking information is a marker of the event happening before the event happened. It supplements the live recording by providing verification from the venue itself. In spite of the other textual references to this performance written after the event took place it is with the handwritten acknowledgement of the event that the concert comes to life. The performance of “All of You” to which I find myself listening in order to get a sense of Davis speaking to all of me emerges in the booking confirmation as a real and powerful event. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612471319">Gumbrecht’s (2004)</xref> terms, it is an event that “undoes itself while it emerges” (p. 113). I know with certainty that this is a performance I can never fully recover.</p>

Because of the lack of access I have to the performance of “All of You,” my experience of the performance depends on my own performances as a researcher. It is in the moments of researching that the performance comes to life. I start with my singing of “All of Me” because this is where I locate the beginning of my search for the performance of “All of You” by Davis. My own singing of this jazz standard into the vintage microphone, and my attempt at improvising a solo on the trumpet mediate my own hearing and witnessing of the performance of Davis.</p>

<title>Driving With Miles Davis</title>
<p>It is a misty, cold, and gray October morning, and my colleagues and I are driving from Carbondale, Illinois to Nashville, Tennessee for a conference. My iPod is playing through the tape deck, and we are listening to “All of You,” repeatedly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532708612471319">8</xref></sup> There is talking and laughing and commentary about various road signs and speculation about the upcoming conference weekend, but as the driver, I occasionally allow myself to drift out of the conversation and focus on the road and the music. The windshield wipers, on the slowest setting, occasionally clear the mist from the windshield. The gray sky and the smell of the coffee in my travel mug seem to set the appropriate mood for listening to the song.</p>
<p>I imagine Davis on stage playing through the mute into the microphone, and without changing the volume control on my car’s unremarkable speakers; I strain to hear the notes as he begins playing the solo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532708612471319">9</xref></sup> I imagine him stepping back from the microphone or turning his body to the side to face the other musicians. He then turns back or steps back toward the microphone as the sound of the trumpet once again fills the speakers. I strain to hear at times, just as I strain to see out of the front window as the mist accumulates. And just as the wipers return to clear the beading mist from the windshield, the sound of the trumpet comes back clearly into focus.</p>
<p>I am bothered by what sounds like condensation in the slides of the trumpet during the solo. As a trumpet player, I yearn for him to blow the condensation out of the spit valve so that his sound will not be muddied by whatever is inside the horn. But I’m also not entirely sure that this is not an effect Davis is intentionally producing with his tongue. What sounds like a mistake at first is easily explainable or justifiable as an intentional or meaningful production on subsequent hearings.</p>
<p>Then, on a slow trill toward the end of the solo, I hear what can only be described as a feeling. I hear something I can’t describe in any musical terms that I know. All I know is that it sounds right on. It sounds funky. It sounds nasty. It sounds like there is pain or pleasure in those notes. There is something raw and real and unrestrained in the trumpet. And the trill ends, and the rhythm section picks up, and the drums and bass become clearer. My hand instinctively taps the side of the steering wheel in time with the bass line, and as Miles finishes the solo the rest of the instruments stop playing for a moment. I nod my head and then I reach for the iPod to return to the beginning of the song, so that I can try to reexperience the feeling of that moment.</p>

<title>Aura and Music Performance</title>
<p>How can I begin to recover this performance of Davis? The moment when performer and audience come together in another time and place cannot be reproduced. Can I return to the performance through recordings and archives? Can this fleeting moment be reperformed or reexperienced? Benjamin’s notion of aura might provide a way of thinking about hearing this recorded performance from over 40 years ago as a critically meaningful event. Listening for the aura, or the element of art that Benjamin fears is destroyed by the processes of mechanical reproduction, in the recording of “All of You” functions as a disruptive practice that transforms specifically how music performance might be experienced or audienced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532708612471319">10</xref></sup> Though I might never identify or hear the aura of this performance, or of any aesthetic communicative event, the practice of listening for aura provides a critical method of engaging with music performance as an audience member, as well as a critique of what it might mean to be an audience member.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471319">Benjamin (1969)</xref> explains the aura of an historical object as a “unique phenomenon of distance” (p. 222). This concept is clarified by Benjamin in his discussion of the decay or loss of aura in relationship to mechanical reproduction. He states,
<disp-quote>
<p>To pry an object from its shell, to destroy its aura, is the mark of a perception whose “sense of the universal equality of things” has increased to such a degree that it extracts it even from a unique object by means of reproduction. (p. 223)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, aura is deeply connected for Benjamin with questions of authenticity and presence, and the phenomenon of mechanical reproduction inherently works to dismantle that which makes aura possible.</p>
<p>The idea that a work of art might contain an aura, and that mechanical reproduction functions to erase the possibility of an aura raises several interesting and, I believe, important questions especially regarding music performance. As a concept, aura is a challenging one to define. In terms of performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532708612471319">Weaver (2009)</xref> suggests, “Aura is how art affects a group of people or a person” (p. 420). Similar to Weaver, I understand Benjamin’s notion of aura, to be a phenomenon that is enacted in interaction among the aesthetic text (art object, performance, etc.), the audience, and a particular historical and social location. What is significant about this concept, and particularly significant in terms of performance studies, is that aura functions to qualify a moment of interaction with an aesthetic communicative event. What happens in this moment? What are the consequences of this moment of interaction? What is the relationship between this moment and broader historical and political contexts?</p>
<p>Aura is a nuanced concept, and though my own understanding of aura may not match precisely Benjamin’s I am attempting to work from Benjamin’s discussion about aura as a starting place. Even if aura is lost, the act of listening for this phenomenon presents a productive challenge to theorize what it means to experience or audience an aesthetic text. For me, this is a question of listening to a particular music performance, and of working to articulate the feelings and consequences of the act of listening. My own use of the notion of aura is not meant as a corrective to Benjamin, but rather as an application of the concept that is transformative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532708612471319">11</xref></sup> Benjamin’s discussion of aura presents a productive critical idea, and my act of listening for aura in a recording of a live performance by Miles Davis is an attempt at hearing new possibilities for both aura and music performance.</p>
<p>What if mechanically reproduced art has an aura? What if aura has only been, as Benjamin argues, decayed but not completely destroyed (p. 222)? What if there are faint traces of an aura in the recording of “All of You” that I find myself listening to repeatedly? What does this aura sound and feel like? And what would be the consequences and implications of hearing an aura? I argue that though mechanical reproduction may cause aura to decay or diminish, it does not entirely erase the possibility of aura. I also argue aura is a productive concept for performance particularly in regard to developing an understanding of presence and the significance of listening to and for historical performances. If mechanical reproduction is understood as an access point to a historically situated moment, then the concept of aura can help unpack the significance of the performance in new and changing historical contexts. To understand how aura might be listened for, it is important to focus on four interrelated components: audience location, audience position, historical context, and duration. I explain these components in pairs. The first pair deals with the listener, and the second pair deals with the work of art, or aesthetic performance, itself.</p>
<p>First, the experience of a performance by an audience is necessary to understand aura. Without the audience the aura goes unnoticed and unread. In his essay, “The Death of the Author,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612471319">Barthes (1977)</xref> emphasizes the importance of the reader to a text and says, “a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination” (p. 148). In other words, the reader or audience plays an integral role in the interpretive act of reading; therefore, the reader is responsible for the interpretation of an aura. There are two important factors to consider regarding the audience. First, the specific location of the audience at the time of the performance must be considered. For example, I am listening to the song in my car, on an iPod, or in the living room. Second, the various subject positions of the contextually situated audience member should be considered. For example, I am a researcher, a musician, a trumpet player, and I can attempt to account for the ways these multiple experiences and perspectives shape my practice of listening.</p>
<p>Next, my interpretation of aura considers the contextual presence of the performance and looks at two categories: historical context and duration. First, understanding the external factors in how the performance is situated historically, socially, and culturally in time and space at the moment of recording provides a framework for interpreting the significance of the performance. Second, the duration of a performance must also be considered. By duration, I am referring to the changes over time that occurs not only to the recording but also to the context within which the recording is experienced. For example, interpretations that add to the performance after it has happened, other critiques of the performance, or new historical moments that filter the interpretation and understanding of the performance. The aura of a performance is an ephemeral attribute, and it highlights and is highlighted by the various interrelated contexts within which the performance occurs. As I try to recover the performance of Davis, my own conception of aura guides my research and my listening.</p>

<title>Writing With Miles Davis</title>
<p>As I write this essay, I find myself listening to “All of You” played by Miles Davis on February 12, 1964, in the Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City. Each time I hear the song, the experience is different, even though the song may be the same. There is always a new or different phrase that catches my attention, or a new or different thought that comes to mind when I hear Miles or any of the other musicians taking solos. As the project unfolds, my excitement for listening to the song builds because with each new piece of information I find, the more complicated the song becomes for me. I do not hear the conflict among the musicians. I do not hear the political overtones of a benefit concert. I do not hear the uncertainty of the evening. I know who will win the 1964 Presidential election. I know how the recording sounds. I know how the critics will respond. But I can imagine what it might have been like to not know.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532708612471319">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>I hear Davis playing with Ron Carter’s bass lines and Tony Williams’s snare drum throughout his first solo. I do not hear conflict in this playing, but I could hear conflict being worked out or worked through. I hear applause at the end of the solo from the audience in the Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center. I do not hear an audience concerned with a civil rights movement or the registration of voters in Mississippi and Louisiana any more than I hear an audience concerned with what was probably a cold February evening in New York City. But I could hear an audience excited to hear Davis, and excited to escape, if only for an evening or even for a moment, the uncertainty of the tenuous political climate in a country where less than 3 months ago the President had been shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>As I type, my computer and I are stereophonically surrounded by the recording of the concert, and my words are creating meaning for the sounds I hear even as I am hearing them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612471319">Sudnow (1993)</xref> systematically describes the ways his hands and body learned to play jazz and improvise on the piano over the course of time. His phenomenological account demonstrates the ways the body learns and acquires skills in order to produce a particular musical style. Sudnow’s descriptions demonstrate the ways the body and musical styles are inseparable. For example, he states, “To <italic>define</italic> jazz (as to define any phenomenon of human action) is to <italic>describe</italic> the body’s ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612471319">Sudnow, 1993</xref>, p. 146). Similarly, my performance of listening for aura in Davis’s recorded performance is an embodied act that emerges through the repetitions and learned practices (as a musician and as a scholar) of my body. The performance I am listening to is changing rapidly and constantly. And it is just as easy for me to get caught up in the frenzy of contextual details surrounding the concert, as it is for me to become distracted by any number of the contextual details surrounding me. It is also just as easy for me to get caught up in the words, structure, and punctuation of my writing, as it is for me to become lost in the pleasure, feeling, and sound of the music.</p>

<title>Listening for Miles Davis</title>
<p>I sit on my living room floor with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612471319">Isacoff’s (1979)</xref> transcription of the solo for “All of You” that is incorrectly titled “All of Me” open in front of me. I select Track 2 on the <italic>My Funny Valentine</italic> album. The applause dies down, and Miles starts playing. I wait for the solo to begin so I can follow along note for note with the transcription. I still have a hard time hearing the beginning of the solo as it is marked on the page, but I usually pick it up in the third bar. Hearing and reading the solo simultaneously mutes the experience of listening to the song, and my concentration on the notation takes away from my presence with the music.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by stacks of papers to grade and articles to read, and I find myself drifting out of the notes on the page and into the music coming through the speakers. I close my eyes and I hear Davis playing. I may as well be in the Philharmonic Hall with my eyes closed. Listening. Feeling. The sound of the muted trumpet becomes softer and then swells into a sustained note. I imagine the conflict, I hear the voices of the critics telling me of the value of this recording, and I see Davis deliberately choosing to place the Harmon mute in the bell of his horn. My perception of the aura of the piece becomes clearer in this moment.</p>
<p>Contexts intertwine and I find myself surrounded by the gaps and spaces. Various markers of myself as researcher and musician are scattered around me as I sit in my home listening to a song and performance come to life. The history of the piece both in the moment of its performance and after its recording shapes my ability to understand the significance of the music. The gaps and spaces that frame my understanding are built from my own research which works to make the performance “real.” Looking or listening inside the mute for the performance, for the aura, for Davis is then always a process of connecting or trying to understand the connections between the singular “me” and the even broader “you.”</p>

Walser offers an explanation of Davis’s playing in terms of Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s work on signifyin’ to explain and critique Miles Davis’s performance of “My Funny Valentine” at the 1964 concert (pp. 345-360). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612471319">Walser (1993</xref>, p. 347) is arguing for a rethinking of meaning and music in terms that do not attempt to “classicize” jazz, or evaluate jazz in terms of classical music and in ways that equate jazz with classical music, especially in scholarly practices. Walser argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>The price of such classicizing formalism is always the loss of affect and history; most jazz analysts and many critics have been modernists willing to make the trade. But Miles Davis, in such terms, would have to be called postmodern. He refused to be constrained by genre boundaries; his music embraced and explored contradictions; he dismissed questions of authenticity or purity; he was unwilling to separate art, life, and politics.

<p>Walser’s arguments regarding music analysis inform my approach to listening to the music performance of Davis, as well as, to my own practices as a musician and researcher.

However, in the picture the stem is clearly not removed from the mute.
