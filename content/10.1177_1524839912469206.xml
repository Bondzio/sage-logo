<abstract>
<p><italic>Public Health for an Aging Society</italic> takes a comprehensive look at promoting physical and mental health in the older population, which is especially important as the cohort of those 65 years and older is rapidly rising. Public Health for an Aging Society builds on an earlier book titled Public Health and Aging (1997), adding new topics of emergency preparedness, technology in aging, environmental influences, health disparities, social and behavioral determinants of health, and the role of social engagement in healthy aging. Using the social–ecological model, the book views how older adults as individuals fit into a larger model of family, community, societal, and environmental levels. The intent of the book is to advance the dialogue, understanding, and collaboration among public health researchers and practitioners, policy makers, and the aging services network.</p>

<p>The baby boom cohort consists of 79 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964. By 2030, one in every five Americans will be aged 65 years and older. The book begins with the acknowledgement that 2011 marked a significant milestone: The nation’s first baby boomers reached 65, the traditional retirement age. This brings new recognition and urgency to the challenge for public health, practitioners, policy makers, and researchers to be more prepared to promote a healthy older population, including supporting their care, managing and preventing diseases, and maintaining both their physical and emotional health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912469206">Fries (1980)</xref> proposes an overall goal of compressing morbidity—pushing back ill health and disability to the latest possible point in a person’s life, with the longer years of life being the healthy years. Others describe successful aging more broadly, adding psychological and cognitive well-being and the ability to remain engaged and productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912469206">Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1998</xref>). These concepts are the focus of this comprehensive 431-page book.</p>
<p>The book is composed of five distinct parts addressing the fundamentals, social and behavioral factors, societal applications, public health infrastructure for an aging society, and emerging issues. It builds on an earlier book titled <italic>Public Health and Aging</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912469206">Hickey, Speers, &amp; Prohaska, 1997</xref>). Topical chapters are written by experts in their field, and authors substantiate their views with information, examples, and recommendations from published research and data. The following paragraphs provide an overview of information included for each topic.</p>
<p><italic>Part I—Fundamentals</italic>: Chapter 1 begins with an overview of public health in the second decade of this century, including fundamental public health models, and introduces current issues being faced by researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. The gap between research and practice is discussed, including strategies and resources to minimize the time to bridge this gap. Chapter 2 acknowledges that the reason for the large number of older adults is an outcome of successful public health interventions of the past century. These successes resulted from achievements in all aspects of public health: clean water, safe food, clean air, infectious disease control, immunizations, screenings, worksite safety, emergency response, health education, policies (e.g., seat belts and child safety seats), among several other factors. This chapter documents that prevention matters up to the oldest ages. Chapter 3 discusses strategies, sources, and mechanisms for financing and organizing health and long-term care services for older populations (including health insurance); the organization of the health care system in the United States; and service delivery. Chapter 4 focuses in great detail on measuring health and quality of life of older populations. Information gathered from surveys and other data analyses can help identify and track health and quality of life and form the basis for planning, organizing, and tracking prevention at all levels—local, state, and national.</p>
<p><italic>Part II—Social and Behavioral Factors</italic>: Chapter 5 focuses on the increased knowledge of social and behavioral determinants of health inequities and health care in old age, and advances in addressing disability and functional limitations. The author discusses ageism as being a social determinant of health care, demonstrated by bias against older adults in health care settings and treatment decisions based on age. Health equity and health disparities are discussed, including how policy changes could reduce health inequities in old age. Chapter 6 looks at disability and functional status, and it discusses models and assessment of disability and aging, including issues related to definitions and assessment. It also describes interventions that have been successful in reducing or delaying disability in some populations, especially related to chronic conditions. Chapter 7 addresses behavioral risk factors and evidence-based interventions. Examples discussed in detail include the prevalence and consequences of physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity and overweight, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. The authors describe different theoretical models that have been shown to address the associated behaviors of these risks, including specific strategies and examples.</p>
<p><italic>Part III—Societal Applications</italic>: Chapter 8 begins by addressing three major movements involving the translation, implementation, and dissemination of evidence-based programs for older adults and the emergence of social engagement and policy successes that improve the public health of older adults. The authors provide eight specific recommendations for enhancing overall impact of programs. They state that with the proliferation of new evidence-based programs, there needs to be a corresponding effort to improve the quality, promote the flexibility, and enhance the public health impact of these programs. Chapter 9 focuses on the critical role of family caregiving of older adults, whose numbers have grown exponentially in the past decade. The authors state that family members have been, are now, and will continue to be the primary providers of care for older adults. They describe demographic transitions, prevalence, characteristics of caregivers, types of care, economic costs, and the public health response. Family caregiving is currently longer in duration and more complex in terms of roles and responsibilities than at any other time in history. Chapter 10 focuses on social engagement and a healthy aging society. The authors start by recognizing that social engagement becomes especially important in the maintenance of physical and mental health of older adults who experience functional limitations, loss of social roles in the workplace and family, and death of friends and partners. They define social engagement, analyze the epidemiological aspects, and detail the salient points related to health outcomes from research. The authors then describe program and policy initiatives to increase social engagement, as well as the role of policy in the prevention of disease, chronic conditions, and disability in older adults. Next, Chapter 11 tackles the broad subject of public health policy successes, beginning with an in-depth discussion of the use of the social–ecological model as a method to guide public health approaches to complex health problems, with interventions at the individual, interpersonal, institutional/organizational, community, and public policy/societal levels. Policy interventions are emphasized as being fundamental to the social–ecological approach. This chapter addresses prevention policy and implementation, and it includes illustrative case studies of public health activities for tobacco, influenza, and immunization. Last, it addresses federal initiatives related to prevention.</p>
<p><italic>Part IV—Public Health Infrastructure for an Aging Society</italic>: This part focuses on the most critical infrastructure concerns today, beginning in Chapter 12 with delineating the increasing importance of technology and aging, including workforce preparedness, and emergency preparedness and response. The author summarizes the challenges posed by the shear increase in numbers of the aging population, combined with the disproportionate level of chronic illness among adult adults, projected shortages in the long-term care workforce, pressures on family caregivers, and rapid increases in the costs of health care. He proposes that this combination requires significant changes in the way health providers address the needs of older adults. There are several emerging technologies that can address these challenges and improve the well-being of older people on both an individual and a systems level. Chapter 13 focuses on the public health workforce, many of whom are trained outside schools of public health, for example, physicians, social workers, and those who play key roles related to older adults. The authors examine the current academic preparation of public health and related professions. Finally, they discuss future directions and offer recommendations, including key competencies of public health personnel related to older adults, and how the major advances in technology will likely improve the health of the older population by reframing how health care will be delivered; how communication will be enhanced between older adults, family caregivers, and service providers; how the health care workforce will be trained; and how older adults access healthcare and services. Chapter 14 focuses on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, especially considering the vulnerability of this population during all phases of disasters and emphasizes the need to make sure that the challenges of older adults are incorporated into disaster plans and responses in both residential settings and nursing homes.</p>
<p><italic>Part V—Emerging Issues</italic>: This part deals with macroecological factors in public health and aging. Chapter 15 explores the association between the built environment and healthy aging. Ecological public health models and gerontological theories underscore the interactive forces of individuals, families, and communities, especially multiple points of interaction with the built environment and how it can affect health behaviors and health outcomes among older populations. One example in this chapter illustrates how physical activity and walking relate to problems of safety and walkability and are especially important in the older adult population who may have limited mobility and safety concerns, resulting in less exercise and deteriorating health and well-being. Chapter 16 looks at the emerging field of genomics information and aging. The authors explore this emerging field, including the potential to prevent disease and promote health by integrating it into public health research, policy, and practice. The authors emphasize the importance between the association of genomics and specific behavioral risk factors. Chapter 17 focuses on public health and aging as global concerns, beginning with a historical perspective on life expectancy increases in the United States and the public health factors that contributed to this increase and comparing these facts with global aging. Chapter 18, the last chapter, examines the effect of political and economic forces in the United States and other nations on the public financial resources for health care for older adults.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are 32 contributors to this impressive book, each an expert in his or her field and chapter topics. The editors state that, given the research-to-practice perspective of the book, it is designed to make a positive contribution to the public health network, the aging services network, policy makers, and clinical practitioners. As pointed out by Linda Fried,
<disp-quote>
<p>There is compelling evidence that public health and health care system approaches designed to benefit the health of older adults will likely benefit all ages. One reason is that communities and systems that can support the needs of the more vulnerable can be beneficial to all. . . . Increased longevity and the aging of society require new public health approaches specific to the prevention and health promotion needs of older adults, but potentially beneficial to people of all ages. They also require re-framing public health approaches at all ages and stages to ensure a life course approach to prevention so that people living longer lives will be healthy into the oldest ages. (p. 48)</p>

</p>
<p><italic>Public Health for an Aging Society</italic> is an extremely well-written, well-researched, and thorough book, with each topic written by experts. In this reviewer’s opinion, it will be extremely useful to researchers, faculty, practitioners, and students alike, with no weaknesses noted.</p>
<p>One of the three editors, Robert H. Binstock, passed away in 2011, shortly before publication. The other two editors express the hope this book will serve to help celebrate his life and acknowledges his many accomplishments in, and profound influence on, the fields of policy and gerontology.</p>
