<body>
<p>During the fifth and sixth weeks of development, the upper lip and alveolus are formed from the fusion of nasal and maxillary prominences. Disruption of the fusion process results in cleft lip, which is one of the most common birth defects in the United States. The reported incidence of cleft lip ranges from 1:500 to 1:1000 births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812474634">1</xref></sup> Individuals born with cleft lip face significant developmental and psychosocial challenges. Thus, timely correction of the defect is essential for improving long-term well-being. In the United States, most children born with cleft lip undergo repair before age 1 year. Management of cleft lip is fairly standard across the nation. Consequently, resource use in primary cleft lip repair should be comparable.</p>
<p>Geographic variation in health care resource use has become a topic of interest to many health care stakeholders in recent years. Over the past 2 decades, the Dartmouth Atlas project has focused on geographic variations in Medicare spending and has revealed significant variations in resource use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812474634">2</xref></sup> The underlying causes of these variations remain partly unexplained. As health care spending continues to rise, it has become imperative to study the factors contributing to regional variations in resource use.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) has gathered the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812474634">3</xref></sup> This has enabled studies on conditions that could not previously be easily studied at the national level.</p>
<p>Given the differing perspectives in the literature on the incidence of cleft lip, this study begins by estimating the incidence of cleft lip in the United States and highlights regional variations in incidence. In addition, regional variations in resource use for primary cleft lip repair are studied, and patient and institutional factors associated with increased resource use are identified and discussed.</p>
<sec id="section6-0194599812474634" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We reviewed admissions records of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of cleft lip from the 2009 Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) provided by the HCUP. The KID is an all-payer nationwide sample of admission records on patients 20 years and younger from 44 states. To protect confidentiality, the KID does not include patient identifiers but contains patient demographics, admission-related data, and information on the type of hospital. As the KID is a public, national database made up of de-identified data, this study was exempt from institutional review board approval.</p>
<p>To estimate the national incidence of cleft lip, the KID was queried using the diagnostic code for in-hospital birth to identify a data set of all newborns. The newborn data set was queried using the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) codes: 74910 to 74914 and 74920 to 74925 codes were used to identify patients with diagnoses of cleft lip. The national incidence was estimated from the proportion of newborns with cleft lip.</p>
<p>Our analysis for resource use in primary cleft lip repair was limited to patients aged 1 year and younger, given that primary cleft lip repair is typically performed prior to age 1 year. A data set of patients with a primary admitting diagnosis of cleft lip and a primary procedure of cleft lip repair (procedure code 2754) was selected for analysis of resource utilization.</p>
<p>Hospitals from 44 states across the United States are included in the 2009 KID database. The hospitals are stratified into 4 geographic regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. To estimate regional incidence of cleft lip, the newborn data set was grouped by region and incidence estimation performed on each region.</p>
<p>The KID provides data on total hospital charge for each patient. The total charge recorded does not include professional fees. Similar to other HCUP studies, total charge is used as a proxy for resource utilization in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812474634">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812474634"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812474634">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Multiple patient and hospital variables were included in our analysis as potential predictors of increased resource use. Hospitals are categorized into 2 groups: teaching and nonteaching. A hospital that is categorized as teaching meets the following criteria: has an American Medical Association–approved residency program, is a member of the Council of Teaching Hospitals, or has a resident to bed ratio of 0.25 or higher. Hospitals are also designated as children’s hospitals based on information provided by the National Association of Children’s Hospitals and Related Institutions. Children’s hospitals are further categorized as children’s general hospitals, children’s specialty hospitals, and children’s unit in a general hospital.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is based on quartile classification of the estimated median household income in the patient’s zip code. The first quartile has a median income of $39,999 and below, the second quartile ranges from $40,000 to $49,999, the third quartile is between $50,000 and $65,999, and the fourth quartile features households with income greater than $65,999.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812474634">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Student <italic>t</italic> test was performed to compare mean charges and mean length of stay (LOS) between teaching and nonteaching hospitals, as well as children’s hospitals and nonchildren’s hospitals. Analysis of variance was performed to compare mean LOS and mean charges between hospital regions and patients’ socioeconomic status. Linear regression analysis was performed using variables suspected to contribute to total charge. Variables included in the regression model were age, sex, LOS, hospital region, hospital type (teaching, nonteaching, and children’s hospital), and number of chronic conditions at the time of surgery. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the estimated 3,989,527 in-hospital births in 2009, 3490 infants were born with cleft lip. Based on this outcome, the national estimated incidence of cleft lip is 0.09%. The incidence rate was higher in males at 0.11% (n = 2199) compared with females (0.07%; n = 1287), resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.8:1. There were regional variations in the incidence rate, with the highest being 0.10% (West) and the lowest 0.07% (Northeast) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cleft lip remains one of the most common birth defects in the United States. Our analysis reveals an estimated 0.09% incidence rate, which is approximately 1 in 1100 births. The previously known male preponderance is also supported by our data with a male to female ratio of 1.8:1.</p>
<p>Among the 4 regions, the West had the highest number of cleft repair cases. According to the 2010 US census data, the West represents only 23% of the US population, but 44% of cleft repair cases were performed in the West<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812474634">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812474634"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). The incidence of cleft lip varies by ethnicity and is highest in Asian and Native Americans and lowest in African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812474634">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812474634"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812474634"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812474634">11</xref></sup> Clustering of certain ethnic groups in the West may partially account for the slightly higher regional incidence rate and higher number of cleft lip repair cases. In addition, out-of-region residents, including residents from Alaska and parts of Canada, may receive cleft lip care in the West, which will contribute to higher numbers.</p>
<p>Children born with cleft lip often have additional impairments and are best treated in a multidisciplinary team setting. Most cleft teams are associated with teaching hospitals; this explains the disproportionate distribution of cleft lip repair cases between teaching and nonteaching hospitals.</p>
<p>The higher charge associated with teaching hospitals is a fact that has been established by prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812474634">12</xref></sup> In primary cleft lip repair, one can argue that this is contributed to by longer operating room times for teaching trainees during procedures. It would be interesting to determine whether procedure times differ between teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Recent studies have shown lower complication rates in cleft lip repair at teaching hospitals compared with nonteaching hospitals. Lower complication rates amount to cost savings in the long term and partly justify higher charges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812474634">4</xref></sup> Although LOS was the strongest predictor of charge, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean LOS of teaching and nonteaching hospitals (<italic>P</italic> = .40).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the region with the shortest LOS (West) had the highest charge, whereas the region with the longest LOS (South) had the lowest charge. This indicates that region-specific factors that contribute to total charge were not identified in our analysis. Perhaps regional differences in the cost of materials, renting office facilities, and cost of living factor into total charge. Western states such as California have a higher cost of living index compared with states such as Texas in the South.</p>
<p>Patients’ socioeconomic status was not predictive of charge. However, age, sex, type of cleft, and multiple chronic conditions were predictive. Charge for bilateral cleft lip repair was higher than unilateral cleft lip repair. Patients who had more than 3 chronic conditions at the time of surgery had higher charges compared with those with fewer than 3 conditions.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>These results should be viewed with the knowledge that the KID 2009 is only a sample of discharge records of pediatric hospitalizations, albeit a highly representative one. The accuracy of KID data is dependent on accurate coding of the inpatient admission information.</p>
<p>Although our use of hospital total charge as a proxy for estimating resource utilization is a logical one, it is important to note that hospital charging structures are complex and may vary from institution to institution. As a result, total charge may not accurately reflect full costs or capture institution-specific factors. Furthermore, reimbursement, which is a better marker of resource use, is often a fraction of the total hospital charge.</p>
<p>The KID does not include outpatient procedures. Outpatient cleft lip repair will be expected to cost much less than inpatient repairs given the high predictive value of LOS on total charge.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our analyses do provide some insights into some of the factors associated with resource utilization in the repair of a common birth defect.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that regional variations exist in resource use for cleft lip repair. States in the West charge higher than their Southern counterparts. Of all admissions, the strongest predictor of high resource utilization was LOS. Studies accounting for regional differences in cost of living may provide a more realistic measure of resource use.</p>
