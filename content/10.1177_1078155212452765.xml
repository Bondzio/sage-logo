<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Evaluation of doxorubicin stability over time when stored into the DC Bead embolic agent, in various containers, which are used for the delivery of the doxorubicin-loaded beads to the patients for up to 14 days under refrigerated conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The doxorubicin was loaded through the ionic exchange mechanism into the calibrated polyvinyl alcohol-based hydrogel beads (DC Bead), with the loading process carried out either in the original DC Bead glass vials or within a polypropylene plastic syringe. The loaded samples were eluted at given time points and the extracted doxorubicin was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography for concentration and chromatographic area response purity.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The variance on the doxorubicin concentration of the samples stored in the syringes under refrigerated conditions was less than 10% over the 14 days period. The chromatographic purity of doxorubicin eluted from the DC Bead in their primary glass vial packaging was measured at 99.7%. The dissolution test showed that the elution rate and amount recovered from samples stored in vials were statistically similar between Day 0 and Day 14. The chromatographic purity of the doxorubicin loaded into DC Bead in presence of non-ionic contrast medium was &gt;99.0% for 7 days under refrigerated conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead® are shown to have adequate physicochemical stability over a period of 14 days when stored in syringes or vials under refrigerated conditions for up to 14 days. The admixtures of doxorubicin-loaded beads with contrast medium are stable for up to 7 days under refrigerated conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1078155212452765" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has found widespread use as a locoregional therapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable primary or metastatic liver cancer. TACE has been demonstrated by two groups working independently to provide significant clinical benefit compared to palliative care for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212452765">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212452765">2</xref></sup> More recently there has been a move towards the use of drug-eluting beads (DEB) for TACE, whereby drug and embolisation device are combined and delivered in one-step rather than in series. DC Bead® are calibrated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogel beads with the ability to load and release cationic drugs such as salts of the anthracycline chemotherapeutics. High doses of these drugs can be loaded into the beads in a reproducible manner and elute in a controlled fashion over an extended period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212452765">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212452765"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212452765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212452765">6</xref></sup> This ability translates into a reduced systemic exposure to the drug in vivo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212452765">7</xref></sup> which has been confirmed in humans by pharmacokinetic evaluations performed during two parallel Phase I/II studies conducted at the Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer (PRECISION I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212452765">8</xref></sup> and the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong (PRECISION II).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212452765">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, several subsequent clinical studies have confirmed the benefits of DC Bead with respect to improved tumour response and reduced adverse events;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212452765">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212452765"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212452765"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212452765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212452765">14</xref></sup> this includes a recent Phase II randomised study that demonstrated significant benefit for patients with more advanced disease treated with DC Bead compared to conventional TACE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212452765">15</xref></sup> Thus, DC Bead is providing clinicians with a reproducible system for local treatment of tumours with the added flexibility of choice over beads size, drug type and dose and administration technique (e.g. super-selective or regional delivery, to complete stasis or low flow). There have also been several studies reported on the use of DC Bead for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer of the liver,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212452765">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212452765">17</xref></sup> cholangiocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212452765">18</xref></sup> and neuroendocrine metastases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212452765">19</xref></sup> with studies in evaluation in other atypical metastases such as breast, pancreatic, sarcoma and ocular ongoing.</p>
<p>In a typical treatment of a patient with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the hospital pharmacy will load the drug into DC Bead some hours or a day prior to the TACE procedure. This is achieved by making a solution of the drug in water-for-injection to the desired concentration and then injecting this into the vial containing a slurry of DC Bead from which the packing solution has been removed. Depending upon the bead size range selected, the drug will be taken up into the beads between 30 min and 2 h (small beads loading more quickly due to surface area effects). The maximum drug loading capacity is controlled by the number of drug-binding sites in the beads and the maximum dose achievable is thus dependent upon drug molecular mass; hence, a 2 mL vial of DC Bead will load a recommended maximum of 75 mg of doxorubicin, epirubicin or daunorubicin for instance, or 100 mg of irinotecan. In the treatment of HCC, although somewhat dependent upon tumour size and number, it is generally accepted that typically up to 4 mL (2 vials) of drug-loaded DC Bead should be prepared prior to the procedure, allowing a maximum administered dose of 150 mg if all the volume can be delivered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212452765">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212452765">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212452765">15</xref></sup> In some instances, an entire vial of the loaded product is not used during the procedure and in others the procedure may be delayed with the vials of DC Bead already prepared. There is therefore an opportunity to assess the long-term stability of DC Bead loaded with the anthracycline drug in order to determine if there is an option to store the drug-loaded product for a period of time after preparation for its use in a subsequent procedure. A similar investigation has been reported by Kaiser et al. for irinotecan-loaded DC Bead, which found the combined product could be stored for at least 28 days at room temperature if protected from light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212452765">20</xref></sup> In this study, we report on a similar high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) evaluation of the 14-day chemical stability of doxorubicin loaded into DC Bead.</p>
<p>An extensive literature survey showed that the stability of doxorubicin is well documented. Studies of drug stability have been carried out under various storage conditions and in a variety of media. Solutions of doxorubicin at 1 and 2 mg/mL were determined to retain 90% of their original concentrations for up to 124 days when stored in syringes and glass vials at 4°C and 23°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212452765">21</xref></sup> In other studies investigating this anthracycline antitumor agent under more specific conditions, such as infusion fluids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212452765">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212452765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155212452765">24</xref></sup> doxorubicin was shown to be stable for up to 28 days. The stability and compatibility of doxorubicin with different types of containers such as plastic syringes and glass vials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212452765">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212452765">26</xref></sup> as well as infusion bags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212452765">27</xref></sup> or devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212452765">28</xref></sup> were demonstrated in a range of media, including water for injection, saline and 5% dextrose or glucose solutions for at least 48 h.</p>
<p>The DC Bead is supplied in 10 mL glass vials and is administered through a microcatheter via the use of a syringe. The primary objective was to demonstrate that the drug manipulation and handling to perform the preparation of the DEB with one of the most commonly used therapeutic agent in the treatment of HCC by chemoembolisation, doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212452765">Figure 1</xref>), did not provoke rapid degradation of the drug compound. The loading of the drug into the beads can be performed equally well within the DC Bead glass vial or when transferred into plastic syringes. Doxorubicin is supplied as a hydrochlorate salt to aid solubility, which can be loaded into the beads using an ionic exchange process between the protonated primary amine on the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212452765">Figure 1</xref>) and the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the PVA hydrogel beads. For that intent, the stability of the drug loaded into DC Bead was assessed at different stages of the product preparation. These stages include the loading stage into the DC Bead and the storage of the prepared product in the injection mixture, which is composed of a suspension of the doxorubicin-loaded beads in a mixture of aqueous solution with a small residual content of unloaded doxorubicin and a contrast agent. These evaluations were performed under various storage conditions, using the doxorubicin and DC Bead product combination in a syringe, as ready for delivery, or in the DC Bead primary packaging consisting of a 10 mL borosilicate vial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155212452765">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>In these evaluations, the stability was assessed by HPLC to determine the concentrations of doxorubicin extracted from the loaded DC Bead and compare the recovery values over the 14-day evaluation period. In the case of the samples stored in the 10 mL glass vials, the doxorubicin stability was also performed by tracking the evolution of the percentage chromatographic area responses of the doxorubicin, known and unknown impurity peaks over the course of the evaluation as well as by comparing statistically the elution rate of doxorubicin between the initial time point and up to the 14 days time point. A final evaluation of the stability of doxorubicin loaded into DC Bead was performed for up to 7 days in presence of a non-ionic contrast medium that is commonly used for the delivery of the beads.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155212452765"><title>Evaluation 1: Doxorubicin stability when loaded into DC Bead in a syringe</title>
<p>A first evaluation was performed by loading doxorubicin into DC Bead vials (nominal diameter of the bead: 500–700 µm) containing 2 mL of beads in 6 mL of saline. The stability of the anthracycline antitumor agent was assessed by measuring the concentrations between the day of preparation (Day 0) and the determined concentrations after 7 and 14 days, and comparing the three sets of data for statistically significant variation.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212452765"><title>Preparation of the syringes</title>
<p>The loading solution was a 2 mg/mL doxorubicin aqueous solution, with a total volume of 25 mL. It was prepared by reconstituting 1 flask of 50 mg dried doxorubicin (Adriablastin, Pfizer, Germany, Lot CI30E) with 25 mL of water for irrigation (B Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The beads were transferred into a 30 mL syringe (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium). The supernatant saline solution was then expelled from the syringe with the help of a 18 G filter needle (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium). The syringe containing the beads was then used to aspirate the 25 mL of doxorubicin solution (2 mg/mL). A total of nine syringes were prepared according to this process. The syringes were then placed on a roller-mixer (Rotary Mixer<sup>R</sup>, Labinco, Breda, The Netherlands) to generate a gentle agitation for 12 h to facilitate the loading step. At the end of the loading stage, more than half the volume of the depleted doxorubicin solution was expelled, keeping approximately 10 mL of liquid within the syringe. Three syringes were tested after the loading was completed and all remaining syringes were then placed in controlled refrigerated conditions for up to 14 days, with three syringes evaluated at the 7 days time point and the last three syringes tested at the 14 days time point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212452765"><title>Extraction of the doxorubicin from the loaded beads</title>
<p>The day prior to the analysis, an extraction medium was prepared by mixing a 1 L of 20% w/v KCl (Fisher Scientific, UK) aqueous solution with a litre of Absolute Ethanol (Romil, UK). The solution was thoroughly mixed and excess KCl was left to precipitate before filtration.</p>
<p>The supernatant was removed and kept for further dose assay of the depleted solution to determine the doxorubicin dose loaded into the beads. The residual volume of approximately 3–4 mL loaded bead slurry in the syringes was then transferred into a conical flask containing 500 mL ± 1 mL of the extraction medium. The extraction of doxorubicin from the beads was performed by magnetic stirring for 7 h. Once the extraction was completed, an aliquot from the supernatant was taken and diluted in 1:1 ratio with physiological water in a volumetric flask in triplicate for analysis by HPLC equipped with a Diode Array Detector (DAD) with the extraction channel set at 484 nm. Consequently, at each time point there were three syringes from which nine diluted solutions were prepared to be injected in triplicate, resulting in 27 readings in total.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155212452765"><title>Determination of loaded and extracted dose</title>
<p>The doxorubicin uptake was determined by testing the supernatant that was composed of the depleted solution of doxorubicin by spectro-photometry at 483 nm against a four-point calibration curve prepared from a doxorubicin stock solution at 2 mg/mL by serial dilution to obtain 2, 20, 40 and 100 µg/mL concentration range. The total loaded amount was then deduced from the total amount transferred into the syringe and the concentration and volume of the supernatant after loading.</p>
<p>The analysis of the extracted doxorubicin was performed by HPLC (Waters Alliance model 2690) equipped with a DAD (996 detector, Waters) set at 484 nm. Overall, 10 µL of each diluted aliquot was injected in triplicate at 10°C onto a 100 Å C18, 5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm Waters Symmetry Column equipped with a Waters Sentry Guard Column and incubated at 30°C using a mobile phase composed of an aqueous solution of 0.05 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (Merck) buffered at pH 4.15 with 30% acetonitrile (Mallinckrodt Baker) with a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min for 15 min and the data were collected and analysed by the Empower Chromatography Manager System (Waters). The method was shown to be linear from 3 to 100 µg/mL with a squared coefficient of regression equal to 0.9989 and a two-point standard calibration linear through zero using 20 and 100 µg/mL doxorubicin solution was performed before sample injections.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1078155212452765"><title>Evaluation 2</title>
<sec id="sec8-1078155212452765"><title>Doxorubicin stability when loaded into DC Bead in a vial in presence of saline</title>
<p>Preparation of doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead was under laboratory conditions, but simulated the critical processes likely to occur during preparation in a hospital pharmacy and which may affect the product stability. Overall, 75 mg of doxorubicin was transferred in to each vial of DC Bead (n = 6, nominal diameter of the bead: 500–700 µm) containing 2 mL of beads and 6 mL of saline solution. This size range is also considered to be indicative of the stability in other size ranges of DC Bead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1078155212452765"><title>Preparation of the vials</title>
<p>A stock loading solution of a 25 mg/mL doxorubicin aqueous solution prepared by reconstituting each vial of 50 mg dried doxorubicin (TEVA, Haarlem, The Netherlands, Lot 09023QA, &gt;99% purity) with 2 mL of water for irrigation. The reconstituted doxorubicin solutions were combined to form one stock solution. A nominal 2 mL volume of DC Bead was dispensed into the vials and the packing solution was removed from each vial of DC Bead using an 18 G needle ensuring that no beads were aspirated from the vial. Using a clean needle, 3 mL of doxorubicin solution (75 mg) was aspirated into each vial of DC Bead. The mixture was allowed to load for a minimum of 2 h (with occasional agitation) and then stored in the drug supernatant solution for a minimum of 14 days at 2–8°C. During the loading process, aliquots of the drug supernatant solution were tested to determine the drug uptake profile. Six samples were tested for dose and purity at the initial time point and after 14 days storage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1078155212452765"><title>Determination of loaded and extracted doxorubicin dose</title>
<p>An extraction medium was prepared as previously described (section 3.1.2). The loaded beads (n = 3 vials) were extracted by agitation for 7 h in the extraction medium, following which the supernatant sample was prepared for HPLC analysis by dilution (1:1) with extraction medium. The uptake of doxorubicin into DC Bead was determined by testing using UV spectrometry (9000 series spectrophotometer, Cecil) the amount of doxorubicin remaining in the drug solution supernatant and calculation of the amount loaded based on the depleted concentration. The purity of the doxorubicin extracted from the loaded beads was determined by HPLC (Waters 2695 Alliance) equipped with a UV detector set at 254 nm wavelength. Overall, 20 µL of the sample was injected onto a Waters Spherisorb column, S5 C1, 5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm using an isocratic mobile phase comprising an aqueous solution of 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (Fisher Scientific), acetonitrile (Romil), methanol (Romil) and 0.2% (w/v) phosphoric acid (Fisher Scientific) buffered at pH 3.6 with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The level of impurities was determined as a percentage of the chromatographic area and all impurities identified were reported. Doxorubicin standard solutions at a concentration of approximately 80 µg/mL were prepared in the extraction media and were employed for quantification purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1078155212452765"><title>In vitro elution of the doxorubicin loaded beads</title>
<p>Three samples of doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead were eluted in 900 mL of an aqueous potassium chloride (20% wv) and ethanol mixture in a closed loop system using a USP II type dissolution batch (Caleva 8ST) at Day 0 and Day 14. The amount of doxorubicin eluted from the beads was detected using an online UV/Visible spectrometer at a wavelength of 483 nm. The analyte was quantified using a standard prepared at a nominal concentration of 50 µg/mL. This in vitro elution model is a forced extraction of the doxorubicin to ensure a complete elution of the drug within 7 h and is employed to evaluate and compare the release characteristics of the DC Bead over time.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1078155212452765"><title>Evaluation 3</title>
<sec id="sec13-1078155212452765"><title>Stability of doxorubicin-loaded into DC Bead in non-ionic contrast agent</title>
<p>Two sets of samples were prepared for this evaluation; one set evaluating the stability in a mixture with non-ionic contrast agent and the depleted aqueous doxorubicin solution used for loading, the other also in presence of non-ionic contrast agents where the depleted solution was replaced by 0.9% saline.</p>
<p>An equal volume of a representative non-ionic contrast agent (Omnipaque 350, GE Healthcare) was added to the drug supernatant solution of the doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead contained in their primary vial packaging (Set 1, n = 3 per size range). Samples were also prepared in the presence of 0.9% saline solution to evaluate its impact to doxorubicin purity (Set 2, n = 3 per size range). These sample mixtures were stored at 2–8°C for a minimum of 7 days. Aliquots of the supernatant solution were removed for HPLC analysis at 0 and 7 days time points to assess the drug purity of the solution only. The sample mixture (including beads) was then extracted at these intervals using an aqueous potassium chloride and ethanol mixture (see previous section) for evaluation of the doxorubicin purity of the drug loaded within the beads. Aliquots of this extracted solution were removed for HPLC analysis using the method previously described and the level of impurities determined as a percentage of the chromatographic area. Various nominal diameters of the bead were used for this experiment: 100–300 µm, 300–500 µm and 500–700 µm.</p>

<p>No increase in the overall level of impurities was observed after the doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead was stored at 2–8°C for 14 days. A small increase from 0.05% to 0.08% was observed in the level of the known doxorubicinone impurity but was below 0.1% of the sum of peak areas.</p>
<p>The in vitro elution profiles for doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead after initial loading and 14 days storage at 2–8°C were assessed to determine if the doxorubicin could be fully released from the beads.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1078155212452765">Figure 6</xref> shows that more than 90% of the expected 75 mg doxorubicin dose was eluted from the beads stored at 2–8°C for 14 days with an average recovered dose of 69.2 ± 0.8 mg (n = 3) and the beads tested immediately after drug loading when an average of 66.9 ± 0.3 mg (n = 3). The discrepancy from the target dose is attributed to operational and handling error as some beads may have been lost during the transfer into the dissolution vessel. The in vitro elution profiles for the doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead stored at 2–8°C for 14 days elute over the same time frame and with a similar elution profile as the non-stored samples.

<p>Visual assessment of the eluted beads using an optical microscope demonstrated that no residual doxorubicin could be observed within the beads following the in vitro elution test and is therefore not held irreversibly within the bead structure.

<p>The results show that the doxorubicin eluted from the samples has a chromatographic purity of greater than 99%. This indicates that DC Bead loaded with doxorubicin can be stored in the injection mixture (containing Omnipaque 350) at 2–8°C for 7 days.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1078155212452765" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>DC Bead loaded with doxorubicin can be stored in a glass vial or in a plastic syringe at 2–8°C for 14 days with no detrimental impact on the doxorubicin dose released and eluted from the beads and no increase in the level of chromatographic impurities. The in vitro elution profile using the model previously defined shows that the release of the doxorubicin from samples stored for 14 days at 2–8°C is statistically equivalent to samples eluted immediately after loading. Storage at this condition does not impair the release characteristics of the DC Bead.</p>
<p>Doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead in the presence of the non-ionic contrast agent (Omnipaque 350, GE Healthcare) was determined to be stable over a 7 days duration. The drug-loaded beads are expected to be stable in the presence of other non-ionic contrast agents but determination of this was beyond the scope of this evaluation.</p>
