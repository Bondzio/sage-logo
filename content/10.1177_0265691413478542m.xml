<p>Just when we had become accustomed to viewing the Italian Fascist regime in the soft focus of its consensual and consent-building cultural policies and its version of aestheticized politics, along comes this excellent book, in which Michael Ebner reminds us of what we had apparently forgotten: that Mussolini headed a repressive totalitarian dictatorship. The book’s demonstration that ‘violence was at the heart of the regime’s ideology and methods’ (265) adds significant firepower to the salutary counter-offensive initiated by the work of Richard Bosworth and Paul Corner against the ‘cultural turn’ in recent Fascist studies, which has concentrated on Fascist culture and Fascism as culture.</p>
<p>Not that the form, alignment or tone of the book are overtly contentious or polemical. The book’s thesis is underpinned by a careful reading of a sample of the voluminous Interior Ministry police files, with a particular focus on reconstructing the stories of those ‘ordinary’ Italians who were interned by the regime as its political, moral and racial enemies. The internment camps and places of internal exile to which the regime consigned about forty to sixty thousand individuals between 1926 and 1943, were the most visible manifestation of a vast and ramified system of repression which affected the lives of tens of thousands of other Italians. This is the real strength and originality of the book, the indication that there evolved, in effect, a sophisticated and intelligent system of ‘terror’, which was not indiscriminate, but highly effective precisely because of its refinement into low level, localized, everyday harassment and intimidation of many Italians, who were made very aware that they were living in a police state, and adjusted their conduct and behaviour in order to conform, and so survive in such a system.</p>
<p>Even after the formal subordination of party to state and the dismantling of squadrist Fascism in the late 1920s, squadrist-style violence persisted and was condoned, with the Fascist Party and Militia acting as coercive agencies of the police state. But such violence was just an element of a routinized and habitual police repression, the intensity of which varied according to social class, region and locality. It targeted Italian workers in both town and countryside, as well as socially marginal and vulnerable groups, including drunks, the workshy, homosexuals, vagrants, and indeed, anybody whose anti-social behaviour was deemed to have offended Mussolini, the regime, and Fascist values and norms of conduct. This system of terror made complicit many more Italians than those directly hit by police measures against them, as ordinary people learned to navigate and survive the repressiveness bearing down on their lives, by mouthing the rhetoric and slogans of Fascism, outwardly conforming, and demonstrating that conformity by informing on and denouncing others: ‘to remain silent was to risk punishment’ (245). The insidious, capillary spread of repression can give us some sense of the growing reach of the Fascist regime in the 1930s, and of the kind of coerced and external consent which the Fascist totalitarian state was capable of mobilizing. This was probably far short of the willed enthusiasm of the religious convert which the regime aspired to generate, and which the cultural interpretations of Fascism tend to assume came into being as a result of the regime’s propagandizing and organizing efforts.</p>
<p>The synthesizers among us need to find a way of bringing together the twinned dimensions of the Fascist totalitarian system, repression and the ‘manufacture of consent’, the paradoxical essence of totalitarianism. The book takes us some way along this path, arguing that police repression, marked by both capricious and predictable violence, was, in itself, intended to be transforming and ‘educational’, and an integral stage in the formation of the ‘new Fascist man’. Police repression not only instructed Italians about what kinds of behaviour were acceptable and unacceptable to the regime; but it also setting one Italian against another, and making them complicit in that repression, fostered the harsh and ruthless attributes which Italians would need to fight and win wars, and to conquer and rule an empire.</p>
