<abstract>
<p>Immigration comes with potential for increased opportunities but poses multifarious challenges to social integration. The local perception that immigration is unsustainable fuels identity threats that lead to surges in nationalism rather than multiculturalism. This paper reports three case studies of Maltese migrants to the UK. Adopting the migrants’ points of view, the paper documents how acculturation takes shape in a situation where immigrants face a social reality in which their own cultural point of view is that of a stranger. This furthers the study of points of view in cultural psychology by reconciling this focus with the socio-cognitive literature on perspectives and their relative propensity to interrelate. The form acculturation takes for individual migrants is demonstrated to be associated with the perspectives immigrants demonstrate and the extent to which they interrelate with cultural diversity.</p>

<p>The migratory movement of people in search of opportunities in near or distant lands is a matter of antiquity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X11434837">Chryssochoou, 2004</xref>), yet the integration of immigrants remains today a challenge to social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X11434837">Farrell &amp; Oliveri, 2006</xref>). Difficulties in social relations persist even when migration occurs as a function of reciprocal international relations, such as within the confines of the EU. EU member states enjoy the internal market’s four freedoms that guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services and people. Whilst in principle this seems to be an equitable transaction, the local perception that nations are inundated with unsustainable immigration is perpetuated by the reality that rises in immigration are relatively compounded by emigration. This realisation precipitates identity threats that lead to surges in nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354067X11434837">Moghaddam, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The present paper reports a case study of reciprocal rights migration. Britain has become a prime destination for Maltese migrants following Malta’s accession into the EU in 2004. Conversely, a number of British citizens chose to retire in Malta following accession. In understanding this social reality, this study adopts a novel focus for cultural psychology that has been pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354067X11434837">Moghaddam’s (2006)</xref> work on terrorists. This study adopts the immigrants’ point of view to investigate how, in a situation where immigrants face an alien social reality in which their own point of view is that of a stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354067X11434837">Schuetz, 1944</xref>), acculturation processes take shape. This provides a development over traditional acculturation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X11434837">Berry, 2011</xref>) in detailing outcomes in terms of reciprocal relations over mere preferences. Moreover, this paper furthers Moghaddam’s contribution by reconciling the empirical focus on points of view with the socio-cognitive literature on perspectives that has delineated three characteristic types, based on the relative propensity of perspectives to interrelate with others. This paper argues that the form acculturation takes for the individual migrant is associated with the perspectives migrants demonstrate and their relative propensity to relate with others.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1354067X11434837"><title>The study of points of view</title>
<p>Whilst much contemporary research utilises the concept of having a perspective, or point of view, and relating to others on the basis of this cognitive operant, the prevailing trend in much research is a focus on perspective-taking as a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X11434837">Gillespie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X11434837">Gillespie &amp; Richardson, 2011</xref>), or on the motivation for closure that inhibits perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354067X11434837">Kruglanski, 2004</xref>). This focus is laudable, and one that psychology has for a long time overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354067X11434837">Peacock &amp; Holland, 1993</xref>). Nevertheless, the consideration of points of view as variable psychological phenomena that demonstrate relatively stable characteristics is equally informative and complementary to contemporary research on perspective-taking, as it offers an understanding of variable socio-cognitive characteristics that may foster or impede social relations. This is critical in understanding how cultural behaviours, customs and practices are structured by systems of knowledge that validate some points of view against others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X11434837">Jovchelovitch, 2007</xref>). Amidst social representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X11434837">Chyrissides et al. 2009</xref>), different individuals adopt different social positions that afford them different points of view within the same social firmament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434837">Clémence, 2001</xref>). Understanding the local practices of human subjects, therefore, requires an understanding of social facts beyond their collective meaning as social representations for a given people, and from the point of view of particular subjects that act within these collectives.</p>
<p>This aim was explicitly adopted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354067X11434837">Moghaddam’s (2006)</xref> work on terrorists, where a contrast is drawn between the understanding of terrorism from the point of view of civilians, victims, journalists, soldiers, politicians, lay people and terrorists themselves. Moghaddam argues that adopting this empirical focus and understanding the reasons and justifications that legitimate terrorism from the terrorists’ own point of view enables a deep understanding of underlying concerns and motives, which provide the best way to combat terrorism. Moghaddam argues that whilst in everyday terms terrorist acts appear irrational, immoral and even pathological to the terrorists themselves, this behaviour is reasonable given the circumstances. Moghaddam goes on to unfurl five circumstantial layers that he terms the staircase to terrorism, that justify the progression of an individual from one layer of discontent to another, which by the end sees an ordinary person transform into a deadly terrorist.</p>
<p>Moghaddam’s work is creditable in demonstrating that overcoming the threat of terrorism requires a sensitivity to the cultural context of its production, as well as a specific focus on particular points of view within wider social representations. Moreover, Moghaddam’s work provides further insight into the merits of an empirical focus on points of view, outlining how this provides layers of understanding into the justification of culturally reasonable social behaviour. LeVine has equally argued for studying “points of view” that seek “to reconstruct the perspectives of the actors involved in a particular field of activity and social life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354067X11434837">2010</xref>, p. 458).</p>
<p>The concerns outlined by Moghaddam and LeVine resonate with those of other sociocultural theorists that have similarly called for a deep understanding of social relations. The recognition that certain communities may espouse different perspectives based on different systems of knowledge poses an obligation for conscientisation and opens potential for dialogical relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X11434837">Gillespie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X11434837">Jovchelovitch, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354067X11434837">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354067X11434837">Marková, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354067X11434837">2003b</xref>). In inquiring into the relations between communities or social representations, much focus has been directed towards perspective-taking as a process. For instance, how do tourists adopt the perspective of locals when they interact with them, and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X11434837">Gillespie, 2006</xref>)? Such deep understanding of localized practices, however, can be complemented by an analysis of the point of view phenomenon itself. Not all points of view are equally predisposed to adopt the perspective of the other. Some individuals motivated by a strong need for closure adopt closed-minded points of view that fail in the very process of perspective-taking. Consequently, as this paper demonstrates, such variable standpoints bear markedly on the social interactions that ensue contact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1354067X11434837"><title>Points of view and the variable propensity for relating with an alternative</title>
<p>The psychological study of points of view as a phenomenon can be traced to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354067X11434837">Rokeach’s (1951a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354067X11434837">1951b</xref>) works on closed-mindedness and has been preserved in studies of social judgment. Rokeach identified three types of cognitive organisation that characterize human cognition, based on the extent to which subjects could relate disparate information. Perspectives were classified as comprehensive if they could relate an entire series of constructs, isolated if they compartmentalized the series, and closed-minded if unable to relate the whole sequence. Rokeach argued that the difference between types is a qualitative one and based on the variable propensity of systems to relate with other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354067X11434837">Krech, 1949</xref>). The same typology was documented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354067X11434837">Pettigrew’s (1959)</xref> psychophysical studies, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434837">Detweiler’s (1980)</xref> intercultural studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434837">Detweiler (1980)</xref> demonstrated how the more open-minded make less negative inferences about culturally different others. More recently, we have documented the same three types of perspectives in our studies of atheism and religious belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354067X11434837">Sammut &amp; Gaskell, 2010</xref>). We termed these points of view monological, dialogical, and metalogical, according to the variable capacity of a perspective to consider the relative underlying logic of an alternative.</p>
<p>Monological points of view fail to understand that another subject may have a different point of view from their own. Their view is regarded exclusively as the solely reasonable view on the issue. Dialogical points of view understand that there can be a multiplicity of views on any given issue, however, these points of view are limited in perspective-taking capacities and reserve an uncritical logic for their views to which other points of view are subjected in assessing their eligibility for dialogue. Metalogical points of view, on the other hand, demonstrated epistemic scepticism both with regards to their own perspectives as well as those of others. Consequently, they held that their own perspectives were relative as much as others’, and that others’ points of view were legitimate in their own right. This recognition engaged their interest and sensitised them to the cultural legitimacy that informed the other’s perspective. They related to this inherent, higher-order rationale, rather than to the expressed content of the other’s beliefs. Their points of view were thus metalogical and able to consider the relative validity of cultural systems of knowledge. They demonstrated an unbounded ability to relate to the perspective of another.</p>
<p>The variable capacity to understand that individuals can see the same things differently has been subjected to experimental investigation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354067X11434837">Gruber (1990)</xref>, whose findings further support the three-part typology of perspectives detailed above. In his shadow-box experiments, Gruber subjected participants to shadows that were cast in front of them when a light was turned on. These shadows differed from ones cast in front of collaborators standing at different locations relative to the object. The findings demonstrate that certain individuals are unable to realise that the same object can cast completely different shadows (e.g., a cone casting a circular shadow and a triangular shadow simultaneously). Other subjects correctly identified objects that could cast both shadows perceived by the two participants and thus resolved the perceptive paradox. Yet other subjects were able to generate further explanations for the shadows perceived, beyond a single satisfactory answer (e.g., other object configurations that could cast similar shadows).</p>
<p>The findings map onto the three point of view types that we, as well as others, have documented (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354067X11434837">Tsirogianni &amp; Andreouli, 2011</xref>). In view of the fact that the distinction between types hinges on the ability to relate to a view that differs from one’s own, these findings warrant specific application to the intercultural situation. Research has found perspective-taking to mediate intergroup contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X11434837">Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005</xref>), the need for closure to mediate acculturation expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354067X11434837">Kosic, 2002</xref>), and open-mindedness to mediate inferences about culturally different others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434837">Detweiler, 1980</xref>). The present idiographic analysis of migrant points of view illustrates how the variable capacity to relate with the views of others, in terms of a tripartite typology of monological, dialogical, and metalogical points of view, serves to structure social relations and mark the acculturation experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1354067X11434837"><title>The case of Maltese migrants to Britain</title>
<p>The case of Maltese migrants to Britain is an instructive case for the investigation of acculturation outcomes. This is due to the fact that in Britain, no native Maltese community presently exists. In this case, therefore, the negotiation of perspectives undertaken by immigrants upon migration is unmediated by a diaspora of fellow migrants. In the absence of a native community to which they could flock, Maltese immigrants are required to acculturate (i.e., learn the rules of another culture sufficiently well to achieve functionality) individually rather than in community with others of their own kind.</p>
<p>The shelter provided by native communities in the immigration situation has been well documented in sociocultural psychology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X11434837">Gervais &amp; Jovchelovitch, 1998</xref>, for a report on the Chinese community in Britain, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X11434837">de Abreu &amp; Lambert, 2003</xref>, for a report on the Portuguese community in Britain and the Channel Islands). In contrast to such communities, Maltese immigrants are required to, for instance, necessarily converse in a foreign language (given the total absence of a native migrant community to which immigrants could flock, like the Chinese community or the Portuguese community in London, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X11434837">Abreu &amp; Lambert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X11434837">Gervais &amp; Jovchelovitch, 1998</xref>), travel using alien modes of transport (e.g., trains, trams, tube, and use prepaid travel cards such as the Oyster card), and socialise in different settings than they would natively (e.g., pubs as opposed to cafés). Whilst sources of support are manifold and include institutional systems, other migrant communities, as well as virtual spheres, the conspicuous physical absence of fellow countrymen means that everyday functioning, for the Maltese immigrant, needs to be achieved on the basis of the British social firmament. Without community, there is no option for doing things in a Maltese way, in Britain.</p>
<p>What the Maltese thus have at the time of migration, by which they can position themselves functionally within a new social reality or fail to do so, is their own preconceived ideas, beliefs, expectations, and experiences that arise from social representations that circulate back in Malta. In other words, their own points of view, that have currency in Maltese social representations, and which may in themselves be more or less open to the alternatives they encounter upon migrating. Indeed, as the findings of this study demonstrate, some are able to negotiate their settlement better than others due to this.</p>
<p>The absence of a Maltese community in Britain is due to events that gave a past Maltese community a negative reputation due involvement in the illicit provision of sexual services, and that led to its demise as immigrants sought to disassociate themselves from the criminal reputation of the Maltese at the time. These events have been extensively documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X11434837">Dench (1975)</xref>. Due to subsequent measures to curb migration and Malta’s eventual independence from the United Kingdom, the Maltese community in Britain never recovered.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1354067X11434837" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<sec id="sec5-1354067X11434837"><title>Respondents and interviews</title>
<p>Thirty-two in-depth interviews were undertaken with a total of 40 Maltese migrants to Britain during the latter half of 2008 and early 2009. Couples who migrated together were interviewed together. Out of the 40 respondents, eight had since repatriated to Malta. Respondents were recruited through snowball procedures and were interviewed at a convenient location, in most cases their own home. Interviews ranged from one to two and a half hours. Migrants’ stay in Britain ranged from less than a year to 50 years. Respondents were asked about their views regarding life in Malta and life in Britain, their reasons for moving, the settlement process, and their plans for the future. The interviews followed a semi-structured, conversational format that probed into the reasons and justifications that sustained the migrants’ views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1354067X11434837"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis on the transcribed interviews was undertaken following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X11434837">Flick’s (2006)</xref> Thematic Coding protocol for comparative studies. In this method groups under study are defined <italic>a priori</italic>. The first step involves drawing up a short description of each case, which serves to categorise respondents. In this study, respondents were classified in terms of their points of view as detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354067X11434837">Sammut &amp; Gaskell (2010)</xref>, according to the operational definitions outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354067X11434837">Table 1</xref>.
<table-wrap id="table1-1354067X11434837" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Point of view types</p></caption>

</table>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>This procedure was selected over the scale measurement of points of view (e.g., Pettigrew’s C-W [category-width] scale) in an effort to retain the qualitative distinctions between types, noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354067X11434837">Rokeach (1951a)</xref>. Considering that the characteristic nature of points of view as a variable involves a simultaneous appreciation of one’s perspective relative to that of another, the collapse of this typology along a single continuum of gradation along a unilinear quantitative measure was deemed inappropriate.</p>
<p>To this end, points of view were categorised by independent raters on the basis of the rhetorical characteristics of each case description. The categorisation demonstrated high convergence between raters (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.905, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.01). The correlation was not perfect due to the fact that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354067X11434837">Sammut and Gaskell (2010)</xref> note, for some individuals a point of view may be a work in progress. Nevertheless, as the authors further note, other individuals present coherent, well-articulated, and discrete points of view that vary in their propensity to relate with alternative views.</p>
<p>Categorization was followed by a deepening analysis of single cases through open coding, resulting in a thematic structure for single cases. A system of categories was subsequently drawn through selective coding that brings together a coding structure across all cases. The overarching thematic structure serves the purposes of comparability across types, with a final output that is a demonstration of coding themes found to differ across groups. This paper presents three typical cases that illustrate variance in the acculturation theme. These cases were selected in view of their similar narratives, preference for Maltese ways, and demographics.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1354067X11434837"><title>Rita’s monologicality</title>
<p>At the time of interview, Rita was a 25-year-old graduate who had moved to Britain over a year ago to pursue a postgraduate qualification. This study track was part of her original “masterplan,” that would enable her to acquire the skills needed to practice her chosen profession in Malta: “I had a masterplan that I had fixed in my mind and never questioned.” Rita was fond of her profession, however, she claimed that she was “doing worse than expected,” and she recognized that moving to Britain had a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>Talking about her preconceived ideas about Britain and her prior expectations, Rita conceded that she had not looked forward to Britain and saw it as a necessary evil. She needed to move to Britain because this was the easiest way for her to acquire her professional skills, but, she said, “I came but not happily.” Other than the fact that her move came on the back of a relationship breakdown, she claimed that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I hated Britain, I hated the British, everything here was silly, I didn’t like the course, I didn’t like my place, I didn’t make an effort because I wasn’t cut out for here and I’d decided that on the last day of the course I’d head back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On moving to Britain, she closed down and failed to integrate. She “couldn’t settle and didn’t want to settle.” Before moving, Rita had a full-time job, did voluntary work for the local parish, participated in community activities, and had a bustling social network. On moving to Britain, she feared she’d be forgotten, that her friends would “move on and leave me behind.” She would sit with her computer for days, awaiting contact from Malta, and on a number of occasions she had gone back unannounced to “make them remember me.”</p>
<p>Rita described her life in Britain as lonely and boring. She did not have time for the activities she enjoyed, and she also discovered that past-times were a less important feature of British life than she had imagined. Her past-time activities in Malta were the source of her life satisfaction:
<disp-quote>
<p>I used to think it was negative, and I used to say I look forward to go to London [before she moved] and slow down and focus, but now I realize it gave me a sense of purpose, it gave me meaning. I was stressed but I was well supported, […] it gave me a reason for living.</p>
</disp-quote>In Britain, Rita was unable to replicate this lifestyle, because things were different. She found that: “even the windows open up different here, they only open partly, so you couldn’t open up to change the air.” She found that the church too was different, that she was made to feel embarrassed about her religious faith, and that life in Britain centered on other things:
<disp-quote>
<p>[l]ife is centered on work and pubs, people work hard, then they socialize by going for a drink. In Malta work is not so important, it’s a means to an end. You work, then get a life after work. Here the central feature of one’s life is work. In Malta my leisure was night hikes, treasure hunts, picnics, cooking at each other’s, but here you don’t do that […] All I do when I go out is go to pubs, cinema, restaurants, that’s it. In Malta I do all these and many more. […] I don’t like it because I don’t drink, I take the least [drink] I dislike. Not my type.</p>
</disp-quote>Rita’s negative experience of Britain changed when she realized she was not making the best of what London had to offer. This coincided with the move to London of some Maltese acquaintances that became her network in Britain. Whilst with foreigners she found it “hard,” with these fellow Maltese immigrants she “felt on the same wavelength.” Through this small community, she could:
<disp-quote>
<p>[f]ill that void somewhat that couldn’t be filled with a pub, […] at least there’s a certain bond, they’re not coming from pub culture. Even the language, I don’t have to make an effort. With other Maltese around, that void can be filled somewhat. But before it wasn’t and I didn’t want to fill it this way. Now it’s a support network that I didn’t have.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rita’s community experience was so significant that she started to feel “settled”:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I] feel settled here now […] I feel part of London, I feel a bit of a Londoner, part of this hotch-potch of people here, and I’m not an outsider, I’m part of that. Now I say I’m going home, I used to say I’m going to my room.</p>
</disp-quote>Looking back at Malta, Rita was “ambivalent.” She was frustrated that things in Malta are not well-organized, but she also thought the Maltese “know how to live.” She planned to stay in Britain for the duration of her studies and a little while after to gain some work experience, then return to Malta to settle down. I made contact with Rita again after three years. In her final year of studies, her plans had not wavered. She was giving herself a couple of months after completion to find a job, after which she saw herself moving back to Malta to “settle back there” for the “long-term.”</p>

<sec id="sec9-1354067X11434837"><title>Toni’s dialogicality</title>
<p>Toni had been in Britain for 7 years at the time of interview. He had moved to Britain for postgraduate studies. He had negotiated migration on his own and had experienced no particular difficulties in regard. Looking back, he thought it “felt like living in a bubble,” as he was in the same situation as everyone else around him, that is, students who had also moved to the university town to study. He felt that for the duration of his studies, “feeling a foreigner wasn’t foreign because everyone’s foreign.” On the other hand, he did not feel part of Britain. For one thing, he always spent a few months each year in Malta, so, he argued, “that’s why I feel so Maltese.” Moreover, Toni felt he had a Maltese mindset, that as opposed to the British he would “approach life differently, for example the boundary of what’s acceptable or not in humor, of having a laugh at others.” Toni liked Britain. He did not like pubs much but he felt accepted and settled. He affirmed he was “a Maltese in Britain, and the more time goes the more Maltese I become.” When he goes to Malta, he has taken to visiting cultural places. He also spends a lot of time socializing and keeping alive a vibrant social network. In Britain though, he feels that:
<disp-quote>
<p>when I’m here I’m not in Malta, I’m not in my place talking my language, I’m not in my country. […] I always tell my partner that my people are there. There’s certain things like the language, things like, to understand how a Maltese would write “Have you seen enough?” on the back of their car, if you’re British you don’t understand that, there’s something Maltese about that; I understand that, I feel I belong there.</p>
</disp-quote>Nevertheless, whilst he thinks he’d enjoy life better in Malta, there were certain things that “bugged” him. However, he liked the Maltese lifestyle, whereas in Britain he has “nothing”. Toni claimed that his social life in Britain was impoverished and taken up by his work. He was employed at an internationally acclaimed university. He had been there for over 2 years and had not made any friends. Typically, he spent his weekends working. He derived much satisfaction from his work achievements, and felt “part of the full-scale of things.” He felt “settled,” “accepted,” he “paid taxes,” and was also open to political participation due to the fact that he objected “to certain things quite strongly.” However, he considered himself a Maltese in Britain, and he did not want a British passport.</p>
<p>With regard to the life situations in both countries, Toni claimed he would never be able to do any other work in Britain than academia, as no other job would afford him the opportunity to spend so much time in Malta at the same time as holding a job in Britain. Ideally, he claimed, he would juggle both countries simultaneously, spending the summer months in Malta and working in Britain during winter. That way, he thought, he would get “the best of both worlds.” He argued that his home was in Malta, but that when he got back to his town in Britain he also felt a homecoming. However, he would eventually want to retire in Malta. Not only that, he did not want to bring up his children in Britain: “I’d want my kids to be Maltese, to speak Maltese, to understand our Mediterranean humour.”</p>
<p>Toni acknowledged that in spite of everything he was in Britain for, he had a strong pull towards Malta. What kept him in Britain was the institution that employed him. He’s ready to stay: “only insofar as I have great jobs here. I wouldn’t take a job at any university and stay, it would have to be a great place […] I won’t stay for anything.” Three years after the original interview, Toni had consolidated his position at the university, becoming a member of faculty. He was in a committed relationship, but still spent much time working. He also spent much time away from Britain, in Malta, working from there and enjoying his social network in Malta.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1354067X11434837"><title>Angela’s metalogicality</title>
<p>Angela had moved to Britain just over 3 years prior to the interview. She had moved to study, had completed her postgraduate degree, and was looking for work at the time. She shared a residence with a classmate on her course, who also stayed around after finishing the degree. Angela was not in touch with others from her course, as “people went their separate ways.” With her flatmate, however, she was very close. She too originated from a Mediterranean country, and both shared similar leisure preferences. Other than her flatmate and a few scattered Maltese friends, Angela did not have a wide social network. She acknowledged that her network in Malta was “much wider, much more diversified, with different interests” and that she “didn’t develop as strong a social network” as she had not had “much time to do so.” She was, however, very much in touch with her social network in Malta. She contacted her family daily and was still involved in voluntary activities that she was engaged in at the time she left Malta. She did, however, note that her relations in Malta had changed because there were “differences now that weren’t there before.” She herself had changed as a result of her move to Britain; she was able to “see things differently.” Even with regard to her values, such as her spiritual faith, her values had not changed, but, she “saw things differently.”</p>
<p>Angela’s religiosity was very significant to her. In Malta, it provided her with much scope. Even when visiting, she would get involved in charitable activities and voluntary work that her parish undertook. She would even help towards the upkeep of the local church, and she spent time at home in Britain working towards these activities from a distance. In Britain, however, she had not become equally involved. She claimed that she felt somewhat of an outsider in Church, because it was different than the one in Malta. She felt that: “priests and mass are cold. More ceremonial […] it puts me off […] they sing hymns, and I’m not comfortable with that […] it’s full of children […] in Malta I can pray because there’s silence.” However, Angela was open to building bridges in future, arguing that “maybe if I get to know people I could get closer.”</p>
<p>The same pattern characterized her social relations. She did not have a strong network, but she was open to make an effort when she got herself a job. The fact that these would be relations amongst foreigners “was not a problem” and she was open to new forms of interaction: “I’d go to a pub […] I wouldn’t drink beer, but I wouldn’t mind going to a pub. I wouldn’t go clubbing. But these differences are not because I’m Maltese, only because I am who I am.” Angela did not feel an outsider in Britain, although she did feel “different.” She felt she was able to “mould”: “moulding is when I adapt to fit. Not I’m a circle fitting into a square. I change slightly but not totally, I remain distinct and different and not fully amalgamated, but not totally alien.” She felt “part of the system,” but “not British.” She argued that you do not have to be British to be part of the system. However, she did not feel she “belonged” as that is something “personal” and requires “family.” On the other hand, she does feel she belongs in Malta and that she fits well there. She is still well connected and still able to draw on social support from there in times of need, such as financial assistance when unemployed or emotional support when she was taken ill. For Angela, such experiences were difficult aspects of coming to terms with migration. She admitted that she was unprepared for these things. She succeeded, however, on her own. She did not seek Maltese community due to a stereotype of the Maltese in Britain that she did not want to associate with. And whilst she felt “settled,” she however did not see herself as a migrant as she did not consider her settlement exclusively permanent.</p>
<p>Angela was open to options; staying in Britain, moving back to Malta, or to another Mediterranean country. Asked about her experiences when revisiting Malta, Angela claimed she gets anxious and excited at the same time, to the extent that she cannot sleep the night before she goes. She feels the same way when coming back. She was “comfy” in some ways in Britain and in other ways in Malta, and when in Britain she lost the comforts in Malta, and vice-versa. For her: “both countries are somewhat home.” She claimed that England was more of a home in line with her character, and Malta was more of a home in line with her family. She claimed that: “in England I have an alternative home, but still a home. It’s an alternative, because even my character is different in Malta.”</p>
<p>Three years after the interview, Angela was once again in a similar position. The agency she worked for had closed doors making all employees redundant. Once again, Angela was open to opportunities in Britain as well as in Malta, and had pending work applications in both countries simultaneously.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1354067X11434837" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In achieving the dual aim of explaining regularities and understanding particularities, an empirical focus on processes needs to be extended to a complementary focus on typical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354067X11434837">Rosa, 2008</xref>). Psychological experience can be studied along either of these concerns, yet the two are often taken to be alternative approaches. As Rosa makes clear, these are complementary, and which is chosen for inquiry depends on the subject matter of study. The scope of the present paper is the identification and mapping effects of characteristics pertaining to the point of view as a variable psychological phenomenon. In extending inquiry into the processes associated with particular types, one is required to sample cases typical of a particular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354067X11434837">Rosa, 2008</xref>). The idiographic analysis of typical cases manifesting monological, dialogical, and metalogical points of view illustrated the acculturation implications of the variable propensity to take the perspective of the other. It demonstrates that acculturation may not so much be related to explicit attitudes towards migration, as it might be due to the success or failure of migrants to relate with another perspective that is, in its turn, based on a different background of intelligibility.</p>
<p>In studying the acculturation experiences of Rita, Toni, and Angela, it is hard to pin down their acculturation preferences according to traditional acculturation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X11434837">Berry, 2011</xref>). Angela seems to be closest to integration, but she has built no social capital in Britain due to her having no social network at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354067X11434837">Sammut, 2011</xref>). Her acculturation style, in fact, transpires as more segregated as she shuns contact with her fellow native migrants and relies on social capital from Malta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354067X11434837">Sammut, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, she was clearly open to building bridges and ready for what she described as “moulding.” This is, paradoxically, synonymous with an integration acculturation style. And yet, her orientation is not very different from Toni’s, who similarly gains much from his network in Malta and far less from his network in Britain. It is hard to see how Toni has integrated or “moulded.” Toni would appear to be marginalized or segregated. And yet, he had a stable relationship with a British partner and held a successful job in an acclaimed British institution. Additionally, his social bonds were very weak relative to Rita, who, in spite of her distaste for Britain had some social relations with fellow migrants as well as a degree of identification with London. She would thus appear to be segregated, yet Rita was most intent on not giving Britain a go and leaving as soon as her cultural capital targets are achieved. Both Toni and, to a greater extent, Angela are open to relate with Britain on British terms. However, Toni’s openness is bounded in a way that Angela’s is not. Toni would only stay away from his people for a great opportunity. Angela was open to benefit from any experience, not merely the ones that fit her preordained criteria.</p>
<p>The empirical focus on points of view undertaken in this inquiry demonstrates that different migrants have different motives and different outlooks on migration, even if these appear similar at face value and originate from their shared native reality. The study of points of view is revealing. It demonstrates that successful integration and positive intercultural relations do not occur as a function of the attitudes of migrants towards long-term or short-term settlement. As argued above, these can be ambivalent in light of the complexity of migrants’ points of view. On the other hand, acculturation outcomes have much to do with migrants’ capacity to relate within others whose views and ways of life are rooted in a social firmament that differs from their own.</p>
