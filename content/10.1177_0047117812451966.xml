<abstract>
<p>Graham Allison’s <italic>Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis</italic> is recognized more for its general decision-making models than for its historical analysis. The second (1999) edition, co-authored with Philip Zelikow, adopts the same basic models and answers the same three ‘central puzzles’ of the missile crisis: (1) why did the USSR deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba; (2) why did the United States blockade Cuba; and (3) why did the USSR withdraw its missiles? This review article questions the answers Allison and Zelikow provide to each of these questions. In particular, I discuss the importance of the partially secret Khrushchev–Kennedy agreement as a factor in ending the crisis and present new evidence suggesting that Turkey may not, as usually assumed, have been opposed at the time of the crisis to decommissioning its US Jupiter missiles. I also suggest some additional missile crisis questions beyond the three ‘central puzzles’.</p>

<p>It is something of a paradox that the best-known book in the vast literature on the Cuban missile crisis is recognized more for its theorizing than its historical analysis, and even more for its generalized models of decision-making than its considerable contribution to understanding the crisis. <italic>Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis</italic> had an impact few academic books ever have and has prevailed for 40 years. The crisis itself, the most dangerous great power confrontation in human history, is now a half-century old. It is an opportune time to assess this pioneering work’s contribution to understanding its chosen event.</p>
<sec id="section1-0047117812451966">
<title><italic>Essence</italic> in essence</title>
<p>Graham Allison’s (1971) <italic>Essence of Decision</italic> (hereafter <italic>Essence</italic>1) was as provocative as it was praised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117812451966">1</xref></sup> From the beginning, it was both an intellectual and popular ‘hit’. It sells still. And it is so universally known that its very title is regularly punned by other missile crisis writings and by non-missile crisis books, sometimes without any felt need to cite the original.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117812451966">2</xref></sup> (Some readers might note that this is a book first published not only ‘b4’ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> and twitter, but ‘b4’ personal computers and the internet.)</p>
<p>The book’s organization reflects its emphasis on exploring alternative explanatory theories. It developed three now-familiar models of decision-making – the rational actor, organizational process and governmental (or bureaucratic) politics models. It devotes a chapter to each model (chs 1, 3 and 5), and it is for these that <italic>Essence</italic> has become universally known and widely cited across the social sciences. The remaining chapters examine three ‘central puzzles’ of the missile crisis: (1) why did the USSR deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba; (2) why did the US blockade Cuba; and (3) why did the USSR withdraw its missiles? In this now-famous mating of models with missiles, the models take pride of place over the puzzles. The even-numbered, substantive chapters (2, 4 and 6) each apply one model to answer all three questions, rather than successive chapters each answering a given question. Unlike conventional histories, therefore, <italic>Essence</italic> provides only brief, somewhat disconnected, narratives of crisis events.</p>
<p>The second (1999) edition, co-authored by Allison and Zelikow (hereafter <italic>Essence</italic>2), follows the same basic format (with one exception).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117812451966">3</xref></sup> <italic>Essence</italic>2 answers all three puzzles differently, however, and the changes do not always parallel the evolution of the literature. This article focuses more on the second edition than on comparing the two. It also assumes that readers have some familiarity with both the crisis and the book.</p>
<p>Both editions generally argue that analysts must venture beyond the familiar rational actor model and employ the organizational and bureaucratic models to arrive at an adequate understanding of events like the Cuban missile crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117812451966">4</xref></sup> On this argument, the passage of time has been unkind. Familiarity breeds contention. Even sympathetic critics have severely questioned the original models and interpretations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117812451966">5</xref></sup> Mounting historical evidence has tended not to bolster the once innovative, even sexy, organizational and bureaucratic models (II and III) – as many analysts had expected further evidence would. Rather, it has tended if anything to reinforce the traditional rational actor model (I). Learning more about the crisis has not reinforced <italic>Essence</italic>’s argument about the value-added quality of the latter two models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117812451966">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be fair, the missile crisis was an extraordinarily tough case for demonstrating the influence of intra-government forces in policy-making. Crises tend to centralize decisions, to push leaders to the forefront, and the 1962 crisis did so more than most. Thus, the decks were stacked very substantially against Models II and III.</p>
<p>Many existing appraisals of <italic>Essence of Decision</italic>, even by historians, nevertheless emphasize the three models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117812451966">7</xref></sup> My focus here is the explanatory puzzles more than the famous models; what follows is thus, oddly, a somewhat unconventional treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117812451966">8</xref></sup> Focusing today on possible explanations of and conclusions about the crisis means confronting changing interpretations of crisis events and exploring the interaction between established notions and recently discovered facts. Perhaps the most central of missile crisis debates concerns the agreement John F. Kennedy (hereafter Kennedy or JFK) and Nikita Khrushchev reached in resolving the crisis, and the role of a secret concession the President made to withdraw US Jupiter missiles from Turkey. About that secret provision much more will be said. I also raise some additional questions about the missile crisis beyond <italic>Essence</italic>’s now-holy trinity of puzzles. While these additional questions are not new, they need highlighting.</p>
<p>Allison and Zelikow themselves state that they make use ‘of <italic>all</italic> information in the public record’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. xiii, emphasis added). That would pose a challenge on most subjects at most points in time; on this subject, at this time, given the now vast and detailed missile crisis literature, it is an unrealistic claim. A more flexible criterion would seem fair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0047117812451966">
<title>Historiographical stages</title>
<p>It would help us to contextualize both editions of <italic>Essence of Decision</italic> to identify four more or less consecutive but overlapping stages of missile crisis research. The first consisted largely of 1960s’ memoirs and popular history, broadly defined, all of them American voices. The most prominent of these were Robert F. Kennedy’s (hereafter, RFK or ‘Bobby’) <italic>Thirteen Days</italic>, Theodore Sorensen’s <italic>Kennedy</italic>, Roger Hilsman’s <italic>To Move a Nation</italic>, Arthur Schlesinger’s <italic>A Thousand Days</italic> and journalist Elie Abel’s <italic>The Missile Crisis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117812451966">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Publication of <italic>Essence</italic>1 opened the second stage, one of serious scholarly research. Allison based his missile crisis chapters on the secondary literature (e.g. both the RFK and Abel books) and extensive, apparently confidential, interviews (not individually referenced). <italic>Essence</italic>1 established a new orthodoxy on the crisis but soon prompted some critics. Two of them, Donald Hafner and Barton Bernstein, focused on the same issue, the Jupiter missiles in Turkey, to which Allison refers but does not emphasize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117812451966">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A surging tide of declassified documents and an extraordinary series of participant–expert observer conferences marked the third stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117812451966">11</xref></sup> The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library (JFKL) began releasing material in the late 1970s and continued that process apace through the 1980s and 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117812451966">12</xref></sup> Of particular interest, it released slowly, over 14 years, fully 22 hours of hitherto secret White House tape recordings relating to the missile crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117812451966">13</xref></sup> The US National Archives, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the now-entitled British National Archives followed suit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117812451966">14</xref></sup> The private National Security Archive secured release of many US documents. The Cold War International History Project provided a key outlet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117812451966">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth and most recent stage is heavily represented by international (i.e. non-US) perspectives and by re-evaluations and refinements, based partly on stage three disclosures. The volumes here include important contributions from Soviet, Cuban, British and European as well as American analysts, and the second edition of <italic>Essence of Decision</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117812451966">16</xref></sup> The current scene is, in short, a vastly more complex, varied and crowded one than when <italic>Essence</italic>1 emerged, but is one in which a significant consensus has emerged on many key issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0047117812451966">
<title>Deploying the missiles: going for advantage in Berlin?</title>
<p>As Robert McNamara later rephrased the first of <italic>Essence</italic>’s three puzzles, ‘<italic>What in god’s name did Khrushchev think he was doing</italic>?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117812451966">17</xref></sup> Early on, scholars and missile crisis participants alike, implicitly engaging in rational actor analysis, commonly inferred three Soviet motives for sending ballistic missiles to Cuba: (1) to narrow the US advantage in long-range strategic capability, (2) to use the missiles in Cuba to strengthen the Soviet position in a divided Berlin and (3) to help defend Cuba.</p>
<p>Allison and Zelikow argue that Khrushchev deployed medium-range R-12 ballistic missiles to Cuba, and tried to deploy intermediate-range R-14 missiles, to bolster Soviet strategic capability and to gain leverage for a favourable solution on Berlin (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 107). Virtually, all experts accept the former explanation as one goal if not the primary goal. Few subscribe to the supposed Berlin motive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117812451966">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the early 1960s, Washington and Moscow both perceived Berlin as a key Cold War problem. In 1961, the Soviets and East Germans began constructing the soon-to-be famous wall to seal off West Berlin. In October, amidst rising tensions, Soviet and US forces directly confronted each other at ‘Checkpoint Charlie’, a major crossing point between the east and the west. The forces involved were conventional but included armed battle tanks. The stand-off ended after a few days and without any shots fired. The wall would survive for almost three decades without a similar confrontation.</p>
<p>Berlin was thus in the minds of US officials pondering Moscow’s moves and motives in October 1962. But Washington’s suspicions do not prove a Kremlin motive. As logical as perceived links at the time might have been, only circumstantial evidence connects Berlin and the deployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117812451966">19</xref></sup> A half-century on, that is slim pickin’s. Indeed, key Russian participants in the oral history conferences have argued that Moscow had made no such direct connection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117812451966">20</xref></sup> Moves against West Berlin, they insisted, were never part of Khrushchev’s calculus.</p>
<p>It is nevertheless possible that there might have been an indirect link between the missiles in Cuba and the future of Berlin. Sir Frank Roberts, the British ambassador in Moscow in 1962, who was unconvinced that Berlin was Khrushchev’s specific objective, nevertheless observed that there was a connexion with Berlin, ‘because in Khrushchev’s calculations there must be some connexion between Berlin and virtually act of policy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117812451966">21</xref></sup> Successfully deploying missiles to Cuba would have been a major Cold War coup for the Soviet Union, a clear manifestation of Moscow’s ability to project force abroad and challenge the United States in its own backyard. That success, in turn, could have increased Soviet prestige globally and thus perhaps strengthened its position on Berlin – an issue about which Nikita Khrushchev cared deeply. A better term for the possible objective here than the so-called ‘Berlin’ motive might thus be the ‘Soviet prestige and influence’ factor. Many existing discussions of Soviet aims in Cuba curiously do not appear to consider this motive systematically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047117812451966">
<title>Deploying the missiles: defence of Cuba</title>
<p>Allison and Zelikow acknowledge that Khrushchev was worried about losing communist Cuba (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 84). They agree he had ‘ample basis for suspicion’ that the United States would invade the island and overthrow Castro (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 84–5). Indeed, they allow this threat was always ‘in the background’. But they still insist that defending Cuba was not a significant Soviet motive for the deployment.</p>
<p>The authors mount various arguments against the defence of Cuba idea. All seem unpersuasive. They make much of the following two facts: that President JFK told Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko during a mid-October 1962 meeting that the United States was not planning to invade Cuba and that Gromyko did not report Kennedy’s assurances to Moscow (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 108). But Gromyko’s oversight, such as it was, does not prove Cuba’s fate was unimportant to Nikita Khrushchev.</p>
<p>Two considerations lessen the significance of JFK’s statement to Gromyko. The President had made a similar statement in September and, when he repeated it in October, he immediately retracted any implied promise. The situation had changed, he told Gromyko, because the Soviets were now building up Cuba’s military capability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117812451966">22</xref></sup> The President’s statement was thus actually more warning than assurance. More importantly, no Kennedy assurance in October could have alleviated Soviet concerns about Cuba’s security at the time Khrushchev ordered the missile deployment – fully six months earlier.</p>
<p><italic>Essence</italic>2 also argues that the defence of Cuba explanation is inconsistent with the nature and number of missiles sent. Nuclear missiles were not ‘necessary’ and certainly not so many of them (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 86–8, 108–9). No single metric exists, however, to calculate the forces ‘required’ to deter potential attacks. Moreover, whether or not a chosen action (such as deploying missiles) is ‘optimal’ is ‘completely irrelevant’ to explaining decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117812451966">23</xref></sup> Allison and Zelikow further argue the Soviet deployment of short-range, tactical nuclear weapons would not and could not have deterred an American invasion because Washington was unaware the tactical weapons were in Cuba (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 209). Hence, they say, Cuban security was not Moscow’s concern. The logic here is simply invalid. Had the crisis unfolded as Khrushchev hoped, had the USSR completed and announced the full deployments in November as planned, then the tactical missiles might very well have helped deter an American invasion. Moscow’s original motives cannot be assessed ex post facto, according to the way events unexpectedly unfolded months later.</p>
<p>Various critics of the ‘defence of Cuba’ theme also argue that however much ballistic missiles might have deterred a US attack, they would not have helped ‘defend’ Cuba. This general deterrence argument assumes, incorrectly, that Soviet thinking then rested on a deterrence–defence distinction as much as did American strategic thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117812451966">24</xref></sup> Moreover, the ‘deterrence versus defence’ argument does not apply at all to the tactical nuclear weapons. Their short range made them solely defensive. So too were the large numbers of Soviet ground troops sent to Cuba.</p>
<p>Defending Cuba is now widely regarded as a primary Khrushchev goal for the deployment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117812451966">25</xref></sup> Support for this motive grew in recent decades as evidence emerged on extensive US planning for an invasion of Cuba and covert CIA operations against Fidel Castro.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117812451966">26</xref></sup> Whatever Washington’s true intentions, Cuban and Soviet concerns about Cuba’s security were more than reasonable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047117812451966">
<title>Blockading Cuba: ‘take ‘em out’ or ‘talk ‘em out’?</title>
<p>The second of the three central questions is ‘Why did the United States blockade Cuba?’ The rational actor approach explained Kennedy’s decision to blockade Cuba as a compromise response to the missile deployment between two extremes: doing nothing, which would have been politically untenable, and attacking the missile sites or invading Cuba, both of which would have dangerously escalated the conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117812451966">27</xref></sup> <italic>Essence</italic>1 shows Kennedy’s so-called Executive Committee, or ExComm, came to focus increasingly during the first crisis week on the blockade (‘force ‘em out’) rather than on the air strike (‘take ‘em out’) or full-scale invasion (‘go in and get ‘em out’) options.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117812451966">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a highly interesting and useful departure, Allison and Zelikow argue the ExComm did not in the end pose establishing a blockade and using or threatening military force as dichotomous alternatives. Rather, the group constructed a more complex set of options: a blockade <italic>and</italic> an ultimatum, on the one hand, versus a blockade <italic>and</italic> negotiating, on the other hand (Essence2, pp. 119–20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117812451966">29</xref></sup> Allison and Zelikow clearly believe the ultimate US response was the former combination, not the latter. Arguably, the actual US response was imposing a blockade, issuing an ultimatum <italic>and</italic> negotiating an agreement.</p>
<p>Most early analyses suggested that ExComm gave the negotiating (‘talk ‘em out’) option short shrift.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117812451966">30</xref></sup> In fact, negotiating a deal involving the Jupiters in Turkey was not overlooked and was not an afterthought. Nor did it only enter the picture late when Khrushchev raised it in a 27 October letter to Kennedy. The ‘friggin’ missiles’ in Turkey figured early and figured often in United States’ crisis thinking. Allison and Zelikow correctly note they were matters of ‘constant discussion’ in the ExComm (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 241). And, contrary to a claim made by Dean Rusk (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 127), the Kennedy administration did not ‘reject’ Khrushchev’s proposal regarding the Jupiters; it publicly avoided a response while secretly preparing one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117812451966">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Explicitly, <italic>Essence</italic>2 poses the same blockade question as <italic>Essence</italic>1. Implicitly, it thus provides an answer to this puzzle that changes the question itself. The puzzle we should pursue here is thus not why the President chose a ‘blockade’ but why he chose the combination of responses. Making that conceptual shift, in turn, raises the question of how ‘talking ‘em out’ played its part in the combination of responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0047117812451966">
<title>Withdrawing the missiles: caving into threat?</title>
<p>Why did the Soviet Union withdraw the missiles? (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 78). According to Allison and Zelikow, ‘the blockade did not change Khrushchev’s mind. Only when coupled with the threat of further action … did it succeed in <italic>forcing</italic> Soviet withdrawal of the missiles’. The necessary and apparently sufficient factor was ‘the <italic>threat of the air strike or invasion</italic>’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 128, emphases added). One might quibble with the wording here – JFK did not specifically articulate the air strike or invasion threats publicly or even privately to the Soviets. But the American military preparations were not hidden and the Soviets presumably used their imaginations as to the further action Kennedy might take. The thrust of the <italic>Essence</italic>2 argument, however, is that US threats, per se, more or less alone, <italic>forced</italic> Khrushchev to withdraw the missiles from Cuba.</p>
<p>That explanation is at least debatable. First, the blockade itself was not irrelevant. It did affect Khrushchev’s thinking. When he learned Kennedy had scheduled a televised address for 22 October, the Soviet leader initially feared the President might order an immediate military attack. The announced blockade signalled American resolve and made clear to Khrushchev he had misjudged Washington’s reaction to the missiles, but also suggested to him the United States might be willing to deal. Moreover, the effective naval blockade, coupled with the interception of Soviet submarines in the area, underscored the US conventional military advantage in the Atlantic and Caribbean.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117812451966">32</xref></sup> The blockade also stopped the entire shipment of intermediate-range R-14 missiles. This was arguably the point in time at which Khrushchev began to realize there was no real alternative to withdrawal, short of risking Cuba and nuclear war. Realizing one has to change one’s position is distinct from changing it, but is a critical start psychologically. Arguably, then, the blockade <italic>did begin</italic> to change Khrushchev’s mind.</p>
<p>Second, the available evidence shows Khrushchev himself dwelling less on the specific possibilities of an air strike or invasion than on other, broader consequences. He clearly thought deeply about and feared an uncontrolled escalation and a resulting nuclear war (e.g. <italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 355, 362). Khrushchev certainly had dramatic evidence of possible escalation: a 27 October attack on an American U-2 spy plane, Cuban forces firing on low-level unarmed US reconnaissance aircraft, US planes violating Soviet airspace and Castro apparently urging a pre-emptive nuclear strike. The fact that unauthorized action by his own troops brought down the U-2 spy plane only emphasized the dangers. Beyond specific threats to attack Cuba, therefore, was the threat of nuclear catastrophe. That was arguably Khrushchev’s overriding concern.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Graham Allison suggested that both Kennedy and Khrushchev sought a peaceful solution, recognizing the need to avoid ‘the final failure’, as the American president called it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117812451966">33</xref></sup> ‘This nuclear crisis’, Allison observed, ‘seems to have magnified both rulers’ conceptions of the consequences of nuclear war, and each man’s awareness of his responsibility for these consequences’ (<italic>Essence</italic>1, p. 212). Allison’s analysis would later be confirmed by documentary evidence and oral testimony. The two men felt accountable ‘to humanity as a whole, not solely to their respective national interests [or] personal political fortunes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117812451966">34</xref></sup> Their mutual sense of personal responsibility was eloquently summed up by Khrushchev: ‘We don’t have the right to take risks’, he told an associate at the height of the crisis. ‘We now have a common cause, to save the world from those pushing us toward war’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117812451966">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, Khrushchev’s own thinking shifted during 1962, from wanting, as he said, to ‘drop a hedgehog’ down the Americans’ trousers, to extending a helping hand. The shift is reflected in another comment he made, about his ally, Castro. Fidel, Khrushchev said, was ‘a very hot-tempered person’ who ‘failed to think through the obvious consequences of a proposal that placed the planet on the brink of extinction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117812451966">36</xref></sup> The same could have been said of Khrushchev himself, before 22 October 1962. That week, however, he saw the quicksand into which he was walking, reconsidered his poorly conceived deployment decision and backed out before becoming stuck. JFK’s thinking also shifted dramatically during late October, from assuming he had no choice but attack Cuba to making a politically dangerous deal.</p>
<p>In sum, the missile crisis did not end by military threat alone. Khrushchev, boxed in, needed a form of retreat with which he could live. If he had not obtained acceptable terms, things might well have ended differently. Kennedy brandished the stick <italic>and</italic> offered a carrot (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 385). His response to the deployment was not just a blockade and threats of further action but also informal negotiation. An agreement was negotiated rapidly, only partially put to paper, and thus never signed let alone ratified. It was an agreement nevertheless. Its written component was Kennedy’s conditional pledge to end the blockade and eschew an invasion of Cuba. Khrushchev publicly promised to withdraw the missiles and later the IL-28 bombers. The secret part was a Kennedy concession on the Jupiter missiles. The so-called ‘missile trade’ was really a mutual missile withdrawal pact. Our understanding of this accord has evolved and deepened, as some background will show.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0047117812451966">
<title>Ordering the Jupiter missiles removed from Turkey</title>
<p>According to Elie Abel, Kennedy was surprised during the missile crisis to discover that American Jupiter missiles were still in Turkey. He says Kennedy ‘distinctly remembered’ ordering them removed. RFK’s <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> made a similar but notably more nuanced claim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117812451966">37</xref></sup> In <italic>Essence</italic>1, Graham Allison hypothesized that Washington bureaucracies must have frustrated the President’s removal order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117812451966">38</xref></sup> Later, writers picked up this version of events. For bureaucratic politics folks, the example was a veritable Krupp Diamond.</p>
<p>Only it was not. Within a few years, and even before official documents became available, Donald Hafner brilliantly shredded this myth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117812451966">39</xref></sup> Based on public material and the secondary literature, Hafner used Kennedy’s own words and actions to show that the President knew very well before and during the missile crisis that the Jupiters remained in Turkey. Hafner also inferred there had been no withdrawal order (prior to October); he was correct, but he lacked direct evidence on this point and his reasoning was faulty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117812451966">40</xref></sup> We know now there was in fact no pre-crisis presidential directive. And thus no bureaucratic politics obstructed a presidential decree. Take that Model III! To be sure, Kennedy had earlier directed his officials to explore ways to remove the Jupiters, and he did ‘want them gone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117812451966">41</xref></sup> He did not, however, explicitly <italic>order</italic> the missiles withdrawn – at least not before 28 October 1962.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117812451966">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Jupiter directive myth has proven difficult to shake off and to see for what it was. Did some White House aides, including RFK, ‘forget’ and ‘garble’ the story (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 252–3, fn 116)? Perhaps, but such is surely being too kind. While some aides may have honestly believed that story, others who knew the truth consciously sought to obscure history, including RFK. President Kennedy’s men were hardly the first in history to spin events for political reasons – or the last.</p>

<title>A deal or not a deal? That was the question</title>
<p>Even as the missile crisis dust was still settling, public speculation arose that its abrupt and unexpected end suggested some sort of secret deal with the Soviet devil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117812451966">43</xref></sup> The New Frontiersmen denied this rumour with all the ‘vigah’ they could muster. Jack Kennedy, they insisted, had done no such thing. Dean Rusk and Robert McNamara so testified under oath to Congress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117812451966">44</xref></sup> US officials also told North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies the same story. They were, for the most part, believed.</p>
<p>The fact that RFK and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin held secret discussions during the missile crisis become public knowledge in 1966 from Abel’s book. That volume, however, makes no mention of the Jupiters being discussed. Cracks in the storyline nevertheless soon appeared, with the posthumous publication of RFK’s <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> in 1969. Washington observers could not help but notice it showed Bobby telling Dobrynin during their now-famous 28 October evening meeting that the President would remove the Jupiters from Turkey. Prior to the book’s release, ‘both admirers and critics [had] assumed that President Kennedy had been wholly unresponsive on the Turkish missiles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117812451966">45</xref></sup> RFK’s account thus surprised both groups. For different reasons, the account challenged fundamental beliefs. For admirers, it undermined the image of JFK’s ‘unwavering firmness’. For critics, it shook their conviction he had engaged in ‘unforgivable risk taking’.</p>
<p>In retrospect, a most interesting but much-ignored feature of the 1971 edition of <italic>Essence of Decision</italic> was its treatment of the Jupiter issue. Allison notes RFK’s claim that he told Dobrynin ‘there could be no <italic>quid pro quo</italic>’, no deal involving the Jupiters of the sort Khrushchev proposed earlier that day. But Allison also argues <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> ‘discloses important, confirming evidence’ of such a deal; indeed, it ‘<italic>could not have been plainer</italic>’ (<italic>Essence</italic>1, pp. 229–30, emphasis added). In effect, then, Allison is suggesting there <italic>was</italic> a <italic>quid pro quo</italic>. The Kennedy brothers offered up the Jupiters for the R-12s.</p>
<p>Allison’s speculation here was sound. In <italic>Thirteen Days</italic>, RFK assures Dobrynin that JFK wanted the missiles removed, and soon after the crisis, ‘those missiles <italic>would be gone</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117812451966">46</xref></sup> If this were all RFK had actually said to Dobrynin, it would still have conveyed a clear message: assuming Khrushchev withdrew his ballistic missiles, the President of the United States was committing himself to removing the Jupiters.</p>
<p>The first edition of Nikita Khrushchev’s memoirs, published in the United States in 1970, was silent on the Jupiter concession. The 1974 edition, published posthumously, briefly describes the deal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117812451966">47</xref></sup> This edition garnered less attention, however. Khrushchev’s revelation was largely ignored. Andrei Gromyko similarly wrote about the arrangement, citing <italic>Thirteen Days</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117812451966">48</xref></sup> Before that, the allies broke the silence. Fidel Castro spoke about the deal in the late 1960s and Turkey’s Prime Minister publicly acknowledged it in 1970.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117812451966">49</xref></sup> In 1980, historian Barton Bernstein argued the case for an explicit Kennedy–Khrushchev agreement. Based on some declassified JFKL documents, he concluded that the President ‘privately offered a hedged promise … to withdraw the Jupiter missiles’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117812451966">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two years later, on the 20th anniversary of the missile crisis, six high-level Kennedy administration officials revised the record, but only modestly. They acknowledged that RFK indeed gave the Soviets an ‘explicit’ (not implicit), private ‘assurance’: the President would remove the Jupiters. They nevertheless insisted he had made no ‘deal’ involving ‘our missiles in Turkey for theirs in Cuba’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117812451966">51</xref></sup> This is, frankly, political semantics: what American officials may have seen as merely an ‘explicit assurance’ was for the Soviets, and unbiased observers, an important offer that became part of an agreement.</p>
<p>In 1989, Theodore Sorensen made a ‘confession’ to the Moscow oral history conference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0047117812451966">52</xref></sup> The <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> account, he said, did not faithfully render the Kennedy–Dobrynin meeting. Indeed, it was not how RFK himself had described the discussion. As the book’s ghost ‘editor’, Sorensen had taken it upon himself to alter RFK’s wording.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0047117812451966">53</xref></sup> The original notes were ‘very explicit’, said Sorensen. Removing the missiles ‘was part of the <italic>deal</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0047117812451966">54</xref></sup> Dobrynin himself recalled RFK had portrayed the Jupiters as a significant concession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0047117812451966">55</xref></sup> Sorensen’s revised version matches closely Dobrynin’s telegram to Moscow that fateful evening (and corroborates Khrushchev and Gromyko). The ambassador’s account is widely considered reliable.</p>
<p>Whatever the value added in Sorensen’s confession, it was a significant reversal of the public position traditionally taken by Kennedy administration officials. All had long remained loyal to a common pledge to maintain the secret. As McGeorge Bundy eventually acknowledged: ‘We denied in every forum that there was any deal … we misled our colleagues, our countrymen [sic], our successors, and our allies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0047117812451966">56</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Essence</italic>2 offers a decidedly more ambivalent take on the Jupiter issue than the 1971 edition, and one at variance with the mounting evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0047117812451966">57</xref></sup> Allison and Zelikow accept RFK made an ‘offer’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 129, 361) but simultaneously cast doubt by referring to ‘the offer on the Jupiters, <italic>such as it was</italic> …’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 129, emphasis added). They also quote and seem to accept McGeorge Bundy’s 1988 version of the RFK–Dobrynin meeting – an account that describes something less than a clear offer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0047117812451966">58</xref></sup> They oddly refer to JFK’s 27 October ‘Trollope Ploy’ letter, which ignored Khrushchev’s Jupiter proposal, as the President’s ‘final move’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 363), thereby relegating to a sort of limbo Kennedy’s later response on the Jupiters. <italic>Essence</italic>2 also misleadingly suggests the Jupiter matter was handled subsequent to the crisis ‘through NATO’ (pp. 365–6). In fact, the NATO Council eschewed a formal decision on withdrawal of the Jupiters from Turkey and Italy because, it noted, the countries concerned (Turkey, Italy and the United States) had already settled the matter. More generally, <italic>Essence</italic>2 plays down both the public and secret offers as factors in resolving the crisis (e.g. p. 242). I return to this latter point below.</p>
<p>Allison and Zelikow devote little attention to the two fallback options Kennedy initiated on 27 October in the event Khrushchev rejected the secret Jupiter offer. One option was to arrange a public missile withdrawal deal under the auspices of the United Nations’ acting Secretary-General.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0047117812451966">59</xref></sup> The other, less well-formed, was to call a NATO meeting for Monday 29 October to discuss the Jupiters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0047117812451966">60</xref></sup> Since neither back-up plan proved necessary, their historical importance is easily overlooked. These plans, however, are highly significant. They demonstrate President Kennedy’s commitment to including the Jupiters in the overall agreement and his willingness to take large political risks to do so, if necessary.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom has always been that obtaining Turkey’s agreement to decommissioning the Jupiters during the crisis would have been extremely difficult, if not politically impossible (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 242, 352). New evidence suggests otherwise: at least some Turkish officials were amenable in late October 1962 to such a withdrawal. Space constraints here prohibit details, but a senior Turkish Foreign Ministry figure told a NATO ally directly on 25 October that the government could probably accept decommissioning of the Jupiters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0047117812451966">61</xref></sup> Moreover, some Kennedy administration officials likely obtained this information by 27 October, before RFK left for his fateful meeting with Dobrynin. If so, it was perhaps a key factor behind the secret offer. It may also help explain aspects of the ExComm discussion that day and explain why Ankara so quickly and readily accepted, post-crisis, both the idea and the eventual fact of a US Jupiter withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0047117812451966">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assessments commonly note that the Cuban crisis led directly to the so-called ‘Hot Line’ agreement and to the Partial (nuclear) Test Ban Treaty. Observers disagree on whether the causal factor was a crisis-reinforced fear of nuclear confrontation or a crisis-induced sense of possible superpower cooperation. It was likely both. What these assessments overlook is that the crisis led to, indeed featured, its own arms agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0047117812451966">63</xref></sup> This pact comprised both a limited mutual withdrawal from allied territory of offensive nuclear missiles and an implicit understanding eschewing future deployments. So thoroughly overlooked is this pact that it lacks a name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0047117812451966">64</xref></sup> It was nevertheless the first-ever nuclear arms reduction agreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0047117812451966">
<title>Withdrawing the missiles: making the other Berlin connection</title>
<p>Where did the idea originate for a secret Jupiter side agreement? Some observers point to a telegram from the US ambassador in Ankara (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 252, note 114). But there was an earlier precedent – a secret Kennedy–Khrushchev agreement that resolved the 1961 Berlin tank stand-off.</p>
<p>In October 1961, President Kennedy asked his brother to pass to Moscow a secret message about the ongoing Berlin tank stand-off, using a back-channel contact at the Soviet embassy in Washington. JFK proposed a mutual and staged withdrawal of the tanks facing each other at the Wall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0047117812451966">65</xref></sup> If Khrushchev would remove his tanks, US forces would follow. Khrushchev agreed, the tanks pulled back, and the crisis quickly evaporated. By extraordinary coincidence, JFK made this proposal exactly a year to the day before he asked Robert to convey another secret message – the offer to withdraw US missiles from Turkey.</p>
<p>The Checkpoint Charlie deal and the Jupiter part of the missile crisis agreement have some striking parallels. Both aimed to defuse tense East–West confrontations, both comprised mutual force withdrawal arrangements – an initial Soviet withdrawal of forces followed by an American one – and both employed informal channels and oral rather than written assurances. Moreover, and tellingly, both were done secretly. The 1961 agreement, really a ‘tank withdrawal’ accord, was thus a precedent for the 1962 agreement on withdrawing missiles from Cuba and Turkey. Did the earlier accord consciously serve as a model for the Kennedy brothers and Nikita Khrushchev in October 1962? The parallels would have been hard to miss.</p>

<sec id="section10-0047117812451966">
<title>Withdrawing the missiles: the role of the Jupiters</title>
<p>However ambivalent <italic>Essence</italic>2 is on the nature of the Jupiter ‘offer’ (or promise or assurance), it is crystal clear on its impact. It had none. Dobrynin’s overnight cable arrived on 28 October after Khrushchev had already told the Presidium meeting that they should withdraw the missiles and accept Kennedy’s non-invasion pledge (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 129, 349, 363).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0047117812451966">66</xref></sup> Kennedy’s offer therefore came too late to influence Khrushchev’s ‘decision’ to dismantle and ‘crate’ the R-12s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0047117812451966">67</xref></sup> It is tempting to dismiss Kennedy’s Jupiter offer simply because of this timing – but too easy to do so. The offer may well have affected the Presidium meeting and its formal decision. And it was not unimportant to Soviet policymakers.</p>
<p>To begin with, Khrushchev first told his Presidium colleagues that he was willing to dismantle the missiles not on 28 October but on 25 October (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 349), three days prior. In what sense, then, had Khrushchev ‘decided’? As his letters to Kennedy suggest, Khrushchev changed his mind more than once during the three-day interim, not about withdrawal per se, but about the conditions thereof.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0047117812451966">68</xref></sup> If he had by then made an unconditional decision to withdraw, he could have simply, unilaterally, announced that decision. The fact he did not simply order a retreat on 25, 26 or 27 October suggests he was still deciding what US commitments would comprise an acceptable bargain. He had heard the implied threats. But he had also discerned in Kennedy’s actions and words an American willingness to talk. Khrushchev’s behaviour during those days was that of a man in search of a deal he was trying to ‘haggle’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0047117812451966">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Events on Saturday 27 October certainly deeply worried Khrushchev, in particular the anti-aircraft missile attack on the unarmed U-2 spy plane. His own forces had fired first, contrary to orders. So far, surprisingly, the United States had not retaliated. It was time to call off the ‘haggling’ and cut the best deal possible. Khrushchev was nevertheless quite willing to receive an improved offer.</p>
<p>Second, the Presidium did know about the Dobrynin telegram, containing both RFK’s warning and Jupiter offer, before making its final decision. Allison and Zelikow argue that the telegram affected the mood of the meeting (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 362) but still insist that the secret offer itself had no impact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0047117812451966">70</xref></sup> McGeorge Bundy, who had opposed any such Jupiter offer, up to the end, and who thus has every reason to minimize its importance, acknowledges that ‘no one can say for certain that this additional concession, so small in one sense, did not have its own importance in the speed and clarity of Khrushchev’s final and best decision’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0047117812451966">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, can we simply assume that the actual R-12 missile withdrawal, let alone Moscow’s later withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons, would have necessarily proceeded as they did in the absence of an agreement the terms of which were acceptable to Khrushchev and his colleagues? Many observers did not expect Khrushchev to live up to his promise, and it was perhaps as surprising that he did so as that he made the promise itself. Successful negotiations are those that not only ‘get to yes’, but also get implemented. And policy decisions do not always lead directly to implementing actions – as we know from a considerable literature, including both editions of <italic>Essence</italic>.</p>
<p>Whatever its influence on Soviet decision-making on 28 October, Kennedy’s offer on the Jupiters and their actual withdrawal became integral to the deal – for both sides. Its value to Khrushchev was obvious, allowing him to declare victory of sorts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0047117812451966">72</xref></sup> His letter to Kennedy the following day deliberately noted the secret provision. For its part, Washington proceeded to dismantle, indeed destroy, the obsolete Jupiter missiles with considerable dispatch, even unusual zeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0047117812451966">73</xref></sup> In the 1970s and then again at the 1989 Moscow oral history conference, Andrei Gromyko indicated Moscow always regarded the Jupiter withdrawal as key to the crisis resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0047117812451966">74</xref></sup> And they never redeployed land-based nuclear missiles to Cuba.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0047117812451966">75</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0047117812451966">
<title>Posing other questions</title>
<p>Consider the timing of <italic>Essence</italic>’s three puzzles: Khrushchev’s deployment decision came in April 1962 with the deployment itself occurring between May and October 1962, Kennedy and the ExComm debated the blockade decision from 16 to 21 October, and Moscow approved the R-12 withdrawal on 28 October. The ‘blockade’ is the only American decision here, and no ‘puzzle’ covers any US decisions during the last crucial week of October, nor any decisions during subsequent weeks and months.</p>
<p>We cannot understand the crisis fully without understanding the two leaders’ decisions to negotiate and conclude the agreement. As John Lewis Gaddis emphasizes, Kennedy as well as Khrushchev ‘made some big concessions in the interests of peace’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0047117812451966">76</xref></sup> That some parts of their agreement were public and one part was kept secret only increases the intrinsic importance of at least one additional puzzle: <italic>why did they negotiate the agreement they did</italic>?’ That question has of course been at least partly addressed above.</p>
<p>Other questions arise from perhaps the most sacred of missile crisis-related historical cows – the lingering but wrong-headed notion that the crisis lasted 13 days. This framing of events began with the administration and publication of <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> and continued in the movie of the same title. It is implicit in the term Cubans still use (the ‘October crisis’) and the phrase ‘the missiles of October’, and found even in recent writings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0047117812451966">77</xref></sup> And it remains a feature of <italic>Essence</italic>2, from page 1 (‘those thirteen days of October 1962’), to its reproduction of the October 1962 calendar, to later references (<italic>Essence</italic>2, pp. 77, 327, 366). This myth was challenged long ago; it is time to discard it fully.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0047117812451966">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conceptualizing the crisis as ‘13 days’ blinkers us to important questions about events before 16 October, in November and beyond. One concerns the so-called ‘photo gap’ – whether and why there was a dangerous delay in obtaining hard intelligence on the missile sites under construction in Cuba.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0047117812451966">79</xref></sup> If we extend the crisis into November and December, we can also ask: W<italic>hy did Khrushchev withdraw the tactical nuclear weapons from Cuba</italic>?’ The US intelligence community was late identifying tactical weapons in Cuba and never confirmed their nuclear capability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0047117812451966">80</xref></sup> American threats of attack cannot explain their withdrawal; by the time Khrushchev quietly ordered them out, there was little or no likelihood of an American attack on Cuba. Khrushchev’s removal of these missiles makes more sense in terms of complying fully with the spirit as well as letter of his agreement with Kennedy.</p>
<p>Another puzzle: <italic>‘Why was Kennedy willing to permit a substantial Soviet military presence in post-crisis Cuba?’</italic> Essentially, this is a question about the risks of having both nuclear-capable fighter-bombers and large numbers of Soviet troops remain in Cuba. This puzzle is neglected and not yet well explained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0047117812451966">81</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ‘hits’ in the extensive literature on the Cuban missile crisis include both editions of <italic>Essence of Decision</italic> as well as <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> and more recent contributions such as <italic>One Hell of a Gamble</italic>. The myths about the crisis have been numerous and some quite profound.</p>
<p>The 1971 edition of <italic>Essence</italic> argued strongly for examining the crisis from the organizational and bureaucratic politics perspectives as well as, if not more than, from the rational actor perspective. The considerable historical evidence accrued in stages two and three of missile crisis research has generally not supported the claims about intra-governmental factors, and perhaps even undermined them. (Indeed, the revised edition simply omitted the application of bureaucratic politics to explaining the first puzzle, the missile deployment; little or no evidence emerged to substantiate what had been an engaging but speculative discussion in <italic>Essence</italic>1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0047117812451966">82</xref></sup>) As noted earlier, however, the missile crisis qua crisis was strongly biased against the organizational process and bureaucratic politics models.</p>
<p>My evaluation here of the answers provided to the three famous puzzles has accordingly, if implicitly, emphasized the role of leaders and their calculations. I question aspects of <italic>Essence</italic>2’s conclusions on all three central puzzles: its emphasis on a supposed ‘Berlin’ motive for the missile deployment and its rejection of the ‘defence of Cuba’ motive; its reformulation of the US response to the deployment and its inattention to the Khrushchev–Kennedy agreement as a factor in resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>Long-standing missile crisis myths include that Kennedy had ordered US missiles withdrawn from Turkey prior to the crisis, that threats and superior American military capabilities ‘forced’ Soviet missiles out of Cuba, that ‘talking ‘em out’ was never a serious consideration, and that Kennedy made no deal to end the crisis. <italic>Essence</italic>1 and <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> helped propagate and perpetrate these myths.</p>
<p>The two leaders did trade threats but they then traded offers. Kennedy made a significant concession, to dismantle the Jupiters. The agreement he and Khrushchev constructed was informal but vital, and is still often overlooked. The Jupiter concession was kept secret, although arguably not kept as secret for as long as scholars often assume. The end was ‘much more of a draw than a US victory’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0047117812451966">83</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Essence</italic>2 does not so much dispute these points as it betrays a decided ambivalence towards some. It surely does not consider ‘all’ of the available evidence. More importantly, it does not adequately incorporate certain now well-accepted, key facts. In particular, it relegates the secret Jupiter concession and the Kennedy–Khrushchev agreement to near irrelevance.</p>
<p>The missile crisis was not only a tough case for the organizational and bureaucratic models but also a much less than perfect fit for the Realist form of the rational actor model. Both Khrushchev and Kennedy temporarily pursued objectives that were arguably neither concrete nor lasting national interests, and certainly not all objectively given ones. The available evidence makes clear that both leaders reformulated their perceptions and goals during October 1962, did so fundamentally, and did so in ways that departed from the preferences of close advisors. The two leaders had fears but also listened, learned and changed. Where does that observation lead? Suffice it to say here, the missile crisis may be a rewarding and rich case for a fruitful marriage of rational actor, cognitive and constructivist approaches.</p>
<p>What if JFK had publicly revealed and then defended the <italic>entire</italic> missile crisis agreement with Nikita Khrushchev, including the Jupiter concession? Had he done so, Kennedy would have challenged and might have dented a core 1960s’ Western belief – that the Cold War must be waged by arming heavily and ‘standing up to the communist threat’. Keeping the concession secret facilitated the myths that there had been ‘no deal’ and that the United States had forced Moscow to back down. These myths bolstered Kennedy’s presidency but also powerfully reinforced that core belief about waging the Cold War.</p>
<p>Whatever the actual impact of the Kennedy–Khrushchev agreement on the crisis’ outcome, the mere fact that they were able to reach an agreement amidst those tensions is highly significant. That fact, and the accord’s viability, both illustrate that surviving the Cold War was not ultimately about ideology or threats or military power, let alone nuclear weapons. It was about empathizing and about constructing common interests. To their credit, both leaders soon followed up – Khrushchev advocating superpower arms control even as the crisis was winding down and Kennedy advocating ‘a strategy of peace’ in a June 1963 commencement address. Unfortunately, neither man had by then the time left to pursue new visions.</p>

<p>Allison never succumbed in <italic>Essence</italic>1 to the tendency to refer to the ‘quarantine’, a term coined for the crisis by the State Department legal advisor and widely adopted at the time. The term has not since become common usage by other states in other situations nor become accepted by legal scholars. The dominant opinion now is that the October 1962 blockade was not legal under international law (Don Munton and Elizabeth Rennie, ‘The Cuban Missile Crisis’, in Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.) <italic>Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011)).

<p>Some of this terminology is JFK’s own (Sheldon Stern, <italic>The Week the World Stood Still: Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis</italic> (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2005), p. 140). On a minor point, <italic>Essence</italic>2 spells the abbreviation of the group name as ‘ExCom’, rather than ‘ExComm’. The latter has become the common form and is used here. On a less serious note, I recall a student in the 1990s, puzzled about a lecture of mine referring to the option of a US ‘air strike’, bravely asking why it would have mattered if the airlines had gone on strike.</p></fn>

<p>Abel, <italic>The Missile Crisis</italic>, pp. 191–2. RFK was undoubtedly Abel’s source here.

RFK also claims he told Anatoli Dobrynin that his brother ‘had ordered their removal some time ago’ (pp. 108–9). If he did (which Dobrynin disputes), then the statement was surely misleading, unless ‘some time ago’ could mean earlier that evening when JFK and a few aides agreed to make the Jupiter offer. On the claims of Kennedy aides, see Hafner, ‘<italic>Bureaucratic Politics and “Those Frigging Missiles”</italic>’, pp. 309–14.

Garthoff, however, first brought the secret agreement to light eight years earlier (Raymond Garthoff, ‘Berlin 1961: The Record Corrected’, <italic>Foreign Policy</italic>, 84, Autumn 1991, pp. 142–56).</p></fn>

<p>The documentary evidence is from Fursenko and Naftali, ‘<italic>One Hell of a Gamble</italic>’, pp. 284–6. <italic>Essence</italic>2 also strongly implies a disconnect between the resolution of the crisis and the Jupiter issue (see p. 242).</p></fn>

<p><italic>Essence</italic>2 does not attempt to specify precisely when Khrushchev ultimately ‘decided’ to withdraw the missiles, but implies that it was between 27 October and the Presidium meeting on the 28th (see especially p. 385). Perhaps we need to distinguish between his decision (taken by 25 October) to withdraw the R-12s in principle; a decision (on 27 or 28 October) to accept Kennedy’s public offer (to end the blockade and not invade Cuba), that preceded news of Kennedy’s Jupiter offer; and the formal decision (made and announced on 28 October).</p></fn>

<p>It is unclear what if any evidence substantiates <italic>Essence</italic>2’s claim that the ‘signal’ of Kennedy’s offer ‘was overwhelmed in the general tone of threat and urgency of the Presidium meeting’ (p. 129).</p></fn>

<p>Allison and Zelikow raise the ‘photo gap’ issue, as part of their discussion about the blockade. They also mention in passing the Corona satellite system that by 1961 was replacing the vulnerable U-2 spy plane, but they do not explore why Corona satellites were apparently never tasked to obtain photo intelligence from Cuba.</p></fn>

<p>The claim the United States knew about tactical nuclear weapons ‘late in the crisis’ (<italic>Essence</italic>2, p. 216) is unsubstantiated and likely incorrect. American intelligence discovered some, but not all, Soviet nuclear-capable tactical missiles in Cuba. They assumed the missiles were conventional, which some were, and that none had nuclear warheads, which some did.</p></fn>
