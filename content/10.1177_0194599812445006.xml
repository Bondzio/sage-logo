<body>
<p>We thank Dr Hornibrook for his comments on our article, and we would like to respond to the main points of the letter.</p>
<p>First, the author advises against using the term <italic>subjective benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</italic> (BPPV), although he admits the existence of this clinical entity. We would like to observe that this term is already established and has been reported in several previous publications. However, we presented a detailed in-depth study of this condition, which we believe was missing so far. Also, the author provided 2 possible explanations: the “limited otoconia” theory and psychological factors, especially in the elderly. We agree with the first theory, which we already presented in our article as the most plausible explanation. However, the second interpretation seems to be unlikely because although psychological reactions quite often occur during examination for BPPV, these do not explain phenomena such as the latency of subjective vertigo and unilateral manifestation, which were evident in most cases. In addition, treatment of these patients by canalith repositioning procedures was successful in most of them.</p>
<p>The author claims that using nonobjective evidence and theoretical diagnoses could confuse residents and dissuade them from acquiring sound techniques and that this is a practice that has prevented the progress in vestibular medicine. However, all experienced clinicians know that gold-standard tests are mostly missing in vestibular diseases, and diagnosis is frequently obtained using the patient’s history, subjective criteria, nonspecific tests, and a successful outcome of a therapeutic trial. The most known examples are Menière’s disease and vestibular migraine, and we may still observe that numerous vestibular clinical entities, such as vestibular paroxysmia, vestibular epilepsy, or cervical vertigo, are presently not well defined. We further believe that residents would benefit from dealing with this disorder, mainly in treating successfully their patients, which is the primary goal of a clinician. We proved that treating patients with subjective BPPV results in resolution of their symptoms in most cases, and we believe that this is much more useful than ordering magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to comment on the last paragraph of the letter. Unspecific dizziness, unsteadiness, and falling sensation after a canalith repositioning procedure are well-known symptoms, on which we have commented in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445006">1</xref></sup> Their duration is usually 1 to 2 days, and prolongation for weeks usually means failure of treatment owing to residual otoconia, needing repetition of the procedure. However, these are not relevant to our publication and the present discussion of subjective BPPV.</p>
