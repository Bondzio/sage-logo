<p>This study, conducted among 169 participants in June 2009, is a methodological replica of Labov’s original study of the social stratification of /r/ in three New York City department stores. Results of the 2009 study are compared with Labov’s original survey and Fowler’s replica. Although the distribution patterns of /r/ remain the same as for the two previous studies in terms of stylistic, social, and phonological variables (word-final vs. preobstruent), there have been significant increases in the overall percentages by some 10 to 20 percent, and there are important differences in terms of the age distribution: the 2009 study suggests that lower-middle-class younger speakers use the [r]-less variant considerably less than older speakers, contrary to Labov’s original survey. In addition, although African American informants use less word-final /r/ than whites, especially in preobstruent position, they nevertheless follow the general pattern of stylistic and social differentiation according to the store, suggesting that African Americans are moving toward greater integration within the New York City speech community.</p>

<p>Historically, native New Yorkers vocalize /r/ in coda positions, following the pattern of the prestige dialects in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov [1966] 2006</xref>). However, over the past century, the prestige norm in the United States, based on Midwestern American English, has favored rhoticity in all positions, gradually displacing traditional New York City pronunciations.</p>
<p>Over the past fifty years, William Labov and other linguists have investigated language change and, in particular, the role of different social factors, including age, social class, and gender on language change. Labov has found that language change can be conscious or unconscious—unconscious being when speakers change their linguistic behavior without being aware of it, and conscious being when they are aware of changes. Conscious language change is termed “change from above,” whereas unconscious language change is referred to as “change from below.” More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>:206) claims that change from above is “the product of overt social pressures consonant with the social hierarchy. The process is out in the open for us to observe, in public performances, in the attitudes of teachers in the schools, and in the conscious reactions of some middle-class speakers.” By contrast, change from below is defined “as a gradual shift in the behavior of successive generations, well below the level of conscious awareness of any speakers” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">1966] 2006</xref>:206).</p>
<p>In 1962, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>) completed the “New York department store study,” which examined overt prestige involving class, ethnicity, and gender. He investigated the pronunciation of postvocalic /r/ in New York City speech, in the words <italic>fourth</italic> and <italic>floor</italic>. He carried out this experiment by walking into three different department stores representing different social classes, namely Saks (upper middle class), Macy’s (lower middle class), and S. Klein (working class). In a rapid anonymous survey (a term arising from Labov’s study), he asked clerks about the location of specific items that he knew were on the fourth floor to elicit the words “fourth floor,” which include two instances of postvocalic /r/. He then pretended he had not understood and asked employees to repeat their answers to see if the pronunciation changed in more careful speech.</p>
<p>He found that the employees from Saks used rhotic /r/ most, showing that the overt prestige form in New York City favored rhoticity. Those from Klein’s used it least, likely because they identified more with their working-class clientele, and because it reflected their own frequency of use in their local communities. Finally, employees at Macy’s displayed the greatest upward shift of pronouncing “floor” with a constricted /r/ when they were asked to repeat the answer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>) found that the pronunciation of /r/ increased both socially and stylistically toward greater rhoticity, and he concluded that the more careful the speech, the more likely the /r/ was to be pronounced. He also found that the increased use of /r/ in careful/emphatic speech was most common among the lower middle class (Macy’s) since employees were most likely to be aware of prestige forms, accommodating to upper-middle-class speech (for a detailed description of accommodation theory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0075424211431265">Giles, Coupland, &amp; Coupland 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The department store study has received a great deal of attention over the past decades, and it has been replicated at least once, in 1986 by Joy Fowler, a New York University linguistics major. The current article presents the results of a methodological replica of Labov’s study, conducted in June 2009, and compares it with both previous surveys. In the following sections, the methodology of the survey is presented, followed by the results of the 2009 study, a comparison with the results of the two previous studies, and a discussion of ongoing language change in New York City English based on the social variables of age, ethnicity, and social class.</p>
<p>Most studies on language change are synchronic studies of two or three generations of speakers, relying on an apparent-time interpretation of the results. For example, in his 1961 study of sixty-nine residents of Martha’s Vineyard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0075424211431265">Labov (1972)</xref> found that the nuclei of diphthongs /aw/ and /aj/ were progressively higher with each younger age group (for speakers thirty and older), which could have at least two possible interpretations: either speakers changed the way they spoke during their lifetime and gradually lowered the nuclei of these diphthongs as they grew older (the so-called “age-grading” interpretation), or the older speakers’ diphthongs reflected an earlier state of the language that they acquired as children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0075424211431265">Sankoff 2006</xref>:1). The second hypothesis is referred to as the “apparent-time” interpretation, as explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0075424211431265">Sankoff (2006)</xref>. To show that the second interpretation was the correct one, Labov had to rely on data from four informants interviewed in 1933 for the Linguistic Atlas of New England, data that showed very little raising or centralization of /aw/ or /aj/. Similar arguments have been made in other apparent-time studies, including Clermont and Cedergren’s (1981) study on the change from alveolar [r] to uvular [R] in Montreal French, which also relied on an earlier survey to show that their interpretation of the data as a generational change was essentially correct. It should be added (as argued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0075424211431265">Labov 1972</xref>) that in some cases, both interpretations may be correct, that is, that there may be generational changes, but also changes within individual speakers during their lifetimes, as their relationship with the standard language evolves.</p>
<p>The department store survey, which was conducted in the same locations at three different times, namely, in 1962, 1986, and 2009, constitutes a valuable example of a longitudinal study, more specifically, of a “trend” study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0075424211431265">Sankoff 2006</xref>:7), since we are not working with the same speakers, but with different speakers within the same speech community. With the possible exception of some rare cases, the speakers interviewed in 1962 had retired from Saks or Macy’s by 1986, and certainly by 2009. Despite the advantage of longitudinal studies in resolving the ambiguous interpretations of synchronic studies (apparent time vs. age grading), they too present challenges. First, there is the resampling issue. Second, in the case of an ongoing change that is also socially stratified, such as the variable use of [r] in New York City English, it cannot be claimed beyond a reasonable doubt that the three department stores used in the original study in 1962 still cater to the same clientele in 2009. This caveat may in turn cast some doubt on whether one can conclude that “all things being equal,” the use of [r] is increasing in New York City, since all things are not quite equal. Nevertheless, despite these caveats, this article shows that a detailed comparison of all three studies can produce meaningful insights into an ongoing change in New York City English.</p>
<sec id="section1-0075424211431265" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the 2009 survey of New York City department stores closely followed the original methodology used by Labov in 1962, the rapid anonymous survey. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0075424211431265">Eckert (2005)</xref>, quantitative studies on sociolinguistic variation have evolved in at least three different directions over the past five decades. To begin, Labov and early sociolinguists were interested in the large-scale variation of (mostly phonological) variables, such as rhoticity in New York City. Typically, these were large survey studies of geographically defined communities, with variables as markers of primary social categories such as class, gender, age, ethnic group, and so on. One example is the survey of the Lower East Side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov [1966] 2006</xref>:96-128), and another is the department store study, the focus of this article.</p>
<p>A second wave of studies concentrated more on social networks and criticized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov’s ([1966] 2006</xref>) view of a city as a single speech community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0075424211431265">Milroy (2002</xref>:549) states that “an individual’s social network is straightforwardly the aggregate of relationships contracted with others, and social network analysis examines the differing structures and properties of these relationships.” Thus, beginning in the 1980s, many sociolinguists focused on ethnographic studies of geographically defined communities.</p>
<p>A third wave of variationist studies took a more stylistic perspective, focusing on ethnographic studies of communities of practice. Here, variables are viewed as indices of stances and activities, and styles are used by speakers to construct a social persona. This third wave is closely related to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424211431265">Eckert (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0075424211431265">2000</xref>) in Detroit. In particular, she shows that linguistic variation is not strictly linked to social group membership and that social practices also play a major role, for example urban engagement (such as cruising—driving around in a car for purely social purposes) and institutional engagement (such as participation in extracurricular activities at school).</p>
<p>This brief history is, of course, simplified. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0075424211431265">Eckert (2005)</xref> points out, “These waves are not strictly ordered historically, and no wave supersedes the previous, rather all three waves are part of a whole.” Each wave of variationist research represents different approaches, which are not mutually exclusive. The choice of one or the other approach depends crucially on the researcher’s goals, as well as on practical and time constraints. One major advantage of the brief anonymous survey used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>) is that it neutralizes the “observer’s paradox.” In other words, since participants are not aware that their linguistic behavior is being observed, they are less likely to modify their speech, and the researcher obtains more spontaneous, naturalistic results. In this sense, traditional sociolinguistic surveys falling within the first wave of variationist studies (according to Eckert’s classification) should be considered as valuable tools, even in today’s very different theoretical environment, in describing and documenting changes in progress. However, as mentioned in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0075424211431265">Eckert (2005)</xref>, surveys of groups that take into account only broad social categories such as age or gender do not typically account for differences within each category. For example, speakers’ sociolinguistic attitudes change throughout their life span, and women are not consistently more conservative or more innovative than men in their linguistic choices; thus, looking only at discrete social categories may mask other, perhaps more important differences within these categories and dynamics underlying these categories that are better investigated within the second or third framework.</p>
<p>Despite the caveats, however, one can argue that all three types of studies can shed light on a given linguistic phenomenon, such as social and stylistic variation in New York City and ongoing language change. As will be shown below, the department store (re)study can be used in a dialogue with more recent ethnographic-type studies (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0075424211431265">Becker 2009</xref>), confirming or nuancing some of the conclusions of these studies. The methodologies may be quite different, but using different types of experimental methods only reinforces and enriches our understanding of a given sociolinguistic phenomenon.</p>
<p>In June 2009, I conducted a brief anonymous survey of 169 employees in four Manhattan department stores, namely Saks, Macy’s Herald Square, Loehmann’s, and Filene’s Basement. The original Labov study had used S. Klein as the working-class store. Unfortunately, S. Klein closed down in the 1970s; therefore, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler’s (1986)</xref> study and my study had to find suitable substitutes. Filene’s basement is located in Union Square, close to the original S. Klein department store. Loehmann’s is located on 7th Avenue near 17th Street (two blocks away from Union Square) and caters mainly to a lower-middle and working-class clientele; it offers only items at discount prices, the general layout of the store is cramped, and it has very few floor employees to assist customers. Both lower-class stores were surveyed to obtain a representative sample since they employ very few floor clerks compared to larger stores like Macy’s and Saks. All four stores used in this survey had a fourth floor, which is of course crucial given the question asked to employees.</p>
<p>As in the previous studies, the researcher, who was the only interviewer, approached each employee in the role of a customer asking for the location of a specific item or department, which the interviewer knew very well to be on the fourth floor of the store. When the interviewer asked, for example, “excuse me, where is the Ben &amp; Jerry’s?” (at Macy’s), the employee normally answered “fourth floor.” The interviewer feigned not to understand the response and said “excuse me?” to which the employee again replied “fourth floor,” in careful style. The interviewer then walked away and, out of the view of the informant, wrote down the values for each of the four occurrences of /r/ as [r-1] for the rhotic variant and [r-0] for the vocalized variant, as well as the following social variables: store, occupation, floor within the store, sex, race, age, and foreign or regional accent.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although the rapid anonymous survey provides obvious advantages, such as anonymity and the neutralization of the “observer’s paradox” (since informants do not know they are being observed), it also has several drawbacks, both in terms of the socioeconomic variables and in terms of the coding of the linguistic variables (this is true of all three studies: Labov’s original 1962 survey and both restudies in 1986 and 2009). Although it may be relatively straightforward to note an informant’s presumed sex, ethnicity can be more difficult to establish. For example, some Hispanics of African descent may have been misidentified as African Americans. Similarly, white Latinos without any discernable Spanish accent may have been coded as white. Attributing age to a speaker is also impressionistic, which is why broad age categories were used. Similarly, although I tried to exclude obvious foreign accents, I also in one case excluded a speaker of Southern English, even though he was not, strictly speaking, “foreign.”</p>
<p>In terms of linguistic variation, rhoticity is sometimes difficult to judge: even though both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler (1986)</xref> noted rhoticity in a binary fashion ([r-1] for rhotic [r] and [r-0] for vocalized [r]), this is likely a simplification of the facts; there are probably some ambiguous cases of partial vocalization of [r]. A case in point is a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0075424211431265">Yaeger-Dror et al. (2009)</xref>, which shows that the vocalization of [r] can be difficult to code perceptually, especially in real time, and that this coding varies across multiple coders. In the present study, if the word “floor” was pronounced with a final schwa or without any final segment at all, both cases were coded as [r-0]. An actual acoustic analysis (rather than a perceptual analysis) may have revealed differences in the length of the vocalized [r]; however, this is not feasible in a quick anonymous survey since informants’ responses are not recorded. Nevertheless, the decision to code both the vocalized [r] and deleted [r] as [r-0] is justified since in both cases the rhotic [r] is absent, which is the relevant fact here. In other [r]-less dialects, such as London English, postvocalic [r] is typically realized as a lengthening of the previous vowel, as it appears to be in New York City English. The relevant fact is not whether the preceding vowel is lengthened or whether the postvocalic [r] is pronounced as a schwa or dropped altogether but whether there is any perceptible constriction at the end of the syllable. While it is true that even this may be difficult to ascertain perceptually, it is less difficult to determine than the actual duration of the final schwa or of the lengthening of the previous vowel.</p>
<p>A total of 169 short interviews were conducted, 56 in Saks, 88 in Macy’s, and 25 in Loehmann’s and Filene’s Basement. Of informants, 70 percent were women, 30 percent men. Of the informants, 45 percent were aged twenty to thirty-five, 40 percent aged thirty-six to fifty-five, and the remaining 15 percent from fifty-six to seventy. Finally, 42 percent of the respondents were white, 36 percent African American, 12 percent Hispanic, 5 percent Asian, and 5 percent other/undetermined. It should be noted here that, given that the survey was anonymous, the interviewer could not ask the informants any questions about their age or ethnic identity, so the classifications are somewhat impressionistic.</p>
<p>The following sections present the results of this survey and a comparison of them with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler’s (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov’s ([1966] 2006</xref>) studies. The goal of this comparison is to determine whether the overall frequency of postvocalic [r] has increased in New York City since 1962, which would indicate a change in progress toward Standard American English, and also whether the distribution of postvocalic [r] has changed in relation to the social variables mentioned above, namely age, social class, and ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0075424211431265" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In the following sections, [r-1] and [r-0] refer to specific realizations of the variable /r/, namely, “a constricted central glide-consonant or the absence of such a consonant, respectively” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov [1966] 2006</xref>:47). As mentioned in the previous section, the letters R1, R2, R3, and R4 refer to the four successive tokens of postvocalic [r] pronounced by the informants in their responses: the first two tokens of [r] in “fourth floor” are noted as R1 and R2, and the two tokens of [r] in the second (repeated) instance of “fourth floor” are noted as R3 and R4, respectively. The expression “all [r-1]” refers to speakers who used [r-1] consistently in all four tokens, “some [r-1]” to speakers who used [r-1] at least once, and “no [r-1]” to speakers who used only [r-0], that is, speakers of a pure [r]-less dialect.</p>
<sec id="section3-0075424211431265">
<title>Overall Stratification of /r/ by Store</title>
<p>In terms of the overall use of the rhotic variant (noted as [r-1]) in all four positions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0075424211431265">Table 1</xref> illustrates a steady increase in rhoticity over the past five decades in both Macy’s and Saks, from 20 percent (1962 study) to 43 percent (2009 study) in Macy’s and from 29 to 54 percent in Saks. There is no such change in the lowest ranking department stores, although here the results must be treated with caution since, as already mentioned, in both subsequent studies the original store had closed. Substitutes were nevertheless included in the 1986 and 2009 restudies to replicate the original study as closely as possible.</p>

For Saks, the percentage of [r-1] for “floor” has increased to 80 percent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0075424211431265">Figure 3</xref>) compared with 65 percent in the original study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0075424211431265">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The position of /r/ (word finally, or before the obstruent [θ] in “fourth”) also seems to have a significant effect on the realization of [r]: it is apparently disfavored in word-final consonant clusters. In fact, the effect of the phonological environment on the production of [r] has been documented in studies of African American English, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0075424211431265">Blake, Shousterman, and Kelley (2009)</xref>, who argue that a following interdental fricative like [θ] disfavors [r-1]. This effect is confirmed by data from African American informants in our study, which we discuss below.</p>

<title>The Effect of Race</title>
<p>In our restudy, no statistically significant difference was found between men and women. For this reason, this section focuses only on differences between African Americans and the general population.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0075424211431265">Labov (2001</xref>:506) and others have claimed that the children of nonwhite ethnic minorities in the United States do not generally participate in sound changes that characterize white Americans’ speech. Empirical studies of ongoing sound change diverge in terms of whether linguistic minorities adopt local innovations in their English. This study contributes to the debate since, on one hand, African American New Yorkers follow the same trend as white New Yorkers (i.e., toward increasing rhoticity), while at the same time they exhibit a different distribution than whites, both in terms of the phonetic environment and in terms of the overall frequency of [r-1], which remains lower than that of white speakers. This ambiguity is discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0075424211431265">Fought (2006</xref>:144), who argues that some recent studies support Labov’s generalization, and that “it is fair to conclude that in some areas of the USA the assertion is valid, particularly for African Americans.” However, she quickly adds that “to generalize it to all minority ethnic groups in all geographical areas seems clearly premature” (144). For example, one recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0075424211431265">Roeder (2006)</xref> investigates whether Mexican Americans in Lansing, Michigan, have acquired the four vowels typical of the Northern Cities Shift (NCS). This shift is characterized by the raising and fronting of /æ/, the fronting of back /α/, the lowering of / /, and the backing and lowering of /ϵ/. Roeder finds that young Mexican American women have acquired NCS /æ/, but that pronunciations of the other three vowels are different from NCS norms for most participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0075424211431265">Hall-Lew and Starr (2010)</xref> report that young Asian Americans in the San Francisco area participate in the ongoing merger of the low-back vowel classes (lot and thought) as well as in the fronting of the nuclei of the mid- and high-back vowels (goose and goat), which are documented ongoing changes among white Californians.</p>
<p>The department store study can also be used to argue for or against the commonly held view that ethnic minorities in the United States do not participate in majority sound changes. In all three surveys (1962, 1986, and 2009), the linguistic behavior of African Americans was analyzed and compared with that of white Americans.</p>
<p>In Labov’s original study, 12 percent of African American employees at Macy’s used [r-1] in all positions, 35 percent used it in some positions, and 53 percent never pronounced the [r] in the coda position, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0075424211431265">Table 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov [1966] 2006</xref>:51). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov ([1966] 2006</xref>:49-50) mentions that, in the distribution of /r/ for African-American employees, “it is evident that the presence of many AA informants will contribute to a lower use of (r-1). The AA subjects at Macy’s used less (r-1) than the white informants, to a certain extent.” I found the same effect in the 2009 survey.</p>

<title>The Effect of Age</title>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, synchronic studies on language change often rely on an apparent-time interpretation of results. Typically, to argue for the apparent-time interpretation, the researcher needs to rely on earlier records of the same speech community, showing for example that a given feature (in this case, [r]- lessness) was more prevalent fifty or one hundred years ago than it is today. For the purposes of the present study, there is robust, documented evidence going back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0075424211431265">Babbitt (1896)</xref> that, in New York city, [r]-lessness is gradually being replaced by the standard North American alveolar approximant /r/, denoted in the IPA as [®] and referred to in Labov’s study as (r-1).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211431265">Labov’s ([1966] 2006</xref>) results show an increase in use of [r-1] at Macy’s among older speakers: 21 percent of speakers fifteen to thirty years old use all r-1, and this percentage increases to 39 percent for the fifty-five to seventy age group in this study. What is interesting in Labov’s data is that while at Saks the new norm (rhoticity) is most evident in the speech of the youngest respondents, at Macy’s the constricted /r/ is more prevalent among older speakers. This difference suggests that at the time of the 1962 study, in contrast to our 2009 restudy, “members of the lower middle class only become aware of the new norm as their social contacts and social awareness expands as they grow older. Hence they begin to shift toward the new norm at a later age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0075424211431265">Bailey 2004</xref>:327-328). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler (1986</xref>:8) reports that her “findings on the percentages of LMC (Macy’s) speakers today using r-full pronunciation do not indicate that there has actually been a great increase among the younger speakers toward the norm.” In other words, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler (1986)</xref> finds the same pattern of age grading as in the original study, although the overall rate of [r]-fulness has increased over the twenty-four years.</p>
<p>By contrast, the 2009 survey suggests a reverse correlation, with younger speakers favoring rhoticity in all three stores and older speakers preferring the [r]-less pronunciation more frequently, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0075424211431265">Figure 5</xref>. At Macy’s, the difference in use of [r-1] in “fourth” is especially significant between the thirty-five to fifty-five years of age (60 percent) and the fifty-five to seventy years of age groups (20 percent), whereas at Saks the difference is more gradual between each age group (65 percent vs. 60 percent). Overall, younger speakers (twenty to thirty-five years of age) favor rhoticity in all positions (almost 60 percent of cases), whereas among older speakers (fifty-five to seventy years of age) the frequency is under 10 percent. At Loehmann’s and Filene’s Basement, the mean value for [r-1] is zero for speakers aged thirty-five to fifty-five and fifty-five to seventy; in this sample, they never pronounce the [r] postvocalically.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0075424211431265-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To conclude this section, there appear to be correlations between overall use of [r] and the variables of age, store, and race. In the 2009 study, (1) younger speakers tend to pronounce [r] in coda position (both preobstruent and word-final) more frequently than older speakers in all stores, contrary to both the original 1962 survey and the 1986 resurvey; (2) upper-and middle-class speakers favor rhoticity more than lower-middle-class informants, as they did in both previous surveys; and (3) African Americans overall use less [r-1] than white speakers, and also avoid [r] in preobstruent positions, although they seem to follow the same general social stratification in the use of [r] as the general New York City population.</p>

<title>Real-Time versus Apparent-Time Studies</title>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, most studies on language change in progress are apparent-time studies, for obvious reasons: one does not always have the time or luxury of waiting twenty-five or fifty years to complete a real-time study on language change. The problem with apparent-time studies is that speakers, throughout their lifetimes, often make sociolectal adjustments, as evidenced by Labov’s data on speakers at Macy’s in 1962, where older speakers tend to adopt more prestige values (more [r-1]) than younger speakers. Given that older speakers do not necessarily speak as they did when they were teenagers, an apparent-time survey of three generations of speakers will not necessarily reflect actual changes in progress.</p>
<p>Taken together, the three surveys examined here (Labov’s 1962 study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler’s 1986</xref> restudy, and the 2009 survey) constitute a good example of a real-time study of phonetic change in progress. And while this type of evidence can provide clear insight into the social mechanisms of language change, it also has some drawbacks. There are issues of comparability, sample design, and demographic changes in the target population. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, the original working-class store, Klein, closed in the 1970s, so that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler (1986)</xref> had to find a suitable substitute, May’s. This store closed in the 1990s, and in the 2009 study two alternate working-class stores with fourth floors had to be chosen: Filene’s Basement on Union Square and Loehmann’s. Although this may first appear as a major drawback, the most interesting results in terms of social and age stratification are found in the lower- and upper-middle-class stores, namely, Macy’s and Saks, both of which still exist in the same locations. A second issue has to do with demographic changes in the surveyed population: in 1962, most employees in all three stores were white, while by 2009 almost all employees at the working-class stores, and most employees at Macy’s, were either African American or Hispanic. Given that the ethnic and linguistic makeup of the informants has changed, to what extent are the three studies comparable, even though they were conducted in the same stores with the exact same methodology (the rapid anonymous survey)?</p>
<p>One argument in favor of comparability is that, in sociolinguistic surveys on language contact and language change, the notion of “place” is a central concept in explaining linguistic behavior. Speakers tend to adopt the norms of the communities they live in, irrespective of the linguistic norms of their parents or families. In this sense, surveys on language change are not concerned with changes in individual linguistic behavior but rather with changes in shared social norms and in the social stratification of these norms over time. In other words, it is irrelevant in this study whether the actual speakers interviewed in the 1962, 1986, or 2009 (re)studies are the same or even belong to the same ethnic group. What matters here is that they live and work in the same community (i.e., New York City), in the same place, and therefore are representatives of that specific community, even as the ethno-linguistic makeup of that community changes over time. It should be added, however, that it is likely that some of the employees in all three stores are not native New Yorkers. Although speakers with obvious foreign accents were excluded from the statistical analyses, the issue of nativeness remains an issue since some of the younger employees working in retail in New York City today may not be native New Yorkers; they might be, for example, students at local universities who moved recently to the city. In other words, and influx of speakers from r-ful regions may also be responsible for some of the apparent rise in [r-1] among younger speakers.</p>
<p>It has often been said that ethnic minorities in the United States (e.g., African Americans or Hispanics) are not full participants in changes in progress. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0075424211431265">Labov (2001</xref>:506) claims that “those children that are integral members of a sub-community that American society defines as ‘nonwhite’—Black, Hispanic or Native American— . . . no matter how frequently they are exposed to the local vernacular, the new patterns of regional sound change do not surface in their speech.” However, as explained in the following section, recent studies on New York City English suggest otherwise.</p>

<sec id="section8-0075424211431265">
<title>Phonetic Changes in [r]-lessness in NYC English over the Past Fifty Years</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, this study is a methodological replica of two identical surveys conducted in 1962 and 1986. A comparison of the results reveals both similarities and differences among the three studies. The 2009 study shows the same general pattern of social and stylistic stratification of [r] as the original 1962 survey since use of [r-1] is higher in careful or emphatic contexts as well as in upper-middle- and upper-class stores. Also, all three surveys suggest that the preobstruent position (“fourth”) disfavors the use of [r] for most speakers, compared to word-final position (“floor”).</p>
<p>However, the 2009 study suggests that important changes have occurred over the past five decades. First, the overall use of [r] has increased dramatically, especially in the high-end stores like Saks, where the highest value (in position R4, “floor”) is over 80 percent, compared with 60 percent in 1962. Second, while both Labov’s original study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211431265">Fowler’s 1986</xref> restudy found that at Macy’s older speakers used more [r-1] than younger speakers, the 2009 survey reveals an opposite effect, suggesting that the variable use of [r] is indicative not only of social stratification but also of a phonetic change in progress. This phonetic change is almost complete at Saks, where [r-1] is used in approximately 80 percent of cases. As discussed earlier, while the new age pattern is what we might expect of a maturing language change, the original pattern was the reverse for lower-middle-class speakers.</p>
<p>Another interesting result of the 2009 study is a complex interplay among the variables of race, social class, and phonological environment in the use of [r] by African American employees. On one hand, African Americans tend to vocalize [r] in coda positions more than whites and are more sensitive to the phonological environment: they use [r-1] twice as much in word-final position (“floor”) than in preobstruent positions (“fourth”). On the other hand, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0075424211431265">Figure 4</xref> illustrates, African Americans display the same social stratification in the use of [r] as other groups, since at Saks the mean value for [r-1] in this group is above 50 percent, whereas at Loehmann’s and Filene’s Basement the value is well below 20 percent. In a sense, African Americans in New York City are taking part in the shift toward [r]-fullness, although they are also more successful than white speakers at maintaining a distinct linguistic identity and avoiding dialect leveling pressures from mainstream American English.</p>
<p>The general increase in rhoticity quantified in this study is confirmed by other studies involving fieldwork in New York City. For example, Becker (2006:646) notes,<disp-quote>
<p>[C]ompletely non-rhotic as late as 1890 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0075424211431265">Babbitt 1896</xref>), NYCE is slowly becoming rhotic as part of a general rhotacization of all American English dialects that were non-rhotic. . . . In 1966, Labov found rates of [r-1] as low as zero for working-class speakers in casual speech. Today, the Lower East Siders are, on average, 36 percent rhotic.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the increase in rhoticity is slower in New York City than in other regions of the United States, so that use of [r-1] or [r-0] still represents a social class marker; it is also used to express place and social identities, with speakers shifting from one pronunciation to another depending on the topic or interlocutor.</p>
<p>Labov’s department store study and the subsequent resurveys at twenty-four-year intervals are significant both as a methodological tool—the rapid anonymous survey—and as real-time studies of phonetic change in New York City. The overall increase in rhoticity in New York City is symptomatic of a change in the United States as a whole over the past one hundred years, and it is an indication that some features of New York City English are slowly disappearing as New Yorkers adopt standard North American linguistic patterns. At the same time, as recent studies have shown (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0075424211431265">Becker 2009</xref>), distinctive phonetic features such as postvocalic /r/ remain important markers of social identity in New York City, as its inhabitants continue to negotiate between overt prestige (in this case, rhoticity) and covert prestige—the sense of belonging to a local community. In this restudy, both the use of [r-1] and [r-0] and the relative percentages of each value of the variable are indices suggesting membership in different and even multiple communities, since for example African Americans follow the general stratification of [r] between department stores, as do most New Yorkers, yet still maintain a distinct identity since the percentages are quite different from those for whites, in terms of both their overall use of [r-1] and the positions in which [r-1] is more likely to occur. More detailed studies are needed, and indeed some preliminary studies have recently been published (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0075424211431265">Becker 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0075424211431265">Becker &amp; Wong 2008</xref>), on the linguistic behavior of subgroups within the New York City speech community, for example, African Americans and Asian Americans.</p>
