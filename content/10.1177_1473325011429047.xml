<abstract>
<p>Individuals receiving home-based hospice services often rely upon family members and friends to serve as informal caregivers responsible for managing the full range of emotional, psychological, spiritual, and physical symptoms. The purpose of this in-depth, grounded theory study was to develop a theoretical model of the processes by which informal hospice caregivers, who often lack formal training, acquire knowledge and skills related to symptom management. Findings indicate that, motivated by a commitment to care, caregivers seek competence in symptom management by learning/doing, consulting with professionals, and personalizing their caregiving approach. The ongoing nature of the development of symptom management knowledge and skills provides multiple opportunities for intervention by hospice social workers and other members of the interdisciplinary team.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011429047" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2009, approximately 1.56 million terminally ill individuals and their family members received services from a hospice agency in the United States (National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429047">NHPCO], 2010</xref>). The goal of hospice care is not to provide treatment intended to cure disease or prolong life. Rather, it is to ensure that patients experience a death that is as natural, dignified, and comfortable as they choose. In order to support patients and families in a holistic manner, hospice agencies typically provide a wide range of services, including care from nurses, social workers, chaplains, physicians, other health care professionals, and volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011429047">Wittenberg-Lyles et al., 2007</xref>). While some hospice patients receive services in long-term care facilities or inpatient settings, support from hospice personnel often enables individuals to die in their own homes with care from family members or friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429047">McMillan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011429047">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>). These individuals, referred to herein as <italic>informal caregivers</italic>, are the focus of this study.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011429047"><title>Informal hospice caregivers</title>
<p>Informal caregivers are critical to the provision of home hospice services. As dying individuals become increasingly debilitated, they often require assistance from family members and friends to complete activities of daily living, administer medications, manage physical pain and other distressful symptoms, and communicate with health care professionals. Informal hospice caregivers may also be called upon to lift or move patients, provide oral and personal hygiene, and provide emotional or spiritual support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011429047">Haley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011429047">McMillan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011429047">NHPCO, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although they are routinely called upon to perform relatively sophisticated caregiving tasks and to make important health care decisions, informal hospice caregivers often lack formal nursing or medical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011429047">Rabow et al., 2004</xref>). Lack of sufficient and accurate training may result in ill-prepared caregivers who are at increased risk of significant caregiving burden and who may also pose a serious threat to the quality of care provided to the hospice patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011429047">Houts et al., 1996</xref>). Clearly, obtaining a thorough understanding of how family members and friends learn to provide care to a dying loved one would benefit hospice social workers and other members of the interdisciplinary team who are charged with the task of supporting informal caregivers during this challenging time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to explore the processes by which family members and friends of hospice patients learned to provide care to their dying loved one. Given the importance of symptom management at the end of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011429047">Steinhauser et al., 2000</xref>), the focus of the study was narrowed to tasks specific to responding to patients’ symptoms. Specifically, the following research question guided the study: <italic>How do informal hospice caregivers acquire knowledge and skills related to symptom management?</italic></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011429047" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Grounded theory methodology was determined to be well suited for this study given its focus on elucidating psychosocial processes with the goal of developing theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429047">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). This method involved focused exploration of caregivers’ experiences and was based on the assumption that informal hospice caregivers’ training and development was influenced by many factors including, but certainly not limited to, direct instruction from hospice personnel. The full research process began with recruitment of participants.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011429047"><title>Recruitment procedures</title>
<p>This study was conducted in cooperation with two hospice agencies serving distinct geographic regions of one Midwestern state. During regularly scheduled hospice intake visits, admissions personnel informed all patients and caregivers receiving home-based services that the hospice agency was involved in a research project designed to improve professionals’ understanding of the caregiving experience. At that time, the admitting staff member asked for written permission to share the caregiver’s name and contact information with the researcher. If permission was granted, the researcher contacted the caregiver by phone within 48 hours of receiving notification in order to schedule an appointment to provide additional information about the study either during an in-home visit or by telephone. During the meeting, the researcher informed the caregiver of what his or her participation in the study would entail and read aloud the verbal consent statement approved by both hospice agencies and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the sponsoring academic institution. Consenting caregivers were then given the option of participating in an in-depth interview at that time or scheduling an appointment for a future interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011429047"><title>Sampling</title>
<p>Participants were recruited according to a theoretical sampling plan designed to maximize diagnostic diversity, specifically recruiting a combination of caregivers of hospice patients with cancer and caregivers of individuals with other terminal diagnoses. Theoretical sampling required that data collection continue until saturation of major categories was achieved (described more fully later). An attempt was made to secure a sufficiently diverse sample in terms of other characteristics as well (e.g. age, gender, relationship to patient, occupational history, etc.). This was successful for all categories except gender. Caregiver characteristics are described in detail in the results section below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011429047"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were primarily collected during individual interviews of informal hospice caregivers, ranging in time from 30 to 60 minutes. Each caregiver was interviewed at least once and was given the option of participating in a second interview approximately 14 to 21 days after the first interview. This timeframe was designed to decrease attrition of study participants due to the death of the patient for whom they were providing care. This consideration was critical because the median length of service for hospice patients is just over 21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429047">NHPCO, 2010</xref>), which presented significant challenges. Interviews took place either face-to-face in locations convenient for the participants or by telephone for those individuals who declined an in-home visit.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on any one particular symptom, caregivers were encouraged to reflect on how they learned to respond to the full range of symptoms experienced by hospice patients. This was important because research has shown that hospice patients are distressed by many different types of symptoms, ranging from physical symptoms (e.g. physical pain, shortness of breath) to more emotional symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety), though lack of energy and physical pain are most common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011429047">Kutner et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, hospice patients may experience multiple symptoms simultaneously, either because the symptoms are associated with one another or occur in symptom clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011429047">Aktas et al., 2010</xref>) or because of the concurrent presence of more than one disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011429047">Head et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of early interviews resulted in the identification of emerging categories that were then explored in subsequent interviews. Therefore, the specific focus of the interviews evolved throughout the course of the study. All interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a contracted service prior to analysis. QSR NVivo 8 qualitative data management software was used to store data and organize analysis-related tasks. All electronic data and corresponding files were stored on an encrypted, password-protected external drive and backed up on an approximately biweekly basis to a second drive (also encrypted and password-protected). The researcher verified interview transcripts by simultaneously listening to the audio recording of the interview and reading the transcribed content. During this process, all identifying information was removed from the transcript and a unique pseudonym was assigned to each participant to ensure confidentiality of the study material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011429047"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis and data collection occurred concurrently, allowing the researcher to apply a recursive constant comparative method in which insights gleaned from analysis efforts informed ongoing data collection and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011429047">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011429047">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429047">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Specific analysis efforts were largely governed by guidelines provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011429047">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref>. Consistent with Strauss and Corbin’s approach, data analysis began with open coding during which labels were applied to segments of data on both a descriptive, semantic level and on a deeper, more abstract level where appropriate. After all interview transcripts had been subject to open coding, the researcher began axial coding. Axial coding involved grouping coded data into categories which were further refined based on analysis and consideration of the data. In addition, relationships among categories were discovered, leading to selective coding which involved identification and further refinement of categories and relationships deemed vital to the study’s core research question. Selective coding also permitted the further abstraction of categories, resulting in a deeper understanding of the process under investigation. Data collection and analysis continued until sufficient data were obtained to saturate the identified theoretical concepts. Categories were considered saturated when additional data collection neither produced new theoretical insights nor further developed understanding of the existing categories. The result of these analytic steps was the generation of a theoretical model describing how caregivers acquire knowledge and skills related to symptom management.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011429047"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Study findings provide a set of conceptually significant categories used to develop a theory of informal hospice caregivers’ acquisition of knowledge and skills related to symptom management, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1473325011429047">Figure 1</xref>. Findings were derived from data collected from 15 hospice caregivers who participated in at least one interview. Seven of the 15 participants also participated in a follow-up interview 14–21 days after the first interview, resulting in a total of 22 interviews. Of the eight caregivers who did not participate in follow-up interviews, seven were ineligible to do so because they were no longer actively caregiving due to their loved one’s death. One participant declined to participate in a follow-up interview, stating she was ‘exhausted’ as a result of the increased care her dying husband required. No substantive differences were noted with regard to findings informed by data obtained from caregivers who participated in only one interview when compared to those who also participated in a follow-up interview.

</fig></p>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011429047"><title>Demographic characteristics of participants</title>
<p>Participants included 15 women who were actively providing care for a family member receiving hospice services. Efforts to recruit male caregivers were largely unsuccessful. One potential male participant whose mother was receiving hospice services expressed initial interest in the study; however, he was ultimately excluded as it became evident during the early stages of his first interview that his wife was primarily responsible for managing his mother’s care.</p>
<p>Participants’ ages ranged from 37 to 76 years with an average age of 57 years. The ages of the hospice patients for whom they were providing care ranged from 49 to 98 years with an average age of 80 years. Seven of the women were providing care for their husbands, four for their mothers, two for their grandmothers, one for her mother-in-law, and one for her brother. One woman reported her highest level of education as less than high school, six completed high school, five completed some college coursework, and three received an undergraduate degree. Only one participant continued to work full-time while caregiving, another worked part-time, while the remaining women were either retired, unemployed, or had taken a leave of absence from their regular employment. The women were caring for family members with an array of terminal diagnoses including congestive heart failure (5), lung disease (4), cancer (3), stroke (2), and kidney disease (1). In addition to their responsibilities as informal hospice caregivers, six women provided care to at least one individual other than their family member who was receiving hospice services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325011429047"><title>Findings overview</title>
<p><italic>Commitment to caring</italic> was the central phenomenon that emerged from the data and served as the core category from which the remainder of the theory was generated. This commitment resulted in a strong motivation for caregivers to relieve distressful symptoms experienced by the patient for whom they were providing care. As a result, caregivers sought to become competent at managing patient symptoms. This involved three processes: <italic>learning/doing</italic>, during which caregivers’ experiences acquiring knowledge and skills (learning) and applying knowledge and skills (doing) informed one another on an ongoing basis; <italic>consulting professionals</italic>; and <italic>personalizing symptom management</italic>. As will become evident during the remaining discussion of the theoretical model, informal hospice caregivers adopted a broad definition of patient ‘symptoms’, voicing a commitment to caring for patients in a physical and emotional sense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1473325011429047"><title>Commitment to caring</title>
<p>All 15 caregivers voiced a commitment to caring for their loved one. This dedication drove all subsequent caregiving behaviors. The following interview extracts illustrate this commitment in more detail (note that pseudonyms are used rather than actual participants’ names).
<list id="list1-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Fran: <italic>[My mother] and I have always had a special relationship … I got in trouble when I was young, and I had a baby out of wedlock. Mother was there, and not all of them are. And when it came to the question of whether to put her in a home, I felt like she took care of me, so it’s my job to take care of her now.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nancy: <italic>It’s not easy, you know. Nobody said it was gonna be, and it’s not. But it’s, you know, it’s worth it. If it’s somebody you really love, you know, you want to do it, you want to be there.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interviewer: <italic>Is there anything about you that … makes the way that you care for [your husband] unique?</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Betty: <italic>No.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interviewer: <italic>No?</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Betty: <italic>(pause) Love.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interviewer: <italic>Well that’s an important factor.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Betty: <italic>I mean, that’s it. But, you know, I would do the same for anybody, though. You gotta like people, and you’ve gotta care for people. If you don’t, you ain’t worth a darn.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Whether due to a desire to reciprocate care provided in the past, due to emotional connection, or simply due to the belief that caring is a universally human responsibility, participants discussed a commitment to care. This commitment generated a strong motivation for caregivers to relieve distressful symptoms and to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to do so effectively. As a result of this motivation, caregivers sought competence in symptom management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325011429047"><title>Seeking competence in symptom management</title>
<p>Seeking competence in symptom management occurred in three different ways. The first, <italic>learning/doing</italic>, was a less intentional process than the others and occurred naturally as caregivers gained knowledge and skills through practical caregiving experiences. The second, <italic>consulting with professionals</italic>, was a more intentional activity on the part of the caregiver and involved active efforts to involve health care professionals in decision-making about symptom management issues. The third, <italic>personalizing symptom management</italic>, was a process by which caregivers tailored their symptom management responses to their loved one based on an in-depth knowledge of the patient as a person. To varying degrees, each caregiver discussed seeking competence in symptom management through these three processes.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1473325011429047"><title>Learning/doing</title>
<p>Participants described a process of <italic>learning/doing</italic> by which they acquired knowledge and skills related to symptom management. Much of their learning occurred during ‘hands-on’ experiences rather than specific training sessions, making ‘learning’ and ‘doing’ interwoven processes in the minds of participants. The following interview extract describes one caregiver’s experiences with learning/doing.
<list id="list2-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Monica: <italic>You learn through, you know, going to the doctor and this happening and that happening and something else happening. And so that, you know, you get this knowledge … I mean, that’s just how you learn.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Most participants were providing care to a patient receiving services for a chronic rather than acute illness. Many had been caring for their loved one for years before hospice services were initiated. In those instances, much of the caregivers’ <italic>learning/doing</italic> had begun years, sometimes decades, before hospice involvement. After hearing the following woman describe a very sophisticated pain management regimen, the interviewer explored the participant’s caregiving history.
<list id="list3-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Interviewer: <italic>So for 12 years you’ve been providing care?</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Carol: <italic>At least, yeah. But, [my husband] also has systemic lupus … we’ve been treating him for a long time. Since about ’82.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Through ‘doing’ caregiving for over 25 years, the caregiver had learned a significant amount about her husband’s medical conditions and viewed herself as a competent symptom manager long before she and her husband began receiving hospice support. Lengthy caregiving experiences were typical of participants in the study, leading many to identify <italic>learning/doing</italic> as a key process in their development as symptom managers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1473325011429047"><title>Consulting with professionals</title>
<p>Without exception, participants indicated that health care professionals played a key role in their training as symptom managers. Many cited the support of the hospice as a particularly valuable resource. However, the manner in which caregivers used this support varied. In fact, the broader category <italic>consulting with professionals</italic> was created through the joining of data originally coded as two separate categories: <italic>following orders</italic> and <italic>partnering with professionals</italic>. For some caregivers, their consultation with professionals consisted largely of explaining the patient’s symptoms and carefully following the instructions provided by hospice personnel. This approach, originally labeled with the in vivo code <italic>following orders</italic>, is illustrated by the following interview extracts.
<list id="list4-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Interviewer: <italic>So, how did you learn to treat the pain?</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Monica: <italic>Well, just follow the doctor’s orders.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Betty: <italic>And that’s one thing I would do. I would call the nurse and ask her first before I would [administer medications on an ‘as needed’ basis] … . If you’ve got any questions, ask [the nurse] … That’s a definite in my book.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lynn: <italic>And I found out I don’t know anything about anxiety. I found all that out since I’ve been taking care of [my husband] and through [the hospice nurse] and talking with her.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Other caregivers viewed their relationship with hospice as more collaborative. Rather than just ‘following orders’, they took an active part in making decisions about symptom management, relying on professional consultation only when their initial efforts were ineffective or in order to generate additional ideas. This approach was adopted by the following caregivers.
<list id="list5-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Molly: <italic>The day that Granny got … very hypoxic, I couldn’t figure it out … Her oxygen was on, the machine was running. I laid her down, and could not figure it out … I had given her her morphine and her Lorazepam and cough syrup and, you know, everything I could think of to do, and I just used the nurse as a sounding board, and they’re like ‘Hmm, we’ll come check her.’</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Kathy: <italic>I like … the educational support that [hospice] gives people … . some people just don’t want to ask for help, you know, but it comes to the point where it’s kind of out of our hands a little bit … [I can] ask for suggestions … I think it’s good for the medical help and the emotional help, you know.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Although the nature of their relationship with health care professionals differed, participants consistently cited external consultation as an important process in their acquisition of knowledge and skills related to symptom management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1473325011429047"><title>Personalizing symptom management.</title>
<p>Each of the women in the study arrived at her hospice caregiving role after sharing a lengthy personal relationship with the patient for whom she was providing care. For some caregivers that pre-existing social relationship had been life-long. For others, the relationship represented a life partnership. Throughout the study, each of the caregivers described how the years during which those relationships unfolded influenced the strategies they used to respond to their dying loved one’s needs. In essence, they described a process of <italic>personalizing symptom management</italic>. The intimacy encompassing the caregiving experience was nicely summarized by Nancy, a spousal caregiver who explained, ‘<italic>I think, you know, just being around a person for 50 years, you’re part of them</italic>.’ The following examples illustrate the ways in which caregivers tailored their symptom management strategies based on knowing the dying individual as a person, not a patient.
<list id="list6-1473325011429047" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Fran: <italic>I had to learn a long time ago how to read her because sometimes she didn’t always complain of pain. You know? Because she was always one to just kind of stuff it and, you know, take it until it was almost unbearable.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rhonda: <italic>How would you know she was having a [urinary tract infection]?</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caregiver: <italic>She wouldn’t eat as well … She would get crabbier.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>_________</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Monica: <italic>[Someone from hospice] would ask him, ‘Well, what’s your pain level?’ Well, he may say it’s a one. He’s a very high pain tolerance person … . I’m not saying that he lied or whatever, but he would sometimes, you know, sugar coat the pain level, you know … and say that it’s better than it was.</italic></p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Having a personal relationship with the care recipient allowed caregivers to detect subtle behavioral and emotional changes that corresponded to physical symptoms and to interpret communication with health care professionals with an ‘insider’s view’ of the patient’s personality and preferences. This was widely cited as an advantage of informal caregiving over less personalized symptom management approaches.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1473325011429047"><title>Employing symptom management strategies</title>
<p>As a result of their experiences seeking symptom management competence, caregivers were equipped with knowledge and a skill set used to respond to the physical and emotional symptoms of the loved ones for whom they provided care. <italic>Employing symptom management strategies</italic> naturally followed the acquisition of knowledge and skills. However, as previously described, this led to additional learning as caregivers grew increasingly experienced and informed with regard to the symptoms accompanying terminal illness, creating a feedback loop in the model and reinforcing the ongoing nature of caregiver training and skill development. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1473325011429047">Figure I</xref>, informal hospice caregivers continue to develop as symptom managers throughout the duration of their caregiving experience.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to develop a model illustrating the ways in which informal hospice caregivers acquire knowledge and skills related to symptom management. Participants described a process in which, driven by a commitment to caring and a motivation to relieve discomfort, they sought symptom management competence by learning/doing, consulting with professional health care providers, and tailoring their symptom management responses to the individualized needs of their loved one. Most notably, this process is ongoing, with caregivers using experiences and education to improve the care they deliver on a day-to-day basis. This creates multiple opportunities for interventions with informal hospice caregivers and suggests that useful training experiences will have a lasting effect on the care provided to hospice patients.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1473325011429047"><title>Implications for social work</title>
<p>This study’s findings have a number of implications for social workers in hospice and, potentially, other health care settings. Here, what was not mentioned by participants is perhaps more important than what was. Specifically, without prompting, caregivers had very little to say about social work’s involvement in supporting them as symptom managers, despite identifying management of physical and emotional symptoms as important to the delivery of good care. Perhaps this is a good thing, evidence of an interdisciplinary team working so seamlessly that individual disciplinary distinctions fade and caregivers are left with an impression of services received from ‘hospice’ as a whole, rather than from nurses, chaplains, social workers, and physicians. However, it is also possible that this reflects relatively low involvement of social workers in supporting caregivers in their role as symptom managers. Recent research suggests that, while social workers see an important role for themselves in supporting caregivers as symptom managers, they struggle to find the time and tools necessary to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429047">Parker Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). Given hospice’s adoption of a multidimensional view of pain and the growing number of evidence-informed interventions available to social workers to employ with individuals in symptom distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011429047">Cagle and Altilio, 2011</xref>), it is reasonable to conclude that hospice patients and families are best served when social workers and all members of the interdisciplinary team are given sufficient time and resources to respond to clients’ needs.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that many of the experiences influencing caregivers’ decision-making as symptom managers occurred long before the initiation of hospice services. This highlights the need for social work assessment practices that demonstrate appreciation for patients and caregivers’ histories in addition to ‘presenting problems.’ According to the National Association of Social Worker’s Standards for Palliative and End of Life Care, ‘assessment is the foundation of practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011429047">National Association of Social Workers, 2004</xref>: 19); however, recent research suggests there is little standardization with regard to the content of hospice social work assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011429047">Parker Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is not known whether hospice social workers routinely ask caregivers about their past experiences and how they might influence their current caregiving responsibilities. This study’s findings suggest that failing to explore hospice caregivers’ pasts prevents the social worker, and ultimately the full interdisciplinary team, from appreciating the complex system of relationships, values, and experiences that guide caregivers’ decision-making regarding symptom management.</p>
<p>The importance of the past in understanding the present is summarized in the core principles of the Life Course Perspective, which asserts that human lives are shaped by historical time, timing of life events, linkages with the lives of others, and individual choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011429047">Elder, 1994</xref>). Use of the Life Course Perspective during assessment and throughout practice will allow hospice social workers to understand caregivers as individuals whose present behaviors and social realities have been shaped by their individual pasts. Hospice social workers should be encouraged to adopt a life course approach and routinely discuss the past as well as the present during psychosocial assessments. For example, social workers might ask caregivers to describe how they met the patient or to discuss how they have worked together with the patient in the past. Such queries will provide information that will be helpful in understanding the ways in which past events may impact families’ current situations. Further, responses may increase the likelihood that relevant concerns are reflected in families’ plans of care and that appropriate services are provided.</p>
<p>Similar to challenges to working with caregivers around symptom management issues, a significant barrier to adoption of a life course approach is time. Because the median length of time families receive hospice services is 21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011429047">NHPCO, 2010</xref>), hospice workers experience an approximate 50 percent turnover in their caseload every three weeks. Moreover, because patients are frequently admitted very close to death, assessment must often happen quickly to allow for critical interventions to begin. Conducting an in-depth psychosocial caregiver and patient history is impractical when the family may receive services for only hours or days. It is possible, if not likely, that workers’ efforts may best be directed at more practical supports for patients and families during that limited timeframe. In light of the prevalence of short lengths of service in hospice care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011429047">Waldrop and Rinfrette (2009)</xref> advocate for adoption of assessment tools specifically developed for late-stage admissions. Such instruments are sorely needed and could be designed to incorporate life course factors in a more abbreviated fashion than would be indicated in a longer, more in-depth assessment.</p>
<p>Although hospice services are intended to be provided to individuals with an anticipated survival of six months or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011429047">Code of Federal Regulations, 2007</xref>), the median length of service for patients and families receiving hospice care is significantly shorter. Late hospice admissions result in numerous problems including less time for providers to establish relationships with patients and families, perform assessments, and respond to patient and family needs. Many hospice and palliative care providers believe that hospice enrollments should occur sooner in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011429047">Emanuel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011429047">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). Increasing the length of service for hospice patients and families will increase the likelihood that hospice professionals will have the necessary time to establish the rapport needed to partner with caregivers as symptom managers and to discuss historical information with patients and caregivers, allowing social workers and all members of the hospice to respond more effectively to presenting issues with a richer understanding of their historical backdrop. This study’s findings provide support for social work’s involvement in practices and policies that support earlier hospice referrals and extend the length of service for hospice patients and families as a means to enhance support for caregivers as symptom managers and key members of the hospice team.</p>
