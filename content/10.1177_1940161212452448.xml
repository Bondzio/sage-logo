<abstract>
<p>The paper highlights the trends of political communications (PC) that have arisen in Hungary after the collapse of communist regime (1989). The authors have identified four main trends in the field of PC: <italic>fragmentation</italic>, the multiplication of PC channels and means, endless amount of PC arenas, Internet, Web 2.0, fragmentation of content, amateurism in PC; <italic>post-objectivity</italic>, the end of the requirement of unbiased and balanced coverage, more emphasis on the rise of opinion, on media as community focal point rather than window to the objective reality; the <italic>performative</italic> turn, the representation of self, a strong focus on act, dramaturgy, and aesthetics in PC; and <italic>popularization</italic>, the convergence of popular culture and politics, fan democracy, entertaining politics, involvement of citizens, etc.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212452448">Blumler and Kavanagh (1999)</xref> claimed that political communication was undergoing a sharp modification: the straightforwardly top–down and mass-oriented character of political communication seemed to be changing radically. The “big players” of political communication would no longer control the field they once commanded because of the rising new patterns of media and cultural consumptions and the new attitudes toward politics. They also said we would soon live in the Third Age of political communication, which is marked by the “proliferation of the main means of communication, media abundance, ubiquity, reach, and celerity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212452448">Blumler and Kavanagh 1999</xref>: 213). Ever since, an increasing number of communication and media scholars, sociologists, and political scientists have studied the profound changes in political communication that are rooted in the cultural and societal shifts appearing in the new millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212452448">McQuail 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161212452448">Nash 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161212452448">Norris 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1940161212452448">Tedesco 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1940161212452448">Van Santen and Van Zoonen 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We also speak about a new age because we see several new trends and tendencies unfold. The present paper cannot give a description of all the trends; it would rather focus on four of them. The main corpus of the article is the description of the recent tendencies in Hungarian political communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212452448">1</xref></sup> It starts with the trend of <italic>fragmentation</italic>, which would not only be the technical, infrastructural, and societal basis but the inherent logic of contemporary political communication stemming from, for example, the marketing logic. Then, <italic>postobjectivity</italic> is put under scrutiny. This trend is linked directly to Hungarian media development, where one has seen the fading away of the old norm of objectivism. Third, the <italic>performative turn</italic> in politics is presented, which theoretically originated in the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212452448">Judith Butler (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212452448">Jeffrey Alexander (2010)</xref>. Last but not least, the trend of <italic>popularization</italic> is described. Under this heading, the study presents developments that show politics and political communication adapt codes from popular culture.</p>
<p>The observations of the paper are derived from the data of several Centre for Political Communication Research projects<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212452448">2</xref></sup> and also lean on works by other, mostly Hungarian, scholars. It is obvious that the very recent, post-2010 developments of the Hungarian media (and politics)—however notorious they have become in Europe and even beyond—can hardly be covered because apart from the new Media Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212452448">CMCS 2012</xref>), no systematic research has been done on them.</p>

<title>Recent Trends in Political Communication in Hungary</title>
<sec id="section3-1940161212452448">
<title>Fragmentation</title>
<p>Political communication has always been fragmented to a certain extent since political discourses also take place outside and in the shadow of the official public spheres that affect the political process. Unfortunately, knowledge of the history of alternative channels, agendas, style, and actors is rather scarce. It is, however, widely accepted that for long periods, the official political debates were hardly influenced by counterpublics, and that resulted in an almost unified public sphere. Scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212452448">Barbrook 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212452448">Bardoel Haenens 2008</xref>) say that in continental Europe, the period from the early 1960s to the 1990s was dominated by the national public television channels. All political discussions were tailored to the demands of the ruling medium, the communication flow was a one-way, top–down, and a mass-mediated activity.</p>
<p>That is certainly true in the case of Hungary. For more than ten years after 1989, Hungarian political communication clearly demonstrated its mass media–centered orientation. The year 1997–1998 brought about a radical change. The privatization of the broadcasting industry after 1995 led to the boom of commercial and thematic television and radio channels, which soon defeated public media in terms of ratings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212452448">3</xref></sup> By this development, the broadcasting system followed the newspaper industry on its way to privatization and commercialization, resulting in a fragmented rather than plural media system in Hungary.</p>
<p>In the past ten years then, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dot.com">dot.com</ext-link> revolution and the Web 2.0 fever have given new impetus to the trend of fragmentation. Online news portals have been a part of the Hungarian media market since the late 1990s and covered politics in a way characteristically different from other mediums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1940161212452448">Szabó 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161212452448">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1940161212452448">2008</xref>) and started to reach wide masses only with the rather late speeding up of Internet penetration. The growing popularity of social media, blogs, and online metaportals and their intensive use for political purposes have fragmented political discourses as never before in Hungary.</p>
<p>The fragmentation and the blossoming digital culture create a media atmosphere where it is impossible to define borders between news producers and consumers, institutional and non-institutional actors, and permanent and ad hoc agencies any more. The trend of fragmentation also makes it difficult to see the clear differences between the logic of <italic>mass communication</italic> and <italic>interpersonal dialogues</italic>.</p>
<p>The difficulties are the most acute when it comes to Internet regulation. The Europe-wide criticism and debates over the new Hungarian media law, which came into force on January 1, 2011, have shown that it is extremely hard to specify which online platform operates under mass media logic (for-profit content provision with responsible editorial staff) and which does not.</p>
<p>As a result of the extreme fragmentation, there is also a huge uncertainty about which forums represent the mainstream of the political discourse if there is such at all. According to the Gfk Hungary Market Research Institute (IPSOS) survey data, people spend more time reading and watching news than ever before, but when it comes to the platform of choice, the Web is gaining ground rapidly while other sectors are losing. In the mid-2000s, the cable televisions and tabloid papers managed to multiply their audiences. Data suggest that in 2010, the digital media was the only sector that saw audience growth. Newspapers (both tabloids and qualities), magazines, television channels, and radio stations faced audience decline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161212452448">4</xref></sup> Traditional media formats, such as television news programs, have lost importance in shaping political discourses; they often decide not to cover policy and political issues in order to maintain the high ratings, that is, what the most viewed commercial broadcasters have done indeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212452448">Csigó 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the importance of ratings and print circulations are getting more and more contingent. Sometimes the most popular media cannot meet the demand for fast news cycles on politics. The EP election campaign of 2004 in Hungary showed the growing importance of online news portals in agenda-setting processes, and the campaign of 2009 EP and 2010 general elections demonstrated the strengths of social media and Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Twitter is the emblematic tool of fragmented communication. Microblogging was an integral part of the election campaigns of all parties that managed to win parliamentary seats in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161212452448">Mihályffy et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212452448">Mihályffy and Szabó 2010</xref>). Even government communication has discovered Twitter and has used it intensively for creating the online presence of the presidency of the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161212452448">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This trend clearly demonstrates that the flow of political communication tends to be initiated mainly outside traditional news media. This has a clear implication for political communication studies: Scholars should consciously redesign the research focus, research questions, scope, and horizons. It should be noted that political communication no longer has the institutional, social, cultural, and geographic borders it may have had two decades ago.</p>
<p>Stepping back to the year 1998, one can see the birth of Hungarian political marketing, which can be conceptualized as an answer by the political parties to the media and social fragmentation that had emerged. Fidesz is referred to as the first party that based its election-winning strategy on marketing logic in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1940161212452448">Tóth 2011</xref>). The most striking invention was the application of segmentation and the turn to establish communication channels (toward citizens) outside the sphere of mass media. The use of political marketing diffused rapidly in Hungary and resulted in an accelerated professionalization of political campaigning. By the years 2002 and 2004, all the big parties consciously applied the means of marketing mix, segmentation, databases, media management, image and identity campaigns, and audience and adverse party research.</p>
<p>Marketing, however, is not only an arsenal of tools but also usable in all the relationships where an exchange of values is taking place. Marketing culture, therefore, is an attitude, a way of meaning attribution and valuation that refers to every social process as exchange, and consequently, it recommends to the partners in exchange the deployment of marketing consciousness and tools—in short, client centeredness, segmentation, and marketing mix as well as the tricks of relationship marketing. Highly professionalized political communication requires major changes in the party and campaign organization and in political human resources too: a centralized decision-making process, prominent role of campaign consultants, and a strong focus on the leader’s personality and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212452448">Kiss 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Today a campaign is a multidimensional, multiplayer, permanent, and very complex political activity that needs special <italic>expertise</italic> (in management, marketing, public relations, arts, and design), <italic>experience</italic> (in politics), and <italic>skills</italic> (leadership) too. With professionalization and segmentation, the political actors not only respond to the trend of fragmentation but make the public sphere even more disunited.</p>

<sec id="section4-1940161212452448">
<title>Postobjectivity</title>
<p>As one of the most important normative standards, the tradition of objectivity is deeply rooted in the Anglo-American political journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212452448">McQuail 2010</xref>). The evaluation of media has usually been based on the following assumptions:</p>
<list id="list1-1940161212452448" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>News can and ought to be objective and balanced.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Journalistic coverage of politics should be fair, unbiased, and nonpartisan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Media content has to be based on facts, source, and information validations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When covering politics and policy issues, journalists must consider all the relevant interests and viewpoints of the community.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neutrality is crucial: journalists have to exclude their emotions, personal affiliations, and feelings from their work. Facts and opinions have to be kept separated.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The norms of objectivity have been sustained by guidelines for broadcasters, by curricula of journalism studies, etc. Besides, advocacy groups and national agencies, which monitor media frequently, adopt similar terms of reference in measuring media outputs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161212452448">6</xref></sup> Not surprisingly then, academics have also adopted objectivity as a main concept theorizing the relationship between media and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1940161212452448">Sükösd 1992</xref>) in spite of the theoretical criticism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212452448">Hall et al. 1976</xref>: 51–93).</p>
<p>The norm of objectivity strongly influenced the discourses on Hungarian media, mainly the televisions, and politics in the decade of 1990s and the early years of 2000. Numerous content analyses have demonstrated that in the 1990s, Hungarian news media was ideologically biased, the journalists’ performance did not meet the requirement of objectivity, and heavy partisanships were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212452448">Argejó et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212452448">Baranyai and Plauschin 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212452448">Beck 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161212452448">Mádl and Szabó 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1940161212452448">Terestyéni 1998</xref>). Sipos and Takács highlighted that the Hungarian press had never been able to follow the ideal of objectivity, even though the codes of ethics elaborated between the mid- and late 1990s clearly explicated this norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1940161212452448">Sipos and Takács 2005</xref>: 79-80; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1940161212452448">Szűcs 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The separation of three aspects of objectivity may help understand the developments in Hungarian journalism. At the level of codes and legal stipulations, the requirement of unbiased coverage has always been present. At the level of journalistic practice, however, academic experts have always found that Hungarian journalism by and large had been unable to meet the norm of objectivity, and that it was rather the opposite: Almost each media outlet and journalist can be classified as pro-right or pro-left.</p>
<p>On the level of declarations, in turn, one may define a trajectory. In the beginning, that is, in the early nineties, the journalists and the editorial boards tended to declare themselves objective, with the obvious exceptions of the media owned by the parties. There was a noticeable desire to build on the value of objectivity in journalists’ self-identification. In discourses on media and politics, the British and American standards were often referred to as models for Hungarian political journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212452448">Bedő 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212452448">Pálfy 2003</xref>). Being criticized because of biases, some media actors were actively searching for ways of neutral political coverage but failed to offer an answer to the question how to be objective in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212452448">Kotroczó 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1940161212452448">Vajda 2007</xref>). Later, journalists started to explain biased coverage with a need for “counterbalancing” partisan reports of the “other side” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1940161212452448">Varga 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1940161212452448">Vásárhelyi 2001</xref>). The reasoning was that the whole media landscape should be balanced and not individual journalists or media outlets. The political right particularly stressed that narrative in the middle and second half of the nineties when a rightist media realm was just being built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212452448">Juhász 2004</xref>). By the beginning of the 2010s, Hungarian media had got to a situation when the declarations do not touch on the ideal of objectivity anymore; today the most important declared aim seems to be to fight for a landscape where every citizen can find his or her media.</p>
<p>As media fragmentation became an everyday experience of the Hungarian audience, the requirement of objectivity slowly and surely vanished from the intellectual debates. Today, most of the Hungarian media workers explicitly deny the significance and validity of the claims of objectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161212452448">7</xref></sup> Journalists often argue that the criteria of neutrality and objectivity cannot be translated into daily work. Thus, the endeavor of being neutral and objective is rather unnecessary and harmful, since it would only feed an illusion or a myth that is promoted by the liberal thinkers; so finally, objectivity also results in (liberal) biases.</p>
<p>In addition, the audience researches show shrinking demand for objectivity—a tendency underlined by the growing popularity of the media formats that clearly demonstrate ideological, partisan, or subcultural background (online journals, blogs, and partisan radio and television channels). The thesis of postobjectivity is also supported by the failed efforts at editorial pluralism in elite papers with a strong focus on political issues that had to be withdrawn because of the intensive oppositional pressure from the side of readers. Furthermore, some political journals, which almost disappeared from the media market, have been able to stabilize their position by strengthening the ideological profile of the editorial board. Apparently, there is almost no market for unbiased media in Hungary. The new journalistic credo in covering politics is the honest coming out with political and cultural predispositions.</p>
<p>Academics also conclude that objectivity is conceptually difficult to define, operationalize, and study. The normative concept of objectivity led to several doubts widely discussed in the 1970s and 1980s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212452448">Hall et al. 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161212452448">Robinson 1983</xref>). The Hungarian reception of these debates can be found in the book of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212452448">Bajomi-Lázár (2010)</xref>, who lists factors that make objectivity theoretically and practically impossible in the Hungarian context. Bajomi-Lázár notes that media always operate with filters, so one might say that biases are structural: They are inherent in the media system. News is obviously selected but the criteria of selection remain hidden from the audiences. Following the arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212452448">Herman and Chomsky (1988)</xref>, Bajomi-Lázár points out that the key factors in influencing news media content are the editorially distorting filters, which can be described as the outcome of ownership, profit orientation, pressure of advertisers, and gatekeeping efforts of news agencies and editorial boards.</p>
<p>Even though some international examples show that the doctrine of objectivity still shapes elite reporters’ minds as “<italic>survival mechanism</italic>” to distinguish themselves from bloggers and tabloid journalists, it is tempting to assess objectivity as a largely failed or outdated concept in describing how media operates and how one can grasp its role in political communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212452448">Hinchliff 2010</xref>). Today, in the Hungarian media world, the discourse of objectivity appears only in the context of party politics when opposition accuses the governing parties of misuse of power in order to dominate the media agenda. The pro-objectivity camp, which was initiated by media professional Brent Cunningham in his article “Take a Stand,” is nearly not echoed in Hungary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1940161212452448">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trend of postobjectivity may entice the revision of the role media play in contemporary societies, also in Hungary. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212452448">Denton and Woodward (1998)</xref> offers an approach that assesses media performance not independently of culture and society. Media, they say, could provide frames that can help us orientate and interpret the world around us. Mediums represent separate realities, which may or may not connect to each other but basically diverge. The present authors would argue that media today more intend to create friendly environment for building (political) identities than to serve as information source for pleasing one imagined public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212452448">Denton and Woodward 1998</xref>: 66-67).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1940161212452448">
<title>Performative Turn</title>
<p>The performative turn refers to the shift that has already affected humanities and the disciplines of social sciences (anthropology, gender studies, communication studies, social movement studies) with the core idea of performance. In the following, an attempt to introduce this paradigmatic change into the political communication studies too can be found.</p>
<p>Since Kenneth Burke, it has been obvious that politics and political communication has a theatrical characteristic: Spectacles and elements of showbusiness have been integrated into politics for long, groups of voters are ready to express their political preferences in public using unusual techniques (e.g., self immolation, clothing as political protests, and so on). The present authors are, however, of the opinion that current developments in political communication such as the changing nature of political rallies, political activities on the social media platforms, and new patterns of expressive coming out with political identities would be better understood by the concept of performativity. To make it crystal clear, we do not argue that contemporary political communication is merely a series of flash mobs and Web-based activities as if there were no place for one-way channels like billboards or television spots. Again, the aim here is to highlight some features of the changing relationship between political communicators that might provoke new research questions and designs.</p>
<p>The starting point is a desire to understand what makes a political discourse efficient in shaping and influencing people’s mind. After conducting qualitative research with a special focus on the mechanisms of audience reception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212452448">Péter Csigó (2005)</xref> concluded that communicative actions are more likely to attract attention and stimulate reactions if they offer comprehensive meanings, and if they are simultaneously impulsive enough for reinterpretation or incorporation. The idea of performative turn underlines that the formal, official, and institutionalized ways of getting and keeping in touch do not meet the expectations, demands, and capacities of a growing number of citizens. Tools like Web 2.0 could provide a friendly environment for all political actors and agencies to galvanize and canalize the creative and innovative power of human desire to express the political self. Today campaign gurus are usually fascinated by Barack Obama’s online strategy, which strongly built on the political capital of ordinary people’s communicative efforts. One of the most important features of Obama’s campaign was it let his supporters be involved emotionally and practically into the campaign flow. It fostered community spirit, encouraged conversations, and called for simple ways of action that would allow them to feel the joy over the commonly produced meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212452448">Alexander 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, performativity is in close connection with political identities and simultaneously refers to the increasing importance of channeling citizens’ creativity into political communication, the growing number of “political performances” (bodily practices in processing political meanings), and the strengthened role of visual and aesthetic elements in the political. Furthermore, performativity has the capacity to function both as theoretical background and an analytical tool for conceptualizing the contemporary nature of political representation as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212452448">Ankersmit (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212452448">Corner and Pels (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1940161212452448">Street (2004)</xref> suggest.</p>
<p>The signs of rising importance of performativity were recorded as early as in the campaign of the 2002 General Election in Hungary. Endre Dányi and Miklós Sükösd spotted very vivid e-mail and text message circulation among both government and opposition parties’ supporters. Mobile communication technologies were used to organize mass demonstrations in just a few hours, and to send campaign messages and political jokes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1940161212452448">9</xref></sup> The liberal opposition party announced a call for uploading user-prepared political collages and montages that were critical against the ruling government parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1940161212452448">10</xref></sup> The initiative was a definite innovation, but at that time, the Internet penetration was too low and only a few people had the digital expertise and technical background to make that tool groundbreaking. Citizens were also offered symbols and ideas to show allegiance to Fidesz by wearing cockade, by signing the petition for the candidacy of Budapest for the 2012 Olympic Games or by eating sour cherry pie referring to the name of Péter Medgyessy, prime ministerial candidate of the Socialist Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212452448">Mihályffy 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Beside text messages and e-mails—both were mediated interpersonal communication tools—the power of face-to-face persuasion was also re-evaluated in 2002. The call of Viktor Orbán that “everybody should bring another person” for the second round of the election, was a clear message for Fidesz supporters to pass their belief in victory onto potential voters still hesitating. During the past two weeks of campaign trails, Fidesz launched a large-scale mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212452448">Mihályffy 2005</xref>). In this new strategy, particular attention was paid to get supporters, ordinary people, and celebrities along with Viktor Orbán together in smaller local events and great rallies in order to give opportunities to strengthen the feeling of belonging and to channel the energies of proactive and emotionally engaged people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212452448">Kapitány and Kapitány 2003</xref>). Besides its centrally organized harsh messages on government parties, the biggest opposition party, in turn, concentrated on entertaining the supporters with road-shows packed with stars of popular music and stand-up comedians in the countryside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1940161212452448">Tóth 2002</xref>). By this approach, the prime ministerial candidate of the Socialist Party, Péter Medgyessy, could construct an image of a likeable and “one of us” type of leader.</p>
<p>According to the assessment of Miklós Sükösd and Endre Dányi, the extremely heated political atmosphere in the days between the two rounds was felt also in the “families, workplaces, schools, circles of friends and civil organizations,” which “were torn by harsh political discussions” (Sükösd and Dányi 2003: 10). In many publications and even in public disputes, this feature was usually considered to be a sign of extreme political populism and tension in Hungary (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161212452448">Palonen 2009</xref>) but one could rather explain it from the perspective of performativity. During the campaigns of the 2002 general elections, both politicians and citizens showed growing need to be involved in situations where one could be “coming out” with political identity to confirm it and help others crystallize their own. Ever since leaders have been eager to organize and maintain spheres of supporters around themselves following the guidelines of relationship marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212452448">Kiss 2007</xref>) and groups of voters are willing to play their role in keeping new communicative fora like offline and online social networks alive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212452448">Kiss 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212452448">Mihályffy 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161212452448">Mihályffy et al. 2011</xref>). Performative political communications tend to attract journalists’ attention too. Unusual public actions receive bigger media coverage, which is crucial for minor or oppositional parties.</p>
<p>The key momentum in the performative turn, however, is the changing nature of interaction between the actors of political communication in creating political identities. The most interesting aspect of the dynamics of political communities is the way individual and communal identities shape each other mostly through communication activities. Under postmodern conditions, the political identities are seldom rooted self-evidently in traditions, ideologies, or social stratifications. Political identities are constructed and reconstructed again and again. This is the reason why today political communication usually deals with questions like “who are we,” and “whom do we represent and whom do we not,” rather than with, for example, policy issues.</p>
<p>The definition of self and the identity construction should be complex, reflexive, but reflective too; it must be produced by constantly monitoring the changing needs, claims, and capacity of both political actors (party and political leader) and the targeted audiences. In order to do that, political players have turned to the approach of branding, which is an attempt to connect politicians to the electorate. On the one hand, with its more engaging and emotional communication style, branding definitely has the potential to repoliticize voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161212452448">Scammell 2006</xref>). On the other hand, branding may drive the substance out of politics and replace it with glitz and style; “political branding is not about reason-giving in terms of rational-critical debate,” as Harsin evaluates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212452448">Harsin 2007</xref>: 21). Branding employs design and attractive visual elements that may add a stylish layer to political products, which might compensate for the loss of ideological background or political identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212452448">Adolphsen 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the General Election of 1998, when Fidesz introduced his party’s new brand as “civic,” identity campaigns have increasingly dominated political discourse in Hungary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212452448">Kiss 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212452448">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212452448">Kiss and Rigó 2006</xref>). The permanent identity campaigns and the intensive use of relationship marketing provide political leaders and supporters with great opportunities to manifest their allegiances to each other and perform their identities in many different ways and on various levels. With the growth of the Internet and mobile platforms, political communication has continued to evolve and step forward toward increasingly segmented, personalized, and two-way symmetric interactions.</p>
<sec id="section6-1940161212452448">
<title>Popularization</title>
<p>Several points above indicated that both the grounds and the surface of the political culture have also been changing as a consequence of the growing intensity and diversity of citizens’ involvement in politics. The trends, therefore, may be grasped with the help of the concept of popularization. Below, the concept of popularization is shown to cover the features, content, and form that come from popular culture, that is, from mass culture. These features of mass culture can be found in the programs of the commercial television channels, also in the tabloid papers and on the most frequented Internet sites.</p>
<p>Popular culture seems to be the common denominator for all the three protagonists of political communication: citizens, media, and politicians. We take a look at each in this order.</p>
<p>The increasing participation of <bold>citizens</bold> in public political communication is popularization definitely and literally. After a slow start until the middle of the 2000s, when Internet penetration reached a relatively high level in Hungary, with the mushrooming Internet sites, topics, and forums, today one finds a huge amount of public–private talks on politics. They are public and private at the same time: They use private styles, content, and vocabulary, but they are reachable for the public and, therefore, produced with that in mind. Although academic study knows less than enough about the characteristics of Internet talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212452448">Heller 2005</xref>) and even less about their direct or indirect effects on the (offline) political processes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1940161212452448">11</xref></sup> one should not ignore their birth and potential for the future.</p>
<p>Obviously, most Net people know that they can be identified by the authorities if they wish to; their anonymity is temporary and only for fellow net citizens. Since in most cases, people use nicknames rather than their real names, it indicates that they are still hesitant about uncovering themselves and instead stay hidden. When it comes to political identity, however, that is, showing their allegiance to political positions, participants in forums seem to be more willing to take a stand than they would offline.</p>
<p>This is all the more remarkable because of the pre-1990 experience and tradition of Hungarian politics. After the reforms of state socialism in the late sixties, the Kádár regime wanted to identify itself as a modernization agent. Modernization meant more professional and less ideological governance in Hungary, with the side effect that individual political positions became a private matter: Hardly anybody was expected to manifest political allegiance to the Party or to the regime anymore; rather the opposite was true. Since 1990, and mostly since 2002, when an outburst of rightist political allegiance and a widespread “coming out” with rightist identities took place, the (post-)communist tradition has weakened and first the rightist then the leftist political identities have been demonstrated in wider and wider circles among the citizens.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the spreading “coming out,” for long, the openness of the Internet was considered dangerous in some circles in Hungary because representatives of extremist views could appear and recruit followers online. Although the present parliamentary majority has alluded to those fears explaining why online media and Internet should be regulated by the new media law, today the extremist sites are mentioned very rarely outside their spheres; they have become part of the online public sphere.</p>
<p>The area of <bold>mass media</bold> has also gone through popularization in Hungary for the past ten to fifteen years.</p>
<p>The 1996 media law made it possible to establish private national broadcasting outlets. Their birth has resulted in an ambivalent situation. On one hand, channels with the highest ratings use components of popular culture in coverage of politics; that is, they simplify and personalize the news and issues. On the other hand, the smaller channels with definite political allegiance have kept a quality style in their political programs. Since the market share of the two biggest channels has been far greater than that of public television—somewhere around 70 percent in the beginning and above 40 recently, with 10 percent or even lower in the case of public channels—the general style of coverage of politics has moved much closer to popular cultural patterns and commercial formats than to public broadcasting ideals. Something similar has happened in the market of print media. The readership of broad sheet dailies has decreased considerably while the tabloids and the free papers like <italic>Metro</italic> fly high. Again, one can find television, radio, and print media for quality coverage but when it comes to the general patterns, popular culture prevails.</p>
<p>The peak of the popularization of political communication is probably the fact that the most popular television channel—a private one—hardly gives any political program except the news reels stipulated by media law. One of the first steps on this path was the night of the 2002 elections when, although the channel had a program, it consisted of celebrities’ comments on the horse race among the parties and the candidates. Afterwards, the channel started to ignore politics, and its news reels were very carefully made and sterile about current events.</p>
<p>The popularization of the <bold>politicians</bold>’ communication may take two ways: Either the politician enters the usual spaces of popular culture, for example, in the pages of the tabloid papers and in the nonpolitical programs of the televisions, or he or she uses means and components of the popular culture on purpose in communication.</p>
<p>It is worth, for example, becoming a celebrity because popular culture is full of celebrities, that is, with people whose private lives are also covered by the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212452448">Marshall 1997</xref>). The private lives are interesting because their coverage promises to reveal the secret of the allegedly great performance in sport, art, culture etc. or in politics for that matter.</p>
<p>The Hungarian mass media have made celebrities of a number of politicians or provided the willing politicians with the opportunity to become celebrities. In the period 2004 to 2006, one could see a hidden competition between Ferenc Gyurcsány (Hungarian Socialist Party) and Viktor Orbán (Fidesz) to get on the cover pages of the tabloids. The two politicians used their families as well as sports performances to attract the attention of the tabloid media. Being a newcomer to the highest echelons of politics, Ferenc Gyurcsány proved to be more eager to become a celebrity because he had to make himself known to the citizens—the faster the better, and definitely before the 2006 elections.</p>
<p>Indeed, one finds the same pattern in the construction of a politician celebrity as in sportspersons or artist celebrities. An important component is health. Ferenc Gyurcsány was exceptional among the Hungarian politicians in that he was even willing to speak about a period of his life when he had to fight the threat of skin cancer. In most of the cases, Hungarian politicians do not reveal their diseases even after recovery. Furthermore, cooking also overwhelms popular culture with a huge amount of books and other publications, with television channels and regular programs on general channels. And cooking is, therefore, another usual activity among celebrities. Again, Ferenc Gyurcsány was shown on the pages of a tabloid paper in the kitchen preparing a complicated meal, and Viktor Orbán also gave information about his experience in preparing goulash, with his wife even publishing a cookery book during a campaign.</p>
<p>Coming from popular culture, celebrities often promote the products of popular culture: films, books, restaurants, food, etc. Ferenc Gyurcsány was ready to let the citizens know that every New Year’s Eve he and his family watch a British film, <italic>Love Actually</italic>. This is remarkable also because in a leaked recoding he even performed the dance of Hugh Grant in the film, which is not surprising if we take into account that Hugh Grant played the British Prime Minister in <italic>Love Actually</italic> and Ferenc Gyurcsány felt very close to Prime Minister Tony Blair. Viktor Orbán was much more modest about films though once he revealed that he had knowledge on the main plot of the American series <italic>Sex and the City</italic>.</p>
<p>The American television series are popular in Hungary, and politicians seem to feel obliged to appear knowledgeable about them. Ferenc Gyurcsány based his main political television spot in 2006 on the iconography of <italic>West Wing</italic>, the American political show. This is all the more revealing because <italic>West Wing</italic> was about an ideal White House, not the real one. But that seems to be the point: A piece of popular culture was used to overwrite reality in a campaign, which was about promises anyway.</p>
<p>Hugh Grant imitated by the Hungarian prime minister and <italic>West Wing</italic> re-created in a political spot indicate the character of simulacrum of Hungarian politics at least in a given period. Some scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212452448">Fodor and Kitta 2009</xref>) thought that communication might be considered the paradigm of Hungarian politics for the first fifteen years after 1990. Indeed, the conviction that communication was the most important activity in politics peaked in the period between 2004 and 2006 but had manifested itself well before that. Politicians seemed to think that communication created reality—not just mirror or cover it. As the Hungarian elites won elections in 1998 and mainly in 2002 and 2006 not by policy programs and solid performance but by unrealizable promises, they seem to have believed that political communication was omnipotent. The moment of truth arrived as late as 2006 when no sophisticated communication tricks were capable of starting real reforms to repair the serious financial and economic situation and, from 2008 on, the global financial crisis. At last, by 2009 and 2010, the elite understood that a new arsenal was necessary in political communication.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Without doubt, Hungary is a postcommunist country historically, but one can say that it is beyond transition from communism to democracy and market economy, and that is true regarding political communication as well. One is allowed to emphasize that in the sense that today <italic>postcommunist</italic> is an adjective only and not a starting point, let alone a paradigm, for a promising approach when one wants to study the processes in Hungary even if the development of democracy has had zigzags. The country is beyond postcommunism in two senses: First, the period before 1990 does not have a direct effect on the political communications situation and processes anymore and, second, the new trends described above can be found everywhere in the Western world.</p>
<p>One could perhaps even claim that being a newcomer in the group of democracies, Hungary and probably other late communist countries show new developments more sharply than the old democracies. For example, with political position being a private matter in the final decades of the state’s socialist regime, performing political identities as an important component of a new trend in democracies is more visible in Hungary than in other countries. To mention another point, with Hungary lagging behind in Internet penetration for long, now the country shows the interconnection between the new tendencies more pointedly than countries where Internet penetration preceded the strengthening of further tendencies.</p>
<p>In any case, the Hungarian experiences in political communication underline the need for a paradigm shift from a media-centered approach to a new one that may put the different forms of participation and involvement in political communication in the foreground. It is hardly possible to understand the political communications processes and developments by raising old questions such as who dominates the public sphere, whether media coverage is objective, and if the mainstream media only set the agenda for public debates or also influence the main positions in the debate. Without a real mainstream media around, with mushrooming forums and forms for citizen participation and involvement, and with a shrinking public media and diversifying private media outlets and channels, it is high time research raised new questions.</p>
