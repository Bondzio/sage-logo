Soon this scandal was known as “Climategate” and a highly charged debate started to rage on blogs and in the mass media. Much of the debate has been about the question whether anthropogenic global warming was undermined by the revelations. But ethical issues, too, became part and parcel of the debate. This article aims to contribute to this debate, assessing the e-mail affair in the light of two normative analyses of science, one proposed by Robert Merton (and developed further by some of his followers), the second by a recent suggestion to use the concept of honest brokering in science policy interactions. On the basis of these analyses, different aspects of malpractice will be discussed and possible solutions will be suggested.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ethics</kwd><kwd>engagement</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd><kwd>politics</kwd><kwd>power</kwd><kwd>governance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>According to many commentators, climate change was a field of research in which, over time, the controversies have died down and the uncertainties decreased. The science had been settled, as a famous phrase puts it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243911432318">1</xref></sup> This all changed when in November 2009 e-mails from one of the leading climate research centers, the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA), were released to the public. The content of the e-mails made for scandal and revealed some questionable behavior by leading climate scientists. All of a sudden, it seemed that the consensus that had been in the making was actually being orchestrated through the manipulation of data and the peer review process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243911432318">2</xref></sup> The scandal caused outrage and posed the question whether the scientists at the center of the scandal had been acting improperly. Improper behavior can have many meanings, including illegal, unethical, or unprofessional behavior. Such differences in meaning are salient in the whole story. The aim of this article is to assess this scandal in the light of two normative analyses of science, one proposed more than half a century ago by Robert Merton—the normative structure of science which has been developed further by some of his followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911432318">Merton 1942/1973</xref>). A second has been proposed more recently by Roger Pielke Jr. using the term honest broker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911432318">Pielke 2007</xref>). I will discuss important issues that arise from the e-mail affair and the resulting public debate, and evaluate them in the light of these approaches.</p><p>The article has the following structure. After a brief description of the CRU affair its relevance for science as an institution in modern society will be examined. This is followed by a discussion of the scientific Ethos, as identified by Merton, criticized by others, and modified by his supporters. Another normative framework, the `honest broker' will be discussed in section three. The fourth section will examine the notion of malpractice, including legal aspects. The article concludes by asking how science policy interactions could be designed to ensure trust and reliability.<sup>3</sup></p><sec id="section1-0162243911432318"><title>“Climategate”</title><sec id="section2-0162243911432318"><title>The Case</title><p>In November 2009, e-mail correspondence from the CRU at the UEA was uploaded to various Web sites posing the immediate question whether these mails had been obtained by illegal hackers or by whistleblowers from within. There was suspicion that this was a political maneuver to derail the Copenhagen summit which was three weeks away. On a deeper level, commentators posed the question whether the exposed behavior was within bounds of “normal” scientific behavior or not, whether it documented illegal acts, and whether it undermined the scientific consensus about global warming. While some observers and participants of the debate saw the <italic>release</italic> of the e-mails as unethical, others perceived the e-mail <italic>content</italic> reflecting unethical behavior. The term Climategate, invented by a Daily Telegraph journalist, suggests wrongdoing. It was initially rejected by defenders of CRU and other incriminated scientists but has now become part of the vocabulary. Many debates ensued in the mass media and scientific journals, but the majority in the blogosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243911432318">Nerlich 2010</xref>). Outrage was the common element, on both sides of the divide, and in civil society at large. The publicized material from CRU contains over 1000 e-mails and several documents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162243911432318">4</xref></sup> The vast majority of these related to three CRU researchers: director Phil Jones; Keith Briffa, a specialist in tree ring analysis; Tim Osborn, a climate modeller; and to Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. They were either recipients or senders of e-mail messages. These had been filtered using keywords such as “Yamal,” “tree rings,” and “Phil Jones,” so that these terms appear in many of the documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911432318">Arthur 2010</xref>). This explains the focus on the United Kingdom, although much of the debate centers on work published by Michael Mann, a professor of Earth System Science at Pennsylvania State University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911432318">Flam 2009</xref>). Mann was the main author of a historical temperature reconstruction (dating back to AD 1000 and known as the “hockey stick”), which had become highly influential among climate scientists, policy makers, and the media. The hockey stick graph showed an essentially flat temperature curve from AD 1000 until the late twentieth century when temperatures shoot up (the “blade” on the flat “handle”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243911432318">Mann et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911432318">1999</xref>). Mann et al. “critically revisit” the issue of the so-called Medieval Warm Period, which is assumed to have existed, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, from ca. AD 1000-1200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911432318">Lamb 1965</xref>). Mann’s temperature record relativized this phenomenon, claiming “unrivalled warming” in the late twentieth century. The political implications of this claim are evident: if record warming occurs after industrialization, this may be due to anthropogenic influences. Before the hockey-stick model and its adjustment of the Medieval Warm Period, skeptics could point to warmer periods in recent history that occurred despite large-scale burning of fossil fuels as a rationale for doing nothing with regard to greenhouse gas emissions. To them the e-mails proved that the temperature record in the hockey stick had been manipulated. Such political dynamite was bound to create high levels of attention. It was of little wonder that from the outset commentators focused on a handful of juicy e-mails. In one e-mail message, Phil Jones spoke of a “trick” to “hide the decline” of a specific proxy temperature record (e-mail, November 16, 1999). This referred to a solution to the problem of representing diverging temperature curves based on different data sets, one from paleoclimate reconstructions obtained through tree rings (some of which became less well correlated with thermometer records), the other from thermometer readings. Just when the thermometer curve showed a steep rise, one specific tree ring curve showed a decline. These data had been combined in a way that concealed the obvious divergence between them.</p><fig id="fig1-0162243911432318" position="float"><graphic alternate-form-of="fig1-0162243911432318" xlink:href="10.1177_0162243911432318-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>In another e-mail, Jones said he would prevent research articles by competitors from being published, even if he had to redefine what peer review means (e-mail, 8 July 2004). Anxiety about freedom of information requests led him to suggest to his collaborators to delete e-mails. It has been claimed that there is evidence of keeping unwelcome papers out of the peer reviewed literature while at the same time fast tracking papers from within the circle of likeminded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911432318">Douglass and Christy 2009</xref>). The same differential treatment has been suspected in the process of compiling assessment reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007 (AR4; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911432318">McKitrick 2010</xref>). The IPCC had come under fire after several errors in AR4 were publicized, among them the claim that Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. As a result of these developments several investigations were launched, on both sides of the Atlantic, examining the practices of Michael Mann, CRU, and the IPCC (see timeline box).</p></sec><sec id="section3-0162243911432318"><title>The Aftermath</title><p>In the meantime, six investigations have been completed<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162243911432318">5</xref></sup>; none put the square blame on Jones (or any other climate researcher).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0162243911432318">6</xref></sup> Perhaps the most important inquiries were the Muir Russell review in the United Kingdom, which looked at CRU’s practices, and the Inter Academy Council (IAC) which looked at the procedures of the IPCC. The Muir Russell review (published in July 2010) emphasized the changed nature of science communication in the electronic age and points out that CRU did not realize the role of public debate in which rhetoric and credibility are crucial but instead relied on traditional ways of publishing research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911432318">Muir Russell 2010</xref>). What is more, CRU seems to have dismissed critical enquiries all too quickly, which was problematic and counterproductive. The review states that the emergence of the blogosphere has changed the nature of such scientific debates. Before, “scientific debate largely took place in journals and conferences that effectively excluded the public from active engagement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911432318">Muir Russell 2010</xref>, 41-42). But this has now changed and has led to an increased demand of openness on the part of scientists:<disp-quote><p>Without such openness, the credibility of their work will suffer because it will always be at risk of allegations of concealment and hence malpractice. … Therefore, the Review would urge all scientists to learn to communicate their work in ways that the public can access and understand; and to be open in providing the information that will enable the debate, wherever it occurs, to be conducted objectively. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911432318">Muir Russell 2010</xref>, 41-42)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In a similar way, the IAC found that the IPCC needs more transparency and a better management structure: “The IPCC should complete and implement a communications strategy that emphasizes transparency, rapid and thoughtful responses, and relevance to stakeholders, and which includes guidelines about who can speak on behalf of IPCC and how to represent the organization appropriately” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911432318">IAC 2010</xref>). Both reviews largely refrain from commenting on the content of the science (despite claiming that much of the science remains intact) and focus on procedures. Both also do not pose the explicit question as to whether there was unethical behavior. Only the Oxburgh review dedicates a few lines to this question. It states “We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it. Rather we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention. As with many small research groups their internal procedures were rather informal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911432318">Oxburgh 2010</xref>, 5). We note the use of the term <italic>malpractice</italic> and a largely sympathetic evaluation of the CRU researchers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-0162243911432318"><title>The Scientific Ethos</title><sec id="section5-0162243911432318"><title>Merton’s Normative Structure of Science</title><p>Robert Merton formulated his views on the scientific ethos in the Second World War, at a time when totalitarian regimes had a large influence in the operating of science, especially in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Confronted with examples of problematic instances of state intervention into research practices, Merton faced a dilemma. On one hand, he could have acknowledged that science at times proceeds in “all-too-human,” problematic, or unpleasant ways, with regard to research topics, research methodology, or political and economic interest. On the other hand, he could have ruled out such problematic instances as unscientific. As we know, Merton chose the second option and defined science as a social institution which is governed by special social norms. According to Merton, science is marked by an<disp-quote><p>ethos [or an] affectively toned complex of values and norms which are held to be binding on scientists. The norms are expressed in the form of prescriptions, proscriptions, preferences, and permissions. They are legitimized in terms of institutional values […] and internalized by the scientist […] Although the ethos of science has not been codified, it can be inferred from the moral consensus of scientists as expressed in use and wont, in countless writings on the scientific spirit and in moral indignation toward contraventions of the ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911432318">Merton 1942/1973</xref>, 268-9).</p></disp-quote></p><p>Merton identifies four scientific norms: universalism, communism, disinterestedness and organized skepticism. <italic>Universalism </italic>means that truth claims are to be subjected to preestablished impersonal criteria. <italic>Communism</italic> means that there is an imperative for communication of data and research findings. <italic>Disinterestedness</italic> means that institutional checks are in place that prevent scientists from pursuing their career goals ruthlessly. <italic>Organized Skepticism</italic> means that all research is checked by rigorous, structured scrutiny of peers.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0162243911432318"><title>Criticisms and Further Development</title><sec id="section7-0162243911432318"><title>A special ethos in science?</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162243911432318">Schmaus (1983</xref>, 13) challenged Merton’s view that scientists’ norms are different from others. Discussing cases of “scientific fraud,” he claims these “involve the violation not of a special moral rule proscribing self-interested behavior on the part of the scientists, but rather a general moral rule requiring that one's job or role-related responsibilities be fulfilled honestly, whatever they may be. In the case of scientists, this general moral rule entails that they fulfil their obligations as scientists. The responsibilities of scientists, in turn, consist largely in maintaining the highest standards of intellectual rigor.” In other words, there are no special moral norms operating in science. But from the fact that scientists are not different or “better” than other citizens it does not follow that they are exempt from general moral codes. Hiding data and giving preferential treatment to allies (if true) would violate such general norms and explain why so much media furore could develop after Climategate.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0162243911432318"><title>Empirical challenges</title><p>Following on from authors operating in the New Sociology of Science, after their “empirical turn,” Merton’s ethos was subject to several criticisms. Some argued that only cognitive, not social norms really count in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243911432318">Barnes and Dolby 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911432318">Mulkay 1976</xref>). Others said that scientists act out of self-interest: They assess the work of others since they depend on their recognition. They invest and accumulate credibility capital which is convertible into other resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243911432318">Bourdieu 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243911432318">Latour and Woolgar 1986</xref>). In addition, the point has been made that normative statements are ideological facades for the defense of the autonomy of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911432318">Mulkay 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section9-0162243911432318"><title>The role of controversies</title><p>Such criticism provoked Mertonian sociologists to come to the fore, most notably Joseph Ben-David and Harriet Zuckerman. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911432318">Ben-David (1982/1991</xref>) argued that empirical studies of scientific judgment and the allocation of rewards have shown, “there is little doubt […] that scientists observe the rules of their professional ethic in the allocation of rewards and punishment of fraud and other kinds of deviance.” Yet he admits that there are some empirical studies on scientists’ attitudes that paint a different picture: “The outcome of these is inconclusive: answers to some questions show acceptance of norms, while others suggest rejection.”</p><p>He solves this divergence by indicating a special role for scientific controversies. When scientists are embroiled in controversies, “evidence may seem to support the view that ethical norms are unimportant […] In these situations, scientists are indeed willing to transgress practically all the norms enumerated by Merton […]: they may withhold findings in order to prevent advantage from competitors, they make judgments on the basis of personal prejudice, interpret results arbitrarily in order to fit theories, and so forth.” However, Ben-David holds, scientific controversies are an exception: They deal with “an entirely different situation […]: the scientists at this stage act like litigants concerned more with putting together a convincing case than with ultimate truth. They are not, and are not expected to be, dispassionate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911432318">Ben-David 1982/ 1991</xref>, 479-480). This indicates that the e-mail scandal could be seen as within the scientific ethos, as defined by Ben-David. In controversies, passionate scientists use various tactics to further their goals, “like litigants putting together a convincing case.”</p></sec><sec id="section10-0162243911432318"><title>Intellectual property rights</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911432318">Metlay (2006</xref>, 566) argues that since the creation of national competitiveness policies in the early to mid-1970s, ‘the academic world has been experiencing a period of ‘renormalization’. In particular, the norm of communism is being or has been replaced by the norm of private intellectual property.</p><p>Metlay quotes Zuckerman to the effect that “this is evidently a time of exceedingly rapid and possibly fundamental change in the social organization of scientific research and in the normative structure of science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243911432318">Zuckerman 1988b</xref>, 11). Already in the early 1970s, it was observed (e.g. by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243911432318">Sklair 1973</xref>, 113) that “much, if not most, contemporary science is carried out under conditions of formal or informal secrecy—necessitated by national security matters and matters of economic interest.” And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911432318">Etzkowitz and Webster (1994</xref>, 488) hold that science is being transformed “from a relatively minor institution encapsulated from social influence to a major institution that influences and is influenced by other social spheres.” Other authors have added that science since the 1960s has become more attuned to social concerns (mode 2 of knowledge production, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911432318">Gibbons et al. 1994</xref>) and is operating in a context where decisions are urgent, facts are uncertain, and values under dispute (also known as post-normal science, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911432318">Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section11-0162243911432318"><title>Core groups and outsiders</title><p>Sociologists and historians of science have analyzed many examples of insider/outsider constellations in the past. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911432318">Collins (1985</xref>) uses the term ‘core set’ to characterize the small network of research groups, generally located at prestigious labs and universities, that are the heart of a research area or speciality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0162243911432318">7</xref></sup> Leadership personalities in these groups control the access to key resources of research such as labs, publication opportunities, and finance (cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243911432318">Traweek 1988</xref>). They also decide in which direction the field will move, and where the boundary between science and nonscience has to be drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243911432318">Gieryn 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911432318">Jasanoff 1990</xref>). They define who counts as scientist and who does not, who should get data and who should be prevented from getting access. This social process of status attribution, recognition, and gatekeeping has been operating throughout the history of science—it is a universal social mechanism. The criteria for inclusion/exclusion are social, not cognitive (truth does not reveal itself but is the outcome of a social process). Once an insider/outsider demarcation has stabilized, the odds of gaining cognitive authority shift in decisive ways.</p><p>This section has revealed that Merton’s claim about a special scientific ethos has been subject to many criticisms. It has hardly achieved the status of shared consensus. Critics and supporters of Merton concur that it is unrealistic to expect scientists to behave in disinterested ways when engaged in controversies. If this is the case, what yardstick remains to identify malpractice? This question will be addressed in the following two sections.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section12-0162243911432318"><title>Honest Brokers?</title><p>Let us look at a contemporary attempt to define the roles of scientists in society, taking explicitly into account the existence of scientific controversies and the politicization of science. As we have seen, Neo-Mertonians have granted an exception from the scientific ethos under conditions of scientific controversy. This seems to leave the door wide open to many questionable practices. It is in this context that the contribution of Roger Pielke Jr. is relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0162243911432318">8</xref></sup> It should be noted that Merton’s norms focus on scientific practice, while Pielke’s Honest Broker focuses on the practice of science in a political context, in a manner similar to the notion of post-normal science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911432318">Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993</xref>). Pielke Jr. has introduced a fourfold distinction between different types of policy relevant research. He writes:<disp-quote><p>[S]cientists have choices in what roles they play. Pure Scientist, Science Arbiter, Issue Advocate, or Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives? All four roles are critically important and necessary in a functioning democracy. But scientists do have to choose. Whether a scientist admits, accepts, or is aware of it, a choice must be made on how they relate to the decision-making process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911432318">Pielke 2007</xref>, 7).</p></disp-quote></p><p>This is a useful typology as it identifies some of the key roles played by scientists in the advisory process, like Ben-David’s litigants putting together a convincing case. However, given the individualist terminology (scientists making choices), there may be some doubt about the prospect of individual scientists performing the role of Honest Broker. This doubt relates to the problem Merton confronted when he denied that scientists are essentially altruistic:<disp-quote><p>A passion for knowledge, idle curiosity, altruistic concern with the benefit of humanity, and a host of other special motives have been attributed to the scientist. The quest for distinctive motives appears to have been misdirected. It is rather a distinctive pattern of institutional control of a wide range of motives which characterizes the behavior of scientists.

Institutions can bring together people with diverse perspectives to provide a spectrum of options for decision makers. It will be much more difficult for any one individual to serve in such a role.”</p><sec id="section13-0162243911432318"><title>Stealth Advocacy</title><p>If scientists are driven by self-interest and guided by values, it seems to be unrealistic to expect that they will spontaneously adopt the role of honest brokers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243911432318">Pielke (2007</xref>, 7) points out, there is the temptation to act as policy advocate, albeit in a concealed manner:<disp-quote><p>So when a scientist claims to focus “only on the science,” in many cases the scientist risks serving instead as a Stealth Issue Advocate. For some scientists stealth issue advocacy is politically desirable because it allows for a simultaneous claim of being above the fray, invoking the historical authority of science, while working to restrict the scope of choice. The stealth issue advocate seeks to “swim without getting wet.”</p></disp-quote></p><p>This relates to practices where science is used as a means for achieving political goals. Such practices occur on the individual and collective level but are more pernicious on the collective level. Nothing more than a personal reputation is at stake where one researcher claims to be guided by the science and nothing but the science—where there are indications that his public appearances are motivated by political goals. It is far more problematic if science advisory boards engage in stealth advocacy. Such committees should always point out the limits of knowledge and the range of political options. It is another matter if decision makers then present their chosen course of action as based on “irrefutable science” or not. In this reading, Pielke alerts us to the ethical problem of stealth advocacy in science policy which is a new and interesting issue (it has received some attention in publications on the politics of knowledge, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243911432318">Beck 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243911432318">Grundmann and Stehr 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911432318">2012</xref>).</p><p>Someone who has built her career on a specific scientific hypothesis is unlikely to reverse gear after having made a name in that field and discovering some uncomfortable data. The same applies to someone having gained a public reputation in favor of a specific course of policy action. The former acts out of self-interest, the latter out of ideological conviction. Sometimes both combine; and both have to be seen as motivations that drive the research enterprise and the advisory process. However, both are not enough to devise an advisory structure for democratic societies that enables policy makers to make informed decisions. They are not enough because the scientists’ self-interest and ideological orientation make it possible (perhaps even likely) that they misrepresent the state of knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="section14-0162243911432318"><title>Individual and Collective Action</title><p>Merton distinguishes between individual and social action and expects a “distinctive pattern of institutional control” to lead to the desired outcomes. This would mean with regard to the honest broker, that we need to establish institutional structures that enable honest brokering to take place. It is too much to expect from individual scientists to go against their career strategies and normative commitments. Only in rare cases should we expect individual scientists performing such roles. As we have seen, even Mertonians have admitted that the scientific ethos does not apply in situations of scientific controversy.</p><p>Analyzing the roles of advocates and honest brokers through the lens of individual and collective (institutional) action, one can distinguish between individual and collective advocacy, and individual and collective honest brokering. While there are many examples of individual advocacy (see F.S. Rowland, Paul Crutzen in the CFC controversy, Jim Hansen in the climate change debate, or E.O. Wilson advocating biodiversity) and collective brokering (see many advisory committees), collective advocacy and individual brokering are far less established. There are exceptional circumstances where scientific organizations have engaged in advocacy (such as the National Academies of Sciences calling for action on climate change c. 2007, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911432318">Grundmann and Stehr 2012</xref>, chap. 4). And individual scientists are less convincing in the role of honest brokers as they are normally not bound by specific rules or policies. They can switch from advocate to honest broker at any time.</p><p>From this it follows that honest brokering in Pielke’s sense requires institutional arrangements that explicitly foster and encourage a diversity of viewpoints and practical options for decision making. Only by confronting the different viewpoints in an open manner can transparency for the decision maker emerge. If we grant one group too much power, it will dominate the research process and the decision-making process. It will ultimately define what science is and what a good policy decision is without our ability to check and without an opportunity to revise decisions, should they turn out to be flawed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section15-0162243911432318"><title>Climategate and Malpractice</title><p>The six reviews and investigations did not make reference to Merton’s or Pielke’s concepts but used the term “malpractice,” albeit little specified.

The former occur when investigators follow appropriate scientific practice, that is when they follow cognitive (and technical) norms. Disreputable errors are those that occur when cognitive norms are neglected, for example when no proper experimental controls are used, when samples are not protected from contamination, when double-blind designs are not arranged (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162243911432318">Zuckerman 1988a</xref>, 521).

He traces the controversy about the paleoclimate reconstructions by Mann et al. to his earliest papers, and then focuses on events after others had started inquiring about data and methods used by Mann et al. in 2003. Montford, who is not a climate scientist, runs the skeptical climate science blog <italic>Bishop Hill.</italic> This book provides a partial account in which Steve McIntyre challenges the hockey stick. According to Montford, there is evidence that Mann et al.’s papers, published in <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Geophysical Research Letters</italic> did not conform to the standards of scientific publication. Essential information was missing both from the published article and the supplementary information. Peer review was not particularly useful or effective in this case. The referees have overlooked basic shortcomings. They did not check the completeness of information provided and the editor did not involve reviewers who were too critical. Around 2003 outsiders made inquiries about the hockey stick, its data, and methods. Prominent among them was Steve McIntyre, a semi-retired mining consultant and founder of the skeptical blog Climate Audit. Together with economist Ross McKitrick, he developed a critique of the controversial hockey stick graph. According to Montford, the weakness of Mann’s early papers became apparent when McIntyre started requesting information from Mann. McIntyre tried to replicate the paleoclimate temperature reconstruction but could not find the data or program code in order to do so (this looks very much like Collins (1985) experimenter's regress, with the added difficulty that the debate has been heavily politicized). When he requested these, Mann was very reluctant to comply and became increasingly edgy and evasive. Montford’s account suggests that Mann knew that there was a problem with his papers and did not want to admit it. Furthermore, he was eager to prevent others from getting access to the relevant information. It looks like a cover-up in order to preserve scientific reputations. This seems to have been facilitated by the politicized nature of the climate debate, and Mann could easily point to the “devious” or evil intentions by the detractors or skeptics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243911432318">Pearce (2010)</xref> has given an account which is also highly critical of the climate scientists, albeit more careful and impartial.</p><p>Was this malpractice? According to Zuckerman, all depends if we think Mann et al. committed disreputable errors or not. If some of the most prestigious scientific journals had accepted their papers after peer review, nothing untoward should have happened. But maybe the reviewers were lazy, or sloppy, or both, and the errors escaped their attention? They certainly did not try to replicate the findings themselves—which is not expected in peer review anyway. But what about the alleged cover-up and the refusal to share data and code with the critics? While Mann may have shared the dataset he did not share the techniques for using it. Perhaps this is not a universal norm in science, but this does not make it unproblematic. Neither is Jones’ reply to a critic who demanded data unproblemtaic (“Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”). This is not a violation of a cognitive norm but rather of a social norm. Mann tried to give the impression that he was cooperating by telling McIntyre where the data were to be found, and by giving (by whatever brief or token explanations) a description of how the data analysis was to be done. But McIntyre could not replicate Mann’s findings and he contacted Mann repeatedly about problems with the correct application of his method and data set. Mann seems to have become fed up and ultimately terminated the communication. Again, it would appear difficult to come to the conclusion that this behavior was unethical. The story so far tells us that the main problem was the peer review process which failed to spot the weakness of Mann et al.’s paper and gave Mann the confidence that he was in the right and his critics were in the wrong.</p><p>There has been some debate on blogs about the ethical problems associated with the hockey stick graph and its use in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR). Many commentators were outraged about that, including Steve McIntyre who told the story on his blog <italic>Climate Audit.</italic> At an IPCC meeting in Tanzania in September 1999, the temperature decline in Briffa's tree ring reconstruction was perceived by IPCC as “diluting the message,” as a “problem,” as a “potential distraction/detraction.” McIntyre quotes an e-mail from Michael Mann which shows that he wanted to use his work as the basis for the overall IPCC consensus.</p><p>Mann says, “But … Keith’s [Briffa] series … differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that Phil’s [Jones] does from ours. This is the problem we all picked up on (everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a potential distraction/detraction from the reasonably concensus [sic] viewpoint we’d like to show w/ the Jones et al and Mann et al series” (Mann, September 22, 1999 0938018124.txt). So what is wrong with the disagreement among the scientific experts? Mann explains, “So, if we show Keith’s series in this plot, we have to comment that ‘something else’ is responsible for the discrepancies in this case. … Otherwise, the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and, thus, can undermine faith in the paleoestimates. I don’t think that doubt is scientifically justified, and I’d hate to be the one to have to give it fodder!” (Mann, September 22, 0938018124.txt).</p><p>On his blog Roger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243911432318">Pielke Jr. (2009)</xref> discussed the question whether this amounts to scientific fraud and answers the question in the negative:<disp-quote><p>Here is why. First, the IPCC is not engaged in research. It apparently violated its own terms of reference when it allowed scientists to re-process data from the peer reviewed literature. So the IPCC clearly violated its own norms. However, even in violating its own norms, because it is not a research organization, it is very hard to say that it engaged in scientific fraud. But even if the IPCC was a research organization, the selective omission of data might be a questionable practice but hardly rises to any level of misconduct, which generally refers to fabrication, falsification or plagiarism. There is no evidence of that here. Just cherrypicking, perhaps egregious leading ultimately to misrepresentation, but nonetheless cherrypicking. It can appear unseemly when revealed (which is why it is not a good idea to do so in the first place), but misconduct? No.</p></disp-quote></p><p>If we use the above definition of scientific fraud, according to which it is “forging, trimming, or cooking of data,” we could arrive at a different conclusion. The handling of the divergence problem seems to be a clear instance of “trimming” (editing or suppressing data), maybe even of “cooking” (adjusting data by aligning paleo data with thermometer data through splicing). Pielke continues:<disp-quote><p>Did it engage in any other kind of "fraud"? […] [T]he authors of the IPCC TAR chapter under discussion clearly wanted to present information that (a) best positioned their work for inclusion in the SPM [Summary for Policy Makers], and (b) avoided giving "skeptics" ammunition. So they stage managed the process to present a picture that they thought best conveyed the storyline that they wanted. Was this fraud? I see no evidence for such a claim. Again, misrepresentation but not fraud.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Based on the conceptual trio of forging, trimming, or cooking the data, one may well come to the conclusion that what Pielke calls “misrepresentation” is an instance of scientific misconduct. Be that as it may, it is again the review process that has led to the problem we are discussing. This time it was the review process under the umbrella of the IPCC. It deserves special attention that Mann was involved in a crucial IPCC meeting where the fate of “his” hockey stick was to be determined. The outcome is well known: after 2001 the hockey stick became the icon for the IPCC and global anthropogenic climate change. By the end of 2009, it had unraveled and become contested. At present, the epistemic status of the hockey stick is uncertain, especially as regards the medieval warm period. It will be interesting to see if the next IPCC report endorses it. The strong warming trend in the twentieth century seems to get confirmation by an independent reconstruction of the temperature record (the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Analysis, not yet published at the time of completing this article).</p><p>To come back to the problem of “malpractice,” it can be stated that there might be a legitimate interpretation which sees the hockey stick team engaged in questionable practices. Secrecy about data in an attempt to avoid providing arguments for their political opponents (climate skeptics) is likely to have repercussions on the integrity of their science. As we saw above, some interpreters are less harsh in their judgment and prefer to use the term “misrepresentation” instead of fraud. Furthermore, the practices were not deemed problematic by several inquires and it is interesting to note that Merton's norms did not enter the discussion at all. We have argued that one reason is that Merton’s analysis reflected a different problematique and that it has been superseded in the meantime, allowing for a suspension of the norms of science in scientific controversies.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0162243911432318"><title>Was there Unethical Behavior?</title><p>Nearly four weeks after the scandal broke, IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said that in the field of climatology there “might be a few ‘black sheep’ who deviate from ethical practices” (Gulf News, December 13, 2009). This seems to be in line with a Mertonian view which assumes a shared ethos among researchers. In an op-ed for the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162243911432318">Dan Sarewitz and Samuel Thernstrom (2009)</xref> took a different approach, making the point (against Merton) that scientists do not have special normative standards:<disp-quote><p>Central to this disaster has been scientists' insistence that they are unsullied providers of truth in an otherwise corrupt and indecipherable world.

There has been initial reluctance on the part of most climatologists and other observers of Climategate to condemn the exposed behavior. A <italic>Nature</italic> commentary put it this way:<disp-quote><p>What the e-mails do not show, however, is a grand conspiracy to concoct global warming. Instead, they show sincere researchers struggling to do good work in a highly politicized environment — and sometimes losing their tempers.

As NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt puts it, “Science doesn't work because we're all nice. Newton may have been an ass, but the theory of gravity still works” (cited in Kleiner 2010). Schmidt claims that the scientists were perhaps ruthless in their relation to other scientists but despite this ruthlessness (or because of it?) were able to make great discoveries that stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>There are many anecdotes of how peer review has been corrupted in other fields of research, across the academic spectrum. Given the nature of the process (anonymity and confidentiality), we lack systematic studies. Some people will claim that their field or journals are innocent in comparison with the East Anglia e-mails, whereas others will say that their field is quite similar (or even worse). But in the case of climate science the stakes are far higher: the IPCC is supposed to inform governments around the world with the best scientific knowledge. This advisory system was set up by the UN in 1988 and comprises scientists and government representatives from around the globe. The IPCC advises governments and the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in a unique way (for historical accounts, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243911432318">Agrawala 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243911432318">Edwards and Schneider 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911432318">Grundmann and Stehr 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243911432318">Haas 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243911432318">Siebenhüner 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243911432318">Skodvin 2000</xref>). The process used for this aim should be as robust as possible and withstand any amount of scrutiny. Sooner or later it will be put under the microscope.</p><p>The question of what exactly constitutes unethical behavior can be illustrated by the following example. The coordinating lead authors for the Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group 1, Chapter 3: Observations: Surface and Atmospheric Climate Change arguably had a conflict of interest when assessing research results during the review process. It appears that these lead authors actively (Trenberth and Jones) sought to suppress other research findings.<sup>9</sup> And Trenberth gave the following advice to the director of CRU who was the second coordinating lead author, of how to deal with the skeptics:<disp-quote><p>The response should try to somehow label these guys and [sic] lazy and incompetent and unable to do the huge amount of work it takes to construct such a database. … So my feeble suggestion is to indeed cast aspersions on their motives and throw in some counter rhetoric.

Recall his definition which stipulates (1) the existence of a special scientific ethos (prescriptions, proscriptions, preferences, and permissions) which are (2) legitimized in terms of institutional values and (3) internalized by individual scientists. (4) The ethos can be inferred from (among other things) moral indignation toward contraventions of the ethos.</p><p>The exposed climate scientists did not adhere to the norm of universalism as they gave preferential treatment to close allies. They did not share their data as would be required under the norm of communism. They did not act in a disinterested way as the whole e-mail communication reveals. On the contrary, they acted strategically, showing self-interest and zeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0162243911432318">16</xref></sup> Above all, they wanted to communicate the political message of their research (that the Northern Hemisphere has never been as warm in the past millennium as it is at present) and boost their own careers. Finally, they did not foster organized skepticism but tried to stifle skeptical voices. It is interesting that the Climategate investigations describe this as “bunker mentality” but do not see unethical behavior.</p><p>However, sociologists close to Merton have suggested that scientists do not conform to the Ethos when engaging in scientific controversies. Here, different norms apply, above all the cognitive norm of adhering to technical standards in data gathering and analysis. Still, the hockey-stick controversy and the dealing with the “divergence problem” could be seen as an instance of violating a cognitive norm. But only skeptical scientists and bloggers seem to put forward such a case.</p><p>This leads to the conclusion that the Mertonian ethos of science is not operating in practice, and that it has been irrelevant for defining proper behavior in the CRU e-mail scandal. This may be due to the fact that today there are many more scientific debates and controversies, and that they are increasingly politicized. Neo-Mertonians were ready to grant an exemption for the scientific ethos under these circumstances. What must have seemed an anomaly to Merton, Ben-David, and Zuckerman, namely that science proceeds through controversies (which often overlap with a policy debate) has become much more common.</p><p>The second normative framework considered here, Pielke Jr.’s Honest Broker, recognizes the politicized nature of scientific controversies. Given the title of his book, it may lead to the impression that Honest Brokering depends strongly on individual choices, that is which role they can play. While it is true that scientists must choose between such roles, this would overlook the crucial difference between advocacy and honest brokering. Advocacy can be carried out very effectively on an individual basis, honest brokering much less so. But Pielke is aware of the institutional aspect of honest brokering. Above all, his point about stealth advocacy is well taken and should inform our endeavors to devise institutions for effective science policy interactions that are trustworthy.</p><p>Merton is ambivalent when it comes to personal virtues but surely puts emphasis on institutional design which matters when assessing scientific practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0162243911432318">17</xref></sup> He emphasizes the institutional integrity and the policing of the science community. From this perspective, it would seem a moot question to discuss the question whether there was individual failure exposed by Climategate. High-profile reviews have focused on the procedural and institutional aspects, leaving aside the issue of research ethos. In so doing, they concur with Merton in emphasizing institutional procedures above personal virtues. We have to establish processes that are open, transparent, and robust enough to avoid conflicts of interest to arise in the first place. And this should be the major focus for an institutional redesign of the scientific advisory process on climate change, post CRU scandal. The IPCC procedures were not robust enough to prevent these abuses, as the IAC review found. Likewise, the peer review process proved to be weak in many instances. It needs to be complemented by communication tools that provide more transparency. Science policy makers would be well advised to study the hockey-stick controversy in order to learn crucial lessons to make science policy interactions more robust in the future. No matter what official policies will be drawn up (if any), there will be a lesson learnt by many researchers. The use of electronic forms of communication, especially through blogs and Internet forums means that all communication is stored somewhere (forever); it means that it is potentially public at the push of a button, especially as more and more “lay” persons are following such debates. This lesson has been learnt the hard way by the authors and recipients of the CRU e-mails. It should serve as a cautionary tale for all other researchers.</p><p>There are examples where powerful people in the review process have not abused their position. But it would be problematic to rely on human virtues alone. Honest brokering can only be achieved on a routine basis through institutions, not through individuals. This does not deny the fact that sometimes exceptional individuals will play a decisive role in politicized science controversies. However, it would be naive to take such interventions for granted. One should rather design institutions of knowledge provision and advisory systems that do not fall prey to such vagaries. Moving from the individual level to the collective level brings the risk of group think, nepotism, and deference to authority. To forestall these, one needs to include viewpoints that go against the grain of the views of established elites of expertise and policy making.
