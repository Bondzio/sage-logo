<abstract>
<p>This presentation to the Bolzano Congress in 2010 describes the value of Median Group Dialogue in work with offenders in prison and the community, and the success achieved.</p>
<p>Pat de Maré’s Median Group is the missing link between the disaffected individual and the depersonalized institution, which can bring about a transformation of humanizing the institution and socializing the individual. Institutional failure has resulted in a chasm between an increasingly sophisticated/divided society fuelled by the rapid advance of the technological revolution and the outmoded feudal controlling institution. When free to operate effectively the Median Group creates an atmosphere where the institution can become flexible and sensitive towards the needs and demands of individual members.</p>
<p>Having illustrated the application of Median Group Dialogue to the prison situation, this article proceeds to the difficulties encountered through the tendency of ossified institutions to reject change, and imagines another way forward starting in the community at large.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Median Group is the missing link. For over 40 years I have worked in a variety of settings, that all have demonstrated an inability to prepare people adequately for life outside institutions. My efforts to install this missing link in prison and probation work has had some success. I have initiated two organizations that have successfully established Dialogue Groups in prison, based on the principles of the Median Group. There is a Prison Service Research Report by the University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology that makes positive reference to the value of the group. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413483082">Liebling and Price, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The Median Group can be seen as a threat to institutions as its currency is truth and openness. It encourages people to think and to question the rules. Median Group Dialogues in prison are ongoing in the UK but I have not been directly involved for some time.</p>
<p>Working in an institution is rarely free of conflict as illustrated by Donald Factor, one of the authors with Peter Garret and the physicist David Bohm, of the article <italic>Dialogue a Proposal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316413483082">Bohm, Factor and Garrett, 1992</xref>). The following extract is from his 1994 article on <italic>Facilitation and Purpose</italic>:-
<disp-quote>
<p>At the time that we wrote ‘Dialogue—A Proposal’ we added a final section to address the question of dialogue in existing organizations. But I now believe that our view was too optimistic and that it also may have added to the confusion that concerns me. I suppose Patrick de Maré’s comment to me about the sort of dialogue that he and Bohm envisioned sums up the difference. ‘Yes, dialogue is very subversive.’</p>
<p>No organization wants to be subverted. No organization exists to be dissolved. An organization is, by definition a conservative institution. If you didn’t want to conserve something, why would you organize? Even if an organization runs into serious trouble—if, perhaps, its market or reason for existence vanishes there remains a tremendous resistance to change. (And, by the way, our larger culture is also an organization.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316413483082">Factor, 1994</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite problems that I have experienced, my belief in Median Groups remains strong. Pat had a vision which he felt was expressed in a pamphlet that he gave to me in 1990, called the <italic>Technique of Group Work</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413483082">1935</xref>) by Basil Beaumont. Beaumont hoped to construct a network of groups throughout the world, in which the principles of group work might be carried out. He hoped these groups would multiply and permeate the world. Well, we are a bit stalled on that particular front because the Median Group exists primarily in the land of the specialist and the professional. It has not become a mainstream method of reconstructing and re-integrating society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0533316413483082">
<title>Historical Background to the Application of the Median Group in Prison</title>
<p>As a Probation Officer I had developed cognitive behavioural groups in the Probation Service but felt dissatisfied. This was personified by a client who said, ‘When I come to your groups, I feel like a piece of jigsaw, I change shape but then I go back to the big jigsaw and I fit right back in about where I was before.’ The cognitive behavioural groups I ran developed insight but often failed to help people translate knowing into doing or outsight. There was also the ‘Hillman and Ventura’ factor. You might remember they wrote the book that said ‘we’ve had a hundred years of psychotherapy and the world is still getting worse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316413483082">Hillman ands Venture, 1993</xref>). The suggestion being that we are trying to squeeze people into the small spaces left for them by society rather than persuading society to make the spaces bigger.</p>
<p>In 1989, I attended a working conference called <italic>Studying Group Behaviour</italic> at the Grubb Institute. Whilst entering very enthusiastically into its rather disturbing spirally seated groups and constructing a ‘Jacob’s ladder’ between my subconscious and my conscious mind, I was blown into another dimension and lost my grip on reality for about two rather frightening weeks. On reflection, I am glad I went through the experience because I then joined the Institute of Group Analysis Introductory Course, in part to give myself the knowledge to unpack the rather unsettling Grubb event. The Introductory Course gave me a good foundation and consolidated my past group work experiences. Then I came across the man that was really to make sense of it all: Pat de Maré. I read his pamphlet, <italic>The Development of the Median Group</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316413483082">1990</xref>) and the ideas he expressed just felt right. I should admit at this point that I still cannot read Pat’s book <italic>Koinonia: From Hate, Through Dialogue, to Culture in the Large</italic> Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413483082">1991</xref>) on my own, so attending the Median Group seminar in London has helped me to find the gold dust it contains.</p>
<p>Small groups help you to understand yourself in the family context but can leave a yawning chasm between self-knowledge and how to put it all into practice—outsight. Pat’s larger Median Groups provided the context where you could test out your new ideas about yourself and society and develop the self-confidence needed to find your place in the larger society. I also read Alvin Toffler’s <italic>Third Wave</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316413483082">1991</xref>) at this time and it seemed to me that the information revolution, the third wave after agricultural and industrial revolutions, was occurring at phenomenal speed but our culture has failed to develop coping mechanisms at an equivalent speed. That is why we still rely on outdated institutions to resolve the problems of an increasingly divided society by top down measures that are massively time consuming, expensive and ineffective unless we plan a future of imprisonment both literal and through increasing levels of surveillance, control and medication. I have come to believe that in terms of learning to live together in a massively changed society we are still in the stage of adolescence and we have to learn the skills of living harmoniously together. I have been privileged to spend time with Pat de Maré learning how we could possibly perform that magic.</p>
<p>It was at one of Pat’s theory groups in 1993 that I met David Bohm, Sarah Bohm and Peter Garrett. Peter was very interested in my plans to start a large group in a maximum security prison and agreed to join me as researcher. Peter became my co-worker and after I moved on from the prison he continued and established the Prison Dialogue charity.</p>
<p>Recent contact with Peter is pleasing in that he has taken forward my idea for threshold dialogue where prisoners leaving a prison group can move on to a local community based group. These community Dialogues were to incorporate volunteers, referrals from all social agencies, as well as men returning from prison. Ex-prisoners already experienced in Median Group Dialogue could have an important role in social change in the community, which can occur by community volunteer members getting in touch with their own and society’s shadow through exposure to offenders in the flesh rather than just the media version of events. I believe that these Dialogues have enormous healing potential.</p>
<p>The methodology stems from Pat, the introduction occurred through Pat and a lot of the support in the difficult early years came from Pat and his large group section at the IGA.</p>
<p>There follows a transcript of most of a letter I received from Pat after he read one of our Prison Dialogue reports:
<disp-quote>
<p>One point I wish to make, which could be helpful, and that is—by getting people to talk, whatever they talk about, it is the main object—putting the awful reality into words—into the symbolic order that can then be handled by the mind. This is the only object of the exercise, so that the more controlling and punishment that goes on makes no difference. So the symbols are not reality but a reflection of a defused reality. So that whatever people do (other than stopping you meeting and talking on a regular basis) is simply more grist to grind. Fortunately the powers that be do not realize this. Whatever structure is imposed, the true freedom is of the mind—the clients do not have to realize this either—it will happen provided they have the opportunity to talk, which seems harmless enough to the powers that be. Reality and trauma is one thing, reflection of reality is another, which of course brings about ‘growth, development and humanizing’ but such words may be experienced by the ‘authority’ as threatening to their control and their trend towards infantalisation (1994).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact the mind cannot cope with ‘reality’ itself only the reflections, their reflectiveness—the power to think. Traumatic events of the past and the present (outsight) become memories by talking—otherwise they remain intolerable reality, they remain traumatic.</p>
<p>Pat goes on to say how we, society at large, are as much prisoners as the clients—both behind the ‘bars’ of society. Actual prisons are simply a reflection of the state we are in.</p>

<title>Extract from a Prison Dialogue Report</title>
<p>The Prison Dialogue sessions are structured in an unusual way, such that everyone learns although nobody teaches. There is no agenda or pre-determined topic, no rights or wrongs—simply an open forum where all may give their views and enquire into what really matters to them, but with the additional responsibility of taking others seriously even when they do not agree. Each person’s behaviour is mirrored back to them by the other participants. As a result, the differences between a person’s intention and their impact on others becomes more evident. The facilitators cultivate an atmosphere of support and challenge in order to encourage everyone, including themselves, to become clearer why they feel, think, speak and act in the ways that they do. As a result, change emerges from within rather than being imposed from without.</p>
<p>The Dialogues involved volunteers from inside and outside the prison—prisoners, managers, volunteers from all walks of life, male, female, black, white, old, young—the idea being to create a microcosm, a slice of life.</p>
<p>A prisoner is quoted as saying, ‘being in the Dialogue it is possible to let your hair down a little. Back on the wing you can’t do that because you would get hurt.’</p>

<title>Extract from An Exploration of Staff–Prisoner Relationships at HMP Whitemoor by Alison Liebling and David Price of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413483082">Liebling and Price, 1999</xref>):</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The dialogue group, where staff occasionally joined prisoners in their ‘thinking out loud’, was often mentioned as a place where staff prisoner encounters were at their best. This was a weekly discussion group meeting between mainly prisoners (about 20), facilitated by an outside group worker and attended by others. Its purpose was to enable prisoners and others to talk in an exploratory way together about subjects which held deep meaning for the participants, without violence or dispute: to enquire together through conversation. Relationships in the dialogue group were at their best because they were honest, and yet could be critical. It is one of the most honest places in the prison (prisoner). Staff sometimes attended this discussion group (although some staff refused), and we were present at many of these often powerful sessions. Prisoners felt that this was a place where staff could be seen and known as they really were, and vice versa. One or two confident staff members increased the level of esteem and respect accorded to them by prisoners simply through being themselves in the group. Conversation started in dialogue would continue on the wing. Staff and prisoners would see the other’s perspective, and would shift their ground, as well as develop a broader vision of each other. The conversations we witnessed and participated in were unusually mature, open and constructive. They were sometimes extra ordinarily moving. It was as if prisoners (and sometimes staff, when they took part) stopped being in prison, and became once again themselves. The impact of this ‘space’ on the individuals who participated, their relationships with each other, and on life in the prison was, we felt, wholly positive. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316413483082">Liebling and Price, 1999</xref>: 32)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the things that the Prison Dialogues achieved was to create a space for thinking together, which a prisoner described as feeling like he was not in the prison for the 90 minutes of the Dialogue. At one prison we ran the groups over two days and at the end of day one we went off to our cells and outside accommodation and wrote a poem based on our experience of the day. At the beginning of day two we were invited to read our poem. Here is one from Dennis:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s come again that Thursday night</p>
<p>when a dialogue poem I should write.</p>
<p>But with inspiration running cold</p>
<p>what subject this time should be told?</p>
<p>I wonder if the story I should tell—</p>
<p>but then again would that go well ?</p>
<p>Perhaps the one about that day—</p>
<p>oh no that one I shouldn’t say.</p>
<p>What about I were to give</p>
<p>some idea of how I live,</p>
<p>or what if they would care to hear</p>
<p>of the things that I most fear?</p>
<p>It’s all inside and won’t come out,</p>
<p>the things that I should shout about.</p>
<p>So sorry mates it’s not today</p>
<p>that I can find those words to say.</p>
<p>Next time perhaps, who knows, maybe,</p>
<p>will be the time for me to see</p>
<p>a way to tell what’s there inside</p>
<p>when inspiration may provide</p>
<p>the words to set you all agog</p>
<p>with poems for a Dialogue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst a Probation Officer inside the prison I was able to deal with any issues that arose, but once I retired and only visited weekly to run the groups, changes of regime led to a range of problems that became insurmountable. There were problems around confidentiality and officers were no longer able to join the group but had to sit outside the circle supervising. My reduced relationship with the prison no longer enabled me to overcome these difficulties and so I left.</p>
<p>Since leaving, I have been very interested in the only place that maintains real freedom of speech without censorship—cyberspace. There follows an extract from John Barlow’s (of the band Grateful Dead) cyberspace manifesto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483082">Barlow, 1996</xref>):</p>
<p>First paragraph:
<disp-quote>
<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Concluding paragraph:
<disp-quote>
<p>We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413483082">Barlow, 1996</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We need mechanisms to move this, the new home of mind, back to the community again. The lorry driving fraternity used citizen’s band radio, which allowed them to communicate from lorry to lorry. They arranged to meet up in transport cafes to ‘eyeball’ or meet face to face. From Internet communities new relationships are emerging, as well as clubs where people eyeball and meetings can be set up using Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Whilst Median Group Dialogue in prison has involved volunteers from the general public this has not been on the scale that could lead to the sort of social change that could generate the level of thinking that might change institutions or the public perception of them and their population.</p>
<p>Thinking about how to develop community based groups that might be more popular. I have been examining the possibility of running fortnightly Median Group Dialogues in a public house or café. My personal involvement with the ukulele revolution has led me to think about combining music and Dialogue.</p>
<p>In my supervisions with Pat we always talked about music and often played ukulele or Pat would blow on his recorder. Interestingly the ukulele is a small voice—a small instrument, which gives non-musicians access to playing an instrument and to the community building aspects of singing and playing together. My virtual community of ukulele players, the ukulele cosmos, over the last few years has evolved into a real network of clubs and festivals. Members do not only talk ukulele, they often have deep interest in social issues. The Median Group is also about listening to the small, quiet voice and allowing people access to thinking together, not reserving it to the elite, to the experts. It might seem outlandish but I propose grafting together ukulele and Dialogue in residential workshops. In that way it might be possible to popularize and expand Dialogue in a way that starting from within institutions has not.</p>
<p>Another feature of the Median Group seminar at Pat’s house was wine.</p>
<p>Excerpt from <italic>I Drink Therefore I Am</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316413483082">2010</xref>) by Roger Scruton:
<disp-quote>
<p>The social drinking of wine, during or after a meal, and in full cognizance of its delicate taste and evocative aura, seldom leads to drunkenness, and yet more seldom to loutish behaviour. The drink problem that we witness in British cities stems from our inability to pay Bacchus his due. Thanks to cultural impoverishment, young people no longer have a repertoire of songs, poems, arguments or ideas with which to entertain one another in their cups. They drink to fill the moral vacuum generated by their culture, and while we are familiar with the adverse effect of drink on an empty stomach, we are now witnessing the far worse effect of drink on an empty mind (p. 3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Scruton discusses wine as an accompaniment to philosophy, and philosophy as a by-product of wine. In Scruton’s view wine is an excellent accompaniment to food; but it is a better accompaniment to thought and by thinking with wine (he emphasizes one or two glasses only here) you can learn not merely to drink in thoughts but to think in draughts. By swallowing premise, argument and conclusion in one full satisfying stream you do not merely understand an idea you fit it to the life in you.</p>
<p>So now we have a plan for a Median Group residential conference: Median Group Dialogue interspersed with music, singing and poetry and one or two glasses of wine. I think Pat would have liked that.</p>

<p><bold>David Parsons</bold> was invited to full membership of the Group Analytic Society in 1997. He trained as a Social Worker in 1970 at Bristol University and has extensive professional experience, principally within the Probation and Social Service. He has been engaged in the application of Median Dialogue Groups within the prison system and initiated the Prison Dialogue Groups at HMP Whitemoor in 1992. David went on to develop community based Dialogue Groups after leaving the Probation Service in 1999. Two charitable trusts, Prison Dialogue and The Dialogue Trust have been founded on the basis of his work. Pat de Maré wrote about David’s work in his article The Millennium and the Median Group (2003). David continued to meet with Pat until shortly before Pat’s death. He continues to liaise with members of Pat’s original Median Group at the IGA. More recently he has worked in residential child care and remains interested in returning to community based Median Group Dialogue when he has completed his reflections on the difficulties encountered working in the often toxic environment of maximum security prisons where a truth seeking group often encounters resistance. He hopes to find a way forward that is more anchored in the whole community. <italic>Address</italic>: 71 Owl Way, Hartford, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PE29 1YZ, UK. <italic>Email</italic>: <email>david.parsons27@ntlworld.com</email></p>
