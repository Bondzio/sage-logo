<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The college years represent a developmental transition during which the initiation and escalation of heavy drinking set the stage for lifelong difficulties with alcohol and other drugs. Evidence from studies of adolescents and young adults with ADHD suggests that college students with the disorder may be uniquely vulnerable to alcohol- and drug-related problems. However, no studies have examined substance use in college students with ADHD. <bold>Method:</bold> Tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug use, and associated impairment were examined in 91 college students with (<italic>n</italic> = 53) and without (<italic>n</italic> = 38) ADHD. <bold>Results:</bold> ADHD was associated with increased frequency of tobacco use, higher rates of dangerous or hazardous patterns of alcohol use, and higher levels of impairment related to marijuana and nonmarijuana illicit drug use, independent of conduct disorder history. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> These findings suggest that college students with ADHD may be at elevated risk for problematic patterns of substance use.</p>

<p>ADHD is characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity resulting in academic and social impairment (American Psychological Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710392536">[APA], 2000</xref>). Once conceptualized as a disorder specific to childhood, it is now estimated that ADHD persists into adulthood in 58% to 70% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710392536">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). Individuals with ADHD have been found to engage in higher rates of risky behavior across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392536">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710392536">Flory, Molina, Pelham, Gnagy, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710392536">Lahey et al., 2004</xref>) and beginning in adolescence are at elevated risk for problematic substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392536">Barkley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054710392536">Molina, Marshal, Pelham, &amp; Wirth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1087054710392536">Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1087054710392536">Wilens et al., 2008</xref>). The college years overlap with the peak developmental period for problematic substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710392536">Littlefield, Sher, &amp; Wood, 2009</xref>) and may represent a time of unique vulnerability for students with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710392536">Brown et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Advances in the use and effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions and increased legislative support have made higher education more accessible to students with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710392536">Gallagher, Sysko, &amp; Zhang, 2001</xref>). The actual proportion of college students meeting full diagnostic criteria for ADHD is currently unknown. Studies suggest, however, that 2% to 8% of college students self-report symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1087054710392536">Weyandt &amp; DuPaul, 2008</xref>), with the percentage varying as a functional postsecondary institution characteristics and study design. In addition, it is estimated that individuals with ADHD represent 25% of college students who self-refer to campus disability support services (DSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1087054710392536">Wolf, 2001</xref>). College students with ADHD likely represent a unique subgroup of individuals with the disorder who have thus far achieved a relatively high level of academic functioning. Nonetheless, challenges such as moving away from home, making autonomous decisions, establishing a new peer group, and managing unstructured social and academic environments may be particularly difficult for these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710392536">DuPaul et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1087054710392536">Weyandt &amp; DuPaul, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that students with ADHD appear to represent a significant population on college campuses, little is known about how this group adapts to developmental challenges unique to the college experience. Recent theories have attributed the core symptoms of ADHD to deficits in executive functioning (e.g., difficulties with impulse control, planning, goal persistence, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710392536">Barkley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054710392536">Nigg, 2001</xref>). When considering problematic substance use in this population, it is notable that there is significant overlap between executive functioning deficits independently associated with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710392536">Barkley, 1997</xref>) and substance use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710392536">Giancola &amp; Tarter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710392536">Grant, Contoreggi, &amp; London, 2000</xref>). Impairments that emerge when ADHD persists into adolescence (e.g., difficulty adapting to increasing academic demands, interpersonal problems, and higher rates of criminal offending; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1087054710392536">Smith, Waschbusch, Willoghby, &amp; Evans, 2000</xref>) are additional risk factors for problematic substance use. In addition, the decrease in external structure and adult supervision that occurs during adolescence may be particularly problematic for individuals with ADHD given their reliance on external sources for structure and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1087054710392536">Pelham &amp; Fabiano, 2008</xref>). The presence or history of comorbid conduct disorder (CD), found in 7% to 50% of children and adolescents with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710392536">Barkley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710392536">Ford, Goodman, &amp; Meltzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710392536">Lahey, McBurnett, &amp; Loeber, 2000</xref>), confers an additional risk for substance-related problems. Adolescents and young adults with ADHD and comorbid CD typically evidence the riskiest patterns of substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392536">Barkley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054710392536">Molina &amp; Pelham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1087054710392536">Molina, Smith, &amp; Pelham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1087054710392536">Wilens et al., 2008</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies have examined how these risk factors may operate in the context of the college environment.</p>
<p>In contrast to the absence of studies examining substance use in college students with ADHD, numerous studies have identified risky patterns of substance use among adolescents and young adults with confirmed ADHD diagnoses. Across studies, adolescents and young adults with ADHD have been found to use tobacco at higher rates and begin using at an earlier age relative to their nondisordered peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054710392536">Milberger, Biederman, Faraone, Chen, &amp; Jones, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054710392536">Molina &amp; Pelham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1087054710392536">Wilens et al., 2008</xref>). Although rates of cigarette smoking are consistently highest among adolescents with co-occurring ADHD and CD (hereafter referred to as ADHD + CD), ADHD alone does appear to confer a unique risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054710392536">Molina et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from studies of alcohol and illicit drug use in this population are less consistent than those related to tobacco. In earlier research, substance use behavior in adolescents with ADHD was examined as a secondary outcome in several large-scale longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710392536">Barkley, Fischer, Edelbrock, &amp; Smallish, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710392536">Biederman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710392536">Gittelman, Mannuzza, Shenker, &amp; Bonagura, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710392536">Hartsough &amp; Lambert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710392536">Mannuzza &amp; Klein, 1999</xref>). Many of these early studies failed to include questions about behaviors prognostic of later use (e.g., age of first use and a history of having used multiple illicit drugs), included only male participants, and rarely considered the role of comorbid CD. When using developmentally sensitive indicators and examining the role of comorbid CD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054710392536">Molina and Pelham (2003)</xref> found higher rates and earlier initiation of both alcohol and nonmarijuana drug use and substance use disorder among adolescents with ADHD compared with those without ADHD. The highest rates were found among those with ADHD + CD. Given that substance use during adolescence predicts continued substance use during young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710392536">Johnston, OâMalley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2009</xref>) and that individuals with ADHD begin using alcohol and illicit drugs at an earlier age and with greater frequency than their peers, higher rates of substance use and substance use disorder (SUD) can be expected among young adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies have identified important differences in the alcohol use patterns of young adults with and without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1087054710392536">Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1087054710392536">Wilens, Biederman, &amp; Mick, 1998</xref>; Wilens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710392536">Biederman, &amp; Spencer, 2002</xref>). Although young adults with ADHD do not appear to use alcohol at higher rates than their peers without the disorder, they are significantly more likely to abuse alcohol or have alcohol use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054710392536">Smith, Molina, &amp; Pelham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1087054710392536">Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1993</xref>). The absence of a between-group difference in rates of use may be explained by the fact that increased alcohol use is normative during young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710392536">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, behavior patterns that constitute alcohol abuse or dependence are outside the norm. Although illicit drug use has been studied to a lesser extent than alcohol use in this population, findings indicate significantly higher levels of illicit drug use among young adults with ADHD compared with those without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710392536">Biederman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710392536">Hechtman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710392536">Lambert &amp; Hartsough, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710392536">Mannuzza &amp; Klein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054710392536">Milberger, Biederman, Faraone, Wilens, &amp; Chu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1087054710392536">Weiss, 1979</xref>). In the only study that considered comorbid CD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392536">Barkley et al. (2004)</xref> found that young adults with ADHD alone had a significantly higher rate of illicit drug use relative to controls. Those with ADHD + CD, however, had the highest rate of use among all groups. Additional studies are needed to further examine the associations between substance use, ADHD, and CD in young adults.</p>
<p>The college years overlap with the peak developmental period for problematic substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710392536">Littlefield et al., 2009</xref>). For college students with ADHD, environmental influences specific to the traditional college experience may uniquely influence patterns of alcohol and illicit drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710392536">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). However, up to this point, substance use in college students with ADHD has largely gone unstudied. In contrast, substance use behaviors in the general college student population have been studied extensively. Three large-scale projectsâthe Monitoring the Future Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710392536">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>), the College Alcohol Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1087054710392536">Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>), and the Core Alcohol and Drug Survey (CORE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710392536">Core Institute, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1087054710392536">Presley, 1994</xref>)âfound that patterns of alcohol and substance use among college students differ from those of the general young adult population. For example, findings consistently show that college students engage in riskier alcohol consumption behaviors than their peers who are not attending college and that those who are members of fraternities or sororities engage in the riskiest patterns of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710392536">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). Results from the Monitoring the Future Study show that illicit drug use is also a significant concern on college campuses. One third of all college students report past-year marijuana use and one fifth report past-year nonmarijuana illicit drug use. As with alcohol use, patterns of illicit drug use in college students differ from those of young adults not attending college. Although marijuana use is similar between these two groups, current daily marijuana use is significantly lower among college students. When considering all illicit drugs other than marijuana, college students report significantly lower rates of use in the past year than their noncollege peers. As these studies demonstrate, patterns of substance use differ between college students and their same-age, noncollege peers. Findings derived from studies of noncollege young adults may not apply to the college student population.</p>
<p>In summary, a robust literature demonstrates that adolescents and young adults with ADHD engage in riskier patterns of substance use than their non-ADHD peers. Unique vulnerabilities associated with ADHD may intensify the challenges associated with the transition from adolescence to young adulthood that occurs within the context of the college environment. These vulnerabilities may place college students with ADHD at elevated risk for engagement in risky substance use behaviors. For the reasons described earlier, findings from studies of adolescents and young adults with ADHD may not generalize to college students with ADHD. The absence of studies examining these issues in college students with ADHD therefore represents a significant gap in the literature.</p>
<p>The current study aimed to evaluate associations between ADHD diagnosis and patterns of substance use in a college student sample. We addressed limitations in the existing literature in three important ways: (a) by utilizing a sample of college students with retrospectively confirmed childhood ADHD diagnoses, (b) by examining the role of CD when studying associations between ADHD and substance use, and (c) by including a large proportion of female participants. On the basis of the existing literature of adolescents and young adults with ADHD, we hypothesized that in our college student sample the presence of <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710392536">APA, 2000</xref>) ADHD would be associated with higher rates of current tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use; earlier age of first use across substances; patterns of harmful or hazardous use across substances; and greater substance-related impairment.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 91 full-time undergraduate students enrolled in a large, public, Mid-Atlantic university: 53 with ADHD and 38 without ADHD. Participants were recruited through flyers advertising a study of substance use in students with and without ADHD and through electronic postings for extra credit opportunities available to students in introductory psychology courses. Following a brief telephone screen, respondents were invited for a onetime appointment at our ADHD Program within the universityâs Department of Psychology. All participants in the ADHD group met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for current ADHD, based on guidelines outlined in the seminal article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054710392536">McGough and Barkley (2004)</xref>. Within the fields of psychology and psychiatry, there is an ongoing debate about how to best apply the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD criteria in adults given that the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria were based on field trials conducted with elementary school-age boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710392536">Lahey, Applegate, McBurnett, &amp; Biederman, 1994</xref>). As a result, several of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms are reflective of ADHD in children and less relevant to adults (e.g., running or climbing on things excessively, difficulty playing quietly, etc.). For this reason, McGough and Barkley, in their seminal paper, recommend that a diagnosis be made during adulthood (a) only when there exists clear evidence of childhood <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD symptoms and impairment based on retrospective report and (b) when participants meet reduced current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptom criteria (i.e., a minimum of four or five current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of inattention or four or five current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity) and present clear evidence of functional impairment.</p>
<p>For inclusion in the present study, participants with ADHD were required to (a) retrospectively meet full <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria for ADHD during childhood (i.e., a minimum of six <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of inattention or six symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity), according to self- or parent-report; (b) have a minimum of four current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of inattention or four current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity according to self- or parent-report and clear evidence of current functional impairment; and (c) have a Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) ADHD Index <italic>T</italic>-score above 60 (i.e., one standard deviation above the mean). Although a prior diagnosis of ADHD was not required for participation in the ADHD group, it should be noted that 66% (<italic>n</italic> = 35) of participants in the ADHD group reported that they had received a prior ADHD diagnosis. As noted previously, all participants in the ADHD group were required to retrospectively meet full <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptom and impairment criteria for ADHD during childhood based on self- or parent-report.</p>
<p>Participants in the non-ADHD comparison group were required to have the following: (a) no history of an ADHD diagnosis or prescription of ADHD medication according to self-report, (b) fewer than three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of inattention and fewer than three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity, (c) fewer than three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of CD with no history of the disorder according to self-report, and (4) a CAARS ADHD Index <italic>T</italic>-score below 40 (i.e., one standard deviation below the mean). To enhance generalizability, participants in either group were not excluded on the basis of having a self-reported learning disability (LD) diagnosis or other psychiatric disorder. In addition, all participants were required to be enrolled as full-time undergraduate students and to be living away from their parents during the academic year. The residency criteria ensured that participants were college students who were no longer living at home and relying on their parents as a principle source of external structure.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>ADHD group classification was determined through (a) the administration of a semistructured interview assessing <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD symptoms during childhood and young adulthood, (b) parent responses to questionnaires about the presence of past and current ADHD symptoms in their child (when available), and (c) responses on the CAARS self-report questionnaire. In accordance with procedures previously used in our research laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Raggi, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Seymour, et al., 2008</xref>) and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710392536">Biederman &amp; Spencer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710392536">Faraone, Biederman, &amp; Milberger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710392536">Faraone, Biederman, &amp; Monuteaux, 2002</xref>), investigators administered the ADHD and CD modules of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710392536">Ambrosini, 2000</xref>) to the participants with modifications appropriate for retrospective and current self-report by adults. A clinical psychology doctoral student administered a majority of the diagnostic interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 80) under the close supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist who directs the Department of Psychologyâs ADHD Program. A senior undergraduate research assistant administered 11 interviews under the close supervision of the advanced doctoral student and faculty supervisor. Supervision included having the clinical psychology doctoral student present in the interview room with the research assistant to aid with interview administration when necessary. All interviews were audio recorded for supervision purposes and a second interviewer coded 20% of the interviews. Interrater reliability analyses using the kappa statistic were performed to determine consistency among raters for ADHD diagnosis and CD diagnosis. Kappa values were 1.0 for ADHD and 1.0 for CD.</p>
<p>Informant ratings of participant ADHD symptoms are frequently used in ADHD diagnosis (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710392536">Katz, Petscher, &amp; Wells, 2009</xref>). Studies have shown that adults with ADHD may report fewer ADHD symptoms and impairment than collateral informants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054710392536">Mannuzza, Klein, Klein, Bessler, &amp; Shrout, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054710392536">Murphy &amp; Schachar, 2000</xref>). Therefore, informant reports of childhood and current symptoms were obtained whenever possible from a parent who had frequent contact with the participant both at the time of the interview and during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710392536">Belendiuk, Clarke, Chronis, &amp; Raggi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054710392536">McGough &amp; Barkley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054710392536">Murphy &amp; Schachar, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were asked to provide consent for the researcher to contact a parent for the purpose of obtaining informant ratings of ADHD symptoms but were explicitly told that they would not be excluded from the study if they did not allow parental contact. Including only the participants who consented to parental contact would have produced a biased sample and may have limited the degree to which participants felt comfortable responding candidly to questions about substance use. A total of 88% of ADHD participants (<italic>n</italic> = 47) and 56% of non-ADHD participants (<italic>n</italic> = 22) provided consent for parent participation. Informant report forms, an informant consent form, and a stamped self-addressed return envelope were mailed to the parents of students who provided consent for parental participation. A single reminder call was placed to parents who did not return forms within 3 weeks. Parents were not compensated for completing forms. Informant ratings were received for 73% of ADHD participants (<italic>n</italic> = 38) and 29% of non-ADHD participants (<italic>n</italic> = 11). The large discrepancy between groups in the percentage of informant reports received was driven largely by a group difference participant willingness to provide consent for parental contact. Possible reasons for this difference include (a) students with ADHD may be more likely to have a history of parental involvement in mental health treatment or educational intervention, (b) participants in the ADHD group felt more invested in the study because they are directly affected by the diagnosis under examination, or (c) participants in the ADHD group may have been less likely to consider consequences associated with the researcher contacting their parents.</p>
<p>Guidelines for the use of informant ratings in diagnosing ADHD have not yet been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710392536">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1087054710392536">Piacentini, Cohen, and Cohen (1992)</xref> have recommended combining self- and informant-reports such that any symptom endorsed by either source was counted toward the symptom total (i.e., the âor ruleâ). As with prior studies conducted in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Raggi, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Seymour, et al., 2008</xref>), we followed Piacentiniâs recommendation and combined self- and informant-reports using the âorâ rule. As informant ratings were not available for all participants, it is possible that differences in symptom count emerged between those whose parents participated and those whose parents did not participate. In a post hoc review of the data, all participants in the ADHD group with informant reports were found to meet symptom criteria for an ADHD diagnosis based on self-report alone. When informant reports were integrated using the âor rule,â the number of symptoms per participant increased, and for 4 participants, subtype classification changed from inattentive type to combined type. ADHD group classification (i.e., ADHD vs. non-ADHD group), however, did not change for any participants.</p>
<p>CD diagnosis was based solely on participant responses to questions from the CD module of the K-SADS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710392536">Ambrosini, 2000</xref>). This module inquires about CD symptoms present during childhood and adolescence (i.e., before age 18). Notably, all participants with a history of CD met criteria for the adolescent-onset subtype and primarily endorsed symptoms and impairment related to truancy, breaking curfew, lying, and shoplifting.</p>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the universityâs Institutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed consent after procedures were described in detail. Compensation for participation was provided in the form of extra-credit points for introductory psychology classes or a US$12 cash payment.</p>

<title>Assessment of ADHD and CD</title>
<p>The CAARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710392536">Conners et al., 1999</xref>) provided a dimensional measurement of participantsâ current ADHD symptoms. The CAARS ADHD Index score was one indicator used to determine placement in the ADHD or comparison group. The CAARS is a reliable and valid measure that assesses the core features of ADHD as seen in children and adolescents, while adding content unique to adult expression of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710392536">Erhardt, Epstein, Conners, Parker, &amp; Sitarenios, 1999</xref>). This measure has excellent psychometric properties and provides essential age- and gender-based normative data to supplement the adult ADHD diagnosis based on diagnostic interview.</p>
<p>The ADHD and CD modules of the K-SADS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710392536">Ambrosini, 2000</xref>; Biederman &amp; Montreaux, 2002), modified for past and current self-report by adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710392536">Biederman &amp; Spencer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710392536">Faraone et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710392536">Faraone et al., 2002</xref>), were administered to participants. The K-SADS has well-established reliability for the diagnosis of ADHD and CD in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710392536">Ambrosini, 2000</xref>) and has been used by our laboratory and others in studies of adult ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710392536">Biederman &amp; Spencer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Raggi, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710392536">Chronis-Tuscano, Seymour, et al., 2008</xref>). To facilitate retrospective recall of symptoms, interviewers asked participants whether symptoms were present during âearly elementary schoolâ that was then defined as third grade or earlier. At times, participants provided examples of childhood symptoms and impairment that were present around the age of 9 or 10 because they were unable to recall specific examples from kindergarten through second grade. In so far as we required that all participants in the ADHD group endorsed symptoms and impairment present during âearly elementary school,â we did not adhere to the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> age of onset criteria with the stringency found in studies of children with ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054710392536">McGough and Barkley (2004)</xref> and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710392536">Faraone et al., 2006</xref>) recommend an age of symptom onset before the age of 12, and our procedures were consistent with these guidelines.</p>
<p>The Childhood Symptom ScaleâOther Report Form and Current Symptoms Scaleâ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710392536">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>) were mailed to parents to obtain informant ratings of the participantsâ past and current ADHD symptoms. These measures each contain 18 items that map directly onto <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms of ADHD. Responses range from <italic>rarely or never</italic> to <italic>very often</italic>, with the two highest responses (<italic>often</italic> and <italic>very often</italic>) considered clinically significant. The measures also inquire about age of symptom onset and related impairment. Internal consistency coefficients were calculated for the Childhood and Current Symptom Scales using data from the current study. Cronbachâs alphas were .76 for the Childhood Symptom Scale and .68 for the Current Symptom Scale.</p>

<title>Substance Use</title>
<p>The alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054710392536">Saunders, Aasland, Babor, De La Fuenta, &amp; Grant, 1993</xref>) was developed by the World Health Organization as a simple, brief method of screening for excessive drinking and related impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710392536">Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, &amp; Monteiro, 2001</xref>). This self-report questionnaire provides a continuous score comprising 10 items on three factors: (a) consumption: 3 items assessing quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, (b) dependence: 3 items assessing alcohol dependence, and (c) hazardous use: 4 items assessing problems caused by drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1087054710392536">Rist, Glockner-Rist, &amp; Demmel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054710392536">Saunders et al., 1993</xref>). Each question is scored according to a 5-point scale (0-4). Higher total scores on the AUDIT indicate higher levels of risky alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710392536">Babor et al., 2001</xref>). Internal consistency for the AUDIT has been shown to be strong. Analyses of the consumption factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1087054710392536">Shields, Guttmannova, &amp; Caruso, 2004</xref>) and the total score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710392536">Kokotailo et al., 2004</xref>) have produced Cronbachâs alphas of .81 and .80, respectively, in college samples. Testâretest reliability has been shown to be satisfactory in a general population sample with an intraclass correlation coefficient of .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1087054710392536">Selin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The drug use disorders identification test (DUDIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710392536">Berman, Bergman, Palmstierna, &amp; Schlyter, 2005</xref>) is an 11-item self-report instrument intended for use with the AUDIT. Like the AUDIT, each question is scored according to a 5-point scale (0-4) and provides a continuous score of drug use and related impairment. Studies of young adults have yielded different findings when marijuana use was considered independently of other illicit drug use. Therefore, the DUDIT was modified to obtain separate scores for marijuana and nonmarijuana illicit drug use. Psychometric properties for this scale are not available in the existing literature. In the current sample, internal consistency coefficients were calculated separately for the DUDITâmarijuana and DUDITânonmarijuana measures. Calculations included all items in each measure. Cronbachâs alphas were .77 for the DUDITâmarijuana and .68 for the DUDITânonmarijuana.</p>
<p>The CORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710392536">Core Institute, 2005</xref>) is a 198-item rating scale with a number of subscales designed to assesses quantity and frequency of alcohol and illicit substance use, consequences associated with substance use (e.g., âHow often have you gotten into an argument or fight due to your drinking or drug use?â), and reasons for use of alcohol or drugs (e.g., âDo you believe alcohol facilitates a connection with peers?â) in a college student population. It was selected for its strong psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710392536">Core Institute, 2005</xref>) and its relevance to the studyâs research questions. In the current study, we used subscales related to the quantity and frequency of drug use and negative consequences of alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710392536">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Analytic Approach</title>
<p>Regression analyses were used to examine the association between ADHD diagnosis and several indices of substance use outcomes, while also examining associations with CD. Preliminary analyses were first conducted to examine the extent to which the demographic variables of age, race/ ethnicity, gender, fraternity/sorority membership, current ADHD medication status, and LD diagnosis were associated with the outcome variables. These control variables were selected on the basis of prior literature, suggesting a relationship, positive or negative, to substance use behaviors in college students and/or young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710392536">Douglas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710392536">Kollins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054710392536">Mannuzza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1087054710392536">Volkow &amp; Swanson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1087054710392536">Wechsler, Dowdall, Davenport, &amp; Castillo, 1995</xref>), or because the difference between ADHD and non-ADHD groups was statistically significant in the current sample. Demographic variables significantly associated with each outcome variable were included on the first step of the regression equation. ADHD and CD diagnoses (dummy coded) were entered on the next step. Finally, although our sample size did not allow for sufficiently powered analyses, exploratory analyses were then conducted to examine the association between the interaction of ADHD and CD (ADHD + CD comorbidity) and the outcome variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1087054710392536">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Age was frequently associated with the variables of interest, and these associations were always in a positive direction, suggesting greater use with increasing age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710392536">Tables 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">4</xref>). In addition, fraternity/sorority membership was positively associated with all alcohol-related variables with the exception of age of first use (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710392536">Table 3</xref>) and with frequency of current nonmarijuana illicit drug use (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">Table 4</xref>). African American race/ethnicity status was positively associated with having ever used marijuana (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">Table 4</xref>), and Asian race/ethnicity status was positively associated with frequency of arguments or fights resulting from alcohol use (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710392536">Table 3</xref>). Finally, male gender was positively associated with the DUDITâmarijuana total score (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">Table 4</xref>). Surprisingly, neither current ADHD medication use nor self-reported LD was significantly associated with any of the outcome variables.</p>

<title>Tobacco</title>
<p>The presence of ADHD was uniquely associated (i.e., independent of CD history) with having first used tobacco at an earlier age. In addition, when compared to their peers without ADHD, those with ADHD were 3.6 times more likely to have ever used tobacco (95% CI [1.424, 9.431]). ADHD was also independently associated with a greater frequency of tobacco use during the past 30 days. Associations between ADHD + CD and tobacco use were not significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710392536">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Alcohol</title>
<p>ADHD, independent of CD, was not associated with an earlier age of alcohol use initiation, with the likelihood of having ever used alcohol, or with the quantity or frequency of alcohol use during the past 6 months. However, ADHD was independently associated with higher total scores on the AUDIT, higher scores on the dangerous or hazardous use subscale of the AUDIT, and with a greater likelihood of having endorsed an item indicative of dependence or emerging dependence on the AUDIT (odds ratio = 3.70, CI [1.397, 9.821]). Findings are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710392536">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>Among those who had used alcohol in the past year (<italic>n</italic> = 87), ADHD was associated with a greater frequency of the following consequences of use: having a hangover, getting into an argument or fight, getting nauseated or having vomited, experiencing memory loss, doing something he or she later regretted, and being hurt or injured. Associations between ADHD + CD and each measure of alcohol use or consequences of use were not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710392536">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Drug Use</title>
<p>When compared to their peers without ADHD, those with ADHD were 3.3 times more likely to have ever used marijuana (95% CI [1.208, 8.553]) and 4.5 times more likely to have ever used nonmarijuana illicit drugs (95% CI [1.353, 15.282]). ADHD was also independently associated with having first used marijuana and nonmarijuana drugs at an earlier age and with higher levels of current substance-related impairment on measures of both marijuana and nonmarijuana illicit drug use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">Table 4</xref>). ADHD was not, however, independently associated with a greater frequency of marijuana or nonmarijuana illicit drug use during the past 30 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054710392536">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of exploratory analyses showed that ADHD + CD were significantly associated with higher scores on the global measure of impairment related to marijuana use (DUDITâmarijuana). However, no significant associations between ADHD + CD and nonmarijuana illicit drug use (DUDITânonmarijuana) were identified.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the very first to examine associations between <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD and substance use in college students. Although the existing adolescent and young adult ADHD literature provides a useful foundation, findings from these studies may not generalize to the college student population. Three categories of substances were examined in the current study: (a) tobacco, (b) alcohol, and (c) illicit drugs. Consistent with our predictions and with the existing ADHD literature, ADHD was independently associated with a greater likelihood of having ever used tobacco, using tobacco at an earlier age, and higher rates of current tobacco use. It has been hypothesized that individuals with ADHD may be self-medicating with nicotine, a stimulant found to improve mood and performance on tests of attention and processing speed in individuals with and without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710392536">Levin, Conners, Silva, Canu, &amp; March, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1087054710392536">Poltavski &amp; Petros, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1087054710392536">Rezani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1087054710392536">Trimmel &amp; Wittberger, 2004</xref>). Recent studies have tested alternative hypothesis to explain the high rates of tobacco use among this population. Specifically, researchers have found that adult smokers with ADHD experience a greater disruption in cognitive processes when they abstain from smoking relative to smokers without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710392536">Kollins, McClernon, &amp; Epstein, 2009</xref>). This same group also found that cognitive functioning may be differentially affected in smokers with ADHD because of an overlap in the neural circuitry implicated in nicotine addiction and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710392536">McClernon et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with studies of adolescents with ADHD, college students with ADHD did not report consuming alcohol in greater quantities or with greater frequency than their non-ADHD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1087054710392536">Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1087054710392536">Wilens et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1087054710392536">2002</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054710392536">Smith, Molina, and Pelham (2002)</xref>, however, this should not be interpreted as evidence that young adults with ADHD are not consuming alcohol at high rates. Rather, high rates of alcohol consumption are normative at this developmental stage, and young adults with ADHD appear to be âkeeping upâ with their non-ADHD peers. Given this finding, it does not appear to be the amount of alcohol consumed by college students with ADHD that puts them at risk for alcohol-related problems. Rather, this population appears to be more vulnerable in developing alcohol dependence or experiencing other negative consequences (e.g., doing something he or she later regretted, being hurt or injured, and having a hangover) as a result of their alcohol use.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous studies, linking CD to increased rates of alcohol dependence in young adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710392536">Barkley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710392536">Gittelman et al., 1985</xref>), the present study identified an increased risk for alcohol dependence or emerging dependence specific to ADHD, independent of CD history. Differences in alcohol use assessment methods and sample composition may partially explain these inconsistencies. In addition, differences in CD subtype (childhood- vs. adolescent-onset) may have influenced these findings. Specifically, individuals with adolescent onset, the subtype endorsed by all participants with CD in the present study, have largely been found to demonstrate less severe dysfunction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054710392536">Moffitt, 2003</xref>, for a review). However, additional studies are needed to conclusively determine the factors that may contribute to the discrepant CD-related findings.</p>
<p>Consistent with our predictions of marijuana and nonmarijuana illicit drug use, ADHD, independent of CD history, was associated with the following: (a) an increased likelihood of having ever used marijuana or nonmarijuana illicit drugs, (b) an earlier age of first use for both illicit drug categories, and (c) higher levels of impairment related to illicit drug use. Despite higher impairment ratings, current frequency of marijuana and nonmarijuana illicit drug use was not predicted by ADHD alone or by ADHD with a history of CD. Consistent with the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392536">Barkley et al. 2004</xref>) in exploratory analyses, the highest level of marijuana-related impairment was predicted by ADHD with a history of adolescent-onset CD.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the current findings. This study was conducted at a large, public, Mid-Atlantic university with stringent admissions criteria and included only âtraditionalâ college students (i.e., those attending college full-time immediately or shortly after completing high school). Therefore, results can only be generalized to similar students with ADHD attending universities with similar characteristics. Additional studies that use more diverse samples at multiple universities are needed. In addition, although the current study addresses a gap in the existing literature by including a large proportion of females in the ADHD sample, this gender distribution may not be representative of the actual college student ADHD population. Likewise, the way in which the sample was collected (i.e., reliance on volunteers who responded to flyers or received extra credit for class) may have resulted in a biased sample. For example, participants who volunteered may have had lower rates of CD or substance use.</p>
<p>Our relatively small sample limited our ability to conduct a number of potentially important analyses. These include examining interactions between ADHD and history of CD as well as studying the moderating effects of factors such as gender, ADHD subtype, and ADHD medication status. As each of these factors is accompanied by different correlates and comorbidity profiles, they should be examined in future studies with larger samples. In addition, the cross-sectional nature of the study design did not allow for the identification of developmental precursors to the substance use behaviors under examination. The current study also lacked a noncollege student ADHD comparison group. The absence of this comparison group limited our ability to interpret differences between current study findings and those of previous studies examining noncollege young adults with ADHD. Future studies should consider including noncollege comparison groups.</p>
<p>The present study relied solely on the use of self-report data for information related to substance use. Objective measures of use (e.g., hair follicle testing) could potentially provide more accurate indicators of substance use behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710392536">Harrison &amp; Huges, 1997</xref>) and should be incorporated into future studies. Collateral informant ratings of past and current ADHD symptoms were available for only a portion of participants. In future studies, researchers should consider the benefits of requiring informant reports for all participants while weighing the impact of this requirement on sample composition. In addition, the method of data collection differed between participants and informants. Future studies should include interviews with informants as well as participants. Likewise, future studies should include a more thorough assessment of learning disabilities. In the present study, LD diagnosis was captured by participant responses to a single self-report question about presence or absence of an LD diagnosis. This is likely to be an inadequate method for accurately capturing students with an LD.</p>
<sec id="section15-1087054710392536">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study findings suggest that college students with ADHD are at risk for problematic alcohol and drug use. Although these findings are preliminary, they are useful for informing current intervention and prevention efforts on college campuses. Therapists working with this population should consider the role of substance use in patient symptom and impairment profiles and incorporate substance use treatment when necessary. Likewise, parents of students with ADHD and the students themselves should be aware of the elevated risk for problematic substance use. With this knowledge, they may opt to select a college with fewer known environmental risk factors for excessive alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1087054710392536">Wechsler &amp; Nelson, 2008</xref>) or choose living environments that reduce the risk of problematic substance use (i.e., substance-free housing, living at home with parents, and avoiding fraternity/sorority housing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1087054710392536">Park, Sher, &amp; Krull, 2009</xref>). In addition, medical doctors prescribing stimulant medication should be particularly vigilant about assessing current substance use and provide extensive education about the hazards of mixing stimulant medication with alcohol or illicit drugs. Future research is needed to replicate the current findings and examine mechanisms underlying the association between ADHD and substance-related problems. These studies would provide an empirical foundation for the development of prevention and treatment programs addressing substance use problems in college students with ADHD.</p>
