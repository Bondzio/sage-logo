<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Academic health center.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects</italic>. In total, 23,384 PET and PET/computed tomography (CT) scans were performed between December 2001 and April 2011.</p>

A significant difference between malignant SUV<sub>max</sub> and benign SUV<sub>max</sub> was found (mean ± SD, 7.04 ± 7.88 for malignancies vs 3.85 ± 3.06 for benign tumors, <italic>P</italic> = .0292).

<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. All thyroid nodules with focal uptake on <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET/CT should be considered at higher risk of malignancy than those discovered incidentally by other imaging modalities. Higher SUV<sub>max</sub> values are more indicative of malignant lesions. All lesions should be evaluated with ultrasonography ± fine-needle aspiration if no clinical contraindications exist.

<p>Thyroid nodules are common in the population, with 4% to 7% patients harboring clinically palpable nodules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811435770">1</xref></sup> In addition, up to 50% of patients older than 50 years harbor nonpalpable nodules noted on imaging for nonthyroidal disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435770">2</xref></sup> These “incidentalomas” rarely harbor malignant disease and have an associated cancer risk of 5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435770">2</xref></sup> Despite the low risk, all patients are recommended to undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for evaluation, which currently remains the “gold standard” for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811435770">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The past decade has seen the establishment of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a valuable imaging modality in oncology. <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography exploits the fact that tumor cells have higher metabolic activity and concentrate 18-FDG more than normal tissue due to GLUT overexpression, a glucose transport protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811435770">4</xref></sup> Thus, GLUT1 has been found to be strongly expressed in tumor cells. <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography has proven itself useful in providing information for diagnosis, tumor staging, surveillance, and monitoring response to therapy.</p>
<p>For thyroid cancers, FDG-PET has proven reliable in the postoperative detection and management of some well-differentiated thyroid cancers and medullary thyroid cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811435770">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811435770">7</xref></sup> Positron emission tomography activity of thyroid nodules is inversely related to radioiodine avidity and a favorable prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435770">8</xref></sup> As thyroid tissue becomes less differentiated, its ability to concentrate iodine is diminished, although PET activity increases. In those patients with elevated thyroglobulin and negative I-131 scans, the sensitivity of PET for the identification of recurrent/metastatic disease ranges from 66% to 93.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811435770">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811435770">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite its usefulness in postoperative surveillance for thyroid carcinoma, debate remains regarding the preoperative significance and appropriate management of incidental thyroid uptake noted on FDG-PET obtained for nonthyroidal disease. Studies have reported incidental focal thyroid uptake ranging from 1% to 4% with malignancy rates ranging from 14% to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435770">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811435770">16</xref></sup> Although focal standardized uptake value (SUV) cutoff values ranging from 3.5 to 5 have been reported useful for the differentiation of benign from malignant nodules, sample sizes remain small, and a well-accepted SUV cutoff has yet to be established for distinguishing benign from malignant nodules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811435770">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811435770">18</xref></sup> Our investigation, therefore, aims to further characterize differences of SUV between benign and malignant lesions with a large series in an attempt to identify those at increased risk for thyroid malignancy. We also investigate significance of change in SUV<sub>max</sub> over time in those patients with serial FDG-PET scans that resulted from surveillance of other oncologic diagnoses.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Approval for the project was obtained through the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board. Patients undergoing FDG-PET (2001-2004) or FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) (2004-present) from December 2001 to April 2011 were selected. A retrospective chart review of those patients with abnormal uptake in the thyroid bed noted on FDG-PET was completed. We excluded patients undergoing PET for known thyroid disease, patients with known thyroid abnormalities, and patients whose final thyroid pathology findings included micropapillary carcinoma.</p>
<p>For those patients with focal uptake patterns, SUV<sub>max</sub>, age, sex, size of thyroid lesion on final pathology, indication for PET scan, and final histopathology or cytology were obtained.</p>
<p>The earlier imaging studies were acquired with a GE Advance NXI whole-body PET scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. However, most of the scans (from mid-2004) were performed on 1 of 2 PET/CT scanners: CTI-Reveal or Biograph 6 (Siemens Medical Systems, New York, New York). The CT portion was acquired with a Siemens Sensation helical scanner (Biograph, 6-slice; CTI-Reveal, 16-slice). The PET detectors consisted of lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals arranged in a full-ring gantry (Pico Electronics, Pelham, New York). Images were obtained 60 minutes after the intravenous administration of 10 to 15 mCi (370-444 MBq) FDG and extended from vertex to toes with 4 minutes per bed position. Image reconstruction was performed on a CTI Wizard workstation. A dedicated PET/CT software (Mirada Medical Ltd, Oxford, England) workstation was used for image analysis. Thyroid uptake was classified as focal or diffuse depending on pattern. Focal lesions were defined as FDG uptake in an isolated area of the thyroid gland, whereas diffuse uptake was defined as FDG uptake in the entire thyroid gland. Regions of interest were drawn around any focal or diffuse thyroid uptake on a computer with subsequent calculation of SUV<sub>max</sub> based on lean body mass.</p>
<p>Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed with or (rarely) without ultrasound guidance for those patients referred with focal SUV patterns. Three patients had no FNAB performed before surgery. Cytologic diagnosis was made by an experienced cytopathologist, and patients were either observed or referred for surgical intervention dependent on American Thyroid Association guidelines in effect at the time for the management of thyroid nodules.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was conducted for those patients with complete data sets, with the focus being the association of SUV and malignancy. Patients with and without malignancy were compared to one another using Wilcoxon scores and the Kruskal-Wallis test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was constructed using the SUV<sub>max</sub> from those patients with PET data within 3 months from their date of pathology diagnosis (n = 64) to maximize the sensitivity and specificity between the malignant and benign lesions. A Spearman rank correlation was used to examine the relationship between SUV<sub>max</sub> and maximum diameter of the focal thyroid lesion, both overall and subgrouped by the cytopathologist’s diagnosis. Regression models with 2-tailed probability values and 95% confidence interval for all significant factors were used to determine the strength of associations, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 considered statistically significant. Patients with results of indeterminate cytology and their respective lesion’s SUV were analyzed as a subset.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 23,384 FDG-PET and FDG-PET/CT scans were reviewed between December 2001 and April 2011. Incidental thyroid uptake was noted in 1309 PET scans (5.60%) with focal thyroid uptake being present in 690 (2.95%) cases and diffuse uptake being present in 619 (2.65%) cases. Complete data were available for 359 PET scans distributed among 103 patients. All patients had undergone PET imaging for further characterization of another malignancy. The primary sites of malignancy or disease were as follows: 2 amyloidosis, 16 breast, 7 lymphoma, 2 leukemia, 8 lung, 56 multiple myeloma, 2 melanoma, 2 Merkel cell carcinoma, 3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 2 pancreatic, 1 renal cell carcinoma, 1 salivary gland carcinoma, 1 ovarian, and 1 colon.</p>
<p>Results from thyroid cytology and pathology are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811435770"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Thyroid malignancy was identified in 28 of 103 patients (27%), whereas the remaining 76 patients (73%) harbored benign nodules. The majority of malignant lesions (n = 25; 89%) were primary tumors from the thyroid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811435770"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), with papillary thyroid carcinoma being the most prevalent malignancy (n = 22). The demographics of the 103 patients with focal thyroid incidentalomas revealed 38 men and 65 women. The mean age was 62.3 ± 11.95 years (range, 19-84 years).</p>

<p>The average ± SD of focal SUV<sub>max</sub> was 7.04 ± 7.88 (range, 1.3-30.9) for all malignant lesions vs 3.85 ± 3.06 (range, 1.02-16.0) for benign lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435770"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Not only did the SUV<sub>max</sub> tend to be higher in those patients with malignancy, but the tendency was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0292). Average size ± SD of the malignant thyroid lesion was 1.5 ± 1.04 cm (range, 0.2-4.5 cm) on final pathology, whereas the average size ± SD of benign lesions measured 1.6 ± 1.59 cm (range, 0.8-8.0 cm) on ultrasound. Fisher exact test and univariate statistical analysis were performed and found no statistically significant correlation between benign and malignant lesions with regard to sex (confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.86; <italic>P</italic> = .1735), age (<italic>P</italic> = .7637), and size of lesion (<italic>P</italic> = .5345).</p>

<p>Those patients identified with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were noted to have stage 1 disease the majority of the time (87.0%; 20/23). One patient was noted to harbor lymphatic metastasis on final pathology that was not identified preoperatively on FDG-PET/CT. When the ROC curve was constructed for those patients with PET data within 3 months of definitive pathologic diagnosis, the cutoff SUV<sub>max</sub> value of 4.2 yielded a maximal sensitivity of 64.3% and specificity of 78.0% (area under the ROC curve was 0.688; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435770"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This resulted in a positive predictive value of 45.5% and negative predictive value of 83.6% given the 22% prevalence of malignancy among the 64 subjects in the analysis subset.</p>
<p>We also investigated the serial SUV measurements for all lesions with more than 1 SUV within 24 months from their date of diagnosis. Regression analysis was performed on 42 lesions to compare benign and malignant lesions individually, as well as against one another. Serial SUV uptake of benign and malignant lesions appeared to have no significant change over time; subjects’ rates of change in SUV<sub>max</sub> had a median of −0.017 units per month (signed-rank <italic>P</italic> = .22) among benign lesions and a median of 0.000 units per month (signed-rank <italic>P</italic> = 1.00) among cancers. When the above rates of change were compared against one another via Kruskal-Wallis test, no significant difference was found (<italic>P</italic> = .60; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435770"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>The expanding utilization of FDG-PET has resulted in an increased identification of incidental thyroid lesions. Although the increased utilization of combination FDG-PET/CT fused imaging has improved the ability to localize and further characterize these lesions, the diagnostic sensitivity of the SUV is still controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811435770">12</xref></sup> As a result, numerous investigations have been undertaken to determine the significance of these lesions. Diffuse uptake of the thyroid gland is benign in nature and is usually associated with underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811435770">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811435770">21</xref></sup> Focal uptake, however, has been associated with an increased incidence of malignancy and has been a focus of investigation to further characterize those at risk for cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435770">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811435770">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reported prevalence and rate of malignancy for lesions with focal SUV vary in the literature. Cohen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435770">14</xref></sup> reported a 2.3% (102/4525) prevalence of focal thyroid FDG uptake on PET with 47% (7/15) harboring malignancy. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435770">11</xref></sup> reported a 1.1% (45/4136) prevalence of focal uptake with a 50% (16/32) risk of malignancy. Chen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811435770">15</xref></sup> investigated the rate of focal thyroid FDG uptake and risk of malignancy in healthy patients undergoing cancer screening PET, reporting an incidence of 1.2% (60/4803) with 14% (7/50) of those lesions positive for papillary carcinoma.</p>
<p>In our review of patients undergoing FDG-PET, the prevalence of focal thyroid FDG uptake was 2.87%. The prevalence of diffuse uptake was noted to be 2.58%, which is similar to rates reported by Karantanis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811435770">21</xref></sup> (2.9%) but lower than rates reported by Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435770">11</xref></sup> (3.6%) and Yasuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811435770">19</xref></sup> (3.3%) for a Japanese population. The risk of malignancy for thyroid lesions with focal uptake in our study was 26.9% (28/104), which falls within the reported rates of 23% to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435770">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811435770"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811435770">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The large majority (87%; 20/23) of patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in our study were noted to have stage 1 disease, correlating with a favorable survival prognosis. In our only patient with cervical lymph node metastasis, the preoperative PET data provided no information regarding the status of the nodal disease, which has been reported by other investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811435770">22</xref></sup> Although it has been reported that patients with known malignancies are at higher rates of developing secondary malignancies, no significant association was noted with age and previous malignancy history in our study population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599811435770">23</xref></sup> The majority of uptake noted on FDG-PET in this study was a result of a separate thyroid primary malignancy; the remainder comprised thyroid metastasis detected by PET from acute myelogenous leukemia, Merkel cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of the present study is not all patients with focal SUV patterns underwent surgical intervention. However, most underwent FNAB, with the majority performed under ultrasound guidance. Three had thyroidectomy without a preoperative FNAB. One must keep in mind that patients who are FDG-PET positive during staging of metastatic thyroid carcinoma carry an overall poor prognostic indicator. However, this negative prognostic indicator has not been substantiated for the primary thyroid lesion. For example, as noted in the present study, only 1 patient had lymph node metastasis. The remaining patients were stage 1 with an excellent prognosis.</p>
<p>When looking at SUV<sub>max</sub> as a potential marker for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions, variability exists in the literature. Cohen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435770">14</xref></sup> reported an average SUV<sub>max</sub> of 6.92 ± 1.54 for malignant lesions and a SUV<sub>max</sub> of 3.37 ± 0.21 for benign lesions with a significant difference between the two. Kang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599811435770">24</xref></sup> also found a significant difference between the average SUV<sub>max</sub> of malignant lesions (16.5 ± 4.7) and benign lesions (6.5 ± 3.8). Other authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599811435770">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599811435770">26</xref></sup> have found no significant difference between the average malignant SUV<sub>max</sub> (3.4 ± 2.6) and benign SUV<sub>max</sub> (2.9 ± 1.6). On the other hand, 3 different studies have reported that focal SUV cutoff values ranging from 3.5 to 5 are effective differentiators of benign from malignant nodules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435770">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811435770">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811435770">18</xref></sup> Although these cutoffs were arrived at by different study designs, they are consistent in the sense of being fairly close to each other, and our cutoff of 4.2 for focal SUV value falls almost in the middle of the range. Thus, it appears that several studies, including ours, are converging on what may someday become a well-established and effective rule for detecting malignant thyroids from incidental findings on PET scans.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography has not only established itself as a staging tool but is also being integrated as a tool to monitor response to therapy in multiple disease processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599811435770">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599811435770">28</xref></sup> Intuitively, serial SUV measurements should respond to treatment as glucose transport and turnover decrease when tumors regress with treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599811435770">29</xref></sup> A number of patients, therefore, undergo multiple FDG-PET scans to predict and monitor tumor response to therapy. Our patient population included a significant number of patients with multiple myeloma (57/106) who had undergone serial FDG-PET/CT for treatment monitoring.</p>
<p>When the slopes of those patients with multiple PET scans (2 or greater) within 2 years prior to pathologic diagnosis were compared, no significant correlation existed between benign and malignant lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435770"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). As the widespread and extended application of FDG-PET continues to evolve, more patients will present for evaluation with serial SUV data. Based on our analysis, SUV remains relatively stable over time, and its changes in thyroid nodules provide no predictive value regarding final tumor pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study investigating the changes of SUV over time for thyroid nodules. More research, however, will need to be undertaken in this area as the current study is limited by a small sample size (n = 42). In addition, the data are somewhat skewed by a limited number of malignant lesions with serial measurements, as these patients typically undergo surgical intervention within 6 months of diagnosis.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if focal SUV lesions found incidentally on PET imaging could be characterized into benign or malignant lesions preoperatively and to evaluate the significance of serial SUV measurements with respect to the incidental uptake of these nodules. However, limitations of the study must be taken into account with the final analysis. Our study is retrospective in nature, which resulted in exclusion of a large number of patients with focal PET uptake without a complete workup and definitive diagnosis. Also, a large number of the patients harbored a diagnosis of multiple myeloma as our institution is an international referral center for treatment. As a result, many patients travel from afar who ultimately have follow-up with their local health care providers. In addition, the underlying disease process or level of infirmity of the primary cancer limited some patients’ ability to undergo complete workup of the focal PET uptake. This ultimately reduced our sample size, which could be corrected for by larger prospective studies.</p>
<p>Novel information generated by this study is the finding that the natural history of PET-positive thyroid nodules, whether benign or malignant, is to have a stable SUV over time. This finding implies that SUV velocity cannot be used as a criterion to differentiate benign from malignant thyroid lesions. In addition, we report that an SUV<sub>max</sub> value of 4.2 was the cutoff that most effectively distinguished malignant from benign thyroids in our sample. This value of 4.2 lies in the middle of the range of 3.5 to 5.0 reported by others and suggests that a number of different studies, including ours, are converging on what could someday become a well-established threshold of potential concern for PET-positive thyroid lesions. In addition, indeterminate FNAB results cannot be differentiated by PET SUV.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>All nodules with focal uptake on FDG-PET/CT should be considered at higher risk of malignancy than those discovered incidentally by other imaging modalities. Higher SUV<sub>max</sub> values are more indicative of malignant lesions but cannot be used as a sole determinate of pathology. All lesions should be investigated with ultrasonography ± FNA if no clinical contraindications exist. An SUV exceeding 4.2 may be more suggestive of malignancy. Standardized uptake values do not appear to have a discriminating power when confined to a population of indeterminate cytology results. The clinical significance will yet be determined as more data are collected and combined with this and other studies. We have not proposed to change the standard algorithm of surgical decision making from FNA cytology; however, cases where SUVs are low or high might help the surgeon and the patient and surgeon decide on timing and even perhaps extent of thyroid surgery. Avoiding FNA based on a low SUV from PET is a premature conclusion but might develop from further research of this question. Serial SUV measures appear to be stable and do not appear to be predictive of pathology, and size of the primary nodule does not influence SUV<sub>max</sub> uptake.</p>
