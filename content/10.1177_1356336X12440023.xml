<abstract>
<p>Tikunoff, Ward &amp; Lazar (1980) argue that parity or ‘equality of status’ (p.12) is one of the most important ingredients of successful collaboration. During the placement of students on teaching practice (TP), therefore, it can be argued that school and university personnel should be equal partners if the collaboration is to be effective. This paper reports one set of data from a study of Irish physical education teacher education (PETE) students and considers the impact of ineffective school–university partnerships on their professional learning during TP. The study employed a range of qualitative research methods centred on one umbrella case study and five individual case studies. Data were analysed using a systematic grounded theory process and findings indicated a perceived lack of parity between schools and the university. This resulted in PETE students developing in an unsupported and often isolated manner. The implications for career-long professional learning are considered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Effective Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes are defined by a range of key characteristics one of which, it is argued, is the value they place on the strength of school-university partnerships (Darling-Hammond, 2006b:305).</p>
<p>A plethora of international research has identified ways in which school and university personnel should, ideally, work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440023">Brouwer and Korthagen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440023">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440023">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356336X12440023">Graber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356336X12440023">Hynes-Dussel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440023">McCullick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356336X12440023">O'Sullivan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1356336X12440023">Youens and McCarthy, 2007</xref>). It has been argued that effective collaboration between relevant school and university personnel enables ITE programmes to deliver shared, logical programmes of teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440023">Hardy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al., 1996</xref>). In particular, teaching practice (TP) has been identified as a pivotal aspect of collaboration, with the school becoming the key worksite for the school–university partnership. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen (2006</xref>: 407): ‘The school…constitutes the rich environment where prospective teachers (PT) will learn a great deal of their job’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al. (1996</xref>) outline how the placement of student teachers in schools is crucial in teacher preparation and how frequently it is based on convenience rather than on any consideration of what might provide a quality learning experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen (2006</xref>) suggest that:<disp-quote>
<p>The ecology of the school setting - pupils, physical environment, curriculum and community - is a major influence on prospective teachers development and all too frequently this influence is not positive (pp.407-408).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the issue of school–university partnerships in supporting student learning during TP. Drawing on case study research conducted on one physical education teacher education (PETE) programme in Ireland, the paper reports data on the effectiveness of a school–university partnership from the different perspectives of those engaged in it. The paper is organised into five sections:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1356336X12440023">
<title>Theoretical background and research context</title>
<sec id="section200-1356336X12440023">
<title>Professional learning theory</title>
<p>The research is rooted in an understanding of the complexity of learning generally, and PETE student learning in particular. Because the social relationships that student teachers develop in school and university contexts are of pivotal importance to their learning, this study is framed by situative theories that focus on the social nature of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356336X12440023">Barab and Duffy, 2000</xref>: 26). The decision to focus specifically on PETE student professional learning was taken to address the dearth of research in this area in Ireland, and for its potential contribution to the wider student learning literature.</p>
<p>Learning is typified in situative theories as an increase in the capacity to contribute meaningfully to the practices of a specific community. Therefore, learning is construed as collaborative social practice centred in communities of practice and happens through legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) in those communities of practice (CoP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440023">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440023">Lave and Wenger (1991</xref>) assert that for learning to occur on the periphery of the CoP ‘newcomers have broad access to arenas of mature practice’ (p.110). Given this, it would appear helpful to gain an understanding of the ways in which school–university partnerships support co-operating teachers (CTs) to support PETE students (newcomers) to make the learning journey from LPP of the CoP to the core, that is, to full participation in the community of practice. If we view PETE student learning as social practice within ITE, it seems clear that we must interrogate how the school–university partnership itself, in which a PETE student is located, can be described as a community of practice that supports these neophyte learners. Based on situated learning theory, such a community of practice would comprise school principals (SPs), CTs, PETE student peers and university tutors (UTs), and would facilitate PETE student learning through collaborative enterprise on shared issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356336X12440023">Mawer, 1996</xref>). In this way, it is argued that teacher competencies can be developed in schools where PETE students can ‘take advantage of the resources available to them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440023">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>This paper considers the issue of PETE student learning on TP from a range of perspectives within a community of practice (or aspirant community of practice) centred on supporting student learning. Focused on five partnership case studies, the research investigated the ways in which CTs, UTs and SPs attempted to work in partnership as expert teacher educators to support Irish PETE students to learn.</p>

<title>Teachers’ career-long professional development</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356336X12440023">Coolahan (2003</xref>) argues that teacher professional development takes place in three stages referred to as the ‘3 I’s’. The ‘3 I’s’ refer to <bold>I</bold>nitial Teacher Education, <bold>I</bold>nduction and <bold>I</bold>n-service training. In-service training is also referred to as continuing professional development (CPD). More recently, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356336X12440023">Teaching Council of Ireland (2011b</xref>) referred to these phases as the Continuum of Teacher Education, a term also used by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356336X12440023">European Commission (2010</xref>: 4) in its policy document ‘Common European Principles for Teacher Competences and Qualifications’. This study focuses on the first phase – ITE in Ireland – and looks particularly at TP as a key element of ITE.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond (2006b</xref>) examined seven exemplary ITE programmes in the US in a range of contexts: public and private settings, undergraduate and graduate qualifications, and large and small universities. The study found that these seven ITE programmes produced graduates who were extraordinarily well prepared from their first days in the classroom and that, despite superficial differences, the programmes had common features, including the following.<disp-quote>
<p>Strong relationships, common knowledge, and shared beliefs among school and university-based faculty jointly engaged in transforming teaching, schooling and teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond, 2006b</xref>: 305).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440023">Brouwer and Korthagen’s (2005)</xref> findings concur with Darling-Hammond on this and, of specific interest to this research, comment on the quality of clinical experiences (TP) in an ITE programme. In their longitudinal study of 370 student teachers in the Netherlands, they concluded that there are three features of any TP model that are crucial for integrating practice and theory: (a) cyclical programming of college-based and student teaching periods; (b) supporting individual learning processes; and (c) intensive co-operation between teacher educators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440023">Lewin (2004)</xref> adds to this, pointing out that having a ‘constructive supportive and enlightening’ (p.12) TP experience depends on four key factors: ‘How it is organised and supported, the mechanism of fusing theory with practice, visits of university tutors (in the absence of trained mentors) and timing and duration of teaching practice (TP)’ (p.12). Considering each of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440023">Lewin’s (2004)</xref> factors, it could be argued that TP should be located in schools that exhibit best practice and where student teachers are supported by well-trained mentors. It could also be argued that the university maintains constant contact with and support for the student teacher and his/her school mentor, and that TP and university-based sessions are cyclical and are of reasonable length such that theory and practice may be integrated. As Sutherland et al. (2005: 80) point out, in order to develop professional knowledge, PETE students need ‘opportunities to be involved in professional practice, and to reflect on and integrate the knowledge they have gained from their experiences with the theoretical knowledge provided by the institution’. However, a prevailing theme in the literature is the struggle to integrate theory and practice in ITE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440023">Garm and Karlsen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In reality, it seems clear that the characteristics of effective ITE identified above by Darling-Hammond, Brouwer and Korthagen and Lewin are not always evident in ITE programmes. Although TP ought to be at the heart of the ITE experience, Neville et al. (2005b) describe clinical experiences as ‘limited, disconnected from university coursework and inconsistent’ (p.13). One explanation for this might be financial constraints in some countries that limit university funding for mentor selection, training and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356336X12440023">Skilbeck and Connell, 2003</xref>). Another reason could be rooted in poor relationships between schools and universities, with divergent expectations from student teachers and misunderstandings regarding the role of school and university in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440023">McCullick, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Teaching practice as a site for PETE student learning</title>
<p>It can be argued that schools and universities have a <italic>joint</italic> and <italic>interconnected</italic> role in the education of novice teachers in the praxis of teaching. Yet, at times, there appears to be a dichotomous relationship between these two partners, with the school-based experience focusing novice teachers on day-to-day practicalities of working in school classrooms, while UTs endeavour to provide the theoretical basis to underpin and make sense of these school-based activities ( 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356336X12440023">Furlong et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356336X12440023">Spendlove et al. (2010</xref>) suggest that the differing roles of school and university ‘represents a division of labour, which can be characterised as theory on the one hand, and practice on the other’ (p.66). In reality, it has been argued that there is often considerable tension in the relationship between school and universities within TP, with the majority of <italic>joint</italic> training programmes being ‘neither complementary nor collaborative' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440023">Edwards and Mutton, 2007</xref>: 505).</p>
<p>With the more recent understanding of learning shifting to a social, situated and contextual view, the literature on PETE programmes suggests that TP, or clinical experience, is a central aspect of quality PETE programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen, 2006</xref>). In spite of this, TP placement is often based on convenience rather than other considerations, with schools sometimes providing difficult contexts for the PETE student; for example, with poor facilities and untrained mentors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al., 1996</xref>). It is through TP that the PETE student learns the ‘rub between theory and practice’, solidifying teachers’ professional knowledge, encompassed in the generic term pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356336X12440023">Amade-Escot, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440023">McCullick (2001</xref>) emphasises the importance of ensuring that teacher educators, CTs and UTs share a clear understanding of the curriculum of ITE and their role in promoting this on TP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440023">Kinchin (2009</xref>) describes how student teachers view UTs as ‘Guide, mentor, advisor…mentors more than lecturers’ (p.4). However, there is a sustained view that of all teacher educators, the CT (mentor) has the most significant influence on PETE students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356336X12440023">Coleman and Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440023">Kinchin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440023">McCullick, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, the process of TP and indeed ITE needs to be based on a lucid understanding of how pupils learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356336X12440023">O'Sullivan, 2003</xref>). This is an area, however, in which there is a gap in the existing literature. In addition, there appears to be a continued lack of consensus regarding the length of the TP experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356336X12440023">O'Sullivan, 2003</xref>), with researchers reporting that it is the quality of the experience that is important and not the quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al., 1996</xref>). While the length of PETE TP varies across programmes, the elements typically inherent in the TP experience comprise the initial opportunity for the PETE student to observe expert teachers teaching, followed by teaching parts of lessons, which progresses to the teaching of full lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen, 2006</xref>). The CT (mentor) is a constant presence during TP, supporting the preparation, delivery of and reflection on lessons. The reflective element of TP is still widely considered to be a pivotal aspect that prepares PETE students for the unknown in their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1356336X12440023">Tsangaridou and Siedentop, 1995</xref>). In a recent policy document on the future of teacher education in Ireland, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1356336X12440023">Teaching Council of Ireland (2011b</xref>) recognised the most recent research on best practice in ITE, listing the following as key processes in ITE: teaching learning and assessment models, engagement of students with the programme, tutors, teachers and peers, personal and social development, attitudes and values and professional dispositions, life-long learning and reflective processes (pp.22-23). The next section outlines a detailed account of the current milieu in TP in Ireland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356336X12440023">
<title>The context for the research</title>
<p>ITE in Ireland takes place within university and school settings employing two models of ITE: concurrent and consecutive. In the consecutive model, the student attains a Bachelor’s degree in chosen subjects over a three- or four-year term and completes a further one- or two-year post-graduate teacher education qualification. Within the concurrent model, the student teacher completes a four-year Bachelor’s degree programme where university tuition and school-based TP (clinical practice) are combined. All disciplines, with the exception of PE, Materials Technology (Wood), Metalwork, Home Economics and Science use a consecutive model. PETE students typically engage in a concurrent four-year degree programme using a ‘block TP model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356336X12440023">Coolahan, 2003</xref>), where students are placed in schools for blocks of time that accumulate over the period of the degree. A typical pattern of TP through a four-year programme might include individual practice in years one and four, with dyads of students working together in a school in year two. Universities retain control over students during their in-school experiences; for example, in placement, guidance, supervision and assessment. Schools are requested by the university to co-operate with the TP process on a voluntary basis. The drawbacks of this system are twofold: teachers (known as CTs) are not trained as mentors in schools and the school mentor or School Principal has no official role in student assessment. It is argued, therefore, that wide variations exist within school cultures and in the support and advice offered by schools to student teachers on TP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440023">Coady, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440023">McWilliams et al., 2006</xref>: 73).</p>
<p>ITE in Ireland is tentatively embracing the notion of formalised mentoring through (a) the University College Cork Telemachus Mentor Training Programme for PE teachers and (b) The Lucent Science Teacher's Initiative and (c) The University of Limerick Masters of Arts in Educational Mentoring and (d) the Dublin City University Cooperating PE Teachers programme. Mentoring at the Induction Phase of teacher learning is also being advocated at both national policy and practice level through the National Induction Programme (NIP). This programme is supported by the Teacher Education Section in the Department of Education and Skills (DES), the Association for Secondary School Teachers of Ireland (ASTI), the Teachers Union of Ireland (TUI), the Education Centres and the partner schools. The NIP is facilitated by trained mentors who support newly qualified teachers in their first years in the profession. To date, however, the Irish Government has not made a strong commitment to mentoring in ITE by developing a formal, nationwide policy. The Government’s position is perhaps influenced by the teacher unions, who have vetoed the introduction of formal mentoring in ITE. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report ‘Improving School Leadership’ (2007), teachers in Ireland are highly unionised, with 91% of post-primary<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356336X12440023">1</xref>
</sup> teachers belonging to a teacher union (p.16). The report describes how teacher unions since their inception have been highly influential in Irish education, as they have both negotiated on behalf of their members in relation to pay and conditions and have been pivotal in discussions regarding curriculum development and examinations and the new Teaching Council.</p>
<p>The teaching unions have argued consistently that if teachers are to become formalised as mentors, they should be offered additional remuneration or ‘time in lieu’ for their mentoring duties. As a result, a rather ad hoc situation remains, where the choice of whether to engage and train as a mentor is left largely to the individual teacher. The decision is also dependent on gaining permission from an individual School Principal, because teachers must be given time in their schools to mentor students and released from teaching duties to engage in mentor training, for example, in the Telemachus Mentor Training programme. The ad hoc mentor system described has resulted in a dual system in Ireland, with formal and informal mentoring operating side by side in ITE. The majority of ITE programmes subscribe to informal mentoring, where CTs support student teacher learning during TP, but are untrained and unpaid to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440023">McWilliams et al., 2006</xref>). It was anticipated that investigating student learning in this context could shed light on broader issues of student learning in school-based settings.</p>
<p>Working collaboratively with UTs at a University in Ireland, the research reported in this paper focused on PETE students’ professional learning on TP and on the ways in which the processes of TP guidance and supervision both constrained and enabled student learning. The timing of the research coincided with the introduction of a new one-year post-graduate programme at this University. This new structure presented an ideal opportunity to research Irish PETE students’ learning-in-action during a cyclical TP placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440023">Brouwer and Korthagen, 2005</xref>), which spanned seven months in one allocated school (three-week observation, one day per week for ten weeks and seven full weeks). The five PETE students at the centre of the research were graduates of another university (Brightwater), having studied for five years to obtain a primary degree in the area of Leisure. This was not a teaching certification degree, so the students entered the one-year post-graduate programme at this University to gain a PE teaching qualification. The research was designed to allow the views of each member of the learning partnership to be voiced independently, thus offering a unique multi-layered perspective on critical learning incidents. A detailed account of the methodology now follows.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>This study reported in this paper analysed <italic>one</italic> umbrella case (university and PETE students and the schools) encompassing five individual cases. The case studies were identified when the researcher was invited to attend the induction day of the teacher education programme and all seventeen students (fifteen females and two males) on the programme were offered an opportunity to participate in the research. Five female PETE students volunteered to take part in this study: Aoife, Barbara, Carol, Dara and Edel. The UT, CT and SP assigned to each PETE student on TP then became part of each case study, resulting in five individual case studies each comprising a tetrad of individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356336X12440023">Table 1</xref>). Within this framework, the phenomenon of how these PETE students experienced learning support from CTs, UTs and SPs during TP was studied over a seven-month period comprising a three-week observation period, one day per week for ten weeks and seven full weeks at one allocated school. Pseudonyms were used to protect the identity of the participants. The researcher would like to acknowledge that it was fortunate that this University was willing to be engaged in the research and to seek to learn from it.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the data were rich, a variety of data collection methods and approaches was used. The process of triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356336X12440023">Begley, 1996</xref>) allows the researcher ‘to determine how various actors in the situation view it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356336X12440023">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>: 44). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356336X12440023">Richardson (2000</xref>) extended this notion using the image of crystallisation. The specific approaches used in this study to engage in crystallisation within the case study framework comprised:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>one open profile questionnaire issued to each of the PETE students and each of the five CTs;</p>

<p>focus groups (one comprising all five PETE students and one consisting of three UTs);</p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>in-depth interviews (PETE students and CTs were interviewed on three occasions with each interview lasting one hour; one UT was interviewed; each of the five SPs were interviewed for one hour); and</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data analysis method adopted was that advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356336X12440023">Strauss and Corbin (1998</xref>), that is, grounded theory (GT), a method that spearheaded the ‘qualitative revolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356336X12440023">Charmaz, 2000</xref>: 509). GT is an inductive process of discovering theory from data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356336X12440023">Pidgeon and Henwood, 2004</xref>), meaning that the qualitative researcher has ‘grounded their theory in data and validated their statements of relationship between concepts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1356336X12440023">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>: 5). This process ensures that the researcher is confident about the conclusions he/she has reached and is convinced that they will withstand criticism from the target audience.</p>
<p>GT consists of a process of ‘constant comparison’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440023">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>). There are three clear stages in this process, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1356336X12440023">Strauss and Corbin (1990</xref>): open coding, axial coding and selective coding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440023">Harry et al. (2005</xref>) extended this framework to a detailed six-level approach. The data analysis in this study used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440023">Harry et al.’s (2005)</xref> six stages as follows.</p>
<sec id="section9-1356336X12440023">
<title>Level one and level two: derivation of open codes and conceptual categories (open and axial coding)</title>
<p>This involved the researcher labelling the concepts in each paragraph of data, by asking ‘what categories, concepts or labels do I need in order to account for what is of importance to me in this paragraph’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356336X12440023">Pidgeon and Henwood, 2004</xref>: 637). To do this a ‘table' for each source of data collected was created. A memo was written about each piece of data and then these fragments of data were colour-coded according to specific categories. An example of this process is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356336X12440023">Table 2</xref>, indicating the process of conceptualising the data in one focus group. As was noted above, having identified key codes and related memos for one of the case studies using a Microsoft Word Package, the researcher then utilised the data analysis software package ATLAS.ti to analyse all five case studies. This was done to ensure that the coding and memo-writing stages were rigorous and robust and to begin to abstract meaning from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356336X12440023">Pidgeon and Henwood, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1356336X12440023">
<title>Level three: developing themes (selective coding)</title>
<p>In this step, themes are formed by relating clusters of data to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356336X12440023">Pidgeon and Henwood, 2004</xref>). The researcher began to determine which categories were dominant in the data. This was done by viewing the data categories and determining which category encompassed the most data from the perspectives of all participants. As a result of this process, a theme was developed entitled <italic>school–university support for mentee learning</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1356336X12440023">
<title>Level four: testing the themes</title>
<p>In this phase, theory was inducted through interpretation of data. In order to ensure that presentation of data were transparent, the researcher used memberchecking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356336X12440023">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>) through crystallisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356336X12440023">Richardson, 2000</xref>), that is, looking at the data from the viewpoint of a number of participants. This was done by interrogating what each participant had said about the theme identified. The process led to a succinct group of themes and sub-themes in relation to ‘the school–university relationship’:</p>
<p>
<underline>Theme 1</underline>: parity in the UT–CT relationship;</p>
<p>
<underline>Theme 2</underline>: parity in the school and university relationship:</p>
<p>
<underline>Sub-theme 2a</underline>: SPs believed that the school is the primary site for PETE student learning;</p>
<p>
<underline>Sub-theme 2b</underline>: universities appeared not to value the school contribution to TP;</p>
<p>
<underline>Sub-theme 2c</underline>: the perception that the university appeared not to acknowledge or value the role   of the SP in TP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1356336X12440023">
<title>Level five: interrelating the explanations</title>
<p>Because the themes were grounded in extensive crystallised data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356336X12440023">Richardson, 2000</xref>), the themes became explanations of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440023">Harry et al., 2005</xref>). In drawing final conclusions, the researcher discovered that, ultimately, one key factor appeared to have a strong impact on PETE students’ professional learning during TP: the school–university relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356336X12440023">
<title>Level six: delineating the theory</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440023">Glaser and Strauss (1967</xref>) determined that there are two types of theory: formal and substantive. Formal theory is that which can pertain to a wide range of topics. Substantive theory implies that the theory only applies to the situation being studied. In this case, ‘parity of esteem within the school–university partnership’ is considered to be substantive theory.</p>
<p>All data gathered, that is, open profile questionnaires, recording key events through participant observation, focus groups, collection of artefacts, in-depth interviews and reflective journal writing, were analysed using this six-level process. In the next section, data will be reported and discussed under two themes and three sub-themes, which include crystallised data from interview questionnaires and focus groups.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Limitations of the study fall under three key headings:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>generalisability;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>reliability and validity;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>researcher objectivity.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section15-1356336X12440023">
<title>Generalisability</title>
<p>In the post-graduate programme, there were 17 PETE students: 15 females and 2 males. When the researcher made a presentation to students about the proposed research in August 2006, five female PETE students volunteered to take part in this study. Given the ratio of females to males, and the fact that a representative sample (in a qualitative sense) was not being sought, this sample of five female PETE students was deemed to be acceptable. It might have enhanced this study, however, to include the views of at least one male PETE student.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356336X12440023">Merriam (1998</xref>) questioned the generalisability of outcomes from a single case to a larger population. It is acknowledged in this study that small qualitative studies are not generalisable in the more accepted sense; however, it is also argued that studies such as this have laudable qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440023">Myers, 2000</xref>). In this study of Irish PETE students, the generalisability of the research does not emanate from how representative the sample might be, but from the way in which the experiences are likely to be appropriate to other groups in related contexts. It can be argued that the strength of the qualitative approach employed in this study is the depth of exploration and description, which produces a vivid and detailed understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the situation under investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1356336X12440023">
<title>Reliability and validity</title>
<p>It has been argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440023">Kirk and Miller (1986</xref>) that reliability in research is attained in two ways:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>the study is reported in a detailed and accessible manner so that it may be replicated;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the results of the study are reported in a transparent way in terms of theoretically meaningful variables.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The researchers have addressed each of these demands in reporting this study.</p>
<p>In order to ensure reliability, the research procedure for this study has been documented in a detailed and clear manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440023">Minichiello et al., 1995</xref>). In theory, the research could be replicated, although there are clear challenges in seeking precise replication in studies of this nature. In addition, in order to ensure rigour in this research, there was an imperative to work with the reality of each case as it presented itself and thus to use data collection methods that suited the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1356336X12440023">Yin, 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1356336X12440023">
<title>Researcher positioning</title>
<p>In this study, one of the researchers had the status of both insider and outsider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440023">Minichiello et al., 1995</xref>: 182) because she:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>had been a PETE student;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>was supervised by untrained mentors/CTs during TP;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>had acted as an untrained mentor/CT to PETE students for 11 years;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>had acted as an untrained UT assessing PETE students on TP.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In all of these roles, the impact of lack of training of key personnel to support PETE student learning on TP concerned the researcher, FCC, who decided to investigate this issue. Taking account of the researcher’s knowledge of the context and her familiarity with the language of TP, it was difficult for the researcher to remain ‘objective’ in a traditional sense during the study. Therefore, in order to mediate for bias in the study, (a) the researcher engaged in reflexivity or ‘explicit, self-aware analysis of their own [researcher] role’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356336X12440023">Finlay, 2002</xref>: 531) and (b) the second author acted as a critical friend throughout ensuring that, for example, data analysis was systematic and transparent.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1356336X12440023">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>A number of mechanisms were used to satisfy procedural ethics. Firstly, ethical approval for the study was sought from Loughborough University in the UK. This involved providing a detailed report outlining all research instruments and consent forms to be used. This report was ratified by the Research Ethics Committee at the University in July 2006. Secondly, with regard to selection of participants, there were two key issues to consider.</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>In qualitative studies the participants are selected purposefully because they will be particularly informative about the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356336X12440023">Cresswell, 2002</xref>). In this study, all 17 PETE students in the post-graduate programme were offered the opportunity to take part in this study and five of these volunteered.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To obtain ethical and informed consent from the participants, the researcher must describe the research purpose and procedures, report foreseeable risks and expected benefits, offer to answer questions regarding the procedures, and explain clearly that participation is voluntary and that participants have the right to discontinue at any time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356336X12440023">Anderson and Arsenault, 2000</xref>). This protocol was followed with all participants in this study.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The ‘ethics in practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356336X12440023">Guillemin and Gillam, 2004</xref>: 261) element of this study had a number of implications. For example, the researcher discovered that the ethical process was indeed anything other than a fait accompli, but rather was a continuing process of negotiation with the participants, which became increasingly complex. To illustrate this point, four particular instances are outlined.</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Four out of five of the PETE students began to view the researcher as a facilitator in the TP process, a person to whom they could express their grievances and worries. This allowed the researcher to excavate deep into the data generated by these PETE students and understand their TP experience in a more situated manner. However, it was very important that the researcher maintained confidentiality on more sensitive issues and only reported data that PETE students were happy to disclose.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All the participants asked the researcher for advice on PCK during TP. This further reinforced data suggested that PETE students were unsupported in their learning on TP and that they foraged for PCK from any source available. At times the researcher had to take up the role of mentor instead of researcher. This dual role was difficult to maintain at times. It did show, however, that the researcher had built up trust with the PETE students and thus all interviews were open and transparent. It also indicated that the PETE students respected the researcher and regarded her as an expert in PE PCK in light of her work as a PE teacher and UT, although not this course.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>SPs used the interview as an opportunity to make political points by highlighting complaints about the exclusion of schools from meaningful involvement in the TP process. The researcher had to ensure to check with the SPs that all of the data collected could be reported in this study. One SP asked that the Dictaphone was switched off during part of the interview and spoke ‘off the record’. The researcher did not report this data.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When presenting the interim findings to the participant tutors and other interested parties, one of the participants described how shocked she was at the results reported, feeling that despite her best efforts, her role as a TP coordinator had not been as effective as she had hoped. This was clearly a sensitive issue for both the tutor and the researcher. Nonetheless, the tutors were keen to learn from student perceptions of the TP learning process.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section20-1356336X12440023">
<title>Theme 1: parity in the UT–CT relationship?</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1356336X12440023">Tikunoff et al. (1980)</xref> cite parity as one of the most important ingredients of successful collaboration. A dictionary definition describes parity as ‘equality, as in amount, status or quantity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1356336X12440023">Dictionary.com, 2007</xref>). In this study, parity refers to ‘equality of status’ in relation to TP supervision, thus parity implies that during TP, school and university personnel would be regarded as equal partners in supporting student learning. This does not mean, however, that all members of the project need to have equal abilities. Indeed, an advantage of collaboration is the opportunity to capitalise on a range of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440023">Kiely, 2005</xref>). Data on the assessment of PETE student learning on TP highlight issues of concern about parity.</p>
<p>As was noted earlier, in Ireland, the UT is the only assessor of PETE student learning on TP. This is because, following teacher union directives on the matter, CTs will not assess or grade student teachers assigned to their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440023">Kiely, 2005</xref>). The UT and CT sometimes have a post-lesson conference about PETE student progress, but TP grading is ultimately determined by the UT. One UT in particular, Noelle, felt that the current TP grading process was unjust and unilateral, with the UT placed in an omnipotent role with the CT regarded as largely passive in the process:<disp-quote>
<p>We [UT and CT] can have these conversations without prejudice to a grade, you know. But in reality, you know it’s not an even playing pitch. And I will make the call at the end of the day (UT, Noelle, Tutor Focus Group, 17 January 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Given this structural issue, it was immediately apparent that there was a fundamental lack of parity between the UT and CT in relation to PETE student assessment. This situation gave rise to a number of hostile encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356336X12440023">Trubowitz, 1986</xref>) between CTs and UTs. In these instances, CTs defended PETE student performance during the post-lesson conference in an effort, perhaps, to have an influence on the tutor’s assessment of PETE student learning:</p>
<sec id="section21-1356336X12440023">
<title>Example one: case study – Dara</title>
<p>In this example, Liz (UT) came to observe Dara’s (PETE student) class. Liz (UT) felt from the outset that Anita (CT) and Dara (PETE student) had a defensive attitude to her presence in the school. It was clear to Liz (UT) that they had primed the pupils to behave prior to the lesson.<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I thought that they had been told that beforehand. By God, and everybody including the Principal had told them that there are people coming to watch and you have to be good and they had all white t-shirts on and they were all good (UT, Liz, Interview Tutor, 4 December 2006).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>After this particular class, Liz (UT) was unhappy with Dara’s (PETE student) performance, and thought that Dara was more interested in the pupils having fun than learning anything specific. After a very one-sided conversation, Anita (CT) was invited to give her feedback on Dara’s performance. Liz (UT)was astonished that Anita (CT) thought the lesson ‘was great’ and had ‘nothing negative’ to say about Dara’s lesson and was not ‘interrogating the purpose of Dara’s aims’ in the lesson plan, in order to support her learning (UT, Liz, Interview Tutor, 4 December 2006). Liz (UT) did not challenge what the CT or the PETE student said in these post-lesson discussions as she was ‘used to saying well ok; I’ll leave you there because people [PETE students and CTs] get aggressive’ (UT, Liz, Interview Tutor, 4 December 2006). Liz (UT) was unphased by Anita’s (CT) defensive response, as she had found this type of reaction from CTs to be the norm in post-lesson debriefings. Liz (UT) was used ‘to backing down’ (UT, Liz, Interview Tutor, 4 December 2006). Clearly, in this example the UT was seen as a kind of adversary, in the face of which the CT needed to defend the PETE student’s position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1356336X12440023">
<title>Example two: case study – Barbara</title>
<p>Directly after a lesson had been observed, Barbara commented that she felt that the ‘lesson didn’t go too great, like, but…it wasn’t too bad’ (PETE student, Barbara, Focus Group Interview, 29 March 2007). Claire (UT) met with Laura (CT) and Barbara after the class and interrogated Laura after the lesson to establish if the lesson was of Barbara’s normal standard:<disp-quote>
<p>Like, she grilled Laura, because the class were really well behaved and she wanted to know how I dealt with behaviour problems (PETE student Focus Group Interview, 29 March 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sensing that Claire was unsure of Barbara’s performance, Laura vehemently defended Barbara’s teaching:<disp-quote>
<p>Laura just goes, well, to be honest, I would be disgusted and…and very upset if Barbara doesn’t get a really good mark, here. (PETE student, Barbara, Focus Group Interview, 29 March 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because Laura had shielded her from Claire’s comments, Barbara thought that her CTs were ‘brilliant…like, do you know? They wouldn’t put you down though. So, like, they were brilliant…like, do you know’ (PETE student, Barbara, Focus Group Interview, 29 March 2007). It appeared as if the PETE student and CT were on one side and the UT was on the other.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in spite of this interaction, Claire (UT) was trying to foster a strong, equal working relationship with CTs:<disp-quote>
<p>So, in terms of the co-operating teachers, building up a sense of trust with them that, we are actually all in this together and level the playing field (UT, Claire, Tutor Focus Group, January 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Claire’s (UT) opinion, CT–UT partnership in assessment was the only viable option, because the current unilateral mechanism was ‘neither credible nor robust’ (UT, Claire, Tutor Focus Group, 17 January 2007).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1356336X12440023">
<title>Example three: case study – Aoife</title>
<p>Louise (CT) stayed for half of the lesson and met Noelle (UT) afterwards. She noted that the critique was ‘never shown to her’ (CT, Louise, Interview 3, 13 February 2007). Louise (CT) felt excluded from the assessment process. Interestingly, Noelle (UT) stated that she would value the involvement of the CT in grading the PETE student’s TP performance. She explained that this was because CTs saw the PETE student teaching every day and could, therefore, give a full picture of PETE student progress on TP as:<disp-quote>
<p>I can never know how entirely honest they (PETE students) are being. I mean I get to see essentially, you know, a snapshot of the day or the two days that I go and what I see in the…the folder (UT, Noelle, Tutor Focus Group, 17 January 2007).</p>

<p>John (CT) found it frustrating that in his experience, the UT never had time to talk to him or the PETE student and was always rushing to the next visit: <italic>“like the inspector [university tutor] comes here…saying, I have to be in Riverdale”</italic> (CT, John, Interview 3, February 12<sup>th</sup> 2007). He had been asked: <disp-quote>
<p>Well, how is she getting on? That was the question. You know, the answer, the stock answer was ‘very well’, you know what I mean? But, nothing, like, as detailed as to actually, sit down and talk one on one (CT, John, Interview 3, February 12<sup>th</sup> 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When asked whether he would like to be involved in the critique of the PETE student learning John replied firmly: <italic>“I think I should be, yes”</italic> (CT, John, Interview 3, February 12<sup>th</sup> 2007).</p>
<p>To summarise, there is much evidence of open hostility between the CTs and UTs in this study, which was witnessed by the PETE students. Having experienced this hostility, Claire (UT) explained that perhaps CTs modelled the way in which they had been mentored on TP and the hostility they, too, had witnessed:<disp-quote>
<p>Looked back at how…how it was done with them [CTs]. And so, if you like, they are trying to model that behaviour (UT, Claire, Tutor Focus Group, January, 17<sup>th</sup> 2007). </p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The school princpals (SP) and deputy principals (DP) also had views.</p>
<p>Mr. Cotter (SP) had some comments to make about the range of tutors coming into the school to assess PETE student learning. He noted that the: <disp-quote>
<p>Range and the diversity was just enormous [and he recommended that] tutors need a hell of a lot of training, and opportunities for reflection. And also learning how to give feedback, because giving feedback is an extremely difficult thing to do (SP, Mr. Cotter, Interview Principal, February 12<sup>th</sup> 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. Cotter added that a Tutor needed to be <italic>“a very well developed person”</italic> (SP, Mr. Cotter, Interview Principal, February 12<sup>th</sup> 2007). Mr. O’Brien (Deputy Principal) outlined how some of the more junior UTs have little expertise: <italic>“I often think that they talk the talk, but I think the lack of walk the walk is worrying”</italic> (DP, Mr. O’Brien, Interview Deputy Principal, February 16<sup>th</sup> 2007). Mr. O’Brien said that this behaviour from inexperienced UTs was very different to the calibre of senior tutors from the University:<disp-quote>
<p>The senior people that we have known from my time in the University, they would always spend a lot of time talking to us about what was going on in the school (DP, Mr. O’Brien, Interview Deputy Principal, February 16<sup>th</sup> 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr. Clancy (SP) corroborated this describing senior Tutors from the University as being: <disp-quote>
<p>Top class and generally speaking very good, very approachable, very positive about the school and its support, and love to get a feel for the person that they are…they are monitoring” (SP, Mr. Clancy, Interview 3, February 16<sup>th</sup> 2007).</p>

<title>Theme 2: parity in the school and university relationship?</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356336X12440023">Graham (1988</xref>), when collaboration occurs, the barriers between the university and the school often become less formidable with communication levels increasing.<disp-quote>
<p>Aloofness or a feeling of superiority is a facade that is easy to maintain at a distance, but when people work together successfully, facades disappear. And that is a positive, potential benefit of collaboration (p.168).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As was noted earlier, eventually, in effective collaboration, parties come to value each other’s contribution, which can lead to parity of esteem between the school and university. However, the journey towards such parity is precarious, often infused with suspicion and lack of mutual respect. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356336X12440023">Trubowitz (1986</xref>), when a school and university collaborate, there are eight key stages that must be traversed: (1) hostility and aggression; (2) lack of trust; (3) period of truce; (4) mixed approval; (5) acceptance; (6) regression; (7) renewal; and (8) continuing progress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1356336X12440023">Trubowitz (1986</xref>) argued that in some cases, the school and university fail to progress past the first two stages and certainly in this research there is evidence that all five schools remained in the first two stages of collaboration. There were a number of reasons for this and these are reported under three sub-themes.</p>
<sec id="section26-1356336X12440023">
<title>Sub-theme 2a: school principals believed that school is the primary site for PETE student learning</title>
<p>Similar to the research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen (2006</xref>), three SPs in this study believed that the school should be the primary site for PETE student learning, and indeed was the superior learning site. Mr Clancy viewed the school as central to ITE. Overall, he expressed how the school played a ‘pivotal role in the education of the next generation of teachers’ (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). After all, Mr Clancy said:<disp-quote>
<p>Somebody has to provide for students and you know they need the experience, they need the facility of doing it (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mr Cotter commented that he liked the ‘notion of the school playing its part in professional development or in the formation of the teachers of the future’ (SP, Mr Cotter, Interview Principal, 12 February2007). Mr Noonan (SP) asserted that school was the primary ITE site of student learning not the university:<disp-quote>
<p>As, you learn more in what you do in the school, I am afraid, than you do in lectures and they [student teachers] are not getting enough time in school. You have a big function to play in terms of mentoring new teachers. You are trying to create, I suppose a body of teachers for the future, and for your own context as well (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1356336X12440023">
<title>Sub-theme 2b: universities appeared not to value the school contribution to TP</title>
<p>There was also a feeling, expressed by SPs, that universities did not value the school contribution to TP and might be ‘exploiting’ schools. For example, Mr Noonan (SP) asserted that the system was weighted in favour of the university, and that the school was ‘quite peripheral to the whole affair’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). As an example of this, Mr Noonan (SP) described how the university controlled the placement of PETE students without consulting his school. In fact, Mr Noonan contended that PETE students were assigned to schools on the basis of availability rather than suitability and that there was ‘certain desperation…in getting people into places whether they fit or don’t fit’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). Mr Clancy (SP) concurred and described the university’s mechanism for placing PETE students in school as ‘a little bit ad hoc…trial and error’ (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007).</p>
<p>This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al.’s (1996)</xref> study, which asserted that TP placement was often based on convenience. This led to the situation which, as Mr Clancy (SP) reported, meant that the university simply assumed the school would take a large number of PETE students. He felt the school could not refuse such requests and said, ‘we are a soft touch’ (SP, Mr Kelly, Interview Principal, 13 February 2007) because a number of these institutions are training former pupils from Towerhill and ‘your hand is half twisted, I think, you know’ (SP, Mr Kelly, Interview Principal, 13 February 2007). Mr Kelly appeared to feel frustrated at being in this position:</p>
<p>“I think we are going to have to do something about it, because I can’t facilitate seven different groups coming in all the time. It wouldn’t be good for the school even though the staff here are very good I think at helping the students [teachers] (SP, Mr Kelly, Interview Principal, 13 February 2007)” Mr Clancy (SP) felt somewhat aggrieved, feeling that the support given by schools for PETE student learning ‘was not to be assumed’ (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview, 16 February 2007). Similarly, Mr Noonan (SP) asserted, ‘The university needs to get real in terms of who is serving who’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007).</p>
<p>In general, there was a feeling that the current situation was untenable.<disp-quote>
<p>Well…well I…I actually…you see, I suppose, none of us like to be taken for granted, either as individuals or institutions. And there is a question of money for value and value for money. And if…if there was some remuneration it would also, perhaps, enable much more …how would I say…a much more formal and worked out contract (SP, Mr Cotter, Interview Principal, 12 February 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In essence, Mr. Cotter wanted an understanding between the university and the school where there was “<italic>a bit of give and take</italic>” (SP, Mr. Cotter, Interview Principal, February 12th 2007).</p>
<p>Mr Clancy (SP) advocated a different partnership between school and university on TP. He described a ‘programme of support, mutual support up to and including financial support’ between school and university (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview, 16 February 2007). Similarly, Mr Cotter (SP) advocated that universities should remunerate schools to co-ordinate and mentor PETE students instead of the current arrangement, about which he felt increasingly unhappy; as he commented: ‘money was a way of indicating that you value something’ (SP, Mr Cotter, Interview Principal, 12 February 2007). Fundamentally, Mr. Cotter (SP) wanted an arrangement between the university and the school where there was acknowledgement of the “<italic>huge amount of work [that] isn't acknowledged</italic>” (SP, Mr. Cotter, Interview Principal, February 12th 2007).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1356336X12440023">
<title>Sub-theme 2c: the perception that the University appeared not to acknowledge or value the role of the school principal in TP</title>
<p>Further to the above concerns, there were also issues regarding the way in which universities valued the views of SPs. Certainly, one SP, Mr Noonan, felt that the university largely ignored SPs. With regard to assessment of TP, Mr Noonan stated that there was no mechanism in place for SP feedback: ‘the (university) tutor was certainly not querying the Principal you know… no proper structure where the Principal really has an opportunity to evaluate them’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). With regard to PETE student assessment, Mr Clancy advocated SP involvement saying: ‘he would feel well entitled to comment on her [Dara’s] progress’. He continued: ‘You know, I certainly feel that my comments, in so far as I would be able to offer them, should have weighting’ (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). When he spoke of the relationship between the school and the University, Mr Cotter reported that the school felt undervalued in the process:<disp-quote>
<p>That actually we…we have accommodated a huge number of students from the University over the years and there is a lot of work in it for the principal. Because first of all, you know, you have to deal with the university placement office, then you have to meet the student and find out the subjects, etc., etc. And then you have to go and meet the teachers, and you have to negotiate with them try to identify the classes that would be least problematic and co-ordinate all of that. So there is actually a huge amount of work. It isn’t acknowledged. It is just expected, it is. And I do think that there should be some acknowledgement of the work that the Principal puts in (SP, Mr Cotter, Interview Principal, 12 February 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>Mr Noonan saw the SPs as having a central role in ITE and said ‘It’s as much important as looking after the kids in a lot of ways’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). Within ITE, the school provided the PETE student with a realistic view of both schooling and teaching. The SP was often very well placed to give an insight into the running of a school, through university-based lectures and TP tutorials, but this resource was currently not being used by the university:<disp-quote>
<p>But, I wonder in teacher education, is there any involvement of Principals at all, or administrators of schools, do they have any inputs? (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One UT, Noelle, acknowledged that the university was currently ignoring the potentially powerful role of the SP in TP and believed that the voice of the SP must be included in the assessment process in addition to the CT and UT:<disp-quote>
<p>I just wonder if we should be doing more work…well we talk about co-operating teachers all the time. But is the principal the actual…the gatekeeper for that? (UT, Noelle, Tutor Focus Group, 17 January 2007).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PETE students in this study appeared to feel that they were lacking support from school and university-based teacher educators during their TP experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1356336X12440023">Zeichner and Tabachnik (1981</xref>) argued that the impact of university-based teacher education was often ‘washed out’ by school experiences and the absence of learning support evidenced in this study helps to explain why. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1356336X12440023">Veenman (1984</xref>) coined the term ‘reality shock’ to represent the ways in which PETE students on TP rapidly forgot university-based preparation when surviving the reality of the classroom. Research of this nature resulted in a review of North-American research on teacher education by the American Educational Research Association (AERA) Panel on Research and Teacher Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356336X12440023">Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005</xref>), who contended there was no convincing evidence that teacher education really makes a difference. This is a view shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356336X12440023">Neville et al. (2005a)</xref>, who described clinical experiences in education as ‘limited, disconnected from university coursework, and inconsistent’ (p.13). Such findings may be partly explained by the quality of the school–university partnership in ITE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440023">Callahan and Martin (2007</xref>), since the 1980s there has been an increasing emphasis on school–university partnerships as a stronghold of teacher education programmes. The etymology of the term <italic>partnership</italic>, in the commercial sense, was first mooted circa 1700, pointing to a shared ownership of an entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356336X12440023">Wordnet, 2008</xref>). Today, the term ‘partnership’ has grown to encompass other meanings, one of which describes it as a:<disp-quote>
<p>Cooperative relationship between people or groups who agree to share responsibility for achieving some specific goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1356336X12440023">Wordnet, 2008</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is this definition that, in theory, underpins the notion of school–university partnerships, although as the evidence from this research illustrates, the reality for students can be variable, perhaps because of the nature of these partnerships.</p>
<p>Partnerships in education can be defined in a range of ways; for example, in terms of their interaction preferences or their goals (Day, 1998; Teitel, 1999). With regard to ‘interaction preferences’, Day identifies three types of interaction: ideology (the search for like minds); generativity (the search to produce new knowledge); or capacity building (the search to create change through sustained interaction). Alternatively, Teitel suggests that school–university partnerships may be defined by four key goals: (a) improvement of student [pupil] learning; (b) preparation of educators; (c) professional development of educators; (d) research and inquiry into improving practice. These four goals place adult learning at the centre of the school–university partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356336X12440023">Sandholtz, 2002</xref>) and it is instructive to compare the experience of the Irish PETE students in this research with these models. In particular, there was little evidence of either capacity building in school–university partnerships or a shared goal of professional development for all parties.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier on p.14, Graham's (1988) argument suggests that in successful collaboration, partners move to appreciate each others input, which in this case can lead to parity of esteem between the school and the university. Progressing toward such equality is often steeped with mistrust and mutual disrespect.</p>
<p>As was noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond (2006b</xref>) argues that effective ITE programmes possess a range of key characteristics, one of which is to place value on the strength of the school–university relationship in supporting PETE student learning. Here again, the contrast between Darling-Hammond’s blueprint for effective practice and the findings from this Irish study is stark. Although all parties (UT, SP, CT) were <italic>individually</italic> invested in teacher education, they appeared to compete with each other for a pre-eminent role in the process, rather than collaborating around the central task of enhancing PETE student learning. Tensions therefore existed at the interface between school and university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440023">Edwards and Mutton, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>International research argues consistently that school and university personnel should understand their respective roles in a shared, coherent programme of teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440023">Hardy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440023">Kiely, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440023">Korthagen (2010</xref>) advocates ‘a pedagogy of teacher education that combines fruitful practical experiences’ (p.104) and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440023">Behets and Vergauwen (2006</xref>: 407-408) point out, TP is pivotal within this process. The findings from this Irish study, however, support findings of previous international research and Irish research in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440023">Coady, 2010</xref>) and, in addition, illustrate vividly the mechanics of the process of inhibited student learning in dysfunctional school–university partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440023">Darling-Hammond, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440023">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440023">Hardy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356336X12440023">McIntyre et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, the findings of this study suggest that it was perceptions of a lack of parity within the school–university relationship that led to problems in supporting PETE student learning. This left students with the task of directing their own learning using any available source, including CTs, UTs, books, the Internet or self-selected mentors. Although some of the students appeared to be adept at this process, it could be argued that a training ‘system’, such as ITE, should be able to offer them more.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356336X12440023">Clandinin and Connelly (1995</xref>) highlighted the importance in professional learning of a teacher’s ‘professional knowledge landscape’ and noted that is both ‘an intellectual and moral landscape’ (p.5). It is in this context that we argue the findings of the Irish study are of particular concern. There is no doubt that the professional knowledge landscape for these PETE students was both intellectually and morally impoverished. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356336X12440023">Hager and Hodkinson (2009</xref>) point to the importance of conceptualising learning as a process of learning across boundaries and, in a sense, this is exactly the facility and philosophy that the system in this research lacked. The impact on the PETE students was apparent: the impact on their future pupils, and on the next generation of PETE students, can only be imagined.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper reports one set of data from a study of Irish PETE students and considers the impact of what appeared to be dysfunctional school–university partnerships on their professional learning during TP. The findings indicate a perceived lack of parity between schools and the university in terms of the CTUT relationship. Specifically, the findings show that the TP grading process was perceived to be unjust and somewhat unbalanced, with the UT placed in an omnipotent role. Perhaps as a consequence of this imbalance, CTs tended to defend their PETE students in post-lesson meetings with the UT. In addition, there were issues regarding the optimum site for PETE learning, with SPs believing that the school is the primary site for PETE student learning, not the university (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview, 16 February 2007). Universities did not appear to value school contribution in TP, for example, Mr Clancy (SP) stated the support given by schools for PETE student learning ‘was not to be assumed’ (SP, Mr Clancy, Interview, 16 February 2007) and Mr Noonan (SP) asserting ‘The university needs to get real in terms of who is serving who’ (SP, Mr Noonan, Interview Principal, 16 February 2007). It also seemed that the role of the SP in ITE was not acknowledged or valued. This resulted in PETE students learning in an unsupported and often isolated manner.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of this study, it can be argued that within ITE in Ireland, it would be helpful if UTs and CTs were trained specifically to provide high-quality learning support for PETE students during TP, and if the ‘system’ of ITE could be built upon concepts such as shared understanding of the responsibility of both schools and universities for PETE learning and capacity building. This would pave the way for the development of genuine partnerships between CTs and UTs, and between schools and universities, with all parties actively supporting PETE student learning on TP. In this way, the professional knowledge landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356336X12440023">Clandinin and Connelly, 1995</xref>) could look very different. Corroborating these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356336X12440023">Coady (2010</xref>) in her recent study on teacher education in Ireland concluded:<disp-quote>
<p>The impact that the school has on how student teachers develop must be more widely acknowledged and teacher education must engage in respectful dialogue with schools to enable the development of their role as partners in the TP process through (a) communication of the expectations of teacher education providers during TP re role of the school, the co-operating teachers and the student teachers is during the practicum placement (b) The relationship with schools should also be developed to enable teacher educators to become more involved in the life cycle of teaching within schools in supporting practising teachers in schools and provide an arena for teachers to truly consider and experience their learning as a continuum (pp.322-323).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In 2011, the Teaching Council of Ireland launched a policy document on the Continuum of Teacher Education across ITE, Induction and CPD. This may be the vital first step to recognising the joint role of school and university in preparation of PETE students and finally following the recommendation made in 1999 by two key reviews of teacher education in Ireland (at both primary and post-primary level) that teacher education programmes need to have closer links with school personnel on TP to prepare teachers to deal with educational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356336X12440023">Harford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356336X12440023">O'Donoghue and Harford, 2010</xref>). The Teaching Council of Ireland is currently consulting with key stakeholders regarding the practical implementation of changes to the Irish ITE system. They advocate:<disp-quote>
<p>‘<italic>New and innovative school placement models using a partnership approach</italic>’ which would comprise ‘<italic>host schools being communities of good professional practice</italic>’ (Teaching Council of Ireland, 2011a, pp. 16-17). These new school placement models would (a) devolve greater responsibility to schools to support student teacher learning e.g. mentoring (b) involve a whole school approach to student teacher learning support (c) enhanced partnership between university tutor and cooperating teacher and (d) CPD opportunities for cooperating teachers to help them engage in their role of supporting student teacher learning (e) in-school learning opportunities for university tutors (ibid).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To close, Sir Ken Robinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356336X12440023">2010</xref>) describes the change in culture needed to change Ireland’s current teacher education system, using the words of Abraham Lincoln (1862):<disp-quote>
<p>The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In engaging in dialogue with key stakeholders on the future of teacher education in Ireland, perhaps the Teaching Council is attempting to do just that.</p>
