<p>Teachers need to know a range of information—from how to best organize their classroom to maximize student learning to how to best handle discipline problems when they present themselves in the classroom. In addition, teachers need to know their subject matter content, and they need to understand and be able to respond to the contextual idiosyncrasies and nuances that present themselves as they work to teach their subject matter content such as mathematics, science, art, language arts or history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085913485176">Shulman’s (1987)</xref> work pointed to the necessity of teachers’ development of subject matter content knowledge as well as pedagogical knowledge. His work also stressed the convergence of the two: teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge, the knowledge teachers have of their content, and how they teach that content to their students. Clearly, teachers’ knowledge about and ability to teach their particular subject matter is necessary for student success in any classroom. However, some researchers, teacher educators, policy makers, teachers, and principals believe subject matter expertise is the only real important feature to student and teacher success. I have observed that these stakeholders might admit there are other aspects of teacher learning and development that are essential, but many believe that subject matter knowledge is all that <italic>really</italic> matters in a classroom.</p>
<p>On a broader scale, alternative, fast-track teacher training programs such as Teach for America (TFA) recruit noneducation majors into teaching under a premise that their corps members have content knowledge, having earned an undergraduate degree in a particular domain such as history or mathematics. However, is subject matter knowledge enough, particularly in urban schools where many of these teachers are placed and where the needs of students seem to be profound? In many urban schools, teacher absenteeism is pervasive and students are “taught” by substitute “teachers” without the necessary content or pedagogical knowledge. Of course, these experiences shape students’ experiences and ultimately their outcomes.</p>
<p>A pervasive theme in the development of teachers is that as long as they have a sophisticated command of their subject matter they will be successful. To be clear, I agree teachers must have subject matter expertise to facilitate learning opportunities in a classroom. I recall experiences both as a student in high school and college when it was clear teachers possessed a wide and deep range of knowledge in their particular subject domain. While some teachers were able to draw from their subject expertise and convey it effectively to students, others did not have the ability to teach the subjects well. As a student in college, I recall several higher level mathematics and history professors who knew their subjects well—they were well-respected experts in their respective fields—but struggled to engage students, explain and illuminate complex mathematical ideas or historical events, or investigate why students in their classes were not succeeding. Indeed, the point here is just because a practicing or prospective teacher has a deep-level of subject matter content knowledge does not necessarily mean he or she can or will be successful teaching.</p>
<p>The point that subject matter knowledge is necessary but insufficient is perhaps even more essential in urban and high poverty learning environments. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085913485176">Haberman (1995)</xref>, building from 40 years of research of teachers of urban and high poverty students, explained that while it is essential for teachers to know their subject matter, this is insufficient for the kind of work necessary to be successful in urban and high poverty schools. He maintained that many teachers fail in high poverty environments because they do not have the ability to connect with students and build relationships with them. In the simplest form, an essential element of teaching is learning about the students teachers are teaching, and it is not trivial to develop the skill and knowledge to engage in this learning about students. In this way, subject matter knowledge is necessary but is insufficient in meeting the needs of some students. In urban schools, teachers need to know how to</p>
