<abstract>
<p>Reread–Adapt and Answer–Comprehend (RAAC) is a reading intervention designed to target fluency and comprehension for students with disabilities. Previous researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention for students with learning disabilities. This study extended the research by using the RAAC intervention with three postsecondary students with autism spectrum disorder. In the context of a multiple baseline across participants design, the results can be interpreted to conclude that the RAAC intervention may improve oral reading fluency and comprehension for young adults with autism. Using the linear weekly growth model based on the slope, the authors calculated realistic and ambitious goals. Participants’ fluency gains exceeded the ambitious levels of growth and transferred to unpracticed passages. In addition, all participants correctly answered more factual and inferential comprehension questions during the intervention.</p>

<p>Regardless of disability severity, reading is an essential instructional goal for all students. Instruction for students with moderate and severe disabilities often focuses on the acquisition of critical sight words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357612448421">Browder, Wakeman, Spooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, &amp; Algozzine, 2006</xref>), whereas often the goal for students with mild to moderate disabilities is to read similarly to their peers without disabilities. Unfortunately, despite the need for effective instructional approaches to enable young adults with autism to achieve their reading goals, research in the area of reading and autism is sparse and unable to guide practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357612448421">Whalon, Al Otaiba, &amp; Delano, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The reading proficiency of students with autism varies greatly. In a study of the reading skills of elementary students with autism, researchers found that approximately half of the students had oral reading skills below their same-age peers and nearly 75% of the students had below average comprehension skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612448421">Nation, Clarke, Wright, &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, within every assessment Nation and colleagues administered, students scored from the floor to the ceiling indicating large discrepancies among students in all critical reading skill areas.</p>
<p>One skill area that students with autism may struggle with is reading fluency. Reading fluency, the ability to read with speed, accuracy, and proper expression, is one of the five essential pillars of reading instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357612448421">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000</xref>). When reading is dysfluent, students are unable to comprehend because they need to focus an extensive amount of their cognitive resources on reading individual words and therefore do not have enough capacity to devote to comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357612448421">LaBerg &amp; Samuels, 1974</xref>). Reading fluency is considered vital because students’ ability to read text fluently often predicts comprehension achievement better than direct comprehension measures such as questioning and story retelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357612448421">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Hosp, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although reading fluency is an essential skill, it has not often been a target of instruction for students with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357612448421">Browder et al., 2006</xref>). A meta-analysis of all single-case research studies on reading fluency intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357612448421">Morgan, Sideridis, &amp; Hua, 2011</xref>) reported only one study that involved two students with autism. The researchers in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357612448421">Kamps, Locke, Delquadri, &amp; Hall, 1989</xref>) implemented an oral reading intervention within a classwide peer tutoring model for two students, age 9 and 11 years. Analysis of results indicated a significant increase in these students’ reading fluency.</p>
<p>Despite the paucity of fluency intervention research for students with autism, much is known about increasing reading fluency for typically developing students and students with learning disabilities. One intervention in particular, repeated reading, has an extensive research base indicating that it can increase students’ reading fluency achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>). Repeated reading consists of students rereading a series of passages until they reach a satisfactory level of fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088357612448421">Samuels, 1979</xref>). A critical component of repeated reading instruction is having students read aloud to a competent tutor who provides feedback on word errors. Repeated reading interventions that include this component are highly effective at improving students’ reading fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Improvement in students’ reading fluency via repeated reading has not always translated into increases in reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357612448421">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357612448421">Homan, Klesius, &amp; Hite, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357612448421">Mathes &amp; Fuchs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357612448421">Rashotte &amp; Torgesen, 1985</xref>). Results of a meta-analysis were interpreted to conclude that, at best, repeated reading has a moderate affect on reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>). Researchers must take this into account when designing interventions for students with autism, who often have significant difficulties with comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612448421">Nation et al., 2006</xref>). Instead of using repeated reading alone, students with autism may require a program that combines repeated reading with a comprehension intervention.</p>
<p>Reread–Adapt and Answer–Comprehend (RAAC) is one such intervention that targets both fluency and comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357612448421">Therrien, Wickstrom, &amp; Jones, 2006</xref>). A typical RAAC intervention involves having students reread instructional-level materials to a competent tutor who corrects decoding errors. After reaching a performance criterion (e.g., number of correct words per minute [CWPM]), the student moves to a more difficult passage. The intervention addresses comprehension by having students read a series of generic questions that are related to the important narrative elements of the passage before the initial reading (i.e., time, location, character, story development, and outcome). Researchers of previous studies have used their results to conclude that the RAAC intervention significantly improved students’ reading fluency and performance on both factual and inferential comprehension questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357612448421">Therrien et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357612448421">Therrien &amp; Gormley-Budin, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357612448421">Hua, Therrien, Hendrickson, and Woods-Groves (2012)</xref> extended the utility of RAAC procedures with three postsecondary learners with intellectual disability. In the study, the researchers modified the RAAC procedures by having the students read instructional-level passage three times without using a performance criterion or varying the passage difficulty. The intervention resulted in improved fluency and comprehension for all three participants. Fluency gains exceeded the ambitious levels of growth and transferred to unpracticed passages. In addition, all participants correctly answered more factual and inferential comprehension questions during intervention. Although the utility of the RAAC intervention has yet to be proven for young adults with autism, it seems to be a logical intervention for this population.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to replicate the procedures used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357612448421">Hua et al. (2012)</xref> and assess the effectiveness of the modified RAAC intervention on reading fluency and comprehension of young adults with autism. Specifically, we addressed the following three questions: (a) Does the RAAC program increase students’ reading fluency on intervention passages? (b) Do gains in reading fluency on RAAC intervention passages translate into increased fluency on novel passages? and (c) How does RAAC affect factual and inferential comprehension?</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Three students diagnosed with autism and intellectual disability participated in the study. At the time of this study, all participants were enrolled in a postsecondary education program for young adults with learning and intellectual disability at a Midwestern university. The program provided an integrated collegiate experience, including academic enhancement, career development, student life, and community life. The program academic coordinator referred the three students for participation in the study because of their reading difficulties. The Institutional Review Board at the university approved the study, and the young adults consented to participate.</p>
<p>To determine the participants’ instructional reading level, we administered an oral reading fluency (ORF) curriculum-based measurement (CBM) before the study. Data on ORF were compared with reading placement criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357612448421">Fuchs &amp; Deno, 1982</xref>). The CBM results indicated that the highest instructional reading level was third grade for Jay and sixth grade for Mike and Ben. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088357612448421">Table 1</xref> presents a detailed description of each student.</p>

<p>Nine undergraduate students registered in a special education methods course participated as tutors in the study. Tutors collected data and implemented the intervention during one-on-one sessions in four offices (3 m × 3 m). The experiment took place three times a week (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), and each session lasted for approximately 15 min.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Based on the story ideas from published children’s books, two graduate students wrote 27 narrative passages at Grades 3 and 6, respectively. We calculated the reading level of each passage using Flesch–Kincaid; each passage contained one complete narrative. Similar to the criteria used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357612448421">Therrien et al. (2006)</xref>, we limited the length of the passages so that students with reading fluency at the 50th percentile for the respective grade levels could finish reading the passages in 1 to 1.25 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357612448421">Hasbrouck &amp; Tindal, 1992</xref>). The average length of the passages was 129 words for third-grade passages and 160 words for sixth-grade passages. We also developed four factual and four inferential passage-specific comprehension questions using the following definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357612448421">Davey &amp; McBride, 1986</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>Correct responses to factual questions can be underlined directly in the text without requiring the integration of information from multiple sentences. Correct responses to inferential questions either cannot be located in the text (i.e., cannot be underlined) or require integration of information from multiple sentences. (p. 257)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first author reviewed and edited each passage and the comprehension questions before the study (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1088357612448421">appendix</xref> for an example passage and comprehension questions with acceptable answers). Passages were randomly assigned to sessions before the study began.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1088357612448421">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>During baseline, the tutor asked the student to read a passage aloud. As soon as the student read the first word in the passage, the tutor started a stopwatch. The tutor recorded the student’s reading on the tutor’s copy of the passage by marking errors with a slash through the incorrectly read word (including substitutions and omissions). During reading, if the student did not read a word within 3 s, the tutor read the word and marked it as an error. (We did not analyze the decoding error patterns in the study.) After the student read the last word of the passage, the tutor stopped the stopwatch and recorded elapsed time. The tutor gave the student brief and general praise (e.g., “Good job!”). The tutor then removed the passage and asked the student to read and orally answer the eight passage-specific comprehension questions (i.e., four factual and four inferential comprehension questions). Student responses were transcribed on the tutor’s copy. The tutor did not provide any prompt or feedback to student responses. After each session, the tutor recorded the number of comprehension questions answered correctly using a key of acceptable answers.</p>
<p>During intervention, the tutor implemented the modified RAAC procedure using a specially designed script. The intervention began by having the student read four generic comprehension questions at the beginning of each session. The four generic comprehension questions were (a) Who is the main character? (b) Where and when did the story take place? (c) What did the main character do? and (d) How did the main character feel? These generic questions directed student attention to the important components of narrative passages, thus enhancing comprehension monitoring. The tutor asked the student to read the questions aloud with the following statement: “Before you read the story, I want you to read these questions. Pay attention to what you are reading as you will need to answer these questions (the tutor pointed to the questions on the cue card).” The student then read each question aloud.</p>
<p>Next, the tutor asked the student to read the passage aloud three consecutive times using the procedures identical to those described in the baseline, and the tutor timed each reading. Following each reading, the tutor corrected all the decoding errors using a model-prompt-check procedure. The tutor pointed to the incorrectly read word, modeled the word, and asked the student to read it correctly. After all the errors in the passage were individually corrected, the tutor pointed to each word and asked the student to read it independently. This error correction procedure was repeated until the student read all incorrectly decoded words correctly. The tutor also provided feedback to the student on fluency, accuracy, and prosody using a feedback sheet (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088357612448421">Figure 1</xref> for feedback sheet). The tutor first gave the student feedback on the current level of performance followed by areas of improvement. For example, the tutor’s feedback to the student who read the passage at level three may include the following statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>You read most of the story in 3- to 4-word phrases. You only repeated or missed a few words. You read the story with expression and emphasized important words. Next time I want you to try to read the story in long, meaningful phrases with expression and make sure that you read these words correctly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<fig id="fig1-1088357612448421" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Tutor feedback sheet.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1088357612448421-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>After the student read the passage three times, the tutor asked the student to orally answer the four generic questions from the cue card. The tutor provided additional prompts if the student did not know the answer or answered the questions incorrectly. For example, initially the tutor prompted the student to look for information in the passage (e.g., “See if you can find the answer in the passage”). If the initial prompt did not lead to a correct answer, the tutor prompted the student to read the sentence where the answer could be found or inferred (e.g., “See if you can find the answer in this sentence”). If the student still could not answer the question correctly, the tutor provided the answer and explicitly explained the rationale for the correct answer. Student’s answers to the generic questions from the cue card were not recorded or included as a dependent measure. Following the generic comprehension questions, the tutor then asked the student to answer the eight passage-specific comprehension questions. The tutor transcribed and scored the student responses as correct or incorrect using the same procedures as those described in the baseline. The tutor did not provide any prompts or feedback on student responses to the eight passage-specific comprehension questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1088357612448421">
<title>Tutor Training</title>
<p>We trained tutors to collect data and implement RAAC intervention during two 3-hr class sessions. During the first training session, we described the research design and the rationale of the components of the RAAC intervention. During the second training session, tutors were trained to collect data and implement the RAAC procedures using a model-prompt-check procedure. First, we provided the tutors with a script and modeled the procedures. Second, we prompted the tutors to implement each step of the procedures as a group followed by the tutors’ practice of the procedures with each other. Before the conclusion of the training session, we conducted individual-simulated baseline and intervention sessions to check tutors’ mastery of the procedures. At the end of the training, all tutors reached 100% accuracy on a procedural checklist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1088357612448421">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>We used a multiple baseline across participants design to examine the effects of the RAAC procedures on reading fluency and comprehension on the passages. The systematic and sequential introduction of the intervention and concurrent measurement of the reading performances across participants allowed us to demonstrate the effects of the intervention on a skill we could not reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088357612448421">Tawney &amp; Gast, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The baseline period for Mike was 6 sessions, for Ben 12 sessions, and for Jay 18 sessions. We began Intervention for Jay, Mike, and Ben after we obtained a stable baseline for individual students and the prior student had been in intervention for 6 sessions. The RAAC intervention sessions lasted over a period of 21 sessions for Mike, 15 sessions for Ben, and 9 sessions for Jay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1088357612448421">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The primary dependent variable was CWPM. CWPM was calculated by multiplying the number of words read correctly by 60 and dividing by the number of seconds taken to read the passage. During the intervention, we used CWPM from the terminal (i.e., third) reading of the passages for comparison. We measured Students’ reading comprehension by recording the number of passage-specific comprehension questions (i.e., four factual and four inferential) answered correctly across the experimental conditions. We also noted the total number of decoding errors per passage as a dependent variable.</p>
<p>We assessed the effects of the intervention on unpracticed instructional-level passages using the dynamic indicators of basic early literacy skills (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357612448421">University of Oregon, 2005</xref>). Prior to baseline, each participant read three instructional-level passages for a minute (i.e., sixth grade for Mike and Ben, and third grade for Jay). We recorded the CWPM of each reading and used the median score as a pretest measure. Immediately following the last session of the experiment, we collected students’ CWPM on the instructional-level passages using the same procedures as those in the pretest. We used the median score as a posttest measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1088357612448421">
<title>Reliability and Procedural Integrity</title>
<p>The tutors served as primary data collectors in the study. We also trained a graduate student who had 2 years of research experience to conduct both procedural integrity and interobserver reliability checks. We conducted the interobserver reliability and procedural integrity checks during 25% of the sessions across baseline and intervention for each participant. The graduate student independently recorded timing, number of decoding errors, and answers to the eight comprehension questions. Interobserver agreement was calculated by total number of agreements divided by agreements plus disagreements multiplied by 100%. The mean agreement for CWPM was 98% (range between 97% and 100%); the mean agreement for reading comprehension was 98% (range between 93% and 100%). The observer also evaluated the tutor’s treatment integrity using a procedural checklist identical to the script used by the tutor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088357612448421">Figure 1</xref>). Procedural integrity was 100% across all the tutors and sessions evaluated.</p>

<p>All participants had relatively stable baselines and slightly descending or ascending data paths during the intervention.

<p>Based on the slope values, we calculated CWPM growth per week to examine student progress over time. Researchers found that the linear weekly growth model based on the slope is a close approximation of student learning over time and is a sensitive measure of treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357612448421">Fuchs, Fuchs, McMaster, &amp; Al Otaiba, 2003</xref>). The slope from the regression represents the average change of CWPM for every two calendar days. Therefore, we converted the slope to a weekly CWPM growth rate by multiplying by 3.5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357612448421">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 1993</xref>). Then, we compared weekly CWPM growth with normative realistic and ambitious grade-level growth rates. Realistic and ambitious ORF weekly growth rates are 1.0 and 1.5 words per week at Grade 3, and 0.3 and 0.65 words per week at Grade 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357612448421">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Hamlett, 1989</xref>). In comparison with the normative grade-level ORF growth rate, all three participants exceeded the ambitious levels of growth during the intervention (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088357612448421">Table 3</xref>) by 4.60 (Mike) and 2.14 (Ben) words above the normative ambitious growth rate. Similarly, Jay’s ORF growth rate was 3.68 words higher than the ambitious ORF growth rate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088357612448421">Figure 3</xref> presents the total number of errors participants made per passage during the baseline and the intervention. In comparison with the baseline condition, all participants made fewer errors per passage during the intervention. Mike and Ben’s errors decreased from an average of seven and six errors per passage, respectively, during the baseline to an average of one error per passage during the intervention. Although Jay’s errors increased immediately after he started the intervention, his average number of errors was reduced from an average of nine errors per passage during the baseline to an average of two errors per passage during the intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to replicate the procedures used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357612448421">Hua et al. (2012)</xref> and assess the effectiveness of the modified RAAC intervention on reading fluency and comprehension of three young adults with autism. First, we analyzed the level and trend changes between the baseline and the intervention. In comparison to the baseline, all three participants made immediate gains in ORF from reading the same passage three times. We also compared the individual student’s slopes between the two conditions. Mike reversed the descending trend line during the baseline to an ascending trend line during the intervention. Although Ben and Jay had ascending data paths during the baseline, their slopes during the intervention indicate that the progress they made when they received the RAAC intervention was over and above what would be expected from a continuation of the baseline trend. Similarly, all three students correctly answered more comprehension questions during the intervention than the baseline.</p>
<p>Second, we evaluated the applied significance of the intervention by comparing the participants’ weekly ORF growth rate to the normative benchmarks. The RAAC intervention resulted in an ORF growth rate that exceeded the normative ambitious ORF growth rate for all three participants. In addition, fluency gains accumulated over the intervention produced gains that were generalizable to unpracticed passages with two of the participants, moving them one level higher based on the reading placement criteria. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that young adults with autism may benefit from systematic and intensive instruction that focuses on ORF and comprehension.</p>
<p>Researchers recommend that reading interventions for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focus on both code- and meaning-based skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357612448421">Whalon et al., 2009</xref>). Interpretations of empirical evidence suggest that students with autism have relative strength with decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357612448421">Nation, 1999</xref>), but how this strength in decoding generalizes to reading fluency is unknown because researchers rarely addressed reading fluency of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357612448421">Browder et al., 2006</xref>). The unique reading patterns of students with autism (e.g., preoccupation with decoding and lack of attention to the global context of the passage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612448421">Nation et al., 2006</xref>) also indicate that students with autism need additional training on comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357612448421">O’Connor &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we implemented an intervention that addressed both the fluency and comprehension needs of students with ASD.</p>
<p>We included a repeated reading procedure to build ORF. Previously, researchers suggested that repeated reading is an effective intervention to improve reading speed and accuracy for students with a range of exceptionalities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357612448421">Chard, Vaughn, &amp; Tyler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357612448421">Wexler, Vaughn, Edmonds, &amp; Reutebuch, 2008</xref>). We implemented the procedure using several critical components identified in prior research. First, we had students orally read instructional-level passages aloud three times. Repetitive reading increased students’ opportunities to respond and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088357612448421">Skinner &amp; Shapiro, 1989</xref>) and enhanced reading speed. In addition, syntheses of the research indicate that three rereads result in significant fluency gains without sacrificing too much time for instruction, thus making the procedure relatively efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357612448421">Chard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>). Second, feedback from tutors also was likely essential to the intervention as previous researchers found that students make greater gains on reading fluency when interventions incorporate corrective feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612448421">Therrien, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We also included a comprehension component in the intervention as improved reading fluency does not guarantee improved comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357612448421">Rashotte &amp; Torgesen, 1985</xref>). Specifically, students with ASD appear to benefit from strategies that activate prior knowledge and organize text (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612448421">Nation et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, prior to each reading, we asked students to read the generic questions related to the setting, characters, problem, solution, and outcome. These questions provided a general outline and organization of the narrative that likely helped students activate prior knowledge and organize the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357612448421">Gersten, Fuchs, Williams, &amp; Baker, 2001</xref>). This strategy also likely enhanced comprehension monitoring by assisting students to take note of the relevant information as they read.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1088357612448421">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this study must be interpreted within the context of its limitations. First, the affect of the program on comprehension remains in question. Although the reading intervention increased both factual and inferential comprehension questions answered correctly across the three students, modest effects and a high degree of variability of the data warrant further investigation. One plausible explanation for the modest effect on comprehension is the possibility of a ceiling effect. There were only eight reading comprehension questions, so students had limited opportunity to demonstrate comprehension growth. Future researchers should use reading comprehension measures that are more sensitive to student growth (e.g., story retell; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357612448421">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, although this study demonstrated that the RAAC intervention improved reading fluency and comprehension for postsecondary students with autism, only three participants were involved in the study. Researchers found that individuals with autism have large discrepancies of needs and proficiency levels in critical reading skill areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612448421">Nation et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, further research is warranted to determine whether other individuals with autism would benefit from the RAAC intervention.</p>
<p>Third, we used third- and sixth-grade-level narrative passages in the study to develop fluency and comprehension for young adults with autism. Although effective, findings from this study may not be generalizable to other types of text. For example, readers acquire information from user manuals, rules, and regulations by reading expository materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357612448421">Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 1997</xref>). Expository materials, however, are more challenging for struggling readers than narrative material because of the density of information and varied text structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357612448421">Gersten et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, research designed to improve the ORF and comprehension of expository text for young adults with autism is warranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1088357612448421">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>The Committee on Educational Interventions for Children With Autism recommended that academic skills should be included as an essential intervention for this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357612448421">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). One of the most important academic skills is reading comprehension because it not only enhances learning opportunities and improves communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357612448421">Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 1997</xref>) but also affects individual’s economic security and general well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357612448421">Chhabra &amp; McCardle, 2004</xref>). Therefore, reading instruction arguably should be a priority goal in postsecondary education for students with autism. The results of this study suggest that young adults with autism and intellectual disability can benefit from a reading program that addresses both fluency and comprehension. Teachers can improve reading fluency by providing students with opportunities to reread connected text while providing feedback on word errors. Educators also can enhance narrative passage comprehension by reviewing questions that are related to important elements of the passage before the initial reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1088357612448421">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we extended the research by using the RAAC intervention with postsecondary students with autism and intellectual disability. The results can be interpreted to conclude that RAAC may be an effective intervention to improve ORF and comprehension for this population. Fluency gains exceeded the ambitious levels of growth and transferred to unpracticed passages. Given the paucity of the reading intervention research for students with autism and heterogeneity of the reading ability across the autism spectrum, researchers should continue this line of research with an emphasis on reading comprehension with other types of text.</p>
