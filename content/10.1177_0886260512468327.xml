<abstract>
<p>Considerable research has been done on childhood bullying, including its antecedents and consequences. Yet, with all of the attention on bullying, particularly school bullying, sibling bullying has been vastly overlooked. Sibling bullying is a type of violence prevalent in the lives of most children, but little is known about the phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to profile sibling bullying by examining prevalence rates, the extent to which siblings perceive sibling bullying to be normative, and victim–perpetrator differences in perceptions of sibling bullying. Twenty-seven sibling pairs who wrote stories about personal experiences of sibling bullying and victimization completed questionnaires about these experiences and responded to their sibling partners’ stories. Of the siblings surveyed, 78% reported being bullied by their sibling and 85% reported bullying their sibling during their childhood. This is far greater than published statistics on peer bullying. Not surprisingly, victims viewed sibling bullying more negatively than perpetrators. Sadly, there was a norm of acceptance of sibling bullying among most of the sibling pairs. Practical implications are discussed.</p>

<p>Sibling bullying has been defined as “any motoric and/or verbal episode involving one or both of the siblings that included hitting, pushing, kicking, spitting, biting, throwing objects, struggling over toys, name-calling, or hostile arguing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468327">Adams &amp; Kelley, 1992</xref>, p. 709). Like traditional forms of bullying, sibling bullying involves an act of aggression that is often repeated over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468327">Yabko, Hokoda, &amp; Ulloa, 2008</xref>). It is a widespread and serious problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468327">Simonelli, Mullis, Elliott, &amp; Pierce, 2002</xref>) and, arguably, the most frequent type of aggression in American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468327">Felson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468327">Yabko et al., 2008</xref>). Among children, siblings fight with one of their other siblings more often than they do with all other children combined. Of the 336 participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468327">Duncan’s (1999)</xref> study, 41.6% <italic>pretty often</italic> or <italic>very often</italic> called siblings names, 30% <italic>pretty often</italic> or <italic>very often</italic> picked on siblings, 24.4% <italic>pretty often</italic> or <italic>very often</italic> hit or pushed siblings, and 11.2% <italic>pretty often</italic> or <italic>very often</italic> beat up their siblings. A more recent investigation found that almost 30% of children in the age group of 2 to 17 years had been physically assaulted by a sibling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468327">Finkelhor, Ormrod, Turner, &amp; Hamby, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, there is little research on the antecedents and consequences of sibling bullying in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468327">Hardy, Beers, Burgess, &amp; Taylor, 2010</xref>). Rather, most research on childhood bullying focuses on peer bullying, mainly in schools.</p>
<p>Sibling bullying and peer bullying appear to be linked among some children, as children’s experiences with siblings appear to predict their experiences with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468327">MacKinnon-Lewis, Starnes, Volling, &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>). Sibling violence may teach children that violence is a normal and acceptable approach for dealing with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468327">Simonelli et al., 2002</xref>). Children involved in peer bullying report the highest frequency of sibling bullying and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468327">Duncan, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468327">Wolke and Samara (2004)</xref> found that 50% of children bullied at home by siblings were also victims or bully/victims at school, compared to 12.4% of children not subject to sibling bullying. However, peer bullying and sibling bullying take place for different reasons and in different contexts.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512468327">
<title>Consequences of Sibling Bullying</title>
<p>Sibling bullying is related to both internalizing and externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468327">Finkelhor, Turner, &amp; Ormrod, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468327">Turner, Finkelhor, &amp; Ormrod, 2010</xref>). Peers are more likely to reject boys who have experienced heightened levels of sibling bullying relative to controls and nominate them as being more aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468327">MacKinnon-Lewis et al., 1997</xref>). Sibling aggression is also related to behavioral problems at home, impulsivity, and poor social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468327">Natsuaki, Ge, Reiss, &amp; Neiderhiser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468327">Wolke &amp; Samara, 2004</xref>). Children involved in sibling bullying have also been found to score high on depression and loneliness scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468327">Duncan, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Because sibling bullying remains an underresearched topic, particularly when compared to other types of bullying, the present study was designed to generate a profile of sibling bullying, with a particular focus on prevalence rates, methods used, and perceptions of sibling bullying. We were particularly interested in variability in perceptions of sibling bullying by victims and perpetrators. We expected the frequency of sibling bullying to be higher than the frequency of peer victimization reported in published research. We also anticipated that, because a large number of participants would have first-hand experience with sibling bullying, they would perceive sibling bullying to be normative in sibling relationships. Third, we hypothesized that victims’ perceptions of sibling bullying incidents would be more negative than perpetrator accounts of those same incidents.</p>

<p>Fifty-four students (24 male, 29 female, 1 did not specify sex), age 18 and older (<italic>M</italic> = 19.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.94), volunteered to participate as 27 sibling pairs via the psychology department human subjects participation website. The majority were Caucasian (85%) or African American (9%). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260512468327">
<title>Demographic questionnaire</title>
<p>Participants completed a demographic questionnaire assessing their sex, age, and race.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512468327">
<title>Sibling bullying questionnaire</title>
<p>Thirty-two questions from the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468327">Olweus, 2007</xref>) were adapted to assess participants’ experiences with sibling bullying during childhood. Representative items included, “How often were you bullied by your sibling during your childhood?,” and “How often did you bully your sibling during your childhood?” Participants also completed items asking how they were bullied by their sibling (e.g., “My sibling called me mean names”) and how they bullied their sibling (e.g., “called my sibling mean names”). Participants responded to all of these items using 5-point response formats (e.g., 1 = <italic>I was not bullied by my sibling</italic> to 5 = <italic>several times a week</italic>). Participants also completed items examining whether or not they told and whom they told. Participants answered these questions in regards to experiences with the sibling present with them. Response formats for other questions varied depending on the question asked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260512468327">
<title>Narratives</title>
<p>All participants wrote one narrative describing a time when they were bullied by their sibling and a second narrative describing a time when they perpetrated sibling bullying against the same sibling. Narratives were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468327">Pennebaker, Francis, &amp; Booth, 2003</xref>) program. Although this program produces a total of 61 outcome variables, of interest here were total word count, number of self-references, number of other references, positive emotionality (e.g., happy, pretty, good), negative emotionality (e.g., hate, worthless, enemy), and cognitive mechanisms (e.g., cause, know, ought). With the exception of total word count, numbers reported reflect percentages of total words used by participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512468327">
<title>Postnarrative victim questionnaire</title>
<p>After writing about a time when their sibling bullied them, participants completed a series of questions examining their perceptions of the incident. A representative item included, “How did you feel about the experience.” Questions were answered on 12-point scales with 5 scale labels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512468327">
<title>Postnarrative perpetrator questionnaire</title>
<p>A similar questionnaire examined participants’ perceptions of incidents where they perpetrated sibling bullying.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512468327">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After completing the demographic questions and the sibling bullying questionnaire in counterbalanced order, participants wrote about a time when their sibling bullied them during childhood. Participants were then given a bullying victim questionnaire. Participants then wrote about a time when they bullied their sibling and filled out a bullying perpetrator questionnaire. The order of writing these two narratives was counterbalanced. Thus, all siblings completed both victim and perpetrator narratives.</p>
<p>Participants’ stories were collected and given to the sibling. Participants read their siblings’ narratives and wrote narrative responses. They then completed the bully victim questionnaire and the bullying perpetrator questionnaire in response to their sibling’s stories. The order of these writing sessions was counterbalanced. Upon completion of all narratives and questionnaires, participants were debriefed, thanked, and dismissed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260512468327" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported being bullied by their sibling and 85% reported bullying their sibling. When asked how often they were targeted, 13% reported 2 to 3 times a month, 17% about once a week, and 15% several times a week. In terms of the frequency of perpetrating sibling bullying, 26% said 2 to 3 times a month, 11% about once a week, and 13% several times a week. These statistics are considerably larger than reports of bullying by peers in published research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512468327">Kowalski &amp; Limber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468327">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>), providing support for our first hypothesis.</p>
<p>One explanation for these high percentages may be differing norms relating to the perceived acceptability of bullying one’s sibling as opposed to one’s peers. In support of this and our hypotheses, participants viewed sibling bullying as a norm in sibling relationships. Fifty-eight percent of respondents viewed sibling bullying as acceptable and 85% believed it should be expected. In addition, in spite of the high percentage of sibling bullying, only 19% reported being fearful of their sibling at least “sometimes” or more often. Furthermore, in response to a question asking participants how close their relationship with their sibling was after the incident, both victims (<italic>M</italic> = 8.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.97) and perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 9.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.81) gave high ratings of closeness that did not differ significantly from one another, nor did they differ significantly from ratings of closeness prior to the incident (victim: <italic>M</italic> = 9.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.83; perpetrator: <italic>M</italic> = 9.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.89).</p>
<p>Siblings also reported variability in how they bullied and were bullied by the sibling. Victims reported the most common method to be being verbally teased in a hurtful way (83%), followed by being physically bullied (e.g., hit or kicked; 69%) and being excluded or ignored (66%). Similarly, 91% of perpetrators said they verbally teased their sibling, 72% said that they physically bullied their sibling, and 61% said that they excluded or ignored their sibling. When asked how long the bullying lasted, more than 26% of victims reported several years. Another 7.5% reported that bullying was still going on. More than 30% of perpetrators also said the bullying had lasted several years. Similar to traditional bullying that often takes place in the classroom frequently with the teacher present, sibling bullying often takes place in the presence of parents. Fifty-five percent of victims and 40.4% of perpetrators indicated that their mother, father, or both were present when the bullying occurred.</p>
<p>In reporting sibling bullying victimization to others, youth were more likely to tell their parents (53.8%) than anyone else. Twenty-seven percent told other siblings, and another 10% told someone else, most likely a friend, but no one in our sample told an adult at school. When reporting that they had perpetrated bullying, only 25% told a parent, 22% another sibling, and 10% someone else.</p>
<sec id="section12-0886260512468327">
<title>Victim Versus Perpetrator Accounts</title>
<p>Victim and perpetrator accounts differed in many ways. Because of the interdependence of the siblings’ responses, experimental session served as the unit of analysis. The two participants in each session were treated as levels of a repeated factor. Questionnaire items accompanying stories originally written by perpetrators and responded to by victims yielded several significant main effects of session. In accordance with Hypothesis 3, victims viewed sibling bullying more negatively than perpetrators. Specifically, victims felt that bullying incidents had a greater long-term impact on themselves (<italic>M</italic> = 3.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.35) than perpetrators thought the incidents had (<italic>M</italic> = 1.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.94). Victims (<italic>M</italic> = 2.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.90) also assumed that the incidents had a greater long-term impact on the perpetrators than perpetrators reported (<italic>M</italic> = 1.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.83). Victims (<italic>M</italic> = 4.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.42) felt that perpetrators intended to embarrass them more than perpetrators actually intended to (<italic>M</italic> = 3.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.59). Victims (<italic>M</italic> = 6.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.47) felt that bullying incidents had a greater impact on their self-esteem than perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 5.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.55) thought their behavior had (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05). Victims (<italic>M</italic> = 4.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.31) perceived perpetrators as more aggressive than perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 3.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.51) said they intended to be, but perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 7.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.46) thought that their sibling perceived them as meaner than they (<italic>M</italic> = 5.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.28) actually did perceive them to be. Perpetrators (<italic>M</italic> = 4.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.06) also reported more uncertainty about their motives than victims (<italic>M</italic> = 3.66, <italic>SD</italic> =2.18) perceived them to have (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05).</p>
<p>LIWC analyses of the narratives written by one sibling and responded to by the other also revealed differences in perceptions. Repeated-measures ANOVAs (analysis of variance) with session as the repeated factor were conducted twice, once using victim narratives and the corresponding response by siblings, and the second time using perpetrator narratives and the corresponding response by siblings. Results of these analyses can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512468327">Table 1</xref>. The original narratives describing both victimization and perpetration contained more total words than the sibling responses to these narratives (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The responses to the victimization narratives contained a higher percentage of words conveying positive emotionality than the original narratives (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with a similar pattern approaching significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .09) in the responses to the perpetrator narratives.</p>

<p>More important, we also did linguistic analyses comparing original victim and perpetrator accounts, not involving sibling responses. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512468327">Table 1</xref>, narratives describing a time when the participant bullied his or her sibling contained significantly more words than narratives describing a time when they were bullied. These same narratives also contained a higher percentage of other references (e.g., they, he, she).</p>
<p>A reading of the narratives reinforces these quantitative findings. Although the situations described in the narratives are almost as numerous as the narratives themselves, most of the narratives shared in common strong emotional descriptors such as anger, emotional upset, embarrassment, sadness, and confusion. For example, one victim stated, “I was sitting in a chair and made some suggestion. Afterward I was repeatedly called stupid. A fight broke out and we both ended up injured. I remember being upset about being called stupid and angry once the fight began.” In addition, several of the perpetrator narratives include sentiments of regret.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most of the research and popular attention devoted to bullying has focused on peer bullying, with relatively little attention given to bullying among siblings. The results of the present investigation suggest that this gap in the literature needs to be filled as a large percentage of the respondents admitted to both bullying their sibling (85%) and being bullied by their sibling (78%). Two features about these statistics are particularly noteworthy. First, they far surpass published statistics on the prevalence rates of bullying among peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468327">Olweus &amp; Limber, 2010</xref>). Second, unlike self-reports of traditional bullying where prevalence rates of victimization exceed those of perpetration, in this study prevalence rates of perpetrating sibling bullying exceeded rates of victimization.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the problem of sibling bullying is even more disturbing considering participants’ normative attitudes toward it. Bullying of one’s sibling is not only accepted, but expected. This normalization may contribute to perpetrators minimizing the negative impact they perceive the bullying to have. In the current study, the long-term impact and effect on self-esteem of victims was significantly greater than what perpetrators believed. These differences in views of bullying incidents are consistent with past research on victims and perpetrators’ differing perceptions of bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468327">Kowalski, 2000</xref>) and show that bullying affects victims more than perpetrators think. Perhaps this explains why more people report bullying their siblings than being bullied by their siblings. Because siblings underestimate the effect of their bullying behaviors, they do not mind admitting their behavior. Because bullying is also viewed as a norm in sibling relationships, perpetrators may be even more likely to confess their bullying behavior. Additional support for this was found in the linguistic analyses of the narratives. In accounts of peer bullying, victim narratives are longer than perpetrator narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468327">Kowalski, 2000</xref>). In the current investigation of sibling bullying, however, perpetrator narratives were significantly longer. This highlights again that perpetrators may be more likely than perpetrators of peer victimization to perceive their behavior as normative and also calls attention to the need for additional research on sibling bullying apart from peer bullying.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Although the data from this study add to our body of knowledge by providing us with more detailed profiles of sibling bullying, there were some limitations with the study. First, the retrospective nature of the methodology may lead to some inaccurate memories. In addition, participants answered questions in reference only to the sibling participating with them. Sibling bullying episodes with other siblings could have been more or less intense. Because the sibling partners had to cooperate with each other to schedule a time to participate in the study, it is likely that the siblings in the sibling pairs have a better relationship than those who endured intense sibling bullying.</p>
<p>This study also had a relatively small sample, which precluded us from examining the gender, age, and culture-specific nature of our findings, variables that would be of interest in future research. Examining changes in patterns of bullying behavior across age groups could inform prevention and intervention efforts. If anything, the limitations caused by the narrow range of participants likely underestimated the prevalence of sibling bullying.</p>
<p>Sibling bullying is quite a different phenomenon from traditional peer bullying. Unlike peer bullying, most people involved in sibling bullying both perpetrate and are victims of sibling bullying. Indeed, in the current sample, 72% of the respondents were bully/victims. These sibling bully/victims are different from traditional bully/victims in that they bully the same people who bully them. The long-term effects of this compared to traditional bullying warrant further investigation. We examined self-esteem as a specific marker of the long-term effects of sibling bullying, but additional variables such as depression, anxiety, relationships other than siblings, and so on need examination.</p>
<p>The perceived “normalness” of sibling bullying as a potential deterrent to prevention and intervention efforts, particularly on the part of parents, also deserves additional research attention. Whereas many schools and organizations work to fight peer bullying, an effective intervention for sibling bullying has not been identified.</p>
