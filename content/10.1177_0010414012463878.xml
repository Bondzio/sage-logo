<abstract>
<p>This article tests the linkage between institutional configuration and social trust, highlighting the role of the welfare states in coordinating interests among different labor market actors. This study initially builds a theoretical framework distinguishing training-supplemented welfare regimes from transfer-based welfare regimes. Evidence from descriptive and multivariate analyses of World Values Survey based on 17 advanced industrial democracies supports my argument that public investment in skill provision prevalent in training-supplemented welfare states leads to higher accumulation of social trust, whereas passive social transfers result in lower social trust. Especially, high investment in public skill provision leads to a decreased gap in social trust between employers and low-skilled workers, as well as among different occupational groups. In addition, the negative effect of passive social transfers on trust is greatly ameliorated when it is jointly configured with high active labor market policies. The findings lend credibility to my claim that specific social policies aiming to upgrade citizens’ skill levels provide employees with better prospects for managing life chances (and risks) and therefore building higher social trust.</p>

<p>There has been a plethora of research on the sources and effects of trust on economic, political, and social outcomes at the societal level. The literature on governance and trust, igniting substantial scholarly interest in the importance of trust across diverse social science disciplines, has thoroughly documented the significant role of social trust in building a more effective government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012463878">Putnam, 1993</xref>), a more democratic regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463878">Inglehart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012463878">Paxton, 2002</xref>), a less corrupted regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Uslaner, 2005</xref>), and higher economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012463878">Fukuyama, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012463878">Knack &amp; Keefer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012463878">LaPorta, Lopez-Silanes, Schleifer, &amp; Vishney, 1997</xref>). At the micro level, trust has been known not only as the basic source of social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463878">Coleman, 1988</xref>) but also as the source of efficiency in market transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012463878">Granovetter, 1985</xref>). In short, a higher level of trust among individuals leads to more efficient economic outcomes as well as to better functioning institutions.</p>
<p>Students of trust have increasingly paid more attention to the sources of trust, discovering a diverse range of determinants. The associational social capital approach, despite its unclear causal direction, has argued that civic engagement itself creates trust among participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012463878">Brehm &amp; Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012463878">Kwak, Shah, &amp; Holbert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012463878">Putnam, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012463878">2000</xref>), and that civic engagement in connected associations is more beneficial to building trust than affiliation with isolated associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012463878">Paxton, 2007</xref>). The cultural approach has also emphasized several crucial determinants of trust: the role of parenting in creating optimistic views of life in early childhood at the individual level and the role of Protestant heritages and ethnic homogeneity at the societal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012463878">Delhey &amp; Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463878">Inglehart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012463878">Putnam, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012463878">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). In these traditions, declining social trust may be primarily attributable to the dwindling roles of traditional families, shrinking church attendance or, more broadly, declining civic engagement, and increasing ethnic fragmentation at societal level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012463878">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the institutional approach has contended that trust is promoted by the quality of institutional performances or institutional arrangements featured by law, government policies, and certified professional associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012463878">Rothstein, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012463878">2002</xref>). This approach argues that when public institutions are effectively functioning as a “fair rule-setter or rule-imposer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012463878">Cook, Hardin, &amp; Levi, 2005</xref>), individuals will be assured that other actors are not likely to be engaged in opportunistic behaviors. This assurance will eventually lead to the creation of the societal norm that general others are trustworthy. In particular, the cross-national study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein and Uslaner (2005)</xref> makes the important point that universal social policy design plays a decisive role in generating this general norm of trust, although it did not employ any measures for social policies, simply using income equality as a proxy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a potentially important source for explaining trust in a society—the configuration of social policies that coordinates the balance of power in fundamentally unequal employment relationships—has been neglected by most researchers. With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012463878">Kumlin and Rothstein’s (2005)</xref> study focusing on the role of social policies in explaining social trust, few studies have accounted for the sources of “trust” in a society in terms of employer–employee relationships and relevant social and labor market policies. Although the institutional approach has focused on the role of state institutions as a “fair rule-setter or rule-imposer” in substituting for cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012463878">Cook et al., 2005</xref>), its emphasis has been limited to finding an alternative path—the role of institutions—that guarantees social cooperation. The institutional approach has rarely attempted to explore the ways in which state institutions affect, transform, and create the fundamental settings of “risk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012463878">Coleman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012463878">Tilly, 2005</xref>) among social actors, especially between employers and employees through their policy measures.</p>
<p>Based on previous literature on comparative welfare states, this study identifies and tests the effects of social and labor market policies across different welfare regimes on social trust. In the theory section, I attempt to describe the effects of two types of welfare states, transfer centered and training supplemented, on variations in trust among different social classes. In this project, I develop four hypotheses that address the impacts of divergent configurations of traditional passive social transfers and active labor market policies (ALMP) on individual-level social trust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012463878">2</xref></sup> The remaining sections test the proposed hypotheses using multilevel data consisting of country-level predictors and individual characteristics from four waves of the World Values Survey on 17 advanced industrial democracies.</p>

<title>Theoretical Discussions</title>
<p>Scholars of social dilemmas typically expect that a rational actor will be tempted not to contribute her or his resources in public goods, while still receiving some benefits from the structure. Social transfer programs in modern welfare states as a type of public goods are inherently vulnerable to this free-riding problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012463878">Olson, 1965</xref>) because an actor’s reward from social welfare system is not necessarily contingent on her or his contribution to the system. For instance, it is theoretically possible in a transfer-based social welfare system for an actor to decide not to work but instead to benefit from social assistance programs, as long as other actors hold strong “insurance motives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012463878">Moene &amp; Wallerstein, 2001</xref>) to manage future risks.</p>
<p>Social welfare agencies typically employ rigorous income and means-tested programs to prevent potential abuses of social welfare programs by free riders, but as long as free riders determine to maintain their incomes below poverty threshold, it is still possible for them to exploit the welfare system. Although the vast majority of welfare recipients do not intentionally stay under the threshold, the features of modern transfer-based welfare systems may lead upper- and middle-class contributors to perceive the recipients as free riders.</p>
<p>In transfer-centered welfare states, social policies are likely to divide citizens into two categories: “bad welfare dependents” and “good independent citizens.” Unskilled redundant workers are typically reemployed in “bad jobs” at low wages with weak worker protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012463878">Baumol, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012463878">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>) rather than being given opportunities for training. In most liberal and some conservative European countries, social policies are typically designed to target this population at the bottom of the social strata, which suffers from repeated cycles of unemployment and reemployment at low wage jobs. The middle and upper classes composed of skilled workers are likely to treat social welfare programs merely as philanthropic contributions to the poor, rather than as a common pool of social safety nets that may benefit themselves in bad times. In these countries, skills training is more likely to occur within firms between employers and skilled workers, as strongly unionized skilled workers have traditionally chosen employers as their skills training partners in exchange for strong employment protection and earning-related social insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012463878">Estevez-Abe, Iversen, &amp; Soskice, 2001</xref>), excluding unskilled workers from the firm- or industry-level skill investment and employment protection. Welfare recipients in these countries suffer from social stigmatization and psychological abuse by welfare institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012463878">Kumlin &amp; Rothstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012463878">Soss, 1999</xref>) and media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012463878">Gilens, 1999</xref>) that treat recipients as free riders. In this policy design, higher spending on social policies, especially social transfers primarily consisting of social service and assistance programs accompanied by means or income tests, is more likely to lead to lower trust among contributors and beneficiaries.</p>
<list id="list1-0010414012463878" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Higher (targeted) government spending on passive social security transfers will lead to a lower level of social trust at the individual level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012463878">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In Nordic social democratic countries and some Continental social corporatist countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, generous social transfers are combined with state-funded public job training programs. ALMP, in combination with conventional passive social transfers, effectively resolves both free-riding problems and distrust from contributors not only by imposing contingency criteria<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012463878">4</xref></sup> but also by providing contributors with the strong incentives to participate and remain in the system.</p>
<p>The structure of ALMP pulls different groups of labor market actors together around skill formation and upgrading, thereby providing workers with future employment opportunities and employers with better qualified workers. Although traditional insurance or assistance-based social transfers merely protect workers from the risk of job and income losses by supplementing income, ALMP plays a role of skill and employment insurance. Especially, in this system, unskilled workers (also skilled workers to a lesser degree) and (some) employers have a strong interest in making unemployed (potential free riders) eventually get jobs with meaningful training opportunities coupled to income supplements because the effectiveness and generosity of the current program directly determine their expected return (future jobs and income during training for unskilled workers, and supply of future skilled workers for some employers) from their current investment. The unemployed will also have a strong incentive to be reemployed because new training opportunities give them better jobs, better pay, and better retirement packages (which are earning and employment related) than those they could get without training.</p>
<p>In particular, unskilled workers, who are more vulnerable to future unemployment and income loss than skilled workers, have strong incentives to monitor commitment and make sure that the unemployed obtain the valuable skills that are necessary for reemployment by employers. Unskilled workers, therefore, using their organizational power, will attempt to lobby the government to develop institutional monitoring mechanisms by which unskilled workers receive up-to-date job training and income transfers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012463878">Table 1</xref> summarizes the logics of two types of welfare state structures. Transfer-based welfare states are vulnerable to free-riding behaviors and do not have effective monitoring mechanisms. On the other hand, training-supplemented welfare states have not only the incentive mechanisms within each structure to discourage free-riding behaviors in the long term but also structural or institutional mechanisms to monitor other actors’ commitments and participations. I hypothesize that the latter structures will create higher levels of social trust and cooperation than the former ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012463878">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>To abbreviate, the structure of training-based welfare states provide different groups of labor market actors with incentives to take part in skill formation and upgrading, thereby providing workers with future employment opportunities (along with an optimistic prospect of one’s life trajectory and risk management)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012463878">6</xref></sup> and employers with better qualified workers. Although traditional transfer-based social transfers merely protect workers from the risk of job and income losses by supplementing income, ALMP plays a role of skill and employment insurance.This institutional element will encourage all labor market actors to develop higher level of social trust. In these countries, the degree of the recognition of mutual interests among social actors is high, as both employers and employees tolerate high taxation in exchange for high investment in enhancing “labor force qualification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012463878">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2001</xref>). After all, these supply-side social and labor market policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012463878">Boix, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012463878">Garrett, 1998</xref>) uniquely focusing on the active measures that encourage workers to reenter the labor markets with updated skills will be associated with not only employers’ and employees’ higher trust but also closer trust among different social classes (or occupational groups). These discussions lead to the following hypotheses.</p>
<list id="list2-0010414012463878" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: High ALMP spending at the country level will be associated with a high level of social trust at the individual level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3-1</italic>: In countries with lower ALMP spending, most occupational and industrial actors will show lower trust levels than employers. Hypothesis 3-2: However, as ALMP increases and leads different class actors to take part in skill formation and upgrading, differences in social trust between employers and employees (especially low-skilled workers) will be significantly reduced.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another important feature of ALMP components in training-centered welfare states is that ALMP greatly moderates the negative effect of passive social transfers on trust. Although assistance-oriented or means-testing passive social transfers create skepticism, suspicion, and discontent among contributors, while generating humiliation among beneficiaries, generous social transfers coupled with active job training programs may contribute to generating social trust rather than encroaching on it. Under universal entitlements, as in Nordic social democratic countries, all citizens have access to social insurance and assistance programs as part of basic security programs without strict means or income testing as long as they are exposed to risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012463878">Korpi &amp; Palme, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Uslaner, 2005</xref>). However, this generosity in social protection is also coupled with ALMP in these countries. An unemployed person is not eligible for unemployment compensation, unless the recipient agrees to participate in job training programs. The coordination between the unemployment insurance system and ALMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012463878">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 1993</xref>) enables contributing citizens to be less concerned about free riders’ abuse of the social safety net, while beneficiary citizens maintain their dignity from current adversities and their optimism regarding future well-being. From the employers’ side, comprehensive and generous, but active, skill upgrade programs allow them to adjust to rapidly changing market demands and technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012463878">Martin &amp; Swank, 2004</xref>), with more flexible management of labor force. In sum, passive measures of social transfers do not necessarily have detrimental effects on social trust but may enhance citizens’ trust of general others when they are effectively coupled with active measures of social policies.</p>

<title>Data and Measures</title>
<sec id="section3-0010414012463878">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable of this study is social trust at the individual level. The measure of social trust is based on a question item included in all four waves of World Values Survey (WVS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012463878">European Values Study Group &amp; World Values Survey Association, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012463878">2004</xref>): “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The response categories are dichotomous: (1) <italic>most people can be trusted</italic> or (2) <italic>one can’t be too careful (has to be very careful)</italic>. One potential measurement issue is that this WVS question might not capture “trust” but merely measure “skepticism,” “cynicism,” or more broadly “trustworthiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012463878">Cook et al., 2005</xref>). However, general others’ trustworthiness will be highly correlated with an individual’s trust of general others because other normal citizens’ “trustworthiness” provides an individual with positive information for trusting decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010414012463878">
<title>Independent Variables: Individual-Level Predictors</title>
<p>At the individual level, I introduce respondents’ household income, gender, age, religion, labor market status, and occupations and industries as a baseline model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414012463878">Appendix A</xref> for descriptive statistics for the main variables).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012463878">7</xref></sup> Two religion variables, Protestants and other or no religion, are introduced, with Catholics as the omitted category. Protestantism has been shown to be the best promoter of trust by generating civic efficacy and voluntarism embedded in its independent churches, whereas Catholicism has been the main cause of lack of trust, which can be attributed to the hierarchical culture of the Roman Catholic Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012463878">Delhey &amp; Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463878">Inglehart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012463878">Putnam, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012463878">Uslaner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Seven occupation and industry variables are also introduced to test the first hypothesis that predicts the effects of skill-based occupational positions on social trust: they are professionals, white-collar office workers, skilled manual workers, unskilled manual workers, armed forces, and agricultural workers. Managers is omitted as the reference category. Sex and age are included as baseline controls. Part-time employed, unemployed, labor market outsiders, and self-employed are included as dichotomous variables, with full-time employed as the reference category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0010414012463878">
<title>Independent Variables: Country-Level Predictors</title>
<p>The training-supplemented welfare regime efforts will be measured by ALMP spending, which reflects the degree to which a society is concerned about increasing citizens’ employment potentials by upgrading their skill levels, so that it becomes easier for them to reenter the labor market after unemployment or a relatively long-term recess from previous employment. They are measured as total expenditures on ALMP as a percentage of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012463878">OECD, various years-b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012463878">8</xref></sup> The transfer-based welfare regime efforts are initially measured by government social security transfers (as a percentage of GDP), which comprise four major categories: cash benefits for sickness, old age and survivors, family allowances, and social assistance grants and welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012463878">OECD, various years-a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012463878">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Income inequality is introduced as one of the context-level controls. Researchers focusing on market-based stratification have highlighted unequal distribution of income as a critical factor that generates wide variations in social trust across different societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Stolle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Uslaner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012463878">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). Gini is used for a measure of income inequality in this study. The data are drawn from World Income Inequality Database V 2.0a (United Nations University–World Institute for Development Economics Research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012463878">[UNU/WIDER], 2005</xref>). The data set has information on measurement errors because of different recipient units, the effects of taxation, and different definitions of income. To eliminate potential heterogeneity resulting from different definitions of income sources, only the Gini based on <italic>household disposable income</italic> is used in this study. In addition, only data with a quality rating of 1, except for Japan (rating of 2), are used for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012463878">UNU/WIDER, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>International labor mobility is expected to increase the heterogeneity of civil society. Extreme heterogeneity among immigrants’ ethnic, racial, and religious origins and compositions tends to crosscut and weaken both political partisanship and community-level social groupings. This will lead key voluntary associational activities to develop along racial/ethnic lines, thereby weakening solidarity and cooperation among citizens. International labor mobility, therefore, is expected to affect generalized trust negatively. International migration is measured as net migration rate, which is indirectly calculated from the data on population, population increase rate, and crude birth and death rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463878">OECD, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414012463878">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>I employ a hierarchical (multilevel) logistic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012463878">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). In this model, I assume that citizens in the same geographical unit (country) will be more similar to each other in terms of their attitudes (social trust). The following random intercept model for binary outcomes employs multiple equations for two levels, in which the Level 2 equation has its own error term (u<sub>0j</sub>).</p>

<p>Panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012463878">Figure 1</xref> display the distinctive cross-national and over-time trends of social trust in three different worlds of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012463878">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>). Residual welfare states (Panel 1-1) show very distinctive trajectories of over-time trends of social trust. All four residual welfare states enjoyed relatively high levels of social trust until the early 90s, ranging from 42% in the United Kingdom (in 1981 and 1990) to 51% in Canada (1990), 49% in the United States (1990), and 47% in Australia (1981). And then, all residual countries suffered dramatic declines throughout the 1990s. The degree of decline is astonishingly deep: the United Kingdom lost 35% of trusters in 10 years (from 42.4% to 27.7%); Canada and the United States went through a similar pattern in the 1990s.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0010414012463878-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>However, in Nordic universal countries (Panel 1-2), social trust dramatically increased for two decades, with the exception of Sweden in the early 1990s, which suffered a substantial slowdown of its economy. In Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, overall levels of social trust remained around 50% in the early 1980s, which is not different from those of residual countries, but in the late 1990s, except for Finland, the other three universal countries enjoyed about 65% of their population generally trusting others. The Netherlands, the most remarkable case even among universal countries, boosted its trust level from 39% in 1981 to 59% in 1999.</p>
<p>In contrast to impressive over-time increases in trust in universal countries and striking decreases in residual countries, social insurance countries (Panel 1-3) experienced neither significant gain nor significant decline, with the exception of Germany. Trust levels in most Continental European countries such as France, Belgium, Austria, and Italy stayed low throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Only Germany boosted its trust level from 27% to 39% up through the mid-1990s, after unification, with a subsequent slight decline (36% in 1999).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012463878">Table 2</xref> presents descriptive statistics of social trust, ALMP, and passive social transfers for three types of welfare regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012463878">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>). Regarding between-unit variations, universal countries’ ALMP spending is higher than that of the other two types of countries, and also has grown faster: ALMP in universal countries in the 1990s was almost twice as big as that in Continental social insurance countries and 4 times bigger than that of liberal residual countries. Passive social transfer spending in universal countries was also incomparably high. Continental social insurance countries show fairly high levels of passive social transfers, and liberal countries spend least among three welfare regime types.</p>

<p>Over-time trajectories of social trust, ALMP, and passive social transfers in three types of welfare capitalism can be summarized as follows: (a) contrasting trends between two types in the 1990s, with dramatic declines in residual countries and continuous upward moves in Nordic universal and some Continental social insurance countries; (b) stagnant low trust in Continental social insurance countries; (c) high levels of ALMP matched with high levels of social trust across countries when universal countries are compared with the other two types; (d) increases in ALMP over time that may be associated with increases in social trust over time; and finally (e) all countries with increased spending on passive social transfers, with the exceptions of the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The following multilevel analyses test whether the main theoretical model highlighting the role of training-based welfare regime accounts for some of these variations in individual-level trust, controlling for both country-level predictors and individual-level characteristics.</p>

Age has a negative effect on social trust. Those employed part-time show higher trust than those employed full-time, but labor market outsiders such as housewives, students, and the disabled have lower trust than full-time insiders. The unemployed also show much lower trust than those employed full-time, and this coefficient is highly significant. Protestants are more likely to trust others than are Catholics. Married people have a higher level of trust than the unmarried.</p>

<p>Of importance, large occupation and industry categories are highly significant. Professionals with the highest skill levels and job security show higher social trust compared to managers. Skilled manual workers and agricultural workers show significantly lower trust than mangers. Unskilled manual workers show the biggest difference in trust from that of employers, and the negative logit coefficient (–0.386) is highly significant (<italic>t</italic> = 8.49). This implies that, for unskilled workers, the odds of being a truster (exp<sup>-0.386</sup>) are decreased by a factor of 0.68 (32%) with all other variables held constant. These results support the key argument of this study that the power relationship between employers and employees is determined by the quantity of skill assets possessed by employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012463878">Wright, 1997</xref>), and unskilled workers, because of their vulnerability to potential abuse, manipulation, and exploitation by employers, are less likely to trust others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414012463878">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Model 1 also tests the first hypothesis that passive social transfers will be negatively associated with social trust. Two variables, income inequality and international migration, are introduced as the baseline controls (at country level). Both variables are correctly signed and statistically significant. The negative and significant coefficient of passive social transfer variable suggests that social spending may affect social trust in a negative way. The results give credence to my theoretical conjecture that both contributors’ lingering concerns about free riding and recipients’ humiliation from means tests and negative portrayal by media could be harmful to social trust. However, the small coefficient also suggests that it would be difficult to assert that greater passive social transfers are critically detrimental to social trust. The relationship might contain a contrasting trend that needs to be teased out by a separate mechanism.</p>
<p>In Model 2, I introduce ALMP spending with the two same baseline control variables. The effect of ALMP is prominent. The results support the second hypothesis, which predicts that country-level spending on skills training system will be positively associated with individual-level trust. Both the size of coefficient and its level of statistical significance are substantially large. This result implies that a society’s efforts to invest in enhancing the unemployed and labor market outsiders’ reemployment potential plays a critical role in enhancing citizens’ trust.</p>
<p>Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012463878">Table 3</xref> explores whose trust level is boosted with increasing public investment on skills by analyzing the cross-level interaction effects between occupation and industry indicator variables and ALMP. The significant interaction terms between unskilled and ALMP and between agricultural workers and ALMP support the third hypothesis of this study, which predicts that, in countries with strong ALMP programs, differences in social trust between employers and low-skilled workers will be significantly diminished. In addition, not only the unskilled but also professionals and white-collar office workers show increasingly higher levels of trust in countries with higher ALMP spending.</p>
<p>These results are confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012463878">Figure 2</xref>, which illustrates the predictive probabilities for social trust by different occupational and industry categories. At the lowest level of ALMP, only professionals have higher probabilities of being trusters than employers, whereas manual unskilled, skilled, and agricultural workers have significantly lower chances of being trusters than employers. However, as ALMP increases, employers’ probability of being trusters moderately increases, whereas professional, white-collar, agricultural, and unskilled manual workers’ probabilities of being trusters sharply increase, if to different degrees. As a result, at the highest level of ALMP, professional, white-collar, and agricultural workers’ chances of being trusters are significantly higher than employers’, whereas unskilled workers’ chances have almost caught up with employers’. Especially at the highest level of ALMP, the differences in predicted probabilities among all occupational categories are smaller than those at the lowest level of ALMP. These findings support the central argument of this study (Hypothesis 3) that ALMP encourages different labor market and class actors, especially employees, to develop trust in others. Overall, higher ALMP spending not only increases individuals’ overall chance of being trusters but also decreases differences in the chance of being trusters between employers and employees.</p>

<p>Model 4 tests the fourth hypothesis that the negative effects of passive social transfers on social trust will be conditional on the role of ALMP. As expected, the interaction term is positive and highly significant. The finding supports my claim that ALMP prevents high passive social transfers from invoking hostility and suspicion among labor market actors, and further enables contributing citizens to be less concerned about free riders’ abuse of the social safety net, while beneficiary citizens maintain their dignity from current adversities. This result also convincingly accounts for the difference in trust level between Nordic social democratic countries and the rest of the welfare states. The coexistence of high level of passive social transfers and high social trust in the universal model of welfare states may be attributable to the effective combination of income supplement and skills training/job assistance programs. In contrast to the Nordic model, traditionally high levels of generous transfers in Continental Europe and increasing passive transfers in liberal countries without the ALMP components may account for persistent low trust (Continental Europe) or declining trust (liberal countries).</p>
<p>In Model 5, I introduce all variables used in the previous models with additional control variables: GDP per capita (log), unemployment rate, and net union density. The effect of GDP per capita on trust is positive and statistically significant, as expected. The unexpected positive effect of unemployment rate on trust may be attributable to the recent economic downturn in social democratic countries, in which universal welfare systems have helped citizens maintain the high levels of social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Uslaner, 2005</xref>). In this full model, the interaction terms between ALMP and industry and occupation indicator variables are robust, and the interaction term between ALMP and passive social transfer is still highly significant at the alpha = .01 level. Overall, these findings support my claim that an active skills training regime enables employees in more vulnerable positions in the labor market to gain optimistic views of their life chances and thus to eventually build higher levels of social trust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414012463878">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article attempted to advance our understanding of the source of trust in two aspects, first, by building a unified theoretical framework that incorporates several different sources of literature and, second, by providing strong empirical evidence based on cross-national multilevel data. The study contended that transfer-based welfare states and training-supplemented welfare states have developed different incentive mechanisms for training and social welfare, thereby generating different prospects for managing lifetime risks in the labor market. Specifically, the article highlighted the role of active job training programs in providing different labor market actors with incentives to participate and remain in the public skill provision program, thereby shaping a new constellation of interests and trust among labor market actors.</p>
<p>This article offers sufficient empirical support for the proposed model of the linkage between social policies and trust. To summarize the key findings, first, the evidence offers convincing support for my claim that employees lacking skills are less likely to trust others, compared to employers, because of their vulnerable positions in the labor market and workplace. However, the results also show that the unique role of ALMP may encourage different labor market and class actors to build higher levels of social trust. Furthermore, the evidence shows that unskilled workers, who boost their trust levels in countries with higher ALMP, may be the biggest beneficiaries of this skills upgrade system. The findings demonstrate that in societies such as the Nordic social democratic countries (and the Netherlands), where unskilled workers have prospects for higher skill qualification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012463878">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2001</xref>) and better employment opportunities through state-sponsored investment in training, they are more likely to trust general others. The theoretical framework and empirical findings of this study suggest that ALMP may play a role in generating social trust in addition to or as a part of “universal welfare-state institutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012463878">Kumlin &amp; Rothstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463878">Rothstein &amp; Uslaner, 2005</xref>). In other words, the combination of high ALMP and high passive social transfers in universal countries suggests that ALMP may serve as an institutional component that leads all labor market actors to perceive universal welfare institutions as a common resource pool for risk management. As ALMP weakens incentives for free riding that are inherent in generous welfare states, while providing labor market outsiders with incentives for reentering the labor market, it should be treated as an essential element that allows “universal welfare state institutions” to generate a high level of social trust on a long-term basis. Overall, the combination of appropriate skills training and generous social transfers may provide institutional bases for cooperation and trust among citizens when they have to maintain their skills and income under increasingly hostile and unstable economic environments.</p>
<p>The successful social democratic model of skill supply regime (or human capital formation regime; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012463878">Boix, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012463878">Garrett, 1998</xref>) and its policy structure also have strong practical implications for other countries trying to apply ALMP to their labor markets. The recently celebrated Dutch case provides appropriate model strategies for achieving both social solidarity and efficiency, neither intensifying nor reinforcing existing social divisions. The Dutch have achieved a level of generalized trust corresponding to those of social democratic countries for the past two decades, despite the Netherlands’ heterogeneous religious composition and increasing ethnic diversity. They cut passive social transfers almost in half for those two decades (from 25.5% to 13.9% of GDP), while increasing spending on other active labor market measures that help labor market outsiders get back to work. In conjunction with ALMP, the Dutch have dramatically boosted their total employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012463878">Kenworthy, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the Dutch case suggests that it is not impossible to meet the increasing needs of the disadvantaged in the labor market, the unemployed, and the unskilled for better economic opportunities, while also not discouraging the advantaged (employers and skilled workers) from seeking their own interests.</p>
<p>In the United States, both federal and local state governments have attempted to import some components of ALMP through existing social welfare programs and by creating new job training programs, but their efforts were limited and their performances were unsuccessful. TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) has reinforced only “monitoring devices” by imposing stricter eligibility and limitation of duration, while failing to providing poor single mothers with job training opportunities.</p>
<p>It is true that European welfare states with corporatist traditions have quite different political and institutional histories such as strong labor unions, strong left-wing parties, and coordinated wage bargaining institutions, all of which have been absent in the United States. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect that the United States will eventually embrace this universal component of skills training programs as a part of its welfare system.</p>
<p>However, the United States indeed has some job training programs such as the Workforce Investment Act, although it is limited to a certain segment of the population—the unemployed urban youth—in its scale and scope and has failed to provide meaningful skills upgrades to them. The lack of employer involvement in public skill investment has led to their apathy toward existing job training programs and to the further ineffective performance of these programs in labor market.</p>
<p>Finally, this study suggests that employers’ interest in public training program is critical in making all labor market actors participate in and benefit from the programs in the long term. The study also suggests that employers themselves may actively develop their demands and interests around public provision of skills and income supplements. The success of job training programs hinges on whether the program designers can develop incentive mechanisms that allow employers to be engaged in the functioning and development of specific training contents and manuals. In addition, the success of ALMP-type programs will also rely on their capacity to embrace diverse ethnic groups and broad class categories. If they are disproportionally targeted to a specific minority ethnic/racial group and the bottom of the social stratum, it might be stigmatized and, in a worst-case scenario, might contribute to a decline in social trust.</p>
<p>To summarize, the overall findings of this study suggest that engineering social trust is a matter of configuring the institutional means by which citizens in different labor market positions and occupational and industrial categories are guaranteed participation in market opportunities, and by which they have long-term prospects to manage their life chances.</p>

<p>Other research utilizing individual-level survey data has also reported that the rich, the educated, the employed, professionals, and members of ethnic majorities are more likely to trust others than are the poor, the less educated, the unemployed, the unskilled, and members of ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012463878">Alesina &amp; La Ferrara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012463878">Paxton, 2007</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Active labor market policies (ALMP) are the government-run labor market programs that help unemployed workers regain access to employment. They include job information and placement services, subsidies to employers, and job training. These policies aim to lower structural unemployment by enhancing not only the efficiency of the matching process but also jobseekers’ skill levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012463878">Carcillo &amp; Grubb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012463878">OECD, 1993</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>This first hypothesis differs from the conventional belief that social spending and social trust are positively associated with each other (with reciprocal causal directions). In reality, the positive linkage between the size of welfare state and social trust is observable only in Nordic social democratic countries. Continental social insurance countries have fairly high levels of passive social transfers corresponding to those of their Nordic counterparts, if not actually higher than them, but they have maintained the lowest social trust for decades. In addition, liberal residual countries have increased their passive social transfers for the past two decades, but they have witnessed that the levels of their social trust are declining, almost converging with those of Continental social insurance countries (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012463878">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012463878">Table 2</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>For instance, in social democratic countries, passive unemployment compensation is conditional on the recipient’s participation in job training programs, preventing the long-term unemployed from abusing generous but passive unemployment benefits.</p></fn>

<p>Some social psychology literature argues that sanctioning and monitoring build greater assurance, which leads to higher trust among members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012463878">Yamagishi, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012463878">1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012463878">Yamagishi, Cook, &amp; Watabe, 1998</xref>), whereas others contend that monitoring and sanctioning undermine trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012463878">Fehr &amp; Rockenbach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012463878">Mulder, van Dijk, De Cremer, &amp; Wilke, 2006</xref>). My point is that a training-supplemented regime has “rewarding incentives” through skills training as well as “monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms.” Therefore, I expect that, in training-supplemented welfare states, the effects of incentive mechanisms of ALMP may lead sanctioning to either play a positive role in building trust or at least outweigh the (arguably negative) effects of sanctioning on trust among labor market actors.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0010414012463878">
<label>6.</label>
<p>I owe this point to a reviewer who pointed out that ALMP may increase trust by creating “optimism” and “sense of control of one’s life.”</p></fn>

<p>One of the most prominent determinants of individual-level social trust, education, is not used in the main results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012463878">Table 3</xref> because of extremely high levels of missing data (nearly 40%) for the education variable. However, I conducted the multiple imputations (MI) procedure for missingness in the education variable using the income, labor market status, and occupation variables and analyzed the imputed data using the “mi estimate logit” procedure in Stata 11, with country dummy variables (as multilevel logit model is not available for the “mi estimate” procedure). The results are largely identical to those reported in the text, suggesting that the main findings are not susceptible to the inclusion or exclusion of the education variable.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0010414012463878">
<label>8.</label>
<p>One might contend that social trust might have a reverse causal effect on ALMP. Given that neocorporatist institutions were built on a high level of trust among labor, business, and the state, ALMP might have been implemented based on a high level of trust, too. I propose two reasons why an endogeneity issue is not a serious concern for the ALMP–trust linkage. First, historically, ALMP was devised by social democrat technocrats and evolved into a main policy tool to combat unemployment beginning in the 1960s in Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012463878">OECD, 1993</xref>). In other words, it had been created and implemented by the social democratic policy makers before the Nordic countries started boosting their social trust during the 1980s and 1990s. At least until the early 1980s, trust levels in social democratic countries were not significantly higher than those in liberal countries and conservative countries. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that preexisting high trust allowed the social democrat policy makers to implement ALMP before the 1980s. Second, technically, an IV (instrumental variable) approach in the context of 2SLS (two-stage least square) using panel data aggregated at the country level (<italic>N</italic> = 52) suggests that the instrument (cumulative left party incumbency) has expected positive and significant effects on trust (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414012463878">Appendix B</xref>). Hausman endogeneity test reports that there is no systematic difference between the original analysis based on OLS–FEM (fixed effects model) and 2SLS-FEM (with 16 dummy variables).</p></fn>

<p>I also created and tested a modified measure that subtracts old age pension component from the original social security transfers. The results were largely identical.</p></fn>

<p>To measure racial/ethnic heterogeneity, I also tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012463878">Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, and Wacziarg’s (2003)</xref> ethnic fractionalization score (time invariant), but found no statistically meaningful result. I also built and tested my own ethic fragmentation score based on the World Values Survey that varies over time, in contrast to Alesina et al.’s. The results were not different from the ones reported in the text. I do not use the latter score because of the significant sample reduction.</p></fn>

<p>Employing a two-level model, however, is not the most ideal specification for the (potentially three-level) data structure of this study, as individuals are nested within multiple waves of each country (17 countries have unbalanced two to four waves, comprising 42 units at the country level, whereas each wave has approximately 1,000 to 2,000 individual-level respondents). However, I decided not to use a three-level model in this study because two to four waves for each country are too few to form a separate level. To deal with unspecified wave-level variations, I include three indicator variables for four waves in the Level 2 equation, with the first wave (1981) being the reference category (the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012463878">Table 3</xref>). In addition, I have also tested interaction terms between a year trend variable and all individual- or country-level variables. As these interaction terms did not change the effects of the main independent variables significantly, I do not include them in the models reported in the text.</p></fn>

<p>Introducing the household income variable causes a significant sample reduction because of missing data (8,085, i.e., 49,041 – 40,956). There is little significant difference between the two results.</p></fn>

<p>Unskilled workers will be vulnerable to employers’ exploitation because both parties are aware that unskilled workers are easily replaceable depending on employers’ needs and would have a hard time finding new jobs if laid off. Therefore, unskilled workers, because of their weak bargaining positions in labor markets, will accept unfair treatment in their working conditions and wage levels, and employers will make the most of unskilled workers’ weak positions. As a result, unskilled workers are less likely to develop trusting relationships with their employers and others in general.</p></fn>

<p>I also conducted diagnostic tests to detect influential outliers in Model 6. As this study primarily investigates the effects of ALMP on trust, I employ DFBETA, which detects a single case’s influence on a specific independent variable (ALMP). Based on regression results from the fixed effects models (Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0010414012463878">Appendix Table B2</xref>) using aggregated panel data at the country level (<italic>N</italic> = 52), we found three influential observations, Denmark 1981, the Netherlands 1981, and Sweden 1981 (DFBETA &gt; .277). Then, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012463878">Van der Meer, Te Grotenhuis, and Pelzer’s (2006)</xref> recommendation, we introduced an indicator (dummy) variable to control for the (potentially influential) effects of these three observations on the estimate of the key variable, ALMP, and other covariates. The results are reported in Model 6, which shows that controlling for the influence of these three observations (at Level 2) does not alter any substantial findings.</p></fn>
