<abstract>
<p>School-level performance on standardized reading comprehension was obtained for 259 public schools in a South Florida district with 270,000 children. Eleven percent of the students were English Language Learners (ELLs), and another 20% were English proficient (EP) and former ELLs, for a total of 31% or about 87,000 ELL students. Thirty-eight percent of all children, or about 100,000, qualified for free or reduced lunch (FRL) because of low family income. This study conducts a school-level analysis where SES markers are as available (and reliable) in both poor and relatively rich schools. Socioeconomic status included the percentage of children in the school with FRL, the average family income, and the average cost of the homes in the neighborhood of the school. Poverty is particularly important to define in a complex way in South Florida because bilingual status interacts with it to a substantial degree. Six unit-weighted composite variables including poverty, bilingualism, ethnicity, child risk behaviors, school resources, and teacher resources were created from 22 measured school-level variables. Schools identified as <italic>resilient</italic> are important because they have higher reading scores <italic>and</italic> higher poverty levels than other schools. Other notable characteristics of these resilient schools are that they obtain more state money per pupil, have less crime, and have a better student to teacher ratio.</p>

<p>Schools and teachers are increasingly held accountable for children’s academic skills, and yet because of the complex interrelations between variables, the root causes of both child-level and school-level differences are not always clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408878">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408878">Harwell &amp; LeBeau, 2010</xref>). The purpose of this research is to determine the unique contributions of poverty, bilingualism, ethnicity, teacher and school resources, and child risk behaviors to aggregated school-level performance scores in standardized reading comprehension in Grades 3 through 10 in a large public school system in South Florida. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408878">Harwell and LeBeau (2010)</xref> point out that free and reduced lunch (FRL) status was originally designed as a measure of nutrition, not SES per se, although composites of socioeconomic status (SES) using FRL and other measures have been developed. Correlates of skill, such as economic resources and heritage language, are especially intertwined in South Florida. This study conducts a school-level analysis where SES markers are as available (and reliable) in both poor and relatively rich schools. Socioeconomic status included the percentage of children in the school receiving FRL, average family income, and the average cost of the homes in the neighborhood of the school.</p>
<p>In South Florida, specifically the Broward School District studied in the present research, low-SES schools have a disproportionate number of children who are currently in English language instruction (CURRENT-ELL) in elementary schools. SES has traditionally been defined as the percentage of children receiving FRL at the <italic>school level</italic> and a composite of parent educational attainment and occupational status at the <italic>child level</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211408878">Hecht &amp; Greenfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211408878">Hogan, 1972</xref>). Other regions of North America have similar interactions between poverty and CURRENT-ELL status. For example, in southern California, three times as many children in low-SES schools are nonnative speakers of Standard English as compared to those in high-SES schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211408878">Warschauer, 2003</xref>). The present study clarifies research on nonnative speaker status and poverty by comparing CURRENT-ELL status separate from former English Language Learners (ELLs) and monolinguals. In doing so, the contributions of social deficits, like poverty, can be separated from language differences, like CURRENT-ELL status.</p>
<p>Without question, an environment of poverty remains one of the most substantial risk factors to school performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408878">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211408878">Evans &amp; Kantrowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408878">Harwell &amp; LeBeau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211408878">White, 1982</xref>). Students in Florida are especially vulnerable, as familial low SES is exacerbated by low state funding. Florida ranks 50th among the U.S. states in per capita student expenditures for education. As a group, children from lower SES backgrounds are more likely to have difficulty in developing academic skills when compared to children from higher SES backgrounds, especially during the elementary school years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211408878">Hecht, Burgess, Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211408878">Hecht &amp; Greenfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211408878">Hogan, 1972</xref>). In fact, because ELL children are often poor, low SES is a more important predictor of literacy for them then for their monolingual peers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211408878">Ransdell and Wengelin (2003)</xref> have found that ELL fourth graders in South Florida were reliably weaker in English vocabulary, and of lower SES relative to their monolingual classmates, but similar in measures of literacy such as English writing quality and reading comprehension. Sixty-seven percent of the variance in ELL children’s writing quality was accounted for solely by SES and grammar awareness. However, no significant variance was attributed to SES in the monolingual children’s writing quality, even though SES was widely distributed in both groups. Furthermore, ELL status alone did not account for variance in English writing quality when many other variables were taken into account. Despite a high percentage of ELL children living in relatively impoverished circumstances, these children were as able as their monolingual peers to create high-quality English writing.</p>
<p>Broward School District schools are facing a series of policy changes related to school demographics and academic accountability. At the same time, the ELL population in the Broward School District, as in other parts of America, is on the rise. This is especially apparent in parts of the country where Spanish- and Haitian Creole-speaking families are likely to emigrate, such as Florida, Texas, New York, and California. Recent natural disasters like the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010 make the emigration rates of ELL students even higher. In South Florida, the number of ELL students in the Broward School District continues to increase at a rapid rate. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 17.3% of the population in Florida spoke a language other than English at home, with Spanish the predominant home language. By 2000, this percentage was 23.1%. At the same time that increasing numbers of ELL children begin school in the Broward School District, and 31% are now nonnative speakers of English, schools are being held increasingly accountable for academic performance. To separate the effects of CURRENT-ELL and former ELL status from those of bilingualism per se, and from poverty, I report a study of the unique economic and linguistic predictors of literacy in 259 Broward School District schools. I then present and explore the characteristics of a small subset of schools that despite having high levels of poverty, also have high levels of reading performance.</p>
<p>The Broward School District, with a student enrollment of 270,000, is the sixth largest school district in the United States and the nation’s largest fully accredited school district. Despite having a slightly higher per capital income than Florida counties overall (source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12/12011.html">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12/12011.html</ext-link>), more than one third of all children in the Broward School District do not have their basic needs met on a daily basis. Broward School District recognizes 50 heritage languages among its student body. Bilingual education is given for courses in math, science, and social studies, but for other courses, students are taught by trained English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) instructors using strategies to accommodate ELLs. For schools with large numbers of ELLs, students are placed in a sheltered program, in which they do not have to compete with students who are fluent in English. For schools with smaller numbers of ELLs, students may be placed in clustered programs, in which they are not separated from their English-proficient peers but do receive special instruction from ESOL-trained teachers. Students whose English fluency is close to that of native speakers may be placed in basic mainstream classes, but receive extra courses in English.</p>
<p>Students remain in the ESOL program as long as they need to, as determined by competency scores on the Comprehensive English Language Learning Assessment (CELLA), International Developmental Education Association (IDEA) Oral Language Proficiency Test (IPT-I, IPT-II, or IPT-1 depending on age of student), and Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT) (source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broward.k12.fl.us/esol/Eng/What’s%20New/PDF/Whats_New_ESOL_Exit_Critera.pdf">http://www.broward.k12.fl.us/esol/Eng/What’s%20New/PDF/Whats_New_ESOL_Exit_Critera.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Research in resiliency has been making its way through the various social sciences for the past several decades. The concept of educational resiliency has been explored more recently. In particular, researchers have sought to determine personal and environmental characteristics that allow students to succeed academically despite adverse conditions such as low SES, attending a high-poverty school, or being in a single-parent home. While the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211408878">Waxman, Gray, and Padron (2002)</xref> has succeeded in identifying resiliency attributes, it focused on individual students. To date, no research has focused on characteristics of resilient schools. Waxman et al. found that resilient students are far more engaged in school activities than their less resilient peers. A school-level analysis is described in the present research to identify the best predictors of resiliency that are potentially responsive to school-level reforms.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764211408878">
<title>Use of Aggregate School-Level Data</title>
<p>Across-school systems’ academic performance has been shown to be easier to predict than most within-school variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211408878">Hogan, 1972</xref>). When one aggregates data up to the school level, the relations between variables are increased because random variation at the student level is minimized. This is because there is a loss of variation among children when summing across children to create the school aggregate mean. So in terms of interpretation, the school-level correlations should not be used to infer relations about reading at the child level. This increase in correlations at the aggregate level is related to the “ecological fallacy” when aggregate, school-level data are used to make inferences about child-level data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211408878">Richards, Gottfredson, &amp; Gottfredson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211408878">Robinson, 1950</xref>). There are ways to infer individual-level data from aggregate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211408878">Firebaugh, 1978</xref>). The present research, however, will not make assumptions about child-level data. Aggregate data are used in this research because many of the variables included are only possible to describe at the level of ecological settings like schools. For example, school poverty, school size, the percentage of support staff per pupil, per pupil expenditures, and school operating costs are but a few of the important school-level variables that contribute to academic performance but cannot be measured in child-level data. A second reason for the use of aggregate data is that high-stakes policy decisions are now made based on school-level, as well as child-level, performance in Florida and across America. In fact, school-level demographics related to SES are stable over time, stronger for math than for reading outcomes, and greater for elementary rather than for secondary students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211408878">Mandeville, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211408878">Mandeville &amp; Anderson, 1987</xref>). The use of school-level demographics has also been supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211408878">Wang and Gordon (1994)</xref> in their landmark report of resiliency to low SES.</p>

<title>Composites Created From Economic and Language Aggregates</title>
<p>More than 22 measured variables at the individual school level in the Broward School District were obtained from the Florida Department of Education website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://info.doe.state.fl.us/fsir/">http://info.doe.state.fl.us/fsir/</ext-link>. From these, six unit-weighted composite variables were created: bilingualism, poverty, ethnicity, teacher resources, school resources, and child risk behaviors. The first composite, <italic>poverty</italic>, was created from FRL (free or reduced lunch costs to the parent), a federal marker of poverty based on family income plus house values. FRL status was combined with average house values and household income in the neighborhood of the school (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408878">Harwell &amp; LeBeau, 2010</xref>). Children qualified for FRL if their annual household income was below $17,500 in 2003. All composite variables were first transformed to <italic>z</italic> scores to provide standard units of measurement.</p>
<p><italic>Bilingualism</italic> was created from percentage of children in a school who are both listed as limited English proficient (CURRENT-ELL) and are currently in the ESOL program. This study makes the important contribution of separating ELL children according to English proficiency, rather than grouping all ELL students together. Two groups of ELLs represented in these 259 schools: those who are CURRENT-ELL because they are in ESOL programs, or former ELL because they either successfully completed ESOL, or never needed to attend because of sufficient English skills. The definition of bilingualism is determined by the way the government records provide general categories and is not a standardized measure of bilingualism per se.</p>
<p><italic>Minority ethnicity</italic> was created from the percentage of children in each school who reported themselves as Black or Hispanic. <italic>Child risk</italic> was created by adding the percentage of school absences, children with disabilities, suspensions in and out of school, inverse of the stability of membership from the first half to the second half of the school year, and the total percentage of crimes and violence reported in each school.</p>
<p><italic>School resources</italic> was created as a composite of operating costs total and expenditures per exceptional, risk, and regular children in each school.</p>
<p><italic>Teacher resources</italic> was created from the addition of the percentage of staff who were administrative, support, instructional, and total as a function of the number of children in each grade at each school, the percentage of teachers who had advanced degrees, and the inverse of the percentage of teachers teaching out of their field. This category has limited relevance because there is no information reported on the teachers’ specific training in ESL education or other endorsements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002764211408878">
<title>Models Tested</title>
<p>Four models of the relation between the composite variables in predicting grade level reading were tested. The first model employed a traditional stepwise regression approach and included all variables entered in the order poverty, bilingualism, minority ethnicity, child risk, school resources, and teacher resources (like training, equipment, and supplies). The second model was the same as the first, but without the strongest composite predictor, poverty. The third model included only two variables, bilingualism and poverty. The fourth model was like the first full model, except that bilingualism was entered first rather than second to poverty.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that the best model for predicting school-level reading comprehension will be the model with poverty as the strongest unique predictor. This is expected because other studies have shown that social deficits like poverty can overshadow language differences like CURRENT-ELL status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211408878">Coulter &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>School Profiles</title>
<p>All of the 259 regular public schools in the Broward School District—153 elementary schools, 59 middle schools, and 47 high schools—were characterized in terms of language and economic variables available to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211408878">Florida Department of Education, 2007-2008</xref>). Data acquired from archival sources of schools with FCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211408878">Florida Department of Education, n.d.</xref>) scores in reading were used to conduct an analysis of the best nonredundant predictors of school performance for grade levels 3 through 10. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211408878">Table 1</xref> lists all school profile variables used to create composites.</p>

<title>Criterion Variable</title>
<p>The FCAT reading score was used as the criterion for school performance. The FCAT is designed to assess student achievement of high-order cognitive skills in reading, writing, and science. All students in Grades 3 through 10 take the FCAT Reading and Mathematics in the spring of each year. All students in Grades 4, 8, and 10 take an FCAT Writing test, and FCAT Science is administered to all students in Grades 5, 8, and 10. The reading comprehension norm referenced test (NRT) subtest of school level performance from the 2003-2004 school year is used in the present report. Reading is measured by word decoding and reading comprehension skill. Reading of informational and literary passages is followed by questions about words and phrases in context, the main idea, plot, and purpose, comparisons and cause/effect, and reference and research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0002764211408878">
<title>Predictor Variables</title>
<p>The study included accessing all available school profile information as predictors from the 153 elementary schools, 59 middle schools, and 47 high schools within the district, the sixth largest school district in the nation, for a total sample size of approximately 270,000 children. Data regarding the economic and language variables of each school were merged into a database containing norm-referenced standard FCAT score results according to school and grade level. Additional information on SES was created from an analysis of school zip codes, which was used to determine average income levels and house values in each school’s neighborhood. Language background information for each school was determined by compiling information on the percentage of CURRENT-ELL and English proficient (EP) students within each school, which was obtained from the Florida Department of Education website and from the Broward County Public Schools website. Additionally, information on percentage of self-reported ethnicity within each school was also obtained from the Broward County Public Schools website, Diversity Characteristics by School, 20th Day Enrollment Report for the 2003-2004 school year. Ethnic categories included White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and Multiracial.</p>
<p>Broward School District differentiates its students’ English language skills into the following groups: active ESOL students who have not yet met the exit requirement, exited ESOL students who are being monitored for 1 year, exited ESOL students who are being monitored for 2 years, exited ESOL students who are no longer being monitored, and non-ESOL students. For the purposes of this study, students were categorized as CURRENT-ELL, EP, or monolinguals. The CURRENT-ELL category was created from the active ESOL students who have not yet met the exit requirement. The EP category was created from students who had exited the ESOL program, whether they were being monitored for 1 year, 2 years, or no longer being monitored. The monolingual category was created by subtracting the number of students in the CURRENT-ELL and EP categories from the total number of students.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics for Elementary Schools</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics indicate that of the 153 elementary schools in the present sample, including third, fourth, and fifth grades, standardized reading performance yielded a mean scale score of 626.3 (median national percentile rank [NPR] of 58) for third grade, 643.8 (median NPR of 56) for fourth, and 654.8 (median NPR of 52) for fifth on the 2003-2004 FCAT NRT. In math in third grade, the average school score was 623.7 (median NPR 56); in fourth, 637.3 (median NPR of 53); and 655.8 (median NPR of 55) in fifth.

<title>Elementary School Analyses</title>
<p>A multiple regression at each grade level was conducted for reading comprehension scores with each of the six unit-weighted composite variables as predictors. Four models were tested in each grade level analysis. In third grade, the first full model accounted for 67% of the variance in reading, <italic>R</italic> = .82, <italic>F</italic>(6, 110) = 35.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Poverty accounted for 55% of the variance alone. Child risk added a unique 8% variance and teacher resources added 2%. Model 2 removed poverty and accounted for 49% in reading variance with all variables but ethnicity now making reliable contributions; bilingualism 10%, child risk 27%, school resources 6%, and teacher resources 6%. The third model included only poverty and bilingualism and accounted for 55% of the variance in reading, 32% from poverty, and another reliable 13% from bilingualism. The fourth model entered bilingualism first in a full model and accounted for the same amount of variance as the first model, 67%. In this case, bilingualism entered first accounts for a reliable 14% of the variance, with child risk 24%, school resources 4%, and teacher resources 19%.</p>
<p>The same analyses in Grades 4 and 5 showed similar results with the first full model entering poverty first, showing 65% and 73% variance accounted for, respectively. In fourth grade, poverty accounted for 54%, bilingualism 2%, school resources 6%, and teacher 2%. In fifth grade, poverty accounted for 60%, bilingualism 2%, ethnicity 2%, child risk 4%, and school resources 2%. Fifty percent and 54% in fourth and fifth grade were accounted for in the model without poverty, with all other variables adding single digit, but reliable variance. Bilingualism accounted for 7% and 8% in fourth and fifth grade, with poverty adding 48% and 49%, respectively, in the simple two-composite model.</p>

<title>Resiliency Analyses</title>
<p>Schools in elementary, middle, and high school groups were grouped by a median split of reading comprehension scores and percentage of FRL. Those schools with above median reading and above median levels of poverty were considered relatively resilient to the strong correlations between poverty and reading at each school level. The overall bivariate correlation between poverty and reading in elementary schools was .72; in middle schools, .60; and in high schools, .52. There were seven elementary schools that were resilient to the correlation between reading and poverty by having average reading scores and levels of poverty above the median. These schools contained more CURRENT-ELL students, fewer Black students, fewer school absences, allocated more money per pupil, had a better student-to-teacher ratio, and reported less overall crime. Only two middle schools were resilient and had a higher percentage of White students, had a better student-to-teacher ratio, less crime, and more money allocated per pupil. Nine high schools were resilient and allocated more money per pupil, had a better student-to-teacher ratio, and reported less crime.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The free lunch is still not free. The single best predictor of standardized reading comprehension in all grades is the percentage of children in a school who live in poverty. Poverty is defined in the present study as a unit-weighted composite of the percentage of children in each school who receive FRL and the average family income and home values in the neighborhood of the school. Poverty captures the majority of the unique variance, with other variables making only minor and often redundant contributions. In fact, on average, across all grades, 59% of the variance in nationally referenced FCAT reading comprehension scores is accounted for by poverty. The second strongest predictor, child risk behaviors, such as the percentage of absences, suspensions, and crime, accounts for increasing amounts of variance with age, reaching a peak of 29% in 9th grade and 46% in 10th grade. CURRENT-ELL status only shows minor contributions unless it is entered in a model before poverty. It is reliably correlated with poverty in all elementary school grades. Poverty is related to minority ethnicity in middle school; however, minority ethnicity does not uniquely predict reading in any grade.</p>
<p>Regardless of the percentage of children who are current ESOL students or labeled CURRENT-ELL in a school, poverty remains the major predictor of reading comprehension scores. Likewise, minority ethnicity has no contribution after poverty is entered into the model. The contributions of bilingualism are often masked by poverty. For example, in third grade, bilingualism entered before poverty accounts for a reliable 8% of the variance, in contrast to no unique variance when placed after poverty. In either case, poverty accounts for more than 50% of the unique variance in reading, regardless of whether a school includes many bilingual children, is at risk due to large numbers of truants or other risk behaviors, or is subject to limited school or teacher resources. School and teacher resources each make a peak contribution in middle school, single digit in elementary, and almost no unique variance in high school. School resources include operating costs and costs per student and are about twice as likely to predict reading as teacher resources. Teacher resources include the student-to-teacher ratio, which is quite high in all grades and is therefore subject to a likely ceiling effect. Resiliency characteristics common to all grades were that, in addition to having higher reading <italic>and</italic> poverty levels than other schools, these schools also had more money allocated per pupil, less crime, and a better student-to-teacher ratio.</p>

<title>Implications for Policy</title>
<p>If a school district such as the one highlighted in this study chooses to improve reading comprehension scores by improving teaching and instruction alone, it will fail. Policy will have to address and measure the amount of social deficit a school might be expected to experience. School districts will need to provide social workers who attend personally to the needs of children at risk. After-school activities provided by teenage or elderly volunteers in the community could be encouraged at low cost to provide a structured environment for reading and speaking practice. Bilingual children will continue to be at risk, but not because of language differences. CURRENT-ELL status alone will not predict reading outcomes unless social deficits like poverty are accounted for as well. Research will need to explore both child-level and school-level predictors because one cannot generalize from one set of predictors to the other. Characteristics of the child, attitudes of the teachers, parenting, and other variables will moderate the effects of poverty. Children who exhibit dispositional optimism, or who have parents who do not succumb to learned helplessness and other problems associated with raising children in poverty, and teachers who do not expect lower performance from low SES children, will all serve to moderate SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408878">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>). Most research on SES to date has looked at SES as a moderator, rather than what might moderate or mediate the effects of SES. Developmental systems theory stresses the importance of social dimensions including those of economics and language, but this type of research is limited to case studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211408878">Waxman et al. (2002)</xref> describe the need for more naturalistic longitudinal and experimental studies. The present research serves as a base for designing experimental training that could focus on making schools aware of the need to encourage involved, engaged students, regardless of social or language background. But this research also makes it clear that school reforms focusing on teacher quality improvement will never succeed without including the impact of variables like poverty. Waxman et al. also point out that a focus on resiliency will encourage a focus on positive rather than negative characteristics of students.</p>
<p>At either the school or child level of analysis, poverty and its correlates have no easy solutions with regards to policy because children who live in poverty pose a special challenge to teachers and schools. A better student-to-teacher ratio and more money allocated per pupil are direct recommendations from the resiliency data, although these 18 “resilient” schools are a small enough sample to be different from the rest in unspecified ways. And the regression analyses reported here cannot disentangle the complex causal relations between individual characteristics of a given school. But whereas reciprocal causation is likely involved in the link between SES and school-level outcomes, an index of poverty systematically and consistently predicts FCAT NRT reading scores.</p>
<p>Teachers and schools can have only limited accountability when so many children are in economic need. Ethnicity, economics, and heritage language continue to form a complex web that is still not completely understood, but the time has come for dispelling myths about what leads to academic success. The outcome is simple and yet difficult to address: Poverty provides unique and substantial predictive power. Child poverty continues to reach epidemic proportions within the United States. The 2000 U.S. Census showed that of the 33.9 million people living in poverty in 2000, or 12.4% of the total population, 11.7 million were children, or 16.6% of all children. The present data show that in the Broward School District in South Florida, the problem is even larger than at the national level, because one third of school-age children live below the poverty line and qualify for lunch subsidies. Although it is known that younger children are more likely to face poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211408878">White, 1982</xref>), the present data show that poverty is just as likely to be a strong predictor of reading skill in middle and high school as in elementary school. We have known for some time that poverty has a devastating negative influence on academic achievement and that the relation between socioeconomic status and underachievement is most dramatic near and below the poverty line and among minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408878">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>). Major discrepancies in educational achievement as a function of SES have been well documented since the 1960s. Less than 20% of children from families receiving public assistance have the requisite preliteracy skills at kindergarten entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211408878">National Center for Education Statistics [NCES] 2000</xref>). Of fourth-graders eligible for lunch subsidies, only 2% scored as advanced readers and 12% as proficient readers on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211408878">National Assessment of Educational Progress (2000)</xref> evaluation. Numerous factors contribute to the relation between SES and educational outcomes, including birth weight, nutrition, housing quality, and access to health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408878">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>). Such factors may, for example, have repercussions on child cognitive functioning or parenting, and in turn, educational achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211408878">National Research Council, 2000</xref>).The present data show that poverty predicts most of the variance in reading outcomes even when including a host of other important variables. Poverty as a composite is a better predictor of reading than CURRENT-ELL status. Therefore, more resources like FRL should be provided to high-risk children, perhaps in the form of after-school enrichment programs.</p>
<p>One implication of these findings is that children and schools will require extra educational resources to counteract poverty. Florida is particularly troublesome in this regard as it ranks 50th among states in terms of per capita expenditures for education. A change will have to occur in a climate where schools serving low-SES children currently receive much lower public funding than schools serving higher SES children. Only a few states have moved towards funding equity, and even if each state funded schools equally, large between-state discrepancies can work against poor children. Thus, federal resources and poverty reduction are now necessary to close the SES achievement gap. Further accountability measures by the nation and by states must consider the most potent variable, poverty, as they address other variables in the equation. The schools most resilient to the strong predictive power of poverty for reading outcomes, those with a good student-to-teacher ratio, low crime, and high per pupil expenditures, are suggestive of themes that should run through intervention field trials and experimental research designed to examine sociocultural factors as well as challenges to interventions.</p>
