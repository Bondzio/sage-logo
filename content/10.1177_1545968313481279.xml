<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Task-specific training is emerging as a viable neurorehabilitative approach for improving motor function after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968313481279">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968313481279">2</xref></sup> It is based on the fundamental principle that repeated practice is the best way to learn a particular task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1545968313481279">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately, an individual often loses the ability to perform a number of tasks after stroke, many more so than can be practiced feasibly within the current rehabilitation setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1545968313481279">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545968313481279">5</xref></sup> It is assumed that the effects of training on 1 task in therapy will transfer to other tasks that have not undergone training, yet very little is known about whether this is true. Transfer, in this sense, is the gain in the proficiency of 1 motor task as a result of practice on some other motor task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1545968313481279">6</xref></sup> To what degree does motor training transfer after task-specific training? Given that “there is currently a dearth of evidence on which to construct rehabilitation interventions that are accurately targeted, properly framed, and credibly measured”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1545968313481279">7</xref>(p2033)</sup>, it is critical to understand (1) if task-specific training transfers and (2) how much transfer occurs.</p>
<p>One challenge in addressing these questions experimentally is the substantial differences between functional upper-extremity motor tasks that may be practiced within task-specific training. For example, an individual may repeatedly practice sorting coins with the affected limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968313481279">8</xref></sup> This task would be markedly different from other tasks such as feeding or dressing oneself, not only in terms of movement goals but also in terms of spatiotemporal characteristics of the movements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1545968313481279">9</xref></sup> Previous studies in neurologically intact individuals have used point-to-point reaching paradigms to demonstrate how the effects of motor training can transfer, but the amount of transfer is incomplete even when the context is similar to the training condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1545968313481279">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545968313481279">11</xref></sup> Such results from motor tasks bearing little resemblance to real-world actions suggest that little to no transfer of training would occur between more naturalistic upper-extremity actions involving the entire upper extremity. Naturalistic actions are purposeful and multistep,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1545968313481279">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1545968313481279">15</xref></sup> often recruiting many degrees of freedom and differing substantially in how “successful” performance is defined. We recently found, however, that performance on 1 novel yet naturalistic motor task (simulated dressing) improved significantly following a single session of training on another task that was spatiotemporally quite different (simulated feeding).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968313481279">16</xref></sup> Performance on a novel, nonmotor cognitive task (associative recognition) did not, however, improve following training on the feeding task, indicating that the transfer effects were specific to the motor domain and not a result of changes in overall arousal. Moreover, no improvements on the dressing task were observed in individuals who did not train on the feeding task, indicating that the transfer effects were experience dependent. By establishing this proof of principle in neurologically intact individuals, we now address whether motor training can transfer in individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis and whether the amount of transfer depends on the degree of similarity between the trained and untrained tasks.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test whether 5 consecutive days of training on 1 motor task would transfer to 2 other untrained tasks in individuals with chronic hemiparesis poststroke. All tasks were performed with the affected upper extremity. We hypothesized that training on the feeding task would improve motor performance not only on that task but also on 2 tasks that were not trained (sorting and dressing). We also hypothesized that because the sorting task was spatiotemporally similar to the feeding task, the amount of transfer would be greater in the sorting task than in the dressing task. In this study, the amount of transfer was measured as the degree of improvement from before to after training on the feeding task. Results from this study have direct and immediate implications for maximizing the benefits of task-specific training after stroke by providing evidence that can be used to guide clinicians’ selection of which tasks to practice.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 11 adults with chronic upper-extremity hemiparesis following stroke participated in this study. Of these participants, 9 were right-handed, based on self-report; 5 participants had right-side hemiparesis and 6 had left-side hemiparesis. Participants were recruited from the Brain Recovery Core Stroke Registry at Washington University in St Louis based on the presence of unilateral hemiparesis. Potential stroke participants were included if they (1) had a diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke by a stroke neurologist; (2) had persistent hemiparesis with a score of 1 to 3 on the Motor Arm item of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), indicating mild to moderate impairment; and (3) had the ability to follow 2-step commands. Potential participants were excluded from the study if they (1) had severe hemispatial neglect as evidenced by a score of 2 on the Extinction and Inattention items of the NIHSS or (2) were unable to give informed consent. This study was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office and was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants provided informed consent prior to beginning the study.</p>
<p>Several clinical tests were used to characterize participants. Maximum grip strength (in kg) of the affected and unaffected sides was measured using a dynamometer (Jamar, Sammons-Preston-Rolyan, Bolingbrook, Illinois)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1545968313481279">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1545968313481279">18</xref></sup> before and after training. The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) was used to quantify upper-extremity function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1545968313481279">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1545968313481279">24</xref></sup> An ARAT score of 57 indicates normal function. Spasticity of the elbow flexors was assessed on the affected side using the Modified Ashworth Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1545968313481279">25</xref></sup> Cutaneous sensation was measured with Semmes Weinstein monofilaments (Touch-Test, North Coast Medical, Inc, Gilroy, California) applied to the palmar surface on the distal phalange of the index finger. The Trail-Making Test B was used to assess cognitive function, specifically switching attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1545968313481279">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1545968313481279">27</xref></sup> Results from these tests are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1545968313481279">Table 1</xref>, along with other descriptive characteristics. Time poststroke ranged from 12 to 156 months, and severity of sensorimotor impairment and functional limitation ranged from mild to moderate, as shown by measures of strength and sensation and scores on the ARAT.</p>

<title>General procedure</title>
<p>This study used a mixed-model design to evaluate the transfer of training from 1 motor task to 2 other untrained motor tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968313481279">16</xref></sup> For all tasks, participants sat in a chair behind a table (76 cm × 51 cm) that was adjusted to be as low as possible without contacting the thighs. All motor tasks were completed with the affected upper extremity and were graded according to motor ability on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Each participant completed the study over the course of 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1545968313481279">Figure 1</xref>). Prior to training on day 1, participants completed one 30-s trial of all 3 tasks to establish their pretest motor performance with their affected upper extremity. They then completed 50 more trials of the trained task with their affected upper extremity in a massed practice training session. On days 2 to 5, participants received additional training only on that task (50 trials/d), resulting in 250 total trials over the course of 5 days. Immediately following the training session on day 5, participants completed one 30-s trial of all 3 tasks to determine their posttest motor performance. In both the pretest and posttest sessions, the order of the motor tasks was randomized using the random permutation function in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts) for each participant.</p>

<title>Trained motor task: feeding</title>
<p>The trained motor task was a simulated feeding task that required spooning beans from one cup to another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968313481279">Figure 2</xref>, left panel). At the start of each feeding trial, participants picked up a metal spoon with their most affected hand and spooned 1 bean at a time from one cup away from their body to another cup. The first cup contained 70 beans that were distributed evenly across the bottom. The cups were secured to a wooden board, which was centered in line with the participant’s shoulder. Participants spooned as many beans as possible per trial in the target direction, and the total number of beans in the target cup was recorded after each trial. Only 1 bean was counted per repetition if &gt;1 bean was transferred at a time. That is, a successful repetition in the feeding task was one in which at least 1 bean was transferred. Participants were given no information about their performance strategy during training and were only given verbal feedback about the number of successful repetitions after each trial. Thus, a “discovery learning approach” was taken in this study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1545968313481279">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1545968313481279">30</xref></sup> in which participants adapt their movement strategies based on trial and error over time. The measure of performance for each feeding trial was the number of successful repetitions. Prior to the experiment, participants were tested on whether they could spoon at least 2 beans (2 successful repetitions) within 30 s. Only 4 of the 11 participants did so. For the remaining 7 participants, a piece of cylindrical foam was used to cover the spoon’s handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968313481279">Figure 2</xref>, left panel). This graded the feeding task according to the individual’s ability.</p>

<title>Untrained motor tasks: sorting and dressing</title>
<p>Participants were also tested on 2 other motor tasks before and after training: sorting and dressing. They did not train on either task. The sorting task required participants to transport blocks 1 by 1 from one box to another box away from their body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968313481279">Figure 2</xref>, middle panel). The dimensions of each box were 8.5 × 25.4 × 24.4 cm<sup>3</sup>. The boxes were separated by a partition that was 18 cm high and were centered in line with the participant’s shoulder. Participants transported as many blocks as possible per trial with their most affected hand. The measure of performance for each sorting trial was the number of blocks transported.</p>
<p>The apparatus used in this task was the Box and Blocks Test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1545968313481279">31</xref></sup> In its standardized clinical use, the boxes are oriented side by side, requiring individuals to transport blocks in the mediolateral direction across the midline. In this study, however, the boxes were oriented such that participants were required to transport blocks in the anteroposterior direction in the hemispace ipsilateral to the affected side. This configuration required participants to move in a direction similar to the feeding task.</p>
<p>The second untrained motor task was a dressing task in which buttons were fastened sequentially. At the start of each dressing trial, participants began buttoning the bottom of 7 buttons (3 cm in diameter) that were sewn 2 cm apart to plain-weave cotton fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1545968313481279">Figure 2</xref>, right panel). Both fabric pieces were secured to a wooden board, with the placket centered in line with the participant’s shoulder. The button side of the fabric was folded onto the board, whereas the buttonhole side of the fabric was unfolded onto the table prior to each trial, lateral to the affected upper extremity. Participants fastened as many consecutive buttons as possible per trial with their affected hand. If all 7 buttons were fastened in less than 30 s, participants were instructed to completely unfasten each button in the reverse order until the trial ended. The measure of performance for each dressing trial was the number of buttons fastened/unfastened.</p>
<p>Prior to the experiment, participants were tested on whether they could fasten a single button within 30 s. Only 2 of the 11 participants did so. The remaining 9 participants were tested on an adapted dressing task in which medium-stress dot-on-dot Velcro was fastened rather than buttons. This enabled the dressing task to be graded down according to the individual’s ability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1545968313481279">
<title>Task similarity</title>
<p>Movement kinematics were similar between the feeding task and the sorting task, whereas kinematics in the dressing task were different. To illustrate the similarities/differences between tasks, shoulder and elbow flexion angles during individual trials of each motor task in a single participant are provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1545968313481279">Figure 3A</xref>); more positive values indicate extension direction. Relative to the feeding task (black line), the sorting task (dashed line) is spatiotemporally similar, given the repetitive and consistent shoulder and elbow flexion/extension patterns as the hand moves back and forth between the cups or boxes in the anterior-posterior direction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1545968313481279">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>Task automaticity: an additional probe of transfer</title>
<p>It is possible that over the course of training, participants’ motor performance on the feeding task would become more “automatic” with practice. This is based on the theory that the more learned a task is, the more automatic it is.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1545968313481279">40</xref></sup> Thus, if the effects of training did transfer to the 2 untrained tasks, they too should become more automatic than prior to training. Automaticity is easily tested using a dual-task condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1545968313481279">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1545968313481279">43</xref></sup> and may be operationalized by the amount of dual-task interference (ie, degradation in performance of at least 1 task under dual-task condition compared with performance by itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1545968313481279">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1545968313481279">45</xref></sup>). We recently tested whether dual-task conditions were feasible for detecting transfer in neurologically intact individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968313481279">16</xref></sup> and found that both the trained and untrained tasks showed improved automaticity following a single session of training. To test whether similar effects occurred in this study following 5 sessions of training in individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis, we evaluated individuals’ motor performance under dual-task conditions at pretest and posttest in the same manner shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1545968313481279">Figure 1</xref>. This was to further probe the transfer of training.</p>
<p>In the dual-task condition, participants performed each motor task (feeding, sorting, and dressing) and a nonmotor auditory vigilance task concurrently. Prior to performing any motor task, all participants performed 2 trials of the auditory task in which they listened to recordings of 35- letter sequences. Each 30-letter sequence consisted of a random series of the same 4 letters (A, G, M, and O) at 1 Hz. Prior to each sequence, participants were instructed to pay attention to the number of times a target letter was heard. The target letter was A, G, M, or O and was changed for each trial. Immediately after each sequence, participants were asked to verbally report the number of times a target letter was heard. The primary measure of performance for the auditory task was the number of listening errors per trial, which was calculated as the difference between the reported and correct number of times the target letter was heard. This difference was expressed as an absolute value, such that a score of 1 error was the overestimating or underestimating of the number of target letters by 1.

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Carey, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify normal distribution of each variable. To test whether training on the feeding task (1) improved feeding performance and (2) transferred to the sorting and dressing tasks, we used 1-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with time (pretest vs posttest) as the within-subject factor. Because the units of performance (ie, beans, blocks, and buttons) differed between tasks, separate ANOVAs were performed for the feeding, sorting, and dressing tasks. Significant differences between pretest and posttest performances of the untrained motor tasks would indicate that training had transferred.</p>
<p>To test whether the dual-task condition interfered with each task’s motor performance, we used 2 × 2 mixed-model ANOVAs, with time (pretest vs posttest) and condition (motor task only vs dual task) as within-subject factors. Separate ANOVAs were performed for the feeding, sorting, and dressing tasks.</p>
<p>All participants’ pretest and posttest motor performances were normalized to their unaffected side’s performance (normal = 100%). This normalization allowed for direct comparison of how much each task improved relative to other tasks. Improvement was calculated as normalized posttest performance minus normalized pretest performance. To determine whether more transfer occurred to a spatiotemporally similar task (sorting) compared with a different task (dressing), we used a 1-way repeated- measures ANOVA with task (feeding vs sorting vs dressing) as the within-subject factor. For all ANOVAs in this study, Tukey-Kramer honestly significant different tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1545968313481279">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1545968313481279">47</xref></sup> were used for post hoc analysis when warranted based on the criterion for statistical significance (α = .05).</p>

<title>Preserved Effects of Training Under Dual-Task Conditions</title>
<p>Pretest and posttest performance on all 3 motor tasks was also evaluated under dual-task conditions. Results presented here focus on the statistical comparisons that determined whether automaticity of the trained and untrained tasks improved. There was a significant effect of time on listening performance (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,10</sub> = 3.8; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), such that listening errors were greater during pretest compared with listening only (post hoc <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1545968313481279">Figure 5A</xref>). This occurred even though participants were instructed to prioritize the auditory task. Instead, participants appeared to maintain their motor performance during pretest at the cost of the listening performance, as evidenced by no significant main effect of condition (single vs dual task) for the sorting (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 1.0; <italic>P</italic> = .32) and dressing (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 1.1; <italic>P</italic> = .31) tasks. Thus, prior to any motor training, the motor tasks appeared to disrupt the auditory task. By posttest, however, listening performance under dual-task conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1545968313481279">Figure 5A</xref>) was comparable with to listening only (<italic>P</italic> = .57). Motor performance for all tasks under dual-task conditions also improved significantly after training on only 1 task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1545968313481279">Figure 5B</xref>), as shown by the main effect of time (pretest vs posttest) for feeding (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 187.07; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), sorting (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 7.48; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and dressing (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 16.27; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) performances. Collectively, these results show that after training on 1 motor task, the automaticity of the untrained tasks improved as well, allowing for enough attention to be reallocated back to the auditory task under dual-task conditions with minimal interference.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We tested whether 5 consecutive days of training on 1 motor task would transfer to 2 other untrained tasks in individuals with chronic mild to moderate hemiparesis poststroke. Results supported the first hypothesis that training on the feeding task would improve motor performance not only on that task but also on 2 other tasks that were not trained (sorting and dressing). Results did not, however, support the second hypothesis that the amount of transfer would be greater in the sorting task than in the dressing task because of its spatiotemporal similarity to the feeding task. Instead, the amount of transfer (ie, improvement from pretest to posttest) was comparable. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the effects of task-specific training after stroke to potentially generalize to a wider range of motor tasks beyond that which is practiced.</p>
<p>Given the increased prevalence of task-specific training in neurorehabilitation after stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1545968313481279">1</xref></sup> the question of whether the effects of training on 1 motor task will transfer to other unpracticed tasks is important. Numerous factors may limit exactly how many tasks can be practiced during standard therapy (eg, time, available space, and patient/clinician characteristics), but undoubtedly, the number and range of tasks needing practice exceed those that can be practiced feasibly within the allotted amount of rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1545968313481279">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1545968313481279">5</xref></sup> Thus, any task-specific training treatment plan must consider the amount of expected transfer in order to maximize its benefits.</p>
<p>Although the clinical importance of transfer is indisputable, little research has been done directly in (1) the clinical populations currently being treated with task-specific training and (2) the tasks currently being used within task-specific training. Previous studies in neurologically intact adults have demonstrated in experimental tasks with few degrees of freedom (ie, planar point-to-point reaching or sequential finger flexion with limb support) that the amount of transfer to novel conditions of the same task is relatively small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1545968313481279">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1545968313481279"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1545968313481279">53</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this work has provided considerable evidence that the nervous system can and does generalize movement-related information. This work is, however, unable to predict the following: Does training on a more complex, functional task that recruits more degrees of freedom facilitate more transfer? Or does the diversity among movement patterns and goals minimize or even prevent any transfer? Prior to the current study, it was unclear whether transfer would be expected between more functional tasks involving many steps and degrees of freedom, that is, tasks that are practiced during task- specific training after stroke, such as sorting silverware or drinking from a glass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1545968313481279">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968313481279">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1545968313481279">54</xref></sup> We recently tested this in a group of neurologically intact individuals and found that the effects of repetitive training on 1 functional task are transferrable to another functional task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1545968313481279">16</xref></sup> The tasks in this previous study were similar to the tasks performed in the current study. By demonstrating the effects of transfer between functional upper-extremity motor tasks as a result of repetitive training in individuals with chronic mild to moderate hemiparesis after stroke, we now provide novel quantitative findings that address both a specific population and a task set that are relevant clinically.</p>

<title>More Task Similarity, More Transfer?</title>
<p>In the current study, participants trained on 1 motor task (feeding) but were tested on 2 other untrained motor tasks (sorting and dressing) before and after training. The sorting task was relatively similar to the feeding task in terms of movement kinematics, whereas the dressing task was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1545968313481279">Figure 3A</xref>). Although we expected that the degree of similarity would predict the amount of transfer between tasks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1545968313481279">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1545968313481279">57</xref></sup> we found that the sorting and dressing tasks showed comparable improvement. Although the sample size for this study was small (n = 11), these novel findings may suggest that matching the spatiotemporal characteristics of tasks may not necessarily promote additional transfer. Moreover, the motor tasks had different movement goals. The goals of the feeding, sorting, and dressing tasks were to spoon beans, pick up blocks, and fasten buttons, respectively. Previous work has suggested that movements with similar motor goals share common adaptive structures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1545968313481279">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1545968313481279">58</xref></sup> and although more transfer might be expected experimentally when the goals of tasks overlap, this study demonstrates that transfer can occur even when the goals are quite disparate. More research across a broader range of both upper- and lower-extremity motor tasks is needed to test the limits of transfer. Nevertheless, these results are encouraging because clinicians will often take an individualized approach when determining activities of interest and specific tasks to address during treatment sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968313481279">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1545968313481279">59</xref></sup></p>

<title>More Task Practice, More Transfer?</title>
<p>We provide evidence that the benefits of a high, but relatively brief, dose of functional upper-extremity training (approximately 2250 repetitions over 5 days) can transfer to other untrained upper-extremity tasks that are markedly different from the task that was practiced. This is consistent with recent findings demonstrating that following stroke, high doses of task-specific locomotor training over a 6-week intervention also improved other lower-extremity tasks that were not practiced and that were functionally very different from the trained task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1545968313481279">60</xref></sup> Collectively, these findings support the idea that even after 1 or more years poststroke, transfer can and does occur as a result of training. It is likely that the generalized benefits in the 6-week intervention are in part a result of increased limb strength and/or coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1545968313481279">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1545968313481279"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1545968313481279">62</xref></sup> The training in the current study was only for 5 days, and no significant changes in strength (ie, grip strength; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1545968313481279">Table 1</xref>) were observed. This suggests that the mechanism underlying transfer in the current study may be related more to neural reorganization rather than muscular conditioning, following high doses of functional activity over only a few days.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether even higher doses of training will yield even more transfer. In this study, the median number of successful repetitions achieved per day of training on the feeding task was 450, which is comparable with that from other work in which high doses of task-specific upper-extremity training (average 322 repetitions/d<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1545968313481279">8</xref></sup>) have yielded sustained improvements in clinically evaluated motor function. Future research in a larger sample is needed to determine whether and how the amount of transfer can be enhanced with more practice to maximize the functional benefits of a given intervention.</p>

<p>Results from this study suggest that the effects of upper-extremity task-specific training can transfer to other untrained tasks in individuals with chronic mild to moderate hemiparesis after stroke.
