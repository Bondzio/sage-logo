<abstract>
<p>This article describes the recovery experiences of women who had suffered intimate partner violence in Taiwan. A phenomenological study design using semi-structured interviews was used to obtain data from a purposive sample of eight women. Colaizzi’s approach to narrative analysis was applied. Findings indicate that “reconstructing the self” emerged as the essence of the women’s recovery experiences. Four themes were identified: Feeling shame, creating mastery, recognizing the imperfect self, and embodying the self by helping others. Understanding the recovery experience is an important step in effectively assisting women to recover from abusive relationships and to reconstruct their lives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intimate male partner violence is a common form of violence against women with a significant effect on women’s health. An international and cross-cultural study conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512448851">World Health Organization (2005)</xref> in 10 countries revealed that 15% to 71% of the women reported to have been physically or sexually abused, or both, by an intimate male partner in their lifetime. In Taiwan, the reported number of intimate partner violence (IPV) victims has increased annually in recent decades, and 90% of these victims were women in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512448851">Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Executive Yuan, ROC, 2010</xref>). Affected women may terminate the violent relationship; however, the IPV experience has a lasting effect on their lives. Compared to women who did not report a history of IPV, women with a history of IPV were more likely to have suffered physical and mental health consequences, and to have received medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448851">Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, &amp; Lozano, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>IPV is regarded as a family matter in patriarchal Taiwanese society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512448851">Hsieh, Feng, &amp; Shu, 2009</xref>). Taiwan maintains several traditional Chinese values, and is constructed through a patriarchal hierarchical family system. In the father–son domain of the Han Chinese value system, the husband has power over his wife, and the wife needs to obey her husband’s orders. Based on a traditional Taiwanese saying, IPV is regarded as the expression of love. The wife is expected to stay in the marriage relationship to keep the family intact, even when the husband beats his wife. Furthermore, during the socialization process, women internalized their roles in caring for the family; they build self-esteems by catering to others needs, and neglecting the needs of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512448851">Tsai, 2005</xref>). The failed marriage relationship and IPV may destroy a woman’s self-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>). Women who escape an abusive relationship encounter problems, including economic insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512448851">Hsieh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512448851">Lloyd, 1999</xref>), coping with children’s misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512448851">Matud, 2007</xref>), lack of social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>), and physical and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512448851">Waltermaurer, Watson, &amp; McNutt, 2006</xref>). Multiple problems challenge a woman’s recovery from IPV like the difficulties of life, sociocultural viewpoints toward IPV, and low self-confidence. Little attention has been given to abused women in recovery. Previous studies on IPV have focused on the prevalence, risk factors, assessment of IPV, physical and psychological effect, relationship dynamics, and designing effective interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512448851">Bell, Cattaneo, Goodman, &amp; Dutton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512448851">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512448851">Hou, Wang, &amp; Chung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512448851">Jeyaseelan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512448851">McPherson, Delva, &amp; Cranford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512448851">Woods &amp; Wineman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512448851">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512448851">Yoshihama, Horrocks, &amp; Kamano, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Two qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">1996b</xref>) have explored how women recover after leaving an abusive relationship. The results showed that women’s recovery from abusive relationships is not only a journey toward self-realization, but also a process in relational development including a woman’s relationship to herself and to others; a central aspect to healing. These studies were conducted in the eastern United States which holds a sociocultural belief of individualism, but limited research has been conducted in a country that focuses on familism (e.g., Taiwan).</p>
<p>Women’s experiences of recovery are influenced by the social and cultural contexts in which they live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512448851">Phillips, 1998</xref>). It is important to be aware of the cultural determinants of the recovering experience of abused women. However, under the patriarchal system in Taiwan society, women’s experience of recovery from an abusive relationship is unknown. The chief aim of the current study is to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the recovery experience of Taiwanese women who have suffered from IPV, and had terminated their abusive relationship. Understanding the recovery experience will provide insights into important information to frame the approach, enabling professionals to assist women to recover from abusive relationships, and to reconstruct their lives.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886260512448851" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Phenomenology was chosen for this study design. Phenomenology, a qualitative methodology, aims at understanding experiences based on subjective meaning actors ascribe to incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512448851">Moustakas, 1994</xref>). Phenomenology as the study design was well suited because this approach encourages the participant to describe the phenomenon as it was experienced, and to construct the structure of the phenomenon as it appeared. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512448851">Colaizzi’s (1978)</xref> approach was used to analyze the narratives. A detailed explanation of Colaizzi’s approach has been described in the Data Analysis section.</p>
<sec id="section3-0886260512448851">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>After obtaining approval to conduct the study from the Institutional Review Board of the Meiho Institute of Technology Ethics Committee, participants were recruited from two facilities located in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A letter of support to conduct the study was obtained from each facility. The facilities included a Domestic Violence Prevention Center and a self-help association that provided services to abused women. A social worker at each facility contacted eligible participants for permission to give their personal contact information to the researcher. Women were contacted if they met the following criteria: (a) experienced physical, psychological, or sexual abuse from an intimate male partner, and had terminated the abusive relationship at least six months prior to the interview; (b) gained a normal balance in her life based on the woman’s personal opinion and volunteered to share her recovery experience; and (c) were able to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Eight of the nine eligible abused women agreed to participate in this study. The first author explained the study to the participants, and obtained written informed consent. An agreeable time and location for the taped interview was negotiated. Interviews were conducted between December 2006 and April 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512448851">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were obtained through a semi-structured, open-ended, in-depth interview. Each participant was interviewed with the request, “Please tell me about your experience after leaving your abusive relationship.” Follow-up questions included, “What were your thoughts and feelings when you left the abusive relationship?” and “What difficulties did you encounter in the recovery process?” The interviews occurred during one or two sessions depending on the preference of the participants. The interviews required 1.5 to 3.5 hours with five interviews occurring in the women’s homes, and three interviews occurring in a private place deemed safe and comfortable by the women. All interviews were transcribed verbatim in Chinese; field notes were also recorded. Confidentiality was maintained by coding each transcript, and a demographic data sheet with a pseudonym. During the interview, if participants required additional assistance, referral to the nearby psychiatric clinic was initiated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260512448851">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The transcripts of the women’s experiences of recovery from abusive relationships were analyzed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512448851">Colaizzi’s (1978)</xref> approach to data analysis. During the analysis, the researcher listened to the tape recording of the participants’ experiences to gain a general understanding. The transcripts were read and reread to extract significant statements and phrases that pertained to the study aims. Meanings were formulated from these significant statements and phrases, and organized into clusters. Thematic statements that represented the experiences of the abused women were identified. Using all of the phrases and sentence clusters, the data were reduced until essential themes emerged. The thematic descriptions were reviewed by two of the participants to determine if an adequate reflection of the participants’ experiences were captured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512448851">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>Evidence for trustworthiness was addressed through the following Criteria: credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512448851">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). In regards to credibility, the first author who conducted the interviews had 9 years of experience in psychiatric nursing, and was experienced in conducting qualitative interviews. We discussed the interviews, the observed phenomena and related information with an expert in IPV at regular monthly meeting. Credibility and confirmability were established by this expert who served as a peer debriefer to review transcripts, and confirmed the themes identified. Member checks by two participants to confirm the generated themes if adequate reflections of their experiences were captured also established credibility.</p>
<p>Transferability was accomplished through detailed descriptions of the study design, inclusion criteria, interview questions, the participants, and in-depth interviews, which were recorded and transcribed for analysis and interpretation. Dependability was met through an inquiry audit by the research team, which reviewed theme development, and recorded a self-awareness memo related to research methods and personal biases throughout the interviewing and data analysis process.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The eight participants ranged in age from 33 to 51 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512448851">Table 1</xref>). Six women were divorced, and two were separated. All of the women had children, although only six currently lived with their children. The participants reported that their IPV relationships had been terminated in the range of 0.9 to 13.3 years.</p>

<p>“Reconstructing the self” emerged as the essence of the abused women’s experiences during recovery from the abusive relationship. Four themes were identified: Feeling shame, creating mastery, recognizing the imperfect self, and embodying the self by helping others. Reconstructing the self was the core element of the recovery process, showing that the abused woman accepted the changing self by reconfirming, rebuilding, and embodying the self; and reconnecting relationships among self and others.</p>
<sec id="section8-0886260512448851">
<title>Theme 1: Feeling Shame</title>
<p>In describing the feeling of their IPV, most of the participants and their families felt shame related to suffering, and terminating their abusive relationship. Under the patriarchal ideology and familism in Taiwan society, male violence against women is tolerated, and the individual represents the family. Cultural tolerance of male violence against women not only leads to women’s self-blame but also to pervasive women-blaming attitudes and behaviors among communities. To participants, the term <italic>feeling shame</italic> distinguished them from other women and also made the women unwilling to talk to others about their condition. They internalized a negative self-image because they failed in a marital relationship, which did not fit the expectations of the traditional female role, and to have disgraced the family.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Alisa:</speaker>
<p>Although I was beaten by my husband, divorce was not an acceptable thing by my parents. I felt sorry about my divorce that was a disgrace to my parents.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Helen:</speaker>
<p>My ex-husband’s family often told my daughter, “Your mother abandoned you and this family. She was not a good wife and not a good mother. . .” In the beginning, I doubted myself as to whether my decision was right or wrong. I blamed myself that I failed to carry on a woman’s duty to maintain the wholeness of a family and felt shamed.</p>
</speech>
<p>Most of the participants in this study were isolated with limited social support, which prolonged the duration of suffering. Participants visited the hospital due to physical or mental health problems related to IPV. However, they seldom mentioned their IPV experiences to the health care provider due to feelings of shame about their abusive experience.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ellen:</speaker>
<p>I avoided talking about my experience (IPV). People didn’t understand my suffering, and they (the community) would label me as an abused woman. I didn’t like to be labeled. I felt shamed, lonely, and sad especially at night. . .I couldn’t fall asleep. I drank wine to make myself fall asleep all the time. I could not see my future and I didn’t want to bear such suffering. Sometimes I had suicide ideas.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gina:</speaker>
<p>I went to the hospital for my headache, back pain, and so on. I only told the doctor about my physical problems. I feared of negative reactions from them that enable me did not mention my physical problems that resulted from my husband’s battery.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512448851">
<title>Theme 2: Creating Mastery</title>
<p>Creating mastery meant equipping themselves by increasing their abilities, readjusting their attitudes, being flexible, and acquiring autonomy in their daily lives. Equipping themselves is important in increasing mastery. Participants indicated that they equipped themselves to take control over their lives, and to feel useful. When they left the abusive relationships, women experienced many difficulties and losses, including economic difficulty, parenting difficulty, a decrease in self-esteem, and mental health problems. Economic independence was crucial for participants’ survival. They had to work hard to earn enough money.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ellen:</speaker>
<p>When I left my husband, I only had a little money. In order to pay the rent, my child’s educational expenses and living expenses, I did not have any extra time to absorb myself in reminiscing in the past. I just worked and worked. I hardly had enough time to sleep at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Gina:</speaker>
<p>My economic status was very difficult when I left my husband. Both my day and night part-time jobs did not make enough income for me to pay my expenses.</p>
</speech>
<p>Participants actively developed and enhanced their personal potential, and abilities during their struggles for survival. They became self-aware of their needs, and discovered new sources of emotional and physical energy after terminating the abusive relationship. When the participants had negative feelings or interpersonal problems, they often consulted professionals. They wanted to know that they were doing the right thing, and needed reaffirmation of their self-worth. They overcame many barriers and acquired autonomy in their daily lives, allowing them to feel useful, and increase their self-esteem.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Darlene:</speaker>
<p>I was a housewife before I left my husband. I didn’t know which work I could do?. . . I had tried many works, but failed. I felt useless. When I sold products, sales went badly for several months. I felt frustrated. I gradually perceived that I needed to overcome the barrier. Whenever I had time, I would try to read books and asked others about how to persuade consumers to buy my products. Sales increased gradually. I felt I have potential and abilities. I believed I can do what I want.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ellen:</speaker>
<p>I did not know how to take care of my daughter. Her emotional problems became more serious that may have stemmed from watching her father abuse me. I felt distressed. I decided to talk with a counselor and ask what I should do. I took a long time to consult a doctor who enabled me to pass through much distress and to deal with the relationship with my daughter. I could take control many problems in my daily lives. I felt useful.</p>
</speech>
<p>An important aspect of creating mastery involved the participants readjusting their attitudes and the flexibility to redefine personal and social priorities. Redefining priorities reflected participant focus on the self to reconsider the previously held roles, and to structure their own lives according to their needs. Participants believed that it was important to pay attention to their own needs and desires. They changed their approach to problem solving. They began to reject traditional female roles, and structure their own lives.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Alisa: In the past, my daughter had to do what I said. This caused a bad relationship between us and I felt frustrated. . . . I gradually learned to change my attitude. Things should be more flexible. For example, I did not want to be like my mother, who thought a good mother had to cook on time even when tired. I think I should get enough rest first and then do the family chores as a second priority. I could talk to my daughter about my fatigue. I wanted to rest and not cook. It was ok.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512448851">
<title>Theme 3: Recognizing the Imperfect Self</title>
<p>In learning to recognize and value the changing self, participants gradually recognized their imperfections, and felt comfortable in different situations. For example, people judged the participants’ lack of capacity, and labeled them as a divorced or abused women. To participants, the term “imperfect self” meant that they did not meet the role expectation of others with their limited abilities. They became aware of their own limitations, and could make the necessary changes.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Alisa:</speaker>
<p>When I could not work well, I was presumed lack of capacity that was the reason why I divorced or abused by husband. These encounters made me felt useless and depressed. . . . I knew my own abilities and accepted my own limitations gradually. Although I was imperfect, I could complete my task by reading book and seeking help from others.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Beth:</speaker>
<p>Although I did not know how to deal with my problems, I did not want to seek help due to the feeling of uselessness. I always learned how to manage the problems by myself, but that made me feel tired. Finally, I realized that sometimes I just could not do it myself and I needed to seek help from others.</p>
</speech>
<p>In recognizing the imperfect self, they accepted changes; and were able to live with their imperfections by getting support from others, and by thinking positively. Getting support from others was very important to the participants. In their marriage, participants often felt they did not receive support from their intimate partner or family and as a result, felt isolated. While leaving the abusive relationship, participants were hesitant to talk about their experiences due to the cultural stigma surrounding divorce, and the fear of being reminded of the abusive experience. Several participants became isolated from family and friends, felt lonely, and perceived no future. To recover, participants sought support by connecting with others. For example, to participate in classes or to connect with original family and friends, who accepted and supported them.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Helen:</speaker>
<p>Participation in classes is a good opportunity to come in contact with more people and make friends, especially when you meet teachers or women in the group who have also encountered intimate partner violence. They understood my situation and could give me support. From them, I know that I am being accepted, I am not alone, I belong to the group and, I am valuable.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Claire:</speaker>
<p>After a few months, I tried to connect with my original family and friends who accepted and supported me. They provided material and emotional support that helped me recover from the trauma (IPV). I have become better year by year. If I did not have these supports, I may still remain in the bad condition.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another aspect of recognizing the imperfect self involved the participants maintaining self-awareness when they had a negative image of themselves. By maintaining self-awareness, participants were able to focus on a positive inner strength, which enabled them to keep going, and commit to changing their ways of life. They experienced self-value in the process of change.</p>

<p>Others have criticized me. Sometimes I criticize myself for being unable to overcome the problem. I ask myself, “Do I really have the ability to resolve the problem? Am I really useless? Am I really a bad woman?” I thought I was useless and sad.

<title>Theme 4: Embodying the Self by Helping Others</title>
<p>Participants expressed the need to create a significant life to feel self-worth, and gain the meaning of existence. They embodied the self through the process of helping others. In the process of recovery, participants sought to share experiences of change in their lives as one way to provide others with the type of support that they needed. The affirmation of others was a source of self-worth for participants. Participants hoped they had the ability to help others even though they were not wealthy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>From the participants’ perspective, recovery was regarded as women who rebuilt their self-value and gained the meaning of existence. The recovery process is not a linear progression depending on the feelings and thoughts changing in reaction to a cumulative experience. The findings in our study suggest that reconstructing the self is the core element of recovering from an abusive marital relationship, similar to the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512448851">Shamai (2000)</xref>. Reconstructing the self requires focusing on individual inner strength and potential. Reconstruction actively uses social resources to obtain the desired support; and affirmation to reconnect relationships with others, and rebuild the positive self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512448851">Tsai, 2005</xref>). In the recovery process, abused women reconstructed the view toward self. The findings are similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512448851">Fleury, Sedikides, and Lunsford (2001)</xref>, who noted that the women played an essential role in regulating their own personal thoughts, motivations, and decision-making activities related to the formulation of goals for recovery from both physiological and psychological stress. Reconstructing the self is necessary to help abused women heal from IPV.</p>
<p>Women used the term <italic>feeling shame</italic> to describe their feelings. The theme shows that the strong sense of personal failure, self-blame, and low self-esteem resulting from IPV were influenced by cultural aspects toward IPV. In the patriarchal society of Taiwan, IPV is regarded as a family matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512448851">Huang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512448851">Shen, 2011</xref>). Traditional Taiwanese sayings include, “Beating is intimacy, and scolding is love,” which cause the wife to believe that the husband has more power in the relationship. Occasional wife-beating was justified and accepted in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512448851">Huang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512448851">Tang, Wong, &amp; Cheung, 2002</xref>). Taiwanese women’s perceptions of marriage and family include the belief of having only “one man in a lifetime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448851">Hsu, 1998</xref>). When a wife experiences an abusive husband, she is expected to stay in the marriage relationship to keep the family intact and maintain family harmony. Once a woman is labeled by others as abused, her behaviors will be judged by others. Under patriarchal systems, abused women often face numerous life events that challenge her recovery from IPV. IPV continues to influence many Taiwanese women who have married into more traditional families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512448851">Hsu, Kahn, &amp; Huang, 2002</xref>). In traditional Taiwanese society, the society negatively views divorced women and their entire family. The divorce harms the reputation of the family and causes distress for the woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512448851">Huang, 2005</xref>). As a result, the abused woman blames herself and feels useless and stigmatized for her experience. To protect herself from the stigma, the abused woman refrains from sharing her emotions with others, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512448851">Shen (2011)</xref> described previously. However, the reasons for feeling shame in this study are different from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger’s (1989)</xref> study of American abusive women because the women Landenburger’s study felt ashamed because they were victims. The participants in this study felt shame because of their failed marital relationship and failure to meet the expectations of the traditional female role. We found that women became isolated, lost social support, and sometimes used a maladaptive coping method (e.g., drinking), which extended the period of suffering. If women can recognize that IPV is not their fault, ending a marriage relationship may become an acceptable alternative, which could be discussed openly; their suffering and mental and physical problems could be better managed.</p>
<p>“Creating mastery” was important for women recovering from abusive marital relationships. All of the participants reported economic difficulty and parenting problem led to poor mental health and felt loss of control in many aspects of their daily lives. During their struggle for survival, many participants expressed that they became self-aware of their own needs and desires. They equipped themselves by increasing their potential and abilities, and by readjusting their attitudes and flexibility to better control their lives. During their journey to recovery, women sought psychological and material support, individually and in groups, to create mastery, similar to the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448851">Taylor (2004)</xref>. They mastered and coped effectively with their stress and frustration, which allowed them to feel useful and increase their self-esteem. Available community resources (e.g., financial support), social support, and gaining self-determination are important for recovery of women who have left abusive relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important finding of our study was “recognizing the imperfect self”, which meant that women accepted that they did not meet the expectations of others. They became aware of their own limitations, made the necessary changes, maintained a positive attitude, and felt comfortable in different situations by getting support from others. Most of the participants participated in support groups, and developed a support system to rely on when necessary. This finding supports Farrell’s findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">1996b</xref>), which emphasized the importance of abused women’s sense of self. This finding also reconfirmed the importance of the participants’ self-awareness of their problems, and their discovery of their own needs and desires. The participants’ self-awareness enabled them to make the necessary changes, and to overcome barriers during the recovery process. They accepted the changing self by reconfirming and rebuilding the self. As a result, they experienced self-value in the process of change. The length of time required for successful recovery was specific to the women’s personal situations. For example, in this study, the women who acquired traditional female role expectations needed to spend more time to be aware of their own needs than women without rigid traditional gender role expectation.</p>
<p>“Embodying the self by helping others” is the other way participants rebuilt their self-value, and life meaning. After leaving the abusive relationship, women learned to believe and rely on themselves, and look forward to their future. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell’s (1996a)</xref> study, when faced with failed marital relationships, participants in this study demonstrated a need to reconnect the relationship between self and others during the recovery process. Some participants tried to connect with their original family and friends who accepted and supported them. Some participants took part in group social interactions, which provided an opportunity to regain a positive identity. They embodied the self by volunteering to help others find their self-worth.</p>
<p>Our study findings are similar to previous studies related to the recovery experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448851">Taylor, 2004</xref>), demonstrating that abused women were influenced by cultural shame and struggled for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger, 1989</xref>), equipped themselves for increasing their mastery by enhancing individual potential and ability and actively seeking resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448851">Taylor, 2004</xref>), and rebuilt their self-value and life meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448851">Taylor, 2004</xref>). The major difference compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448851">Farrell, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448851">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448851">Landenburger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448851">Taylor, 2004</xref>) was the reason for cultural shame and self-awareness in the recovery process was more influential for women who had a more rigid traditional female role. Hence, it is important to pay attention to issues related to culture and gender and whether or not self-discovery is desired during abused Taiwanese women’s recovering processes after terminating abusive relationships. Moreover, our findings suggest that it is important to change social norms through gender equality training on school and community, education appropriate responses to victim/survivors of IPV for the health care professionals. Positive community attitudes and leadership about the public obligation to assist abused women can support personal strength. It provides the chances of success in reconnecting women to their family and society, and reconstructing the self.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Studies</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, the generalization of these findings to other settings is limited. This limitation is primarily due to the small sample size, and the fact that the participants were drawn from two facilities in southern Taiwan. Our initial plan was to recruit at least ten participants in this study, but the majority of eligible women refused to be interviewed because they did not want to recall the bad memory. Although there were likenesses and congruence between the participants, saturation might not have been achieved. Nevertheless, this sample size (eight participants) may supply a suitable amount of information in qualitative, exploratory studies that aim to understand abused women’s experiences and guide future research according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448851">McCracken’s (1988)</xref> estimation. The findings are restricted to other abused women who live in similar circumstances. However, important insights can be drawn from the findings that women’s experiences of recovery were influenced by the social and cultural contexts in which they live. Second, selection bias in this qualitative research cannot be ruled out. For example, women who were not seeking help from the women’s association or Domestic Violence Prevention Center may have been less likely to participate. Furthermore, all participants were willing to participate in this study and were altruistic, which also may have led to selection bias. Third, memory recalls error maybe existence in this retrospective study. Finally, all of the participants had children. Children who have witnessed IPV are more likely to have developmental and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512448851">McFarlane, Groff, O’Brien, &amp; Watson, 2003</xref>). Women are not only dealing with their own problems, but also worrying about their children’s developmental problems. Thus, the results of this study may differ from abused women without children because children are an important factor in the recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512448851">Boyd, Scharer, Baliko, &amp; Mackey, 2009</xref>). Future research is suggested to compare the recovery experiences between abused women with and without children. To gain a broad picture of abused women’s recovery experiences after they have terminated an abusive relationship, cross-cultural differences may need more exploration in future studies.</p>

<sec id="section14-0886260512448851">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The findings in this study revealed that reconstructing the self plays an advantageous role for women recovering from abusive relationships. Health care professionals (e.g., clinicians, nurses, social workers, and shelter workers) working with women who have left abusive relationships need to address complex issues related to culture, gender, and chronic posttraumatic stress reactions. To assist abused women in overcoming their feelings of shame, health care professionals should help abused women find their self-value, be alert to the women’s psychosocial responses following the trauma, and design an appropriate intervention that emphasizes psychological support.</p>
<p>In assisting women to equip themselves for increasing their mastery and recognizing the imperfect self during the recovery process, health care professionals can empower women’s potential strengths, guide women’s goal setting, and provide resources for assisting women to manage their loss and stress; and to accept their limitations. Interventions may include an assessment of current and future goals for recovery, the provision of social resources for creating mastery, and the rebuilding of valuable relationships in their lives. For women in this study, participating in support groups provided an opportunity to openly share their experiences with others who had similar experiences and concerns. Embodying the self by helping others (e.g., volunteering) can enhance a woman’s self-value and help her gain a meaningful life.</p>
<p>For the current study, there is no specific time frame of recovery from IPV. To understand the recovery process of each woman’s situation is important for health care professionals. Health care professionals may gain insights from how abused women reconstruct themselves during recovering process and encourage them to reevaluate self as a valuable person and discover the meaning of life. In addition, health care professionals can support women in finding the service that will best help them, such as housing, child care, law consulting, and job in the initial recovering. Interventions should be developed that fit individual needs, and allow sufficient time for women to recover from IVP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0886260512448851" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, an abused woman’s sense of self is the essential strength that enables a woman who has terminated her abusive relationship to overcome many hardships. A woman’s recovery from IPV is associated with her sociocultural viewpoint toward IPV, negative aspects of self, and multiple problems in daily life. Health care professionals should be competent in primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions when working with women affected by IPV, and they must have the necessary skills to discuss moral principles, suffering, and IPV with an attitude free of prejudice. Reconstructing the self in the context of intervention should be taken into consideration.</p>
