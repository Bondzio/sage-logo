<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>Fibroblast activity promotes adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling that underlies the development of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent stimulus for fibrosis, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases(ERK) 1/2 pathway also contributes to the fibrotic response. The thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), has been shown to play an important role in the excessive fibrosis in different tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a PAR1 inhibitor, SCH79797, on cardiac fibrosis, tissue stiffness and postinfarction remodeling, and effects of PAR1 inhibition on thrombin-induced TGF-β and (ERK) 1/2 activities in cardiac fibroblasts.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We used a rat model of myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury, isolated cardiac fibroblasts, and 3-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue models fabricated to ascertain the contribution of PAR1 activation on cardiac fibrosis and LV remodeling.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The PAR1 inhibitor attenuated LV dilation and improved LV systolic function of the reperfused myocardium at 28 days. This improvement was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in scar size (%LV) from 23 ± % in the control group (n = 10) to 16% ± 5.5% in the treated group (n = 9; <italic>P</italic> = .052). In the short term, the PAR1 inhibitor did not rescue infarct size or LV systolic function after 3 days. The PAR1 inhibition abolished thrombin-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TGF-β and type I procollagen production, matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 activation, myofibroblasts transformation in vitro, and abrogated the remodeling of 3D tissues induced by chronic thrombin treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>These studies suggest PAR1 inhibition initiated after ischemic injury attenuates adverse LV remodeling through late-stage antifibrotic events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) continues to decline, while the incidence of heart failure post-MI has remained fairly consistent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074248413485434">1</xref>
</sup> The number of heart failure hospitalizations remains unchanged,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074248413485434">2</xref>
</sup> and the long-term prognosis for patients with acute heart failure remains poor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074248413485434">3</xref>
</sup> Cardiac fibrosis is now widely recognized as part of the pathogenesis of post-MI remodeling and heart failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074248413485434">4</xref>
</sup> After MI, the infarct border zone is infiltrated by neutrophils and macrophages. Cardiac fibroblasts transform into myofibroblasts and migrate into the border zone, where they promote contraction of the scar. Myofibroblasts, detected by the presence of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), represent the main cell type involved in the development of fibrosis by increasing the production of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074248413485434">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074248413485434">6</xref>
</sup> expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enhanced collagen deposition, and contraction of the surrounding matrix.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248413485434">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) has been described as the most highly expressed G-protein-coupled receptor in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248413485434">8</xref>
</sup> Activation of PAR1 on neonatal cardiac fibroblasts leads to transient increase in intracellular calcium and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation, increased DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074248413485434">9</xref>
</sup> The ERK1/2 signaling has been identified as a critical pathway in PAR1-mediated profibrotic activities in lung fibrosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074248413485434">10</xref>
</sup>; however, PAR1-induced fibrotic activities in the heart have not been previously explored.</p>
<p>The PAR1 has been implicated in acute and chronic cardiac injury. The PAR1 is upregulated and activated in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074248413485434">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074248413485434">12</xref>
</sup> We have previously shown that PAR1 inhibition prior to myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (IR) decreases infarct size acutely in rats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074248413485434">13</xref>
</sup> In contrast, PAR1-deficient mice subjected to IR were not protected from acute myocardial injury, yet these mice were found to have reduced left ventricular (LV) dilation and preserved cardiac function after 2 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248413485434">14</xref>
</sup> Cardiac-specific overexpression of PAR1 induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248413485434">14</xref>
</sup> Likewise, Jaffre et al more recently showed that upregulation of MMP-13 in a nonischemic heart failure model promotes cardiac hypertrophy through PAR1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074248413485434">15</xref>
</sup> Although these studies clearly implicate that injury-induced PAR1 activation leads to cardiac injury and hypertrophy, the contribution of PAR1 activation in cardiac fibrosis and in cardiac fibroblast activities has not been investigated previously.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the ERK1/2 pathway was responsible for PAR1-mediated remodeling activities of cardiac fibroblasts including myofibroblast transformation, collagen synthesis, and matrix remodeling. Therefore, we sought to determine whether chronic treatment with a PAR1 inhibitor after IR injury attenuates myocardial fibrosis and improves LV remodeling activities to maintain cardiac function. To analyze PAR1-mediated profibrotic activities in fibroblasts, we used isolated cells and 3-dimensional (3D) tissue models to determine the effects of PAR1 on cellular contractility and tissue remodeling.</p>

<title>Rat Model of Myocardial IR Injury and LV Remodeling</title>
<p>Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats at 8 weeks of age (250-300 g) used in this study received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals formulated by the National Research Council (1996). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical College of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>To determine whether PAR1 inhibition would limit LV remodeling in vivo, we used a rat model of ischemia caused by 30 minutes of left coronary artery (LCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion. Transient LCA occlusion was performed for the determination of the area at risk (AAR) and infarct size described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074248413485434">16</xref>
</sup> In the acute IR study, the rats were divided into 2 groups (IR + placebo and IR + PAR1 inhibitor; n = 6/group) and underwent 30-minute LCA occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. The PAR1 inhibitor, SCH79797 (25 µg/kg) was injected 15 seconds after the onset of reperfusion. For each chronic study (3 days and 28 days), the animals were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 12/group; 1) Sham-operated + placebo (Sham), (2) Sham-operated + PAR1 inhibitor (Sham + PAR Inh), (3) IR + placebo (IR), and (4) IR + PAR1 inhibitor (IR + PAR Inh). Rats in the treated groups received a bolus dose of the SCH79797 (25 µg/kg; intraperitoneally [ip]) 15 seconds after the onset of reperfusion followed with a continuous SCH79797 infusion (25 µg/kg/d; ip) via osmotic pumps (Alzet, Cupertino, California) for 3 or 28 days. Sham and IR rats received an equivalent volume of sterile saline as placebo. Sham-operated rats did not undergo coronary artery occlusion.</p>
<p>Systolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured by a computerized tail-cuff system (Visitech Systems, Apex, North Carolina), as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074248413485434">17</xref>
</sup> Extracted lungs were weighed before and after drying at 90°C for 48 hours. The dry to wet ratio was calculated as an index for pulmonary edema.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074248413485434">18</xref>
</sup> Six hearts from each group were harvested by the end of the observation period for histology and infarct size measurements; the remaining hearts were used for biochemical and molecular assays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1074248413485434">
<title>Infarct Size and Histological Analysis</title>
<p>At the end of 120-minute reperfusion, the coronary artery was reoccluded, and the AAR zone was delineated by intravenous injection of 0.5% Evans blue. Hearts were sectioned and incubated in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 37°C) for 15 minutes to define white necrotic tissue when fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours. Infarct size, AAR, and LV area were determined by computerized planimetry using J-Image 1.45-s software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland). In the acute studies, AAR was consistent between the groups (55.3 ± 2.77 as a % LV).</p>
<p>To visualize cardiac infarct and scarring in the chronic studies, heart sections were prepared as described previously<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074248413485434">19</xref>
</sup> and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or picrosirius red. The infarcted area to LV ratio was determined by planimetry as above. At 28 days, the collagen content in the scarred areas was determined using MetaVue Imaging System (Version 5.0r1, 2002) color threshold function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074248413485434">20</xref>
</sup> The infarct or scar area was then calculated as a percentage of the total LV area. The border zone was defined as the total myocardial area containing the scar. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an anti-α-SMA antibody (A2547, Sigma, St Louis, Missouri).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074248413485434">21</xref>
</sup> Quantification of myofibroblast density in the border zone was performed using MetaVue. Three random images of the infarct border zone (×20 magnification) were selected and thresholded for calculation of the percentage of the stained area.<sup>

<sec id="section5-1074248413485434">
<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in anesthetized (2% isoflurane) animals at baseline and during reperfusion (at 3 days and 28 days). Measurements and data analyses were performed by an investigator (L.M.H.) blinded to the study groups. Animals were studied in the left lateral decubitus position with a commercially available echocardiographic system (Vivid 7, General Electric, with an 11-MHz M12-L linear array transducer, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074248413485434">23</xref>
</sup> From the cardiac short axis at papillary level, an M-mode trace of the LV was obtained; left ventricular end diastole diameter and systole were measured. The LV ejection fraction (EF) was measured by Simpson method from 2-dimensional parasternal long- and short-axis (basal, mid, and apical level) views, as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074248413485434">24</xref>
</sup> The LV mass was derived from the anteroseptal thickness (AST) and inferolateral thickness (ILT) using the formula: 0.8 (1.04[(ILT + LVIDd + AST)<sup>3</sup> − LVIDd<sup>3</sup>]) + 0.6.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074248413485434">24</xref>
</sup> Three consecutive heart beats were measured and averaged.</p>

<sec id="section6-1074248413485434">
<title>Cell and Tissue Culture</title>
<p>Adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were prepared and cultured as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074248413485434">25</xref>
</sup> Briefly, the left ventricles were isolated from excised rat hearts, minced, and digested in 0.1% collagenase type II (Gibco, Grand Island, New York) and 0.25% trypsin. The cells were plated in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and after 60 minutes the unattached or weakly attached cells were removed.</p>
<p>To extrapolate changes in mechanical properties of myocardium initiated by cardiac fibroblast activities, 3D-engineered tissues were fabricated by embedding the isolated cardiac fibroblasts in collagen hydrogels as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074248413485434">26</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074248413485434">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, the cells were mixed with neutralized rat tail collagen (1 mg/mL; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) and DMEM containing 10% FBS. A small amount (250 µL) of this solution was poured into each well of an 8-well polycarbonate mold and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes to allow the cells to become trapped within the polymerized collagen matrix. The tissues were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37°C for 2 to 3 days. During this time, the entrapped cells (1 million cells/1 mL gel solution) remodel and compact the tissue by cell traction force. Final concentrations of cells and collagen in the remodeled samples are ∼18 million/mL and ∼18 mg/mL, respectively. For mechanical measurements, culture medium was switched to a HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4. All cardiac fibroblast tissues were prepared identically and tested following 2 to 3 days of incubation. Therefore, the size of each cardiac fibroblast tissue including its cross-sectional area was almost identical. The stiffness of the 3D-engineered tissue was measured by a probe connected to isometric force transducer using a device described previously<sup>

<title>Treatment of Rat Cardiac Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Cardiac fibroblasts from third to fifth passages were seeded and grown to 70% confluence in 60-mm plates (for protein analysis) and 96-well plates (for collagen synthesis assays). After serum starving, the cells were treated with thrombin (10 U/mL) or a PAR1-activating peptide (TFLLR-amide, 100 μmol/L; Bachem, Torrance, California) with or without inhibitors (PD98059, 20 μmol/L or SCH79797, 1 μmol/L) for either 5 minutes (for Western blot analysis) or 24 hours (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and zymography).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major novel finding of this study was that chronic PAR1 inhibition improved LV remodeling and preserved LV function in the reperfused myocardium. After myocardial IR and infiltration of the infarct border zone by neutrophils and macrophages, cardiac fibroblasts transform into myofibroblasts and migrate into the border zone where they promote contraction of the scar. Myofibroblasts are the main source of extracellular matrix proteins in the infarcted and remodeled heart. Selective activation of the TGF-β pathway in the infarct border zone is critically involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic cardiac remodeling and contributes to the development of cardiac dysfunction following reperfused infarction by enhancing collagen deposition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074248413485434">29</xref>
</sup> We now report that several essential phenotypic and functional alterations of cardiac fibroblasts—key players in developing fibrotic remodeling—are dependent on PAR1 activation. In isolated cardiac fibroblasts, thrombin promotes myofibroblast transformation, PAR1- and ERK1/2-dependent upregulation of TGF-β, and procollagen secretion as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Furthermore, PAR1 inhibition abolishes the thrombin-mediated contraction and stiffening of 3D engineered cardiac fibroblasts tissues, indicating the functional antagonism of profibrotic events by PAR1 inhibition. These findings implicate that thrombin through PAR1 deregulate matrix synthetic function. The inhibition of PAR1 in vivo results in the reduction of LV replacement fibrosis and remodeling after IR.</p>

<title>Effect of PAR1 Inhibition on Infarct Size and LV remodeling</title>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248413485434">14</xref>
</sup> These differences may be explained by differences in species or model used or may reflect the ability of the PAR1-deficient mouse to compensate for lack of PAR1 signaling. Regardless, the PAR1 inhibitor when given after the onset of reperfusion did not result in an acute (2 hours) decrease in the infarct size nor did it affect the size of MI and severity of inflammation 3 days later in this study. In addition, our postsurgery mortality was equal between Sham and IR + PAR Inh groups, indicating that even with PAR1 inhibition initial scar formation was adequate to allow wound healing sufficiently to prevent cardiac rupture. Previous studies that used peptide agonists and or PAR1-deficient mice have shown that the effect of thrombin-mediated inflammation is dependent upon PAR1.<sup>

</p>
<p>Sun Y et al observed the appearance of TGF-β mRNA in infarcted rat myocardium on the second day and myofibroblasts on the third day from the beginning of reperfusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074248413485434">21</xref>
</sup> The blockade of PAR1 receptors in our study did not slow appearance of myofibroblasts. It suggests that secretion of TGF-β was sufficient to stimulate the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, despite the blockade of PAR1 receptors. This result is consistent with previous studies on transgenic mice with a deficiency of PAR1 receptors in which PAR1<sup>−/−</sup> fibroblasts did not respond to thrombin but responded to TGF-β.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074248413485434">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Chronic PAR1 inhibition prevented the dilation of left ventricle. This indicates the important role of PAR1 in the pathogenesis of remodeling in the later stages of healing during myocardial reperfusion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transition from the phase of inflammation into the proliferative phase manifested with decline in the secretion of TGF-β after 7 days coupled with a decrease in macrophage infiltration 2 weeks after reperfusion. Collagen accumulation at the site begins by day 7.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074248413485434">21</xref>
</sup> Based on the results of our 28-day observation, the PAR1 inhibitor, although not significantly reducing total infarct size, limited the transmurality of the scar. We speculate that PAR1 inhibition may mediate a reduction in inflammation and collagen deposition after 3 days to attenuate adverse remodeling. However, we cannot disregard the significant increase in mean BP in the IR group when compared to the IR + PAR Inh group. Theoretically, the increased afterload in the placebo-treated animals could also contribute to LV remodeling.</p>
<p>The information obtained by echocardiography substantiates these findings. The LV infarct and associated wall motion abnormalities was confirmed by echocardiography at 3 days. This was associated with a similar decrease in LV EF in the IR and IR + PAR Inh. Early in the course of reperfusion (3 days), PAR1 inhibition was not able to prevent the initial decrease in LV function, but when continued over 28 days, it improved the LV function significantly. The improvement in LV remodeling and function did not result from a reduction in initial infarct size but more likely from a decrease in infarct expansion. The clinical importance of this study lies with the efficacy of postischemic PAR1 inhibition on preserving LV function. Therefore, the PAR1 inhibition may be an effective treatment to improve prognosis after ischemic episodes.</p>

<title>PAR1 Inhibition Decreases a Thrombin-Mediated Fibrotic Phenotype in Cardiac Fibroblasts</title>
<p>A recent study shows that PAR1 is the most abundant G-coupled protein receptor on the cardiac fibroblast, and its activation regulates the myofibroblast transformation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074248413485434">31</xref>
</sup> We have shown that PAR1 inhibition attenuated thrombin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TGF-β secretion in cardiac fibroblasts as well as type I procollagen production. The PAR1 inhibition also abolished the thrombin-mediated activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9, the primary MMP involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. The data indicate the importance of ERK1/2 signaling in PAR1-mediated upregulation in tissue-remodeling activities including collagen synthesis and MMP-2/9 enzyme activates by the cardiac fibroblasts. Although the tissue-remodeling activities can be detected biochemically at a cellular level, the detection of their functional phenotypes is not possible by a conventional 2D cell culture system. To determine the functional significance of PAR1-mediated signaling in the tissue remodeling, we used a 3D cell culture system below.</p>
<p>Thrombin stimulation of the 3D engineered tissue increased tissue stiffness and cell contraction, indicating significant remodeling of collagen matrix by cellular activities. These PAR1-mediated tissue remodeling activities suggest that PAR1 signaling is a critical initiator in stiffening the engineered tissues, which conceptually mimic the myocardial stiffening that slows diastolic relaxation. Normalization of the tissue stiffening by the PAR1 inhibitor suggests an inhibition of PAR1 signaling in cardiac fibroblasts may alleviate the tissue stiffening in cardiac fibrosis. Treatment with the PAR1-activating peptide also increases tissue stiffness, although it did not reach significance. This is most likely due to several limitations of the PAR1-activating peptides. Although they are specific for activation of PAR1, they signal preferentially through G<sub>q</sub> proteins, whereas thrombin activation of PAR1 signals preferentially through G<sub>12/13</sub> proteins and ρ activation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074248413485434">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074248413485434">33</xref>
</sup> In addition, the peptides may not diffuse as readily throughout the 3D tissue culture as the small molecule PAR1 inhibitor.</p>
<p>Although the detectable signaling events in the myocardium at 28 days were unchanged on average, fibroblast-specific signaling could initiate the myocardial remodeling after IR. In our cellular and tissue models, we have shown that thrombin activated PAR1 and its downstream profibrotic activities. However, a detailed mechanism by which PAR1 is activated in vivo after ischemia injury and during remodeling is not clear. Transgenic mice overexpressing PAR1 on cardiomyocytes develop an eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248413485434">14</xref>
</sup> The deletion of the tissue factor gene in these mice decreases the hypertrophy. This would suggest that low levels of thrombin are generated in the normal myocardium in a tissue factor-dependent manner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248413485434">14</xref>
</sup> The same group showed extravascular fibrin deposition in the rabbit myocardium subject to IR, which suggested coagulation factors gain access to the extravascular space from the damaged endothelial barrier.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074248413485434">34</xref>
</sup> In addition, MMP-1 has been shown to cleave and activate PAR1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074248413485434">35</xref>
</sup> As MMP-1 becomes upregulated in the early stages of repair after ischemia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074248413485434">21</xref>
</sup> it may activate PAR1 and contribute to replacement fibrosis and infarct expansion. Nevertheless, the continued activation of PAR1 in the myocardium may be contributing to excess fibrosis and scarring after ischemic injury. Notwithstanding the activation mechanisms, pharmacological inhibition of PAR1 activation or its downstream signaling could be an effective treatment option.</p>

<title>Limitations in Current Analysis</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. It is not clear whether in vivo cardioprotection by SCH79797 is shared by other PAR1 antagonists. It has been suggested that SCH79797 may have nonspecific effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074248413485434">36</xref>
</sup> The SCH79797 was characterized initially on human platelets as a competitive inhibitor of the PAR1-selective peptide agonist for binding to the receptor, with IC50 values of 70 nmol/L.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074248413485434">27</xref>
</sup> De Serio et al found that SCH79797 inhibited the growth of PAR1-null fibroblasts at concentrations exceeding 100 nmol/L.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074248413485434">36</xref>
</sup> They also found 150 nmol/L SCH79797 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PAR1-null fibroblasts stimulated with 10% FBS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074248413485434">36</xref>
</sup> In our studies, we used an in vitro and an equivalent in vivo dose of 1 µmol/L, therefore, we cannot rule out nonselective effects of SCH79797. We have previously shown that SCH79797 is a competitive antagonist with a specific PAR1 activating peptide in our IR model, indicating that the effects of SCH79797 are at least in part through PAR1 in this model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074248413485434">13</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, in our fibroblast cell culture studies, we have shown SCH79797 is working through PAR1.</p>
<p>Due to limitations in our study protocols, we used different methods to measure infarct size acutely and at 3 and 28 days. We did not design the study to measure AAR at 3 and 28 days, and we used the border zone + scar as a surrogate marker of AAR at 28 days. It is well known that the amount of AAR determines the infarct size. Although our AAR was consistent in our acute studies, and our technique was the same for acute or chronic studies, we cannot exclude the possibility that the AAR was smaller in our chronic studies accounting for the change in infarct size at 28 days. However, since our infarct size did not change at 3 days, most likely the trend toward a smaller scar size at 28 days is due to an inhibition of scar expansion. Furthermore, we were able to verify the infarcted territory by echocardiogram at 3 days. We did not infuse paraffin into the hearts under end-diastolic pressure and because some distortional effects of dehydration and shrinkage associated with embedding could not be avoided, our histological measures may not exactly reflect in vivo changes. Still, we did have a satisfactory correlation between the histological and echocardiography data that we obtained.</p>
<p>We did not assess whether administering the PAR1 inhibitor at a later time point (i.e. 3-7 days after reperfusion) prevents remodeling. Our initiation of treatment occurred within seconds of reperfusion. Another limitation of the present study is the use of otherwise healthy animals to investigate the chronic pathophysiology of IR injury. Most patients with cardiac disease have a variety of risk factors (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes). It may not be possible to realize a significant benefit in the setting of myocardial IR in such individuals. However, since PAR1 expression has been associated with end-stage congestive heart failure,<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Previously, PAR1 inhibition has been shown to limit IR injury when rats were treated immediately before and during ischemia injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074248413485434">13</xref>
</sup> Our present data show that the postischemia PAR1 inhibition may not limit initial IR injury but can downregulate the downstream signaling activities of PAR1 in cardiac fibroblasts to attenuate cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Targeting PAR1 signaling can be a novel strategy to protect against postischemic LV remodeling and failure. Although, there has been no clinical application of the PAR1 inhibitor used in this study (SCH79797) at present; 2 other PAR1 inhibitors, SCH 530348 and E5555, developed for antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease are undergoing clinical evaluation.<sup>
