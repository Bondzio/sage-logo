<abstract>
<p>This column presents an improvisation game designed to be played by any two musicians from beginner through professional skill level. The author argues that two aspects are critical for success: one, an understanding of the creative power of limits; and, two, the importance of framing the activity as a game. The game, based on the limit of the major scale, is explained, and variations are provided to promote further exploration and development. The column also discusses the importance of improvisation in a social context, as well as the role of the teacher as careful listener.</p>

<p>Above all, improvisation in music education should be promoted so that students can express musical ideas. Not merely individual ideas, as can happen when a composer sits alone, but ideas that emerge in social interaction with others. To improvise together is to bring to music the social pleasures we often experience through good conversations or a “pickup game” of baseball. To bring musical improvisation to schools holds the promise of promoting, as put in the title of Eleanor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311435523">Duckworth’s (1987)</xref> wonderful essay, “The Having of Wonderful Ideas.”</p>
<p>In this column, I present a favorite improvisation game, a simple game for piano duo that is easy to learn and fun to play. It can be played by those without music education, as well as those hampered by too much of the wrong kind of music education. I learned it in 1999 from Herb Henke during summer study at Carnegie Mellon University during my certificate studies in Dalcroze Eurythmics. In working with beginning piano improvisers, Herb had us play together at first, but his goal was for us to play solo. Although I do believe that independence is of value—and know his goals were to have students improvising for movement—I believe the social possibilities of playing this game together have become for me the best part.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this particular game because I find it to be a pedagogic gem: Despite the ease of learning and pleasure in playing, I find it elicits rich reflections and deep conversations about what improvisation can be. The game is so simple that it does not even have a name, but it has helped my students become musicians with ideas and has helped them experience the type of reflective thinking in action and careful listening that characterizes much musical improvisation. Two particular aspects seem to me critical to making this activity great: the power of limits and the importance of framing this as a game.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311435523">
<title>The Power of Limits and the Pleasures of Games</title>
<p>This game is built around the major scale. Although some may imagine this to be too constricting, in practice I have found that students thrive within a structure that provides space for imagination within limits. Stephen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311435523">Nachmanovitch (1991)</xref> discusses the power of limits, describing their value for players in the <italic>temenos</italic>, a Greek term he uses to describe a sacred space for creativity that improvisers can create for themselves:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Limits yield intensity. When we play in the <italic>temenos</italic> defined by our self-chosen rules, we find that containment of strength amplifies strength. Commitment to a set of rules (a game) frees your play to attain a profundity and vigor otherwise impossible. (p. 84)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311435523">Nachmanovitch (1991)</xref> beautifully explores how limits, including the limits of making music with fingers and thumbs, help shape and free the work we do. Speaking specifically of scales, he notes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Beethoven crafted his own music, to an amazing extent, of nothing but scales. We generally think of scales as the most elementary or boring element of music. But in Beethoven’s hands, a scale is never just a scale. It is a whole natural phenomenon unto itself, like a flight of birds or mountain range. Each note is personal, assuming an individual weight, balance, texture, and color in relation to its fellows, such as is only possible in living organisms: context within context, ever shifting, sensual. (pp. 86–87)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Keeping this vision of the scale in mind can help avoid the pitfall of thinking of this game as glorified Czerny exercises. To think of the scale in the way Beethoven presented it, with each note unique in its relation to other notes, is to invite exactly the kind of deep listening that should be the aim of all improvisation.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding the power of limits, it is critical to think of and frame this activity as a <italic>game</italic>, rather than an exercise or a drill. A game is something we do for pleasure, for our own enjoyment, for our own enrichment. A drill is something we do for some other time and place or even a goal that may never be achieved. A game is often played with others, and much of the pleasure in the playing comes from a set of conventions that allow us to play together. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311435523">Dewey (1938)</xref> invoked games as a model for schools, suggesting they provide a useful example of a way to organize joint cooperative action superior to authority and personal will:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are certain fairly obvious controlling features of such situations to which I want to call attention. The first is that the rules are part of the game. They are not outside of it. No rules, then no game; different rules, then a different game. As long as the game goes on with the reasonable smoothness, the players do not feel that they’re submitting to external imposition but that they are playing the game. (pp. 52–53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rules make the game, and the game makes the play. That it is a game makes it playful and also makes it so that the players wish to follow the rules. I also believe that framing this as a game keeps the joy up front while helping those students who might worry too much about failure to focus more on the pleasures to be had.</p>

<title>How to Play</title>
<p>In addition to the following description, be sure to listen to the podcast that supplements this column for aural examples and discussion. (found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) Two people sit together at the piano, beginning and ending their playing together. One, seated on the left plays up and down the C-major scale using half notes, improvising only in later stages (see the first variation later in this column). While this bass line is being played, the player on the treble side improvises a rhythm in contrary motion, covering two octaves of the C-major scale, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371311435523">Figure 1</xref>. Especially during the beginning phases, the two players should switch roles frequently.</p>

</fig>
<p>In other words, the bass player presents a steady scale while the partner improvises a rhythm using two octaves of the same scale. The contrary motion is pleasing to the ear, and the strict limit of the scale allows one to quickly develop a sense of intentionality, thus determining moves that make sense. Many students initially struggle to reach the goal notes with their partner, but within a turn or two are able to do so, tuned in socially to their partner and also musically to the form of the game.</p>

<sec id="section3-1048371311435523">
<title>The Role of the Teacher</title>
<p>All would agree that improvisation is learned, but some question whether it can be taught. Maud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311435523">Hickey (2009)</xref> suggests that the profession move toward a conception of teacher as a facilitator of improvisation experiences instead of using the name <italic>teacher</italic>. There is certainly tension between a more instruction-oriented vision of teaching and the idea that students should have their own musical ideas.</p>
<p>For this game, and many times in improvisation in general, I believe the first responsibility of the teacher is to listen closely and carefully and to use that listening to pose questions and make suggestions. When I play this game with students, I listen for several things. I listen for wonderful musical moments, so that we can discuss and honor them. I often notice a particular improvisational idea, such as syncopation or the suggestion of a certain mood, that can become a central theme to develop in a future improvisation. When students struggle, I hope to hear and understand some of the sources of their struggle so that I might suggest alternatives. I listen to hear when students become bored and then suggest a variation or extension to the rules of the game to bring about fresh inspiration.</p>
<p>From my listenings, and the modeling of the things that I hear and notice, grow conversations and discussions with other students who may not yet have had a chance to play the game. With these rules, it is possible for an observer to know when an improviser is playing mechanically and when an improviser is listening and playing with musicality and engagement. It is also possible to hear strategies, musical motives, rhythmic ideas, or a sense of humor or apprehension. All the things we hear when playing this game can be found in the larger world of improvisation, and the opportunity to discuss these and then listen to other improvised music assist in connecting the experiences of this game to the larger world.</p>
<p>Returning to the limits of the game, there is much richness available in using the major scale. Although our improvisations may not always have the richness that Nachmanovitch finds in Beethoven, I agree there is vastness within even the humble major scale. There are opportunities for students to start to listen closely to the counterpoint between bass and treble, listening for tension and resolution and for intervals and harmonies that delight the ear. Many of my students have been asked to play scales all their lives but have never been given the opportunity to “play with” the scale, and this game extends that invitation nicely. As Patricia Sheehan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311435523">Campbell (2009)</xref> notes, we not only learn to improvise, but we can improvise to learn about music.</p>

<sec id="section4-1048371311435523">
<title>Variations on the Game</title>
<p>One of the things that makes this game successful is the array of slight variations always available. These variations allow students opportunities to build confidence in their abilities and to explore new avenues. Each variation deserves some time and space to be explored, so trying just a few is great for a single session. Of course, everyone should be encouraged to imagine and play with other variations, limitations, and digressions. A few of the most interesting and enjoyable variations that have emerged in playing this game over the past 12 years include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371311435523" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Bass player improvisation</italic>: Usually very early in the game, I ask the bass player to improvise the articulation from staccato to legato, adding the rule that the treble improviser must follow the articulations. In this way, the bass player gets to contribute, and both players begin to improvise and interact with each other in rich ways. It often takes a few repetitions before players really begin to connect, but it is frequently one of the richest moments in this game. The bass player can also lead the dynamics or other expressive aspects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Repeated notes</italic>: Players often want to repeat a note, and this variation opens up a beautiful small corner of expression, often leading the improviser to experiment with rubato or create repetitive figures woven throughout their improvisation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Reversing direction</italic>: Departing from a strict performance of the scale, a wonderful variation is to allow the stepwise motion of the scale to be reversed, creating walking and wandering improvisations that move up and down the keyboard. From a pedagogic standpoint, it is important to note that students often naturally play more notes with this variation and that it is often valuable to perform at a slower tempo at first to allow for these. I often use this variation as an opportunity to have students work with very slow tempi, while focusing more on the harmonic counterpoint.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Melodic skips</italic>: Encouraging students to skip intervals, departing from a strict scalewise improvisation, can be a delight. Students with more experience might enjoy experimenting with arpeggios and exploring harmonic substitutions over the bass.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Different modes</italic>: The game enters an entirely different world when played over a different mode, which often simply involves shifting the game up or down the piano keyboard a few keys. All the modes are worth exploring, but I find the Phrygian mode and the harmonic minor to be especially wonderful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Chromatic notes</italic>: This variation can be wonderful and challenging. It is often hard to know how the chromatic note will sound before it is played, and playing the entire chromatic scale can become very mechanical. Students deserve an opportunity to explore chromaticism, and I often find student efforts can be productively directed by asking them to try to make their use of chromatic notes either more or less dissonant. It is possible to use chromatic notes, primarily as passing tones on unaccented beats, to enrich the sound; conversely, it can sound wonderful to emphasize dissonant chromatic notes. Play and exploration, and plenty of time to enjoy the sounds, are central.</p></list-item>

<title>The Freedom in the Game</title>
<p>To close, I return again to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311435523">Nachmanovitch (1991)</xref>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Improvisation is not in the end in the breaking with forms and limitations just to be “free,” but using them as the very means of transcending ourselves. If form is mechanically applied, it may indeed result in work that is conventional, if not pedantic or stupid. But form used well can become the very vehicle of freedom, of discovering the creative surprises that liberate mind-at-play. (p. 84)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I hope this column has provided a few avenues and considerations to allow willing teachers and students to play this game beyond the mechanical and the conventional. To be free within limits and with a focus on the game, educators can promote creativity where the ideas come from social engagement and careful listening. Creative surprises and wonderful ideas await those willing to play, to listen, and to work together toward a more open conception of music education.</p>
