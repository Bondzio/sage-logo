<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred off the Sanriku coast of Japan, which resulted in multiple tsunamis. The earthquake and tsunami damaged several nuclear power stations, with the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant being the worst affected, which led Japan to declare a State of Nuclear Emergency. As of November 9, 2011, the National Police Agency of Japan reported a death toll of 15 836 people, with 3664 people still reported missing, following the earthquake and tsunami.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453258">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Australia responded to the Japanese Government’s requests for assistance and deployed a 76-person Urban Search and Rescue Task Force from New South Wales to the worst tsunami affected area. Australian radiation health advisers were deployed on March 18, 2011, at the request of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to assist the Australian Embassy in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The roles of the Radiation Health Advisers were to provide radiation health advice to Australian Embassy staff, Australian citizens, and expatriates; to conduct a radiation risk assessment and develop and implement risk communication strategies; and to develop contingency plans in the event that the situation at the Fukushima plant worsened.</p>
<p>In a radiological emergency such as this, the population can be divided into various categories depending on their risk of suffering harm. The 3 key groups are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1010539512453258" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>those people closest to a source of radioactive material and/or the site of a nuclear emergency, who are at highest risk: these people may require radiation protection measures, such as shelter and evacuation, and medical treatment for their radiation exposure if there is significant irradiation or contamination;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>those people who are exposed to measurable amounts of radiation, but the exposure will only cause very low and/or unquantifiable risks to health in the short to medium term; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>people with no significant exposure to radiation from the emergency but whose behavior is adversely affected by their perception of the event, the risk to themselves or loved ones, or other psychological factors amenable to management by effective communication.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When an emergency is centered on a site, such as the Fukushima reactor fire, then these groups form concentric zones at increasing distance from the radioactive material or its plumes. If, however, the community is unknowingly exposed to a lost, stolen, or deliberately released source, such as occurred with the polonium-210 poisoning in London, then these categories may not be as clearly geographically defined, but there is still likely to be a gradation of risk based on activity of the source, expected proximity to the source, and duration of exposure.</p>
<p>The management of radiation protection and medical treatment for people in the highest risk category is conducted by appropriate radiation medical and scientific specialists. Public health services may also be important in these operations because they may need to ensure adequate safe food, sanitation, and medical services to evacuation centers but does not generally form part of the management of the incident itself.</p>
<p>In populations not at immediate risk of adverse health effects, public health agencies have an important role to play in managing a radiation emergency. The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-1010539512453258" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the public perception of radiation hazards, combined with the lack of definitive information that may occur in the early stages of managing a radiation emergency, can engender significant anxiety in the wider population;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the degree of exposure of people to radioactive material may not be known, as was the case in Fukushima, where radioactive material was dispersed in the atmosphere, water, or food; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>there may be a need to prepare the general population to move away from areas of risk, if an emergency worsens, without causing undue alarm or mass self-evacuation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Failure to manage the response of lower-risk groups can lead to a dysfunctional response by the public in response to the perceived radiological emergency. Poorly planned decisions by the public to self-evacuate from an area, when there is a low risk from radiation exposure, can be dangerous and may impair the response to an emergency. The unintended harms of risk avoidance on a population scale have been noted in other situations, with several thousand lives estimated to have been lost through the choice by travelers in the United States after the 9/11 attacks of more hazardous forms of road travel rather than air travel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453258">2</xref></sup> Similarly, refusal to enter an area or workplace as well as lack of confidence in food, water, or other products can cause unnecessary economic damage.</p>
<p>Public health communication, however, is not purely a matter of “calming people down.” It may be necessary to simultaneously provide reassurance to many people while providing some quite alarming information to others. These approaches need to be integrated to avoid inconsistent information, confusion, and a lack of confidence in the management of an incident.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to explore the challenges of risk assessment, risk communication, and contingency planning for expatriate Australian staff in the worst nuclear incident since Chernobyl, outline what measures were successful in addressing heightened perceived risks, and identify areas where further research is required, particularly in a radiological incident response context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539512453258" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Radiation health advisers were deployed to the Australian Embassy in Tokyo for 3 weeks from March 18, 2011. The 2 advisers who covered this period were public health physicians with expertise in radiation health, who were recruited by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from Health Departments in Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>Over the 3-week period, a series of radiation risk assessments considering the evolving risks were completed; radiation health advice, both written and verbal, was developed; specific medical advice was provided on a case-by-case basis; and contingency plans were developed and exercised in the unlikely advent of a major deterioration of the nuclear situation at Fukushima. These products were developed against a constantly changing background of real and perceived threats, with ongoing Japanese efforts to get the Fukushima reactors under control, well-publicized threats to water and food supplies, concerns about atmospheric contamination with radioactive iodine and cesium, and ongoing consular efforts to identify any Australian who may have been adversely affected by the earthquake and tsunami. By the conclusion of the deployment, the Embassy had largely returned to normal functioning.</p>
<p>The discussion is based on the case study of the response to this incident and a review of the scientific literature, derived from PubMed, Google Scholar, and other scientific collections, including the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and Centers for Disease Control Web sites, on risk assessment and communication in a radiological incident.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1010539512453258" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Public health agencies have a key role in managing population response to radiological risk, particularly at lower levels of risk. The issue in managing public behavior in an emergency is rarely panic per se. Panic involves “irrational, groundless or hysterical flight that is carried out with a complete disregard for others (p. 342).”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453258">3</xref></sup> More common is an unexpected response to fear, which is rational from the perspective of persons with an incomplete understanding of a situation and/or who believe that their actions are the way to control a threat to their safety. Providing information about the scale of a threat and measures necessary to remain safe can alleviate a lot of what appears to be irrationally motivated behavior.</p>
<sec id="section4-1010539512453258">
<title>Risk Assessment</title>
<p>Radiation can be accurately detected in minute amounts, allowing for a precise assessment of the physical risk posed to the population. Reports of detections of minuscule quantities of atmospheric contamination from Fukushima were followed by reports from across the northern hemisphere, throughout Asia, and in northern Australia. The risk that public health agencies must manage, particularly in the lower-exposure groups, however, is often distorted by psychological factors, which are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539512453258">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Managing these risks involves assessments that public health and environmental protection agencies routinely apply to the management of environmental risks of population significance. This can be done by a wide range of agencies, but public health agencies usually have established links with local doctors, schools, and government departments and experience in assessing risk from environmental/communicable disease hazards. Public health expertise can be used to develop risk assessments that not only capture the pertinent environmental risk but also place it in the context of what is currently evolving locally—in this case, Tokyo.</p>
<p>Public health agencies also are experienced in surveillance and contact tracing, which are routine parts of the response to communicable disease outbreaks and can be modified to manage environmental hazards. In this circumstance, case finding to identify people exposed to significant amounts of radiation, who may need medical treatment or an assessment of long-term health risks, is well within the scope of such agencies. Such techniques can also be used to review other contacts and to reassure people as to what their likely exposure is, particularly where this is far less than feared.</p>
<p>Finally, public health agencies are routinely involved in the development and implementation of evacuation plans. Moving large numbers of people requires planning to avoid public health risks. In this area, there may be a level of complexity introduced to the management of radiological emergencies by the overlap of commonwealth, state, and local government responsibility for some of these areas. For example, in Australia, a radiological emergency would be considered an incident of national significance and have a large degree of commonwealth involvement, including the involvement of specialist agencies, such as the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. It is, therefore, important that there is a clear delineation of the role of public health agencies in an incident, including what they are not doing, to avoid confusion between levels of government and specialist agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539512453258">
<title>Risk Communication</title>
<p>Public health authorities have a key role in developing risk communications for any incident that involves the release of radioactive material. Given the poor understanding of risks of radiation by general populations, this communication must recognize that there is a high likelihood that the population whose risk perception needs to be addressed is far larger than the population that is likely to be exposed to acutely dangerous levels of radiation. There is also an urgent requirement for balanced commentary because media and other commentators may focus on the worst outcomes, which can inflame the situation. The widespread sale and inappropriate use of potassium iodide in California after the Fukushima incidents highlights the dangers of such reporting.</p>
<p>So what key messages are required? The population wants to know what the risk is to their and their children’s health; whether the food, water, or air is safe; and what can be done to avoid or at least minimize the risk.</p>
<p>The risk to health will depend on the type of radionuclide released and the dose the population is exposed to. People can neither identify with mathematical abstractions, such as “1 in 1 million,” nor understand the scientific units, such as micro Sieverts, and can better relate to a risk that can be envisaged. Where the radiation exposure is very low, most people found it more understandable if it were compared with a relatively innocuous activity like an international flight to Tokyo. Comparisons of radiation environmental exposures with other “safe” radiation exposures, however, have their limits. The peak radiation levels in Tokyo in March 2011 were about 0.3 to 0.5 µSv/h, which is a very low risk to human health but equivalent to a chest X ray every 2 to 8 days (20-100 µSv), which is not reassuring to everyone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453258">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453258">6</xref></sup> For this reason, comparison of the lifetime risks of that dose compared with other daily activities, such as driving, living in a major city, or smoking a few packs of cigarettes, can be useful, particularly where they can be compared with a range of events that many people generally accept without great concern.</p>
<p>One group needs particular attention. The risk of a given level of environmental radiation to pregnant women and infants needed to be provided regardless of the scale of risk. Of particular importance was advice around breastfeeding and the excretion of radionuclides in breast milk. Although this is unlikely to lead to significant doses of radiation, factual information is expected, given the perception that radiation is acutely dangerous for babies. Some radioactive substances, such as Iodine-131, can accumulate in breast milk if ingested, particularly soon after birth. Although the overall dose to a mother is likely to be very small, and this will probably be a negligible increase in absolute exposure to breastfeeding children, the relative and perceived risks needed to be addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453258">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because radiation is invisible to the senses, it is viewed as an insidious hazard that may be present in food and water. Radioactivity may also be viewed as contagious, with people or objects from close to the emergency being considered radioactive. Such people, who have been effectively decontaminated, are not a radiation risk.</p>
<p>Determining the presence or absence of radioactive material in water or food and updating that information regularly is crucial because failure to do so can fatally undermine trust in the management of a radiological emergency. In this instance, the Japanese Government regularly provided updates on the food and water situation.</p>
<p>If there is no contamination of food or water, then the issue of public communications is simple. If, however, there is a low level of contamination, as was the case at different times in Tokyo, then it is important that the degree of risk to health this poses is immediately put into context. The Japanese authorities reported the total amount of radioactivity in bulk food or water in Becquerels. As a unit, this contributed to the risk communication problems because the unit has no direct relationship to absorbed dose or the human health impact of ingesting the contaminated food or water. To effectively communicate this, the total activity needs to be converted into realistic figures that can be presented to the general public, such as the quantity required to be consumed to get to the normal background dose. Stating that someone needs to consume 160 kg of unwashed green leafy vegetables to get the annual public dose is far more effective than saying that the activity is above “normal” limits, which are set at a precautionary level that is many times lower than the level of radiation that has a measurable health impact. One salient example of this misunderstanding was the report in mid-March 2011 that the level of radiation in water had exceeded the normal limit for children in Tokyo. Although this was only for 1 day, there was mass buying of bottled water by Tokyo families concerned by the report.</p>
<p>Avoidance or minimization of the risk is also a key concern. Part of the anxiety about the radiation exposure is the perception that exposure is unavoidable and the individual is not in control. It was important, therefore, to provide advice about shelter, safe exposure times in the environment, and distance from the source of a radiological emergency to the population who were outside the immediate area. This simple advice about sheltering, food, water, and related matters was important in avoiding an information vacuum of how to respond in the context of potentially inflammatory media reporting of an unstable emergency becoming worse.</p>
<p>The public was often not aware that substantial buildings, such as brick houses, offer 2 to 10 times reduction in the absorption of radiation and that basement car parks can have much higher levels of protection. Advice about minimizing unnecessary travel outdoors, closing windows, and turning off air conditioning to reduce radiation exposure to as low as reasonably achievable were useful in providing people with measures they could undertake themselves, even if the underlying health risk was very low. The advice needed to be comprehensive, addressing how to manage issues as diverse as rainwater tanks, home-grown food, and the benefits, or not, of filtering or boiling water. Much of the generic public health advice for the management of these issues after bushfires can be adapted for a potential plume of radioactive material.</p>
<p>Information about the need to take potassium iodide (KI) tablets in an area with very low levels of radioactive contamination may do little to alleviate interest in having tablets ready just in case. This can be a problematic public health issue because people may take KI in response to media reports or a personal perception of risk and suffer unnecessary adverse effects. In the United States, where KI is available without prescription, the California Public Health and Emergency Management Agency advised the population to stop taking KI in March 2011 because cases of acute toxicity were being reported by poison centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453258">8</xref></sup> Although the protective effect of KI from radioiodine is established, significant exposure is required to justify its use. KI should not be provided to populations at low (or no) risk of exceeding the amount of radiation necessary for protection against thyroid cancer, particularly not on a precautionary basis or for psychological reassurance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1010539512453258">
<title>Contingency Planning</title>
<p>The other task of the radiation health advisers was to consider the need for and to develop contingency plans. Part of such planning involved the consideration of evacuating from the path of a plume or to look at other alternatives in the event that such evacuation was not possible.</p>
<p>Evacuation of areas where people receive high doses of radiation (approximately &gt;1 mSv/h) is a fundamental part of the repertoire of responses to a radiological emergency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453258">9</xref></sup> Although the decision whether people need to evacuate an area rests with expert advisory groups with experience in radiation safety, managing the evacuation of large populations raises many public health issues.</p>
<p>The aim of an evacuation process is to reduce the overall hazards to human health, but evacuation of large numbers of people is itself hazardous. In 2005, Hurricane Rita was responsible for 111 deaths in the Texas gulf; 3 of these were from wind-blown trees and 90 of the remaining 108 were attributable to complications of evacuation, such as hyperthermia, dehydration, decompensation of chronic health conditions, and vehicle accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453258">10</xref></sup> This balance is particularly important in radiological emergencies because the public perception of the risks from radiation may be disproportionately high compared with the actual risks from a mass evacuation. There may also be the perception that evacuation is the only way of reducing exposure to radiation.</p>
<p>The contingency plan needed to address issues of when to evacuate, how to evacuate, where to go to, and what to do if the decision was not to evacuate or people were unable to evacuate. This needed to be clearly communicated and plans put in place for the various eventualities.</p>
<p>When to go, if ever, is important but needs to be clearly stated. Failing to address this issue may lead to large numbers of people self-evacuating in response to media reports, weather reports, or rumor and suffering the complications of evacuation. This requires a clear and identified messaging system, which is planned in advance.</p>
<p>How may be even more problematic. The concept of trying to evacuate Tokyo, or even a small subset, was daunting. It is not possible to completely move a significant urban population from an area quickly and safely. Although the general public expectation may be for people to leave a city ahead of a “cloud” of radiation, this is not practical. The mass evacuations ahead of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in the United States in 2005 resulted in 100-mile traffic jams, where cars became immovable obstacles because they ran out of fuel or were involved in accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453258">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this context, effectively communicating the degree of the immediate threat to health, which a change in weather, plume direction, or severity of a radiological emergency poses, is critical. A city threatened by a change in the direction of a plume carrying material from a radiological emergency could be expected to have transient peak levels of radioactivity. In this situation, public health advice was to shelter in place and evacuate in due course, rather than evacuating ahead of a particular storm or weather change because this was expected to reduce some of the hazards of mass evacuation.</p>
<p>Where to go also becomes problematic, given all the public health issues with establishing evacuation centers. What is important in an evacuation is the distance from a source of exposure to radiation and that the required distance should be communicated with as many options for destinations as possible.</p>
<p>Where advice to evacuate is a remote possibility, as in Tokyo, people were provided with information about how to protect themselves, so they did not self-evacuate when it was unnecessary. This avoided a poor outcome from self-evacuation or poorly planned sheltering. This advice included how to identify areas of a building that provided optimal shielding, how to prepare water and food supplies to avoid contamination, and what activities to avoid.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has explored the challenges of risk assessment, risk communication, and contingency planning for expatriate staff in a major nuclear incident. The measures that were successful involved effective risk communication about both real and perceived risks and contingency planning for potential deteriorating situations. Given the rarity of these situations, they involved the application of established public health and disaster planning principles to ensure that the concerned population was able to manage through the period. Further development of these principles, particularly in a radiological context, and research to further refine them is needed.</p>
