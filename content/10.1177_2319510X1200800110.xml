<p>The phrase ‘the penny dropped’ figures in a novel written by Nigel Balchin, <italic>A Way through Wood</italic>: ‘I sat and thought for a moment and then the penny dropped’. The phrase essentially refers to a belated realisation of something after a period of ignorance or confusion. The title of the book is as enlightening as the book itself. In sooth, managers do have a tough time in pursuing the organisation’s mission and in achieving organisational objectives and it might take time to comprehend what is actually happening in an organisation. The strength of the book under review lies in the fact that it contains a number of experiences of people from different walks of life; each experience teaches a person distinct lessons. It depends on the reader how he/she uses the lessons to mould his/her own destiny.</p>
<p>The book has been effectively divided into four parts. The first part has four chapters which help in building a framework; the second consists of three chapters and helps the reader explore his/her inner world; the third part contains three chapters which help the reader explore the outside world; and the fourth part consists of two chapters which are devoted to management, that is, getting things done.</p>
<p>The first chapter dwells on the power of positive thinking, the importance of the trait of fighting relentlessly against all odds in life, the significance of seizing opportunities and how strategies can help in career growth. The second chapter dwells on self-confidence, self-awareness, life goals, becoming humane, building credibility, dealing with ambiguity, coping with setbacks, developing adaptability and maintaining integrity. The third chapter looks at the origin of the factors that help in the development of a leader. Strangely, the barriers which prevent a leader from realising his/her full potential also share the same origin, much like the yin and yang of Tao. The concept of yin–yang is used to describe how seemingly contrary forces are interdependent and interconnected in the natural world and how they give rise to each other in turn. The chapter delves into a number of bonsai traps. The chapter contents will definitely help the reader in becoming aware of these traps and perhaps in managing the traps also. The chapter also provides a few insights into brain science. Through a glimpse into the lives of Hellen Keller and Anne Sullivan, the fourth chapter explains the concept of empathy to the minutest detail.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter dwells on the mistakes which young employees might make in the first 10 years of their careers. Although the mistakes are seemingly trivial, yet they might have a devastating effect on an employee’s otherwise blossoming career. The chapter dwells on various practices being carried out at Tata Consultancy Services for the overall development of the workforce. The sixth chapter combines the best of the Western and the Eastern thought processes and traditions. It contains a vivid description of the seminal ‘Grant Study’ conducted by a researcher by the name of George Valliant. Valliant’s study, which extended for a period of more than 60 years, included subjects like John F. Kennedy, the thirty-fifth President of the United States, and Ben Bradlee, editor of <italic>The Washington Post</italic>. The seventh chapter is devoted to the highly vital elements of character, competence and courage. The eighth chapter explains the importance of an environment that is conducive to work and growth. The chapter also contains valuable advice for people who have tied the nuptial knot. The ninth chapter is devoted to non-verbal signs and delves into seven deadly habits which might actually spell bane. The tenth chapter is devoted to the three typical phases in an executive’s career. The eleventh chapter dwells on the power of imagination, seeing what is not visible, hearing what is not audible and sensing future possibilities. The twelfth chapter examines the concept of transformational leadership. It contains a path-breaking, eye-opening case study related to Tata Finance.</p>
<p>The author has built on the works of Warren Bennis, the leadership development guru; Tachi Yamada, President of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Clementine Churchill, wife of Winston Churchill; Charlie Chaplin, world-renowned comedian; Mitch Albom, highly acclaimed author of the enchanting book, <italic>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</italic>; Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian Renaissance polymath; Kazantzakis, author of a world-famous novel, <italic>Zorba the Greek</italic>; Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia; and several other luminaries. The book will help the reader in understanding the fine differences in concepts like micromanage and micro-interest, technical jargon such as ‘circadian phase’, the mistaking articulation for action (MAFA) syndrome, etc.</p>
<p>The book contains shaded boxes in almost every chapter which contain key messages. These inspiring messages are pearls of wisdom and make sense even when read in isolation, that is, without reading the entire chapter, and will definitely enrich the reader. The book is rhetorical and vibrant and imparts a meaningful and strong message: Not everything that a person faces can be changed, but nothing can be changed till a person faces it, so the best course is to keep attempting and conscientiously trying to improve.</p>
<p>The superlative tone under review will be helpful to anyone who considers a management career as stressful. It will be helpful to management practitioners as it contains a description of actual incidences which have occurred in a few enterprises. It will also be of great help to management teachers as it contains illuminating case studies. It is my personal conviction that in these days of scams and scandals such a book can be a part of the regular syllabi of a management programme. The students can be encouraged to study the book in a week or so and then asked to write a summary of it in around 2,000 words. This would perhaps go a long way in helping the present generation towards utilising the experience of their predecessors to improve things for themselves and their progeny without burdening them with tests and examinations.</p>
