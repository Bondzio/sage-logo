<abstract>
<p>This study focuses on fashion retailers’ as the gatekeepers’ role of encouraging eco-friendly consumption culture, that is, consumption of green products. The purpose of this study is to propose and test a green retailing effect model involving different persuasion routes among green private brand (PB), green marketing campaigns, green consciousness and behavior, and to explore the moderating effect of marketing communication involvement (MCI). The research shows that perception of green PBs has positive impact on consumers’ green behavior. Perception of green campaigns has a significant influence on consumers' green consciousness and indirect impact on consumers’ green behavior. The relationship between consumers’ perception of green campaign and green consciousness is stronger in the low MCI group. The model is helpful in understanding the positive impact of fashion retailers’ green retailing activities on green consumption culture. The result also provides strategic guidelines for retailers about their sustainable retail activities.</p>

<p>Global retailers’ eco-friendly policies and investments in their implementation demonstrate that green retailing is no longer an option, but an essential part of the business model. Green retailing refers to retailing products with environmental benefits (hereafter, green products; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12446065">Lai, Cheng, &amp; Tang, 2010</xref>). The green concept is related to the ecological dimension of sustainable development, which consists of its sociocultural, ecological, and economic subdimensions. Among these, the ecological dimension has drawn the most attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12446065">Elkington, 1997</xref>). As consumers’ awareness of environment increases along with the global demand for green products, major global retailers create labels claiming environmental benefits, or green labels, (e.g., Green Collections of Gap and Carbon-Neutral Lingerie of M&amp;S) and indexes to evaluate “greenness” of suppliers and/or products for practicing sustainability (e.g., Sustainability Index of Wal-Mart and the Eco Index<sup>TM</sup> of The U.S. Outdoor Industry Association). Such policies of retailers who have a large number of employees and stores across the globe inspire other retailers to jump onto the bandwagon of green retailing.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of green retailing is to benefit the environment. With this in view, this study focuses on the unique role of retailers in green retailing. Retailers can change consumers’ consciousness and behavior by directly interacting with them. Recently, the retailers started drawing renewed attention as gatekeepers who can lead a good consumption culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X12446065">Solomon &amp; Rabolt, 2004</xref>), including consumers’ eco-friendly behavior. As retailers encourage consumption of green products and discourage consumption of nongreen products through green retailing, they directly influence consumer behavior. Accordingly, the question, “Is green retailing truly beneficial to the environment?” may be replaced by “Do consumers practice consumption of green products because of green retailing?”</p>
<p>Green consciousness and green behavior refer to environmental concern and belief, and consumption of green products, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12446065">Kim &amp; Damhorst, 1998</xref>). Although some studies claim to focus on the consumer attitude toward corporate environmental activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12446065">Creyer &amp; Ross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12446065">Ogle, Hyllegard, &amp; Dunbar, 2004</xref>), they hardly carried out analytical work on the relationship between consumers’ green consciousness and green behavior as a result of green retailing. This study focuses on retailers’ social role—the gatekeeper’s role—that can encourage the eco-friendly consumption culture of individuals to verify whether green retailing actually influences consumer practice of green consciousness-and-behavior. Considering that the retailers’ social role is performed through a persuasion process, the Elaboration Likelihood Model or ELM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12446065">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>) was adopted to describe the way in which consumers’ perception of green retailing is determined by the type of retailing mix. This study provides important implications to both academia and industry. Academically, the study associates green corporate activities with consumers’ green consciousness-and-behavior, a major topic in sustainability studies, by showing green activities of corporations result in convincing consumers of green consciousness and behavior. Industrially, the study can motivate corporations to voluntarily undertake green activities with the belief that retailers can be the ones who lead the consumption culture.</p>

<title>Green Retailer and Green Retail Mix</title>
<p>The concept of sustainability was born out of the warning that the ecosystem is irreplaceable. It has been discussed globally by governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and corporations since the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 referred the issue to the United Nations Conference on environment and development. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12446065">Elkington’s (1997)</xref> triple-bottom-line of sustainability, sustainable corporate management consists in environmental protection, social responsibility, and economic profitability. Among these, environmental protection has drawn the most attention. When corporations respond passively to their environmental responsibilities, consumers show strong negative responses. Therefore, companies have been trying to strike a long-term balance between environmental protection and economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X12446065">Berry &amp; Rondinelli, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Among different eco-friendly activities, green retailing is what most retailers seem to follow enthusiastically for fulfilling their environmental responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12446065">Lai et al., 2010</xref>). Green retailing comprises two parts: green product sales and eco-friendliness of other activity mixes. Green product sales include selling organic and wellness-related products. Management of other mixes contributes to symbiosis with the surroundings with regard to nonproduct management, including retail supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, and facilities management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887302X12446065">Yudelson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Among various green retail mixes, the focus here is on the green products and promotion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12446065">Stern and Ander (2008</xref>) assert that selling green products is the most important activity to become a successful green retailer, besides communicating greenness with consumers and communities as an alarm to awaken retailers’ consciousness of the environment. Other studies point out that green products and green promotions directly influence consumers’ behavior and consciousness and are hence important green retail mixes to green consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12446065">Birgelen, Semeijn, &amp; Keicher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12446065">Jonas &amp; Roosen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12446065">Moore, 1995</xref>). Given the importance of green products and their promotion to consumers, we intend to position our theory in the fashion retail context in an effort to contribute, via empirical insight, to the understanding of green retailing and the prevalence of attention toward the important role of fashion retailers in the area of environment protection.</p>

<title>Green Retailer as a Gatekeeper</title>
<p>Retailers assume the role of gatekeepers because there has been a change in their roles over time. Traditionally, a retailer is considered a mere distributor and is, therefore, regarded as a seller of products. However, modern retailers not only deliver products and services but also respond to consumers’ demands and actively influence their preference and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12446065">Lai et al., 2010</xref>). By excluding certain products from the market or by expanding distribution of certain products, retailers can encourage consumption of eco-friendly products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12446065">Hansen &amp; Skytte, 1998</xref>). Also, they can educate consumers by delivering relevant information about green consumption culture and the means to nurture that culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12446065">Wirthgen, 2005</xref>). Bestseller, one of the leading fashion retailers in Denmark, is a good example of a retailer acting as a gatekeeper. Bestseller, besides developing eco-friendly logistics center and organic product collection, tries to give its customers an opportunity to buy a wide range of environment-friendly products (“Bestseller launches organic . . .,” 2007).</p>
<p>For retailers to play the role of gatekeeper, it is important that they manage products and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12446065">Wirthgen, 2005</xref>). While developing a retailer-gatekeeper model for an environment-friendly food industry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12446065">Wirthgen (2005</xref>) demonstrates how retailers, as gatekeepers, coordinate producer cooperation and control the flows of products and information between the food industry and its consumers. In acting as gatekeepers, retailers selectively deliver eco-friendly products and relevant information to consumers, which results in increasing the consumers’ demand for high quality foods.</p>
<p>Therefore, managing green products and green campaigns is important for green retailers to fulfill their roles. As product sales and campaigns have both direct and indirect impact on consumer consciousness and behavior, a green retailer may serve as a catalyst for consumption of green products. This impact is manifested in the form of different attitudes and behaviors depending on how the consumers perceive green retail activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X12446065">Swait &amp; Sweeney, 2000</xref>). Therefore, green retailing by fashion retailers may have strong influence on inducing consumption of green products if consumers perceive high values from the retailers’ activities. Based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12446065">Wirthgen (2005</xref>)’s model, this study reconstructs a “green fashion retailer’s gatekeeper-model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12446065">Figure 1</xref>),” which explains how a retailer filters products and information through green product and campaign management and induces green consciousness-and-behavior.</p>

<title>Green Consciousness-and-Behavior</title>
<p>Green consciousness is environmental concern and belief, and green behavior is consuming green products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12446065">Kim &amp; Damhorst, 1998</xref>). While many studies claim that individuals with green consciousness are more likely to engage in environmentally responsible consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12446065">Birgelen et al., 2009</xref>), some recent studies report a weak relationship between green consciousness and green behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12446065">Hughner, McDonagh, Prothero, Shultz, &amp; Stanton, 2007</xref>). That explains why the impact of green retailing on consumers’ behavior should be examined from different perspectives of green consciousness and green behavior. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12446065">Kim and Damhorst (1998</xref>) find that the influence of environmental concerns on environmentally responsible behavior is, in general, different from that on environmentally responsible apparel consumption behavior. From this, one can expect to find interesting relationships between green consciousness and green behavior of fashion products consumers and the influence of green retailing activities on them.</p>

<title>Influence of Green Fashion Products on Green Behavior</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12446065">Albino, Balice, and Dangelico (2009</xref>) define a green product as a product devised to minimize environmental damage throughout its lifecycle. According to Pujari et al. (2003) , green products play a key role in the sustainable growth of companies and economies. These definitions focus mostly on the manufacturing processes of green products. Therefore, this study establishes a fashion retailer’s green private brand (PB) as an equivalent concept of manufacturers’ green products to examine their relationships with consumers. A green PB is an eco-friendly brand, which labels proprietary products of a retailer and thus a combination of green products and a PB.</p>
<p>Green PBs provide retailers with competitive advantages such as differentiation and consumer loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12446065">Jonas &amp; Roosen, 2005</xref>). Most green PBs concentrate on organic products and fast-moving consumer goods, but recently, they started expanding their territories to beauty, health, and fashion products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X12446065">Berges-Sennou, Bontems, &amp; Requillart, 2004</xref>). The availability and development of natural fabrics and new materials, such as “green cotton” or “environmentally nonhazardous” material, has become more significant for fashion retailers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12446065">Moore, 1995</xref>). Other than the increasing importance of green fashion PBs in the market, there is little academic evidence to analyze and guide the trend.</p>
<p>As regards nonfashion products such as organic food PBs, satisfaction or perceived positive quality of green products has greater impact on behavioral variables including purchase intention than on consumers’ belief or opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X12446065">De Pelsmacker &amp; Janssens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887302X12446065">Straughan &amp; Roberts, 1999</xref>). The direct impact of consumer’s evaluation of green products on consumer behavior is attributed partly to the physicality of products. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12446065">Smith and Swinyard (1983</xref>) argue that in a promotional situation, direct product trial has a greater influence than advertising on consumers’ attitude, because the tangibility of products dilutes educational aspects of green retailing. By purchasing and using products, consumers accumulate product experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887302X12446065">Sproles, 1979</xref>). That is, heuristic accumulations are built by experiences, not by communication via persuasive media, such as services or education. Thus, selecting green products can make a behavioral change by consumers’ product experiences, rather than consumers’ eco-friendly consciousness. The effect of green PBs on consumers’ green behaviors can refer to the peripheral route of ELM in terms of the direct path between a message and a behavioral response. Without much cognitive elaboration of the message, the experience with the topic can directly persuade consumers to choose a product.</p>
<p>Accordingly, among green retailing activities, a hypothetical path can be established in that green product perception of the consumers, which directly impacts green behavior without the mediation of green consciousness. As green product-related activities of fashion retailers have meaningful direct impact on the formation of behavioral attitude toward consumption of green products, the following hypothesis is propounded:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Consumers’ positive (or negative) perception of Green PB has positive (or negative) direct impact on consumers’ green behavior.</p>

<title>Influence of Green Fashion Campaigns on Green Consciousness and Green Behavior</title>
<p>Green campaign is one of the green promotion activities which focus on the environmental aspects of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Green promotion requires a careful consideration of public policy processes and environmental concerns to persuade consumers effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12446065">Prakash, 2002</xref>). Green promotions, as a tool of CSR activities, improve corporate image, induce product and service purchases, and change consumers’ eco-friendly attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12446065">Birgelen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12446065">Brown &amp; Dacin, 1997</xref>). As the green campaigns do not appear to have any commercial purpose, they can motivate the consumers to participate, and thereby serve as effective tools to persuade consumers. Even so, not many studies were carried out on fashion retailers’ green campaign activities and consumer behavior.</p>
<p>The impact of consumers’ perceptions of the enlightenment of green campaigns on their consumption of green products is processed through a mechanism similar to the impact of environmental education on receivers. Although the message senders are different, one a retailer and the other a public agency, their purpose is the same—convincing message receivers. In marketing, persuasion is a process through which communication is delivered to change beliefs or attitudes in the intended way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12446065">Solomon, 2009</xref>). When message receivers, namely the consumers, perceive the eco-friendly messages of the campaigns, they have more positive thoughts than negative ones, because of this attitudinal changes may occur as the message intends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12446065">Bator &amp; Cialdini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12446065">Kim, Forney, &amp; Arnold, 1997</xref>). This means that receivers’ attitudinal changes are caused by processing cognitive responses.</p>
<p>The consumers’ persuasion process of such green campaigns is explained by the central route of the ELM. The ELM includes both the peripheral and the central routes to persuasion, depending on the receiver’s motivation and the ability to interpret the message. Persuasion through messages affects consumers through their cognitive interpretation of the messages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12446065">Bator and Cialdini (2000</xref>) suggest that the influence of public communication campaign be structured through the central route of the ELM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12446065">Simmons and Widmar (1990</xref>) also find that environmental education has little, if any, direct impact on consumers’ eco-friendly behavior, but has indirect impact through changes in their eco-friendly consciousness. According to the foregoing discussions, green campaigns are expected to persuade consumers through the central route of the ELM. A persuasion model is established such that consumers’ perception of green campaigns will influence changes in their eco-friendly consciousness, and the changed consciousness will, in turn, influence their eco-friendly consumption. In other words, consumers’ perception of green campaigns will reinforce their green behavior by the mediation of green consciousness. The following hypothesis is based on this premise:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Consumers’ positive (or negative) perception of Green campaign has positive (or negative) direct impact on consumers’ green consciousness.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Although several studies propose a weak relationship between green consciousness and green behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12446065">Hughner et al., 2007</xref>), most studies continue to identify the significant positive relationship between eco-friendly concern and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12446065">Arbuthnot, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12446065">Kallgren &amp; Wood, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12446065">Simmons &amp; Widmar, 1990</xref>). The concept of weak relationship between green consciousness and green behavior stems from the fact that environmental goods are similar to public goods, unlike other consumer goods. For a clear understanding of the effects of green retailing, one needs to establish the nature of relationship between consciousness and behavior by experimental evidence. If the relationship is found to be positive, it is significant to prove the indirect impact of green campaigns on consumers’ behavior. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>

<italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Consumers’ green consciousness has positive direct impact on consumers’ green behavior.</p>

<title>Moderating Effect of Communication Involvement</title>
<p>It is evident that communication plays an important role in consumers’ understanding of corporate activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12446065">Keller, 2003</xref>). However, not all consumers respond the same way to marketing communications; some may readily feel arousal and interest, and show emotional attachment and favorable behavior, while others may feel little arousal or interest and thereby show no change in their attitude or behavior. Such difference in response depends on conditions of involvement, communication sources, and differentiation of alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X12446065">Ray et al., 1973</xref>). In particular, involvement serves as an important variable in communication process (Petty, Cacioppo, &amp; Goldman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X12446065">1981</xref>). The relationship between communication effect and involvement is found in the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12446065">Krugman (1965</xref>) who considers that the information process can vary depending on advertising involvement. Based on Krugman’s definition, communication involvement is defined as the interests of general communication activities of cooperation. Many studies find that communication effect (level of persuasion) varies according to the level of communication involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12446065">Aldoory, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X12446065">Petty et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is expected that the communication effect of green fashion retailing on green consciousness and behavior may differ according to consumers’ communication involvement. As the influence of communication on decision-making process differs, depending on the communication tool, it is also expected that the constrained effects of communication involvement may differ depending on the medium: by products and by campaign. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12446065">Picker-Baker and Ozaki (2008</xref>) show that consumers’ response to eco-friendly products varies according to the impact of communication.

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected from 200 Koreans (100 females and 100 males), aged 20–49, by an online research agent, Embrain, Inc., that has 1.5 million online panels and unique online systems. Of those respondents, 31.5% were in their twenties, 36.0% in thirties, and 32.5% in forties; about 60% of them were married. To verify whether the value conceived by consumers of green fashion retailing can promote their green consciousness and green behavior, two representative green fashion retailing scenarios—green PB and green campaign—were provided by the online survey (Appendix A).</p>
<sec id="section10-0887302X12446065">
<title>Scenario Development</title>
<p>To adopt an empirical approach, eco-friendly policies of Korean fashion retailers were collected, modified to fit into the framework of this study and adopted to the scenarios. All the scenarios were developed hypothetically in the form of news articles about fashion retailers. The green PB scenario was drafted as a news article that emphasizes eco-friendly product lifecycles of “Eco-Smile,” an eco-friendly PB of a fashion retailer. This retailer planned to increase the number of PB items from 212 as of 2009 year-end to 300 by 2010 year-end. The green campaign scenario was drafted as a news article that introduces environmental education programs, such as “Environmental Camp for Children” and “Green Ladies and Gentlemen Campaign” for adults, run by a fashion retailer. A manipulation check for greenness of the corporation in the scenario was done using a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Both scenarios were perceived to contain green contents (Green PB, <italic>M</italic> = 5.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17; Green Campaign, <italic>M</italic> = 5.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0887302X12446065">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of three questions about consumers’ perception of green retailing (i.e., green PB and campaign scenarios), three about green consciousness, three about green behavior intention, three about communication involvement, and six about demographic characteristics (sex, age, education, occupation, monthly family income, and marital status). Except for the demographic characteristics, all other items were measured using 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Consumers’ perception of green PB and green campaign was measured by utilizing the items of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12446065">Fisher and Price (1991</xref>), green consciousness by the items of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12446065">Gill, Crosby, and Taylor (1986</xref>), and green behavior by the items of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12446065">Haytko and Matulich (2008</xref>). To identify the effect of green retailing suggested by, regarding consumers’ communication involvement, the respondents were given sufficient time to read and think about each scenario before answering the questions. Their green consciousness and green behavior intentions were measured based on the assumption that they had actually experienced the contents described in the news articles.</p>

<title>Measurement Model</title>
<p>To verify the validity of four constructs (perception of green PB, green campaign, green consciousness, and green behavior), by conducting confirmatory factor analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12446065">Table 1</xref>), AMOS 18.0 was used. This model’s Normed χ<sup>2</sup> is 1.40, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .05, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = .95, adjusted GFI (AGFI) = .91, and comparative fit index (CFI) = .97, all the values being acceptable overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X12446065">Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2004</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12446065">Fornell and Larcker (1981</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12446065">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2010</xref>), the model’s convergent validity and discriminant validity were tested. Factor loadings are within the range of .86–.93, the lower limit being more than the recommended minimum value by over 0.5. All the estimates of construct reliability are also above the recommended value of 0.7. The variance extracted from each construct ranges from .69 to .80, which is higher than the recommended value of 0.5. average variance extracted (AVE) of constructs and the square of correlation coefficient between those two constructs were calculated and compared; the square of correlation between constructs of all combinations is between .33 and .66, which is lower than AVE with a range of .69–.80 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887302X12446065">Table 2</xref>). Four constructs were found to be independent of each other, proving the discriminant validity. As for composite reliability, the range is .84–.90, which is higher than the recommended value of 0.7. The model’s validity was thus verified and therefore, it was decided to use that model in the analysis.</p>

<title>Structural Model</title>
<p>After identifying a reasonably well-fitting measurement model, the hypothesized structural model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0887302X12446065">Figure 2</xref> shows the model fit indices and standardized estimated structural paths. The proposed structural model fits very well as the values of all fit indices are above the recommended values. The hypothesized effects are all significant. To identify the robustness of the model, we compared the additional nested model (i.e., rival model) that included the direct path from perception of green PB to green consciousness. Compared with the research model, most of the fit indices for the nested model remain unchanged for the whole sample. The normed χ<sup>2</sup> differs by only one decimal place (from 1.37 to 1.50). The additional path is not statistically significant. Compared with the alternative model, the research model is preferred.</p>

</fig>
<p>Hypothesis 1 is supported because perception of green PBs is found to have positive direct impact on green behavior. On the other hand, perception of green campaigns is found to have indirect impact on green behavior, mediated by green consciousness. Therefore, Hypotheses 2 and 3 are supported. This is the reflection of the educational aspect of green campaigns. From previous study it can be seen that environmental education effect on consumer behavior is mediated by consumer consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12446065">Simmons &amp; Widmar, 1990</xref>). And, it is clear that the effect of green retailing varies according to the activities.</p>

<title>Moderating Effect</title>
<p>To test the moderating effect of marketing communication involvement (MCI) on the relationship between green fashion retailing activities and green consumption, multigroup analysis by AMOS 18.0 was used. A summated score of three 7-point Likert-type items was used to divide whole sample into two groups—high MCI group (127 respondents who answered more than 4 points) and low MCI group (73 respondents who answered with 4 points or less). First, the measurement invariance between the high and low involvement groups was tested by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887302X12446065">Table 3</xref>). The research model was found to fulfill the condition of metric invariance (i.e., measurement weight invariance). Generally, metric invariance is relevant to establishing relationships among constructs, which is generally needed in moderation tests for structural relationship differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12446065">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>After identifying measurement invariance, tests were conducted by multigroup SEM to verify whether the difference between the structural models of the low and high involvement groups was statistically significant, and to identify whether MCI moderates the influence of consumers’ perception of green retailing activities on their green consumption. First, to examine the moderating effect of MCI on the relationship between perception of green PB and green behavior, multigroup SEM was conducted twice between the model that assumes all theoretical paths are totally free (the conceptual model of this study, totally free (TF) model) and the model (constrained model) that assumes the path to be verified by their moderating effects (i.e., perception of green PB à green behavior) is the same in both high and low involvement groups. Chi square difference tests show no statistically significant difference between the Chi square statics (Δχ<sup>2</sup>= 2.6, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 1) of different models. In other words, no moderating effect of MCI was identified on the relationship between consumers’ perception of green PBs and green behavior. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 was not supported.</p>
<p>Next, it was verified how MCI affects the relationship between consumers’ perception of green campaign and green consciousness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0887302X12446065">Table 4</xref>). According to the result of Chi-square difference static, the model fit of TF model, whose theoretical paths from consumers’ perception of green campaigns to green consciousness are assumed to be different between the high and low involvement groups, improved significantly as compared with that of the constrained model (Δχ<sup>2</sup>= 5.2, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In other words, the MCI moderating effect was identified by the observation that the positive influence of consumers’ perception of green campaigns on green consciousness differs depending on the level of communication involvement. By comparing the path coefficients from consumers’ perception of green campaigns on green consciousness by group, it was found that the low involvement group delivered .82, against .47 delivered by the high involvement group. This indicates that the impact of retailers’ green campaigns on consumers’ eco-friendly consciousness is greater in low involvement groups than high involvement group. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X12446065">Schuhwerk and Lefkoff-Hagius (1995</xref>) report that positive relationships between consumers’ evaluation of eco-friendly messages and their attitude toward products become stronger in low involvement groups. Accordingly, Hypothesis 5 is supported.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study is designed to understand the positive impact of fashion retailers’ green retailing activities on green consciousness and green behavior, based on the persuasion theory. Analysis of the relationship between green retailing activities and green consciousness and green behavior reveals that the more favorable are the consumers’ perceptions of retailers’ green products and green campaign activities, the greener are their consciousness and behavior. This underlines the importance of retailers’ voluntary participation in promoting a green consumption culture in society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X12446065">Kotzab, Munch, de Faultrier, and Teller (2011</xref>) also emphasizes the crucial role of global leading retailers in spreading the green consumption culture. Retailers should assume greater responsibility in spreading eco-friendly consumption awareness in society and in carrying out green marketing activities.</p>
<p>This study validates the assumption that different green retailing activities would affect consumer attitudes through different persuasion effect processes. Based on the ELM theory, the consumer persuasion process can be approached through the central route and persuasion through peripheral route. Stimuli, based on consumers’ intuitions and experiences, seem to have direct impact on behavioral changes, more through the peripheral route than through a cognitive process. This study empirically verified the theoretical path through which, among green retailing activities, higher values perceived by consumers about products have a more positive impact on encouraging consumers’ eco-friendly behavior. On the other hand, highly enlightening green campaigns, in a similar context to environmental education, persuade consumers through the central route that affects their consciousness first and then their behavior, involving a cognitive attitudinal change process.</p>
<p>The cumulative empirical evidence, gathered by verifying different persuasion routes of green retailing activities about central and peripheral routes, provides strategic guidelines to retailers about the effect of their activities. For example, the retailers for whom economic performance such as revenue growth is a priority may focus on developing green products and PBs. Because consumer behavior is more directly connected to the sales performance of companies in terms of purchasing than is green consciousness. On the other hand, the retailers for whom long-term relationships with consumers is a priority for long-term business growth may learn from this study that they should maintain green activities such as green campaigns. As their eco-friendly attitude improves, the consumers may turn develop a favorable attitude toward green retailers, and ultimately could better business performance of the retailers.</p>
<p>This study successfully identifies the positive impact of the fashion retailer’s role as a gatekeeper, which provides a sound basis to policy makers for investment in environmental regulation or an encouragement strategy for the corporate sector. Most previous environmental policies pertaining to retailers, such as regulation on carbon dioxide emissions or the treatment of waste, are somewhat passive or defensive strategies in nature. Instead, the policy makers may consider encouraging retailers to execute green retailing strategies more actively by means of their retail mix, directly affecting consumers’ green consciousness. The policy makers may focus on developing various initiatives for retailers to perceive their social role as green gatekeepers rather than a mere seller taking advantage of sales profits. Endowing rewards such as benefits in taxation or holding special workshops to enlighten retail managers about their gatekeeper’s role could be a possible initiative.</p>
<p>This study also shows that the positive influences of green retailing activities on green consciousness and green behavior vary depending on the type of retailing activity and MCI. The analysis of MCI moderating effects reveals no significant difference between MCI groups in the relationship between perception of green PBs and their green behavior. However, the relationship between consumers’ perceptions of green campaign and green consciousness becomes stronger in the low involvement group. Consumers with high MCIs do not tend to change their attitudes until they are affected by several communication clues and green campaigns, while those with low MCIs tend to change with a single peripheral clue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12446065">Solomon, 2009</xref>). Therefore, in utilizing green communication strategies, retailers may consider providing only a few focused messages to low MCI involvement groups, but diverse green communication activities to high involvement groups. Focused green communications by retailers can have great impact on the people with low MCI. Besides, they have meaningful implications to policy makers in terms of targeting and planning their programs. For example, their primary target audience should be those with low MCI, because the effect of green campaigns becomes stronger with the low MCI group. To enlighten the people with low MCI about green consciousness, policy makers may focus on a seminar or a promotion event with a simple and clear message, rather than with detailed information.</p>
<p>This study focuses on only two persuasion routes of green retailing, but it may be worthwhile to identify and examine more persuasion routes for marketing different marketing mixes, such as price, promotion, place, and product, by combining existing persuasion theories. Each phase of the extended process of the ELM, such as attention, comprehension, elaboration, integration and enduring attitude changes, may be considered separately. In addition, messages related to both products and nonproducts should be studied. This study focuses on how corporate retailing activities influence consumers’ green consciousness and green behavior. It will be meaningful if further studies are carried out to quantify the difference in consumers’ green consciousness and green behavior before and after experiencing green retailing activities by focusing on the eco-friendly changes in consumers’ consumption behavior. In addition, more situational and contextual variables may have to be considered in the overall persuasion process of eco-friendly activities. For example, this study measured only consumers’ perceptions of green retailing activities, but further studies may examine how consumers’ (or information receivers’) characteristics such as how their previous experience and familiarity with information affects the overall persuasion process.</p>

<italic>Green PB Scenario:</italic>Fashion retailer A is encouraging people to consume green products through green private brand (PB) management. A proprietary PB is owned and developed by a retailer. Retailer A is operating 212 green PB items as of the 2009 year-end and planning to expand the portfolio to 300 items by the end of 2010. Its green PB products are labeled “Eco-Smile” and the lifecycles of all products from manufacturing to distribution are “environmentally friendly.” Retailer A uses organic materials or natural fabrics such as bamboo<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887302X12446065">1</xref></sup> and corn, then adopts eco-friendly dyeing processes in order to minimize damage and hazards to the environment and to consumers. In addition, it tries to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy consumption by decreasing transportation distances (80% of suppliers located less than one and a half hour’s drive away from a distribution center) and frequencies (transporting large quantities at one time by heavy duty trucks).</p>

<italic>Green Campaign Scenario:</italic>Fashion retailer A is encouraging consumers to perceive and participate in green movements through active green campaigns. It has hosted an “Environment Camp for Children” since 2000, having educated more than 2,500 children so far. Children participating in this camp have experienced a variety of programs such as reforming clothes that they do not wear anymore, publishing newspapers about green movements of A’s retail stores after visiting them, and touring organic cotton t-shirt factories. Along with children’s programs, A is also expanding its adult education program, “Green ladies and gentlemen” since 2005. This campaign provides adults with eco-friendly guidelines about purchase, consumption, and disposition through “Green classes,” and anyone who takes the class is granted a green mileage card in which he or she accumulates green mileage of 10% of green label product purchase. This mileage can be used as a cash equivalent in any of A’s store when he or she shops there.</p>

<p>We used the examples of bamboo and corn as eco-friendly fibers or materials in this study. Within the Korean apparel market, bamboo and corn have been recognized as eco-friendly materials, by focusing on the source of cellulose fibers extracted from bamboo and corn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://m.outdoornews.co.kr/articleView.html?idxno=3684&amp;menu=3">http://m.outdoornews.co.kr/articleView.html?idxno=3684&amp;menu=3</ext-link>). Although bamboo fibers have been under scrutiny in the United States as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has warned the extensive and harmful chemical processes that bamboo fibers may be required during the fiber production stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt160.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt160.shtm</ext-link>), in Korea, these concerns have rarely been raised in the public and the most retailers and fashion magazines still advertise bamboo fibers as eco-friendly options (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.montbell.co.kr/montbell/html/04_pr/01_report_list.asp?mode=view&amp;idx=901">http://www.montbell.co.kr/montbell/html/04_pr/01_report_list.asp?mode=view&amp;idx=901</ext-link>). Therefore, we have used bamboo as an example of eco-friendly materials in this study to assess Korean consumers’ perception of green PB.</p>
