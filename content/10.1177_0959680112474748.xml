<abstract>
<p>Despite the rapid increase in cross-national labour migration since EU enlargement in 2004, there has been little research on transnational union efforts to organize migrant workers. This article examines the European Migrant Workers Union, created by the German union IG BAU in a shift away from national protectionism towards transnational organizing. The initiative largely failed, primarily because of decisions by other unions to reject the transnational approach and instead to defend existing institutional arrangements. We argue that this inaction constitutes a setback for union reassertion of control over markets and for bringing industrial citizenship to Europe’s hyper-mobile workers.</p>

<body>
<p>In 2004 the German construction union <italic>Industriegewerkschaft Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt</italic> (IG BAU) initiated a project to organize migrant workers from the new EU member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Rather than organizing these workers directly, it established a transnational subsidiary, called in English the European Migrant Workers Union (EMWU), to recruit and service them. IG BAU allocated €1.5 million to the EMWU, and aimed to attract 10,000 members and financial support from other unions, in Germany and abroad. It did not achieve either of these goals, and in late 2008 the EMWU was restructured as a servicing and information point for migrants, housed within IG BAU.</p>
<p>This case study demonstrates the difficulties unions face when they address the problem of transnational labour mobility using national strategies. IG BAU had lost effectiveness within the German construction industry and was frustrated with the slow progress of transnational inter-union cooperation in the European construction sector. IG BAU staff do not regard the EMWU experience as a failure: it was successful in its advocacy and servicing functions. IG BAU has, furthermore, convinced several European construction unions to support the European Construction Mobility Information Network (ECMIN), a less ambitious multilateral project that could, in the long run, lead to collaborative cross-border organizing initiatives. But the EMWU failed to develop into a viable independent organization. We argue that the unwillingness of other unions to support the project made it impossible to overcome the flaws in the EMWU organizing model and the inherent difficulties of organizing hyper-mobile migrants.</p>
<p>We advance the concept of transnational industrial citizenship as a bridge between the literatures on union organizing and labour transnationalism. Cross-border worker mobility, like the mobility of goods and capital, sometimes leads to calls for international trade union cooperation to control wage competition. Union organizing of migrant workers, however, requires a complex process of adaptation to a set of dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680112474748">Lillie and Sippola, 2011</xref>). In Europe, the exercise of denationalized civil rights, such as worker rights to cross-border mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680112474748">Ciupijus, 2011</xref>), accompanies migrants’ exclusion from nationally rooted social rights such as access to collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474748">Lillie, 2010</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474748">Gordon (2007)</xref> we define the exercise of such rights by hyper-mobile workers as transnational industrial citizenship, and argue that its practical implementation requires an organization capable of operating in many countries simultaneously. We refer to the construction of this kind of organization as transnational migrant worker organizing.</p>
<p>We use the case of the EMWU as a window into transnational migrant worker organizing, because it appears the most ambitious example of the phenomenon. The data were collected in four waves between 2003 and 2010. In 2003–2004 we interviewed IG BAU activists, works councillors, staff at the national and local levels, employers, government representatives and EMWU staff. In 2006–2007 we examined EMWU in international perspective by interviewing union and employer representatives in the UK, Germany, and Finland. In 2008–2009 we studied a specific site in depth, and interviewed Finnish construction unionists and managers at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant, where there had been an effort by Polish workers to involve the EMWU. Finally, in 2010 we updated the story through interviews with EMWU staff and activists in Germany and Poland, and broadened our national coverage through phone interviews with trade unionists in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The case study is thus constructed from 88 interviews conducted in Dutch, English, Finnish, German and Polish, as well as secondary written sources and observation of union work.</p>
<p>We first assess the literature on labour transnationalism and union organizing of migrants. Then we discuss why IG BAU created EMWU, its servicing and organizing model, the reactions of other unions and the rise of the alternative ECMIN project. We conclude by examining why EMWU did not become a full-fledged transnational union and exploring implications for transnational industrial democracy in Europe.</p>

<title>Labour transnationalism and organizing migrants</title>
<p>Despite arguments that public policy or collective worker responses to labour migration should be transnational in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474748">Gordon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680112474748">Visser and Dølvik, 2009</xref>), there has been little empirical research on transnational union approaches to organizing migrants. The literatures addressing union responses to migration and union transnationalism have developed separately and have not been integrated. Downward wage pressures from migrant labour create a familiar problem for national unions: if they try to restrict labour supply they may alienate migrants, who are potential members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959680112474748">Penninx and Roosblad, 2000</xref>). If they do attempt to integrate migrants, this provides a basis for organizing around new topics such as anti-racism, and renewing union leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474748">Virdee, 2000</xref>). National inter-regional labour mobility provided the impetus for the growth of national trade unions in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474748">Ulman, 1955</xref>), and international labour mobility could similarly lay the foundations for the internationalization of trade unions in Europe.</p>
<p>The labour transnationalism literature treats union organizing as just one of many reasons why unions would work across national boundaries. Transnationalism can be aided by the erosion of existing national-level union competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474748">Lillie and Greer, 2007</xref>) or hindered by the propensity of still-powerful unions to defend their jurisdictions by resisting the transfer of functions to the transnational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474748">Croucher and Cotton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680112474748">Platzer and Müller, 2009</xref>). Transnationalism can include many different activities: fighting demands by multinational employers for concessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474748">Greer and Hauptmeier, 2008</xref>) or influencing supranational agencies such as the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680112474748">Gajewska, 2009</xref>). Numerous overlaps exist between organizing and transnational unionism: international solidarity may help unions secure rights for the unorganized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680112474748">Fichter et al., 2011</xref>), negotiate international sectoral collective agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474748">Anner et al., 2006</xref>) or pressure employers through organizing campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474748">Anner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, the union organizing literature treats the transnational level as only one of many sources of leverage. For example, research on ‘social movement unionism’ and ‘community unionism’ places organizing campaigns in a broader context, but the partners available tend to be local rather than international. In the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680112474748">Fine (2006)</xref> identifies a class of community organizations aimed at organizing immigrants, and immigrants also play an important role in the rise of ‘organizing unions’ in the construction and service sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680112474748">Milkman, 2006</xref>). UK studies show the importance of ethnic identity in the dynamics of workplace organizing campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474748">Holgate, 2005</xref>) and tactics by British unions to target migrants in their recruitment campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680112474748">Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010</xref>). There is also some evidence from the UK that creating special union structures for minorities can lead to improvements in awareness and expertise in dealing with their issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959680112474748">Wrench, 2004</xref>). Comparative researchers highlight contrasting national union strategies towards migrants, ranging from their exclusion in order to protect local and national markets, to their inclusion and the attempt to enforce local and national labour standards on their employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680112474748">Krings, 2009</xref>). What these studies have in common is that transnationalism plays no role in analysis of union behaviour. Migration is principally understood in terms of the concerns of host country unions and workers or local ethnic communities.</p>
<p>Purely national responses to migration are, however, increasingly ineffective, at least in Europe. Within the EU, changes in the application of EU law have denationalized regulatory authority, opening national markets to migrant workers and multinational firms. The 1957 Treaty of Rome treated the creation of a single market, via the free movement of ‘goods, persons, services, and capital’, as one of the main aims of the European Community. Freedom of movement of persons permits workers to circulate freely across national borders and work in other EU member states; freedom of movement of services permits companies to ‘post’ staff abroad to work. The latter freedom is more problematic from the perspective of enforcing labour rights and equal treatment, because working conditions are, in many respects, regulated from the home country of the sending firm rather than the host country where the work is performed. Though the Posted Workers Directive of 1996 imposed some regulation of posting, a series of decisions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has severely limited its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474748">Barnard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959680112474748">Woolfson and Sommers, 2006</xref>). Workers migrating as dependent employees therefore have access to differently constituted and enforced rights than those who migrate as individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680112474748">Dølvik and Eldring, 2006</xref>). From the perspective of a main contractor operating in a high-wage country, accessing posted workers on home country conditions through subcontractors is a direct substitute for off-site outsourcing to low-wage countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474748">Lillie, 2010</xref>). In such internationalized contracting chains, the organization of work has a strong transnational dimension.</p>
<p>Why, then, does labour transnationalism play such a minor role in studies on union organizing of migrants? An obvious explanation is that not all migrants are embedded in transnational labour markets – as is the case for most workers in low-wage service industries, such as cleaning, cooking, and security – and there is consequently no need for a transnational response. The European construction sector, however, <italic>does</italic> have transnational labour markets, and part of the workforce <italic>is</italic> hyper-mobile. Nationally bounded union strategies therefore fail to address the problems of maintaining union bargaining power and protecting migrants’ labour rights.</p>
<p>In international labour markets, unions no longer control employer access to labour and therefore lose power in wage bargaining. This is similar to the whipsawing problem explored in the literature on European Works Councils (EWCs). When unions facing multinational employers fail to coordinate their wage bargaining, management can extract concessions by creating within-company markets for investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474748">Greer and Hauptmeier, 2008</xref>). In industries such as construction, organized through complex transnational contracting networks, firms from low-wage countries win bids in high-wage countries on the basis of cost advantages and then move workers to the high-wage country. While high profile examples of this such as the wildcat strike at the Lindsey oil refinery raise issues about the right of national actors to regulate conditions for posted workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474748">Barnard, 2009</xref>), union officials admit that at most large construction sites around Europe it is possible to find migrant workers, posted or not, receiving wages below the rates specified in collective agreements. Without international union coordination, national collective agreements are thus difficult to enforce, and migrant workers have little or no access to union representation.</p>
<p>A second problem has to do with the social rights of migrants in a more direct sense. They are cut off from meaningful representation of their interests, not only in collective bargaining and workplace-level representation, but also in the enforcement of legal rights (Dølvik and Visser, 2010) and participation in the workplace and polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474748">Meardi, 2011</xref>). Trade unions helped construct national citizenship as part of the class compromises in advanced capitalist countries in the 20th century; but this national focus now functions as a barrier to the development of European industrial citizenship. Although EU citizens may participate freely in European labour markets, the passports they carry still determine their access to certain labour rights. Just as industrial citizenship emerged at the level of the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680112474748">Marshall, 1950</xref>), a regime of collective and statutory worker rights could however emerge in Europe to cover workers exercising their right to cross-border mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680112474748">Ciupijus, 2011</xref>). This kind of transnational labour citizenship would entail the construction of worker organization effective enough to redistribute the material benefits of migration and minimize its social harms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474748">Gordon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some forms of labour transnationalism in Europe enjoy external institutional support, such as the EWC directive. EMWU, by contrast, was an attempt to build a transnational organizational infrastructure without such institutional support. Unions building new structures are important in accounts of the early trade union movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474748">Ulman, 1955</xref>) and current accounts of union renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959680112474748">Turner, 2009</xref>). In the maritime shipping industry, the International Transport Workers’ Federation has organized a functioning global network of trade unions behind a unified bargaining agenda for the seafaring labour market, demonstrating that ambitious cooperative projects are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474748">Anner et al., 2006</xref>). EMWU is a case of ‘managerial internationalism’, structured by a ‘bureaucratic division of labour’, in which the concerns of members are identified and addressed by ‘technical specialists and experienced international officials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474748">Umney, 2012</xref>). Under these conditions, internal organizational dynamics matter a great deal in explaining success or failure. Nevertheless, we will argue below that the decisive factor was the failure of EMWU to win financial and political support from other unions in Europe.</p>

<sec id="section2-0959680112474748">
<title>The formation of EMWU</title>
<p>Why did IG BAU establish the EMWU? In our early interviews in 2003–2004 with staff and activists, there was widespread belief that the union’s nationally focused strategy had been ineffective. Although separate migrant workers unions had existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474748">Kulczycki, 1994</xref>), post-war German trade unions were organized by sector. A union for migrants, whose jurisdiction cut across industrial boundaries, represented a fundamental departure from the way German workers had been organized, and would have constituted a change for nationally constituted construction unions across Europe. The European Federation of Building and Woodworkers (EFBWW) is the main vehicle for cooperation at EU level, but it is not a membership organization of workers but a federation of unions. Its members are reluctant even to accept transnationally portable union membership, much less shift one of their core functions – the organization and representation of individual workers – to a transnational body.</p>
<p>EMWU was born out of the profound changes in industrial relations in post-unification Germany. Employment in the construction industry had fallen from 1.5 million in 1995 to 740,000 in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959680112474748">Statistisches Bundesamt, 2005</xref>), and IG BAU membership declined from 780,000 just after unification to 461,000 in 2003, despite gaining 100,000 new members through a merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474748">DGB, 2007</xref>). Unemployment and insolvency rates were climbing and the under-the-table ‘shadow economy’ expanding. More than their counterparts in other sectors, large German construction companies became sites of concession bargaining, following real and threatened bankruptcy and mass layoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474748">Rehder, 2003</xref>). Concessions spread to sectoral bargaining in the industry as a whole, despite a successful nationwide strike in 2002.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were significant numbers of CEE migrants who were difficult to organize. IG BAU did not exclude migrants from membership: past generations of workers had been covered by collective bargaining under ‘guest worker’ programmes and remained highly unionized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474748">Kahmann, 2006</xref>). But the union faced difficulty with this new group, for a number of reasons. First, illegal under-the-table work (<italic>Schwarzarbeit</italic>) and bogus self-employment (<italic>Scheinselbständigkeit</italic>) expanded alongside migration. Employers estimated that 35 percent of revenue in construction is generated by the underground economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959680112474748">Zentralverband deutsches Baugewerbe, 2006</xref>), and IG BAU has estimated the number of workers in the unregulated sector at between 300,000 and 500,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680112474748">Keller, 2002</xref>) or, more recently, 20 percent of the industry and 65 percent in some subsectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959680112474748">Schmidt-Hullmann, 2008</xref>). While it is unclear how many of these are migrants, numbers are large. A second reason was the rise of posted labour, in which employers – usually operating within the law – would rotate their workforce internationally from site to site. At its peak, worker posting reached 118,000 out of 603,000 blue-collar workers in the German construction industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474748">Kahmann, 2006</xref>). These workers were highly mobile and unlikely to become members of any national union. Third, employers had incentives to derecognize collective agreements and avoid taxes and social insurance contributions.</p>
<p>IG BAU’s strategy throughout the 1990s was to protect the German construction market from competitors based in lower-wage zones, mainly CEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680112474748">Cyrus, 2002</xref>). Employers and the state were willing to work with them on this. Employers were interested in fighting ‘unfair’ competition, and they lobbied with IG BAU for the EU posted workers directive, which created a framework to police wages and working conditions at firms based in other countries, and the <italic>Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz</italic> (AEntG), which transposed the directive into national legislation. The social partners also passed a number of wage laws at <italic>Land</italic> level (<italic>Tariftreugesetze</italic>) mandating contractors on public works projects to abide by collective agreements (though these were overturned by the ECJ in the <italic>Rüffert</italic> case in 2008). The government was interested in improving the policing of workplaces in order to collect taxes and insurance contributions, and created a special inspectorate to fight illegal work, the <italic>Finanzkontrolle Schwarzarbeit</italic> (FKS). The union worked closely with FKS agents and ran a national campaign, <italic>ohne Regeln geht es nicht</italic> (it won’t work without rules), which involved visits to construction sites by union activists and staff, and a hotline to allowed anonymous reporting of suspected illegal work.</p>
<p>Protectionism, however, produced meagre results, and the union and industry continued to decline. Employers were ambivalent about stricter law enforcement: though their two main associations wanted to protect their members against the sector’s ‘black sheep’, they opposed inconvenient restrictions on their members and policies that could jeopardize their access to neighbouring markets. The AEntG, for example, contained a principle of ‘main contractor liability’, which the union had advocated as a way to recover back wages when subcontractors disappeared. The association of main contractors argued that these rules would increase the cost and complexity of monitoring subcontractor chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474748">Hauptverband der deutschen Bauindustrie, 2006</xref>). The strategy was also controversial within the union. In the <italic>ohne Regeln</italic> campaign, its visible role in the intensified monitoring of construction sites scared workers (migrants and Germans alike) away from the union. Critics argued that this policy could make the union responsible for the deportation of workers and stoke xenophobia in the union’s membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680112474748">Cyrus, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680112474748">Maurer and Harning, 2004</xref>). In the initial round of interviews, just after EMWU was formed, several IG BAU activists and staff told us that migration made national unionism ineffective and that an international union was the natural response.</p>
<p>IG BAU might have addressed these problems through bilateral alliances with unions in labour-sending countries. But where cooperation existed, it was superficial. Because the largest labour exporter to Germany was Poland, the IG BAU executive decided in the 1990s to focus first on two Polish construction unions: the <italic>Związek Zawodowy Budowlani</italic> (OPZZ) and the <italic>Sekretariat Budownictwa i Przemysłu Drzewnego</italic> (<italic>Solidarność</italic>). <italic>ZZ Budowlani</italic> is the larger, and claimed 25,000 members in 2004, out of an estimated 600,000 construction workers in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959680112474748">Towalski, 2004</xref>). While both unions were active in signing cooperation agreements with unions in Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474748">Hardy and Fitzgerald, 2010</xref>), IG BAU interviewees described these cooperation agreement as ‘lifeless’, despite the creation of an IG BAU office in Warsaw. Our Polish interviewees (a union official and a posted construction worker) criticized the Polish construction unions as incapable of representing posted workers. Our German interviewees took for granted that Polish construction unions were ineffective, particularly when it came to posted workers, and suggested that they had been corrupt and untrustworthy. The creation of EMWU did not seem to help matters. A former <italic>Budowlani</italic> official told us, ‘they [the Polish unions] perceive EMWU as unfriendly competition. . . they do not cooperate with a perceived competitor, but perhaps they should’. EMWU interviewees also reported little contact with unions in other sending countries.</p>
<p>The creation of the EMWU did not mean completely abandoning the law-enforcement approach. Although the <italic>ohne Regeln</italic> campaign and the hotline were scrapped, IG BAU continued working with FKS to crack down on criminal employers: interviewees told us that this made it more likely that the policing of employers could take place without victimizing workers. While this claim is difficult to confirm, it does reflect the intention of EMWU’s founders to avoid complicity in migrant job losses and deportation inherent in what they call the ‘repressive’ approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959680112474748">
<title>Organizing by servicing</title>
<p>The EMWU organizing model functioned principally through the provision of services, rather than the organization of worker representation structures and collective bargaining. When IG BAU began planning its response to worker posting, officials commissioned a survey asking migrant construction workers what kinds of assistance they could use from a union. The two most common answers were legal advice and advice on conflict at work. The assumption from the beginning was that workers with problems would join the organization only after they received assistance. However, the EMWU did not reach its initial goal of recruiting 10,000 members in this way.</p>
<p>EMWU operated from offices in Frankfurt and Warsaw, with staff speaking German, Polish, Romanian and to some extent other Slavic languages. The original idea was that staff would circulate around Germany, talking to migrants and helping them with problems at work. They also provided translation, interpretation and other expertise to IG BAU and other unions around Europe, and sometimes worked informally with other German unions, such as <italic>Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten</italic> (NGG) in meat-packing.</p>
<p>Central to EMWU’s functioning has been advocacy and publicity. Staff participate in conferences and meetings involving trade unionists and NGOs for migrant workers. Tensions with other groups sometimes play out in these forums. In one session we observed heated debate between IG BAU staff, far-left groups who opposed any cooperation with the state and business-friendly activists who opposed any policies that could exclude Polish companies from the German market. EMWU helped increase the coverage of migrant worker mistreatment in the German news media. In a search of the Lexis-Nexis database conducted in July 2010, we uncovered 56 articles mentioning EMWU in the mainstream German-language news media, all published between the formation of EMWU and its restructuring in 2008. EMWU also received coverage in the Polish press and the German-language alternative media.</p>
<p>A common problem of migrants and common reason for their contacting the EMWU is the tendency of employers to withhold wages using legally questionable means. One technique is to work migrants extremely long hours, but not pay for all the hours worked. In one case recounted to us, a group of 40 Polish men in a small concrete factory worked 350 hours per month on a salary of €1000, under €3 per hour. Often, as two EMWU representatives pointed out, the workplace becomes a labour camp, with employers taking exorbitant deductions for transportation and (substandard) room and board. In one case, an employer also deducted pay for a two-week unpaid holiday that did not take place. A third variant is the ‘dead souls’ method: firms pay salaries to workers who do not exist and underpay workers who are working.</p>
<p>Recovering lost wages can be difficult, and has been a major focus of EMWU activity. Employers escape their obligations through strategic use of bankruptcy. In these cases, from the workers’ perspective, firms and their assets disappear, leaving workers owed several weeks’ back pay. Employers also hide their assets using complex transnational networks of organizations, many of them shell companies (<italic>Strohmänner</italic>). Even in a relatively simple case of an Austrian contractor using a Hungarian labour-supply agency on a British site, we heard the contractor argue that it was difficult logistically to get the Hungarian employer to change the payments to reflect what had been agreed with the union. In more complex cases, workers are not aware of the nationality of their employer, because it is obscured by a chain of shell companies used to skim profits and hide assets. Using the courts to recover wages requires proving the links in these chains. A further problem is the complexity of legal jurisdictions. In more than one case, we heard of Polish contractors who had substantially reduced their back wage payments by moving the venue to a different regional court. Although the AEntG addresses this problem by making main contractors liable for back pay, these complexities make it difficult for main contractors to police the contracting chain.</p>
<p>The closed nature of the German labour market was acknowledged by many of our interviewees as part of the problem. Germany was among the member states that restricted labour market access by migrants from the accession countries that joined the EU in 2004 until 2011; consequently, such workers were pushed into bogus self-employment or posted labour arrangements, with circumscribed or unenforceable social rights. Under the terms of the accession treaty, direct employees could be excluded, but not service-providing firms or the self-employed. Although workers could not usually be deported, they could still lose their jobs if their employer was forced to shut down. This was a sensitive topic for IG BAU officials, who felt that opening the labour market would have led to more severe job cuts and pressures for concessions in Germany, and who felt the tension between protecting current union members and representing temporary migrant workers.</p>
<p>The EMWU office in Warsaw advises and assists Polish migrants intending to work temporarily in Germany, mainly in construction, but also in meat-packing and agriculture. Partly in response to the worry that EMWU might compete with national unions outside Germany, staff define it as an information centre rather than a union. (Its German and Polish names, <italic>Europäischer Verband der Wanderarbeiter</italic> and <italic>Europejskie Stowarzyszenie Pracowników Migracyjnych</italic>, use the word for association, rather than trade union.) EMWU staff advise workers on the norms of working in Germany and other EU member states before they leave their home country and provide contact details of Polish-speaking union officials in destination countries. This service allows a migrant worker to learn about unions or, in the case of IG BAU, to join the union before leaving Poland. Promoting union membership among potential migrants, however, is not easy, partly because of the retreat of labour in post-communist Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959680112474748">Ost, 2005</xref>). Our Polish interviewees pointed to a lack of union awareness among young people, disillusionment with <italic>Solidarność</italic> because of its support for the right-wing government in the late 1990s and the disengagement of Polish unions from migrants in the west. To reach departing migrants, EMWU advertises in the Polish press.</p>
<p>EMWU staff reported that this information centre works well. The geography and the scope of activities of the Warsaw office are very wide and not limited to the recruitment of members for IG BAU; some of its work provides a service to other unions. The model allows EMWU to provide support to non-unionized Polish workers in Western countries who might otherwise be left with no assistance whatsoever. The Warsaw office also helps returning migrants, especially those with ongoing court cases in Germany or Poland. Staff report that since its founding, the office has assisted over a thousand people.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt office deals with migrant workers in Germany, whether or not they are union members. The staff are Polish and Romanian, representing the languages of the bulk of posted workers in the country, and the Polish speakers have some facility in Russian, Slovakian and Bulgarian. Some queries concern everyday life: where to find a Polish-speaking doctor or Catholic priest or a Polish shop. Others concern issues such as taxes or minimum wage standards. Some queries involve serious problems at work such as unpaid wages. EMWU provides free legal support, including wage-recovery cases with German main contractors and employment tribunals with Polish companies. However, migrants facing employers from other countries may have to approach national unions in the firms’ countries of origin, which are often reluctant to help temporary migrants because of the high costs of legal support and the low likelihood that the worker will be a union member.</p>
<p>The EMWU approach did not prove a recipe for a vibrant member-driven union. With members scattered around Europe and viewing EMWU as a service agency, meetings were not well attended. With court cases lasting up to two years, keeping in touch with mobile workers proved difficult. Retaining members was also difficult: once they recovered their lost wages they would often stop paying their dues. IG BAU officials estimate that over the long term they retain 5–10 percent of those recruited through EMWU. Thus EMWU became a financial problem: IG BAU staff estimate that expenditure was six to seven times subscription income. Consequently, in 2008, EMWU was restructured as a migrant worker information and servicing point within IG BAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680112474748">Balan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959680112474748">Schmidt-Hullmann, 2008</xref>), and in 2011 the Frankfurt office became part of a national network of union-affiliated advice centres for posted workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474748">Buntenbach, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>International relations</title>
<p>In order for EMWU to thrive, it needed financial support from unions other than IG BAU. But our interviews with trade unionists around Europe showed that they regarded EMWU as a failed and unwanted experiment that could never have succeeded. There was a reluctance to discuss the topic, but objections were many: first, EMWU was German-dominated and therefore not truly transnational; second, existing national and local union structures and projects were more effective than a separate migrant workers union; third, a transnational union would lack sufficient knowledge of existing national arrangements; and fourth, EMWU implied a form of apartheid that could lead to separate and unequal collective agreements.</p>
<p>Because EMWU was established to serve members as they circulated around Europe, it was inevitable that it would become involved in jurisdictional disputes with other unions. One example was at Olkiluoto in Finland, a nuclear power plant project with 4000 workers, of whom 1200 were agency workers from Poland. The Olkiluoto 3 project was widely cited in the news media for mismanagement, delays and mistreatment of its pan-European workforce. Without adequate structures in place for coordinating work or for monitoring working conditions, workplace problems were numerous. For example, Portuguese-speaking supervisors had difficulty communicating with Polish workers, used threats to make them work faster, employed workers under differing terms and conditions and, rather than providing health insurance, sent workers back to Poland when they became sick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474748">Niemenen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In summer 2007, Polish workers subcontracted by the Dublin-based employment agency Atlanco Rimec complained to the local office of the Finnish construction union, <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic>, about wages, working time, holiday pay and other violations. The main complaint was that Rimec had deducted 30 percent of their salaries for taxes paid to the government of Cyprus. Because the workers were Polish residents, working in Finland, for what they thought was an Irish company, they rejected the transfer of their payroll deductions to Cyprus. Local union officials and shop stewards did not pursue the matter and kept it secret from the national office, prompting the Polish workers to seek help through a variety of channels, including the EMWU office in Warsaw. Sensing an opportunity to prove its value to a foreign union, EMWU offered, via the IG BAU international department, to assist the Finnish union in their organizing efforts. Although Finnish trade unionists had frequently complained of the difficulties of organizing the Polish workers at Olkiluoto 3 and the lack of information available to help them organize, this offer infuriated the leaders of <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic>, who rejected the offer on the grounds that EMWU was not a ‘genuine’ union, and that IG BAU was too weak to be an attractive partner. Despite offering a capacity that the Finnish union admitted it needed, the proposal represented a clear threat to the geographically defined jurisdiction of <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic>.</p>
<p>For their part, the Polish construction unions also provided no support, despite being contacted by Polish workers and a Finnish shop steward. Within <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic>, some took the view that more should be done, while others wanted to avoid expending resources on foreign workers. The situation escalated when a Polish worker who had spoken on television about conditions at Olkiluoto 3 was fired and his colleagues took action, forcing <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic> to issue a strike warning. This was subsequently rescinded when Atlanco Rimec explained the reasons for the deductions. <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic> failed to involve the Polish workers sufficiently in the negotiation process to allay their suspicions, and several dozen cancelled their memberships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680112474748">Lillie and Sippola, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finland is far from unique. Like <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic>, many European unions that disapprove of EMWU have not developed an effective response. This is not to say they have ignored migrant workers. In the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and even Finland, construction unions have national or local projects to service and organize migrant workers. Some aim to organize those settled in the host country or provide advice and services for a wider range of migrants (including posted workers); and some operate information points in important countries of origin or build links to immigrant communities. But none support a transnational migrant workers’ union. In the minds of most national union officials we interviewed, the all-important question was: how would EMWU interact with local and national union work in differing legal and cultural contexts that they would not necessarily understand?</p>
<p>German unions in other sectors also did not endorse EMWU, for similar reasons: complacency over worker posting and jurisdictional sensitivities. For IG BAU, broadening the project’s sectoral coverage was less a priority than extending it to additional countries. Discussions did take place with other unions, and all but NGG rejected it, partly on the grounds that posted labour was not a serious problem in their main sectors. IG BAU officers pointed to posted workers in supply chains in the metalworking sector, in particular shipyards, but <italic>IG Metall</italic> remained uninterested in the project. This lack of interest may also have reflected the fuzziness of union jurisdictional boundaries in outsourced manufacturing. Large employers have saved money in support services such as cleaning (an IG BAU jurisdiction), catering (NGG) and logistics (<italic>ver.di</italic>), by outsourcing to companies covered by lower-paying agreements negotiated by these unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474748">Greer, 2008</xref>). An undercurrent in these discussions is the fear of <italic>IG Metall</italic> staff and activists that these workers will be recruited into another union.</p>

<title>From EMWU to ECMIN</title>
<p>In late 2008, EMWU was restructured and four out of eight staff were retained, as were the offices in Frankfurt and Warsaw. Those who would have once been EMWU members now became members of either IG BAU or the Polish migrant workers’ union; IG BAU and EMWU have worked with the Polish agricultural workers’ union <italic>ZZ Pracowników Rolnictwa</italic> to establish an association to advise agricultural workers in Germany and coordinate with FKS. Some servicing roles were shifted to IG BAU regional offices, and EMWU staff continued to provide advice and information to migrants and maintain an advocacy role for them within the union. IG BAU continued funding EMWU in order to maintain pressure on employers, and to keep the union responsive to the needs of migrants. In 2011 the office in Frankfurt became part of a new national network of advice centres for posted workers organized by the <italic>Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund</italic> (DGB) and with two years of funding from the German government. The project, which according to our interviewees is uncontroversial within IG BAU, continues.</p>
<p>IG BAU also became involved in the multilateral ECMIN project, established in 2009 and coordinated by the EFBWW. Rather than creating an alternative union membership structure, this project provides information on working conditions to anyone with an internet connection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecmin.efbww.org">http://ecmin.efbww.org</ext-link>). It was funded by the EU Commission to run from 2008 to 2010, with the goal of providing essential information on working conditions in all European member states in English, Polish, Romanian, and eventually nine languages (although there is no information in the languages of such key sending nations as Latvia and Lithuania). The German and Swiss unions have been the most enthusiastic backers. The staff of EMWU see ECMIN as a way to build national union support for a transnational approach.</p>
<p>The website provides information about national standards of pay and working conditions in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. It also gives contact information for national trade unions and for assistance in English, Polish and other languages (the Polish-language contact is EMWU). When we used this information to contact each union, responses varied. In some cases, there was no representative who could comment. One of the listed contacts told us that no migrant workers had contacted him through the ECMIN project. ECMIN is thus not yet a functioning system of transnational union representation or even a well-functioning information point.</p>
<p>When discussing the project with more active participants, however, it became apparent that ECMIN matters beyond its tangible output. Construction unions have been nationally focused until now, and some of our interviewees have found the ECMIN project useful for building international contacts. Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish and Italian unionists said that they had learned from the project, and some were emphatic that it should be expanded to include more information and partners, such as immigrant-oriented NGOs. But will ECMIN develop into a transnational worker organizing project? The answer depends on whether these new channels of communication can reassure trade unionists that transnational approaches to migrant organizing do not threaten national standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959680112474748">
<title>Analysis and implications</title>
<p>The principal reason for EMWU’s failure to become a full-fledged transnational union was the unwillingness of unions other than IG BAU to support it. It is true, however, that EMWU had internal organizational flaws. Organizing through servicing was financially unsustainable, and EMWU never became a vibrant, membership-based organization. In addition, organizing hyper-mobile workers proved to be an inherently difficult task. Worker mobility made it difficult to sustain communication between union staff and members, or to organize attendance at meetings. However, there is no evidence that these two problems were insuperable. Had EMWU developed into a genuine transnational union, European trade unions might have learned important lessons about how to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>National union objections to EMWU, however valid, were also self-fulfilling. EMWU was German-dominated because no other national union provided significant support. It therefore had few resources to organize workers outside Germany; and when it did intervene, union responses were generally hostile. Consequently, EMWU had neither the knowledge of national arrangements nor the political support of unions in other countries that it needed to serve its members. The objection that EMWU is a form of apartheid that could lead to separate and unequal collective agreements is misleading. Negotiating separate collective agreements was never a goal of the EMWU, and it worked very closely with local union officials in specific campaigns. Unions seemed reluctant to support <italic>any</italic> transnational organizing project, and ECMIN provides evidence of this. Unions from half the EU member states did not participate, although it would have merely meant posting online the kind of information that any trade union official should have ready to hand. Like <italic>Rakennusliitto</italic> in the Olkiluoto case, most construction unions in host countries have sought to maintain their right to represent the migrant workers working within their national jurisdictions – and their right to decide the limits of the representation migrants receive.</p>
<p>EMWU’s work highlights the need for transnational union structures for workers circulating around the EU. Because of their hyper-mobility, it is impractical for them to join unions in every country where they work, and it is difficult for unions to organize them. For nationally rooted trade unions this is a serious problem, since it undermines their control over the labour market and hence their power. This case, however, also demonstrates the difficulty of extending industrial citizenship to the transnational level in Europe. While workers in the EU have new civil rights to live and work in different countries, in accessing these rights they give up the rights of industrial democracy. Without collective forms of representation aimed to give a voice to pan-European workers, EU citizenship in itself may well not bring tangible improvements to working lives of workers, particularly CEE migrants working in the west (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680112474748">MacKenzie and Forde, 2009</xref>). Many trade unionists and academics blame the neoliberal outlook of lawmakers, bureaucrats and judges in EU institutions. In order for there to be meaningful European industrial citizenship, however, trade unions also have to adapt their own structures and strategies. Their failure to support EMWU, or even accept mutual recognition of union membership, means that practical access to social rights for hyper-mobile migrants may be a long way off.</p>
<p>In terms of union strategy, it is tempting to conclude on a purely negative note. The story of EMWU shows that most European construction unions are either unwilling or unable to organize hyper-mobile workers on a transnational scale. Nonetheless, some unions do approach EMWU and ask for translation services, and EMWU staff do support the ECMIN project. Tensions between IG BAU and its Polish counterparts have eased somewhat, and across Europe attitudes of construction trade unionists are changing. If in 2004 unions outside Germany rejected EMWU, some now see the value of transnational experimentation. ECMIN represents a burgeoning recognition of the need for a transnational response.</p>
<p>This shift in trade unionism could have consequences for the quality of labour citizenship for workers, both mobile and settled. Unions may turn to the state for resources and for recognition as agents of this citizenship, and they may also work across borders to reassert their control in labour markets and recruit migrants into membership in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474748">Gordon, 2007</xref>). But there is little sign in this case of an evolution towards a rank-and-file-driven ‘grass-roots internationalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474748">Umney, 2012</xref>). Trade unionism may develop as a means of protecting workers and redistributing resources in an internationalized sector, but as a passive form of citizenship lacking a parallel rebirth of worker self-organization and civic participation.</p>
