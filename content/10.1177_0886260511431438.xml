<abstract>
<p>By far, most research on the behavior of socially anxious individuals has focused on the “flight” rather than the “fight” response described in the traditional conceptualization of anxiety. More recently, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting that social anxiety and aggression may be related. The present study examined social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression within a late adolescent sample. Two forms of dating aggression were assessed: physical aggression, such as slapping, use of a weapon, or forced sexual activity, and psychological aggression, such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to one’s partner. One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a significant predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality. Notably, FNE was most predictive of increased aggression of both types when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Despite its demonstrated importance as a contextual variable, however, relationship quality did not mediate the association between FNE and psychological or physical aggression. Implications for prevailing conceptualizations of social anxiety and dating aggression are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>It is well-established that internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression, are associated with difficulties in interpersonal relationships. Defined as a tendency to avoid or feel distress in social situations and including a Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431438">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511431438">La Greca &amp; Lopez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431438">Watson &amp; Friend, 1969</xref>), social anxiety has particular relevance for the establishment and maintenance of social relationships. Individuals higher in social anxiety form fewer social relationships and the relationships they do form are characterized by less intimacy, functionality, and satisfaction than those with lower levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511431438">Alden &amp; Taylor, 2004</xref>, for a review). For the socially anxious individuals, avoidance and distress may occur in any social situation in which there is an actual or perceived evaluative component, including social situations that are novel as well as ones that are commonly experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511431438">La Greca &amp; Lopez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431438">Watson &amp; Friend, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Attempts to understand the behavior of individuals with social anxiety have generally focused on social withdrawal, escape, and avoidance. Moscovitch and colleagues refer to this as an emphasis on the “flight” response in the traditional “fight or flight” model of anxiety and note that far less attention has been paid to the “fight” response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431438">Moscovitch, McCabe, Antony, Rocca, &amp; Swinson, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting links between social anxiety, or features thereof, and anger and aggression. For example, Muris and colleagues found that younger adolescents with social anxiety are more likely to perceive ambiguous situations as threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511431438">Muris, Luermans, Merckelbach, &amp; Mayer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511431438">Muris, Merckelbach, &amp; Damsma, 2000</xref>). These findings led the authors to later speculate that socially anxious individuals may be more likely to react with aggression in situations in which they feel threatened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511431438">Muris, Merckelbach, &amp; Walczak, 2002</xref>). Some support for this speculation comes from the literature on a closely related construct, rejection sensitivity. Rejection sensitivity is defined as an individual’s tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and emotionally overact to perceived threats of rejection by close social others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431438">Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, &amp; Khouri, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431438">Purdon, Antony, Monteiro, &amp; Swinson, 2001</xref>). Men high in rejection sensitivity have a greater probability of engaging in dating aggression once in an intimate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431438">Downey, Feldman, &amp; Ayduk, 2000</xref>). Whereas those with social anxiety assume they are being judged negatively in social situations, those with rejection sensitivity assume that others will reject them. Responding to ambiguous cues as if they are signals of negative evaluation or rejection may lead to anger and aggression in anticipation of a perceived threatening situation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some findings suggest that socially anxious individuals avoid conflict in close relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431438">Davila and Beck (2002)</xref> found that socially anxious individuals report greater desire to avoid conflict, as well as actual avoidance of conflict in their close relationships. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431438">DeWall, Buckner, Lambert, Cohen, and Fincham (2010)</xref> found that, although socially anxious individuals reported feeling greater hostility toward others, they were less likely to engage in aggressive behavior toward a stranger in an analogue laboratory situation. A possible alternative explanation of these findings is that socially anxious individuals are more likely to engage in less direct forms of aggression that allow them to express their anger in response to a threat while avoiding overt conflict with an interaction partner. Two recent studies examining anxiety and less direct forms of aggression in young adolescent friendships bear this out. In contrast to more overt physical forms, relational and social aggression (often viewed as synonymous constructs and heretofore referred to as social aggression; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431438">Underwood, Galen, &amp; Paquette, 2001</xref>, for a review and discussion) are both aimed at undermining relationships or social standing and include the use of social manipulation through verbal behaviors, rejection, and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431438">Crick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431438">Galen &amp; Underwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431438">Underwood et al., 2001</xref>). In a sample of middle school students, features of social anxiety predicted self-reported use of social aggression but not physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431438">Loukas, Paulos, &amp; Robinson, 2005</xref>). For Men, FNE actually predicted the reduced use of physical aggression. In an investigation with college students, FNE was associated with increased self-reported use of social aggression toward peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431438">Loudin, Loukas, &amp; Robinson, 2003</xref>). These studies suggest a link between a specific component of social anxiety, FNE, and the use of nonphysical forms of aggression.</p>
<p>Two recent studies have also found links between anxiety and social aggression directed toward one’s dating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431438">Bagner, Storch, &amp; Preston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431438">Goldstein Chesir-Teran, &amp; McFaul, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431438">Goldstein and colleagues (2008)</xref> found that anxious young adults were more likely to report feelings of insecurity in their romantic relationship and they were also more likely to report engaging in social aggression directed toward their dating partner. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431438">Bagner, Storch, and Preston (2007)</xref> found romantic social aggression to be linked to a number of psychosocial adjustment variables, including depression, loneliness, and social anxiety. Notably, they found that the link between social anxiety and social aggression only held for women, though the relatively smaller number of men in their study may have limited their ability to detect a significant relationship between the variables.</p>
<p>The present study seeks to add to this growing literature by examining social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression. Among university populations, dating aggression is a serious problem. Similar to the differentiation between more and less direct aggression described above, dating aggression has been conceptualized as manifesting in two forms: physical and psychological. Physical dating aggression includes physical acts, such as slapping, use of a weapon, and forced sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511431438">Straus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431438">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511431438">Wolfe et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, psychological aggression is a more emotional and verbal form of abuse that includes behaviors such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to ones’ partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511431438">Straus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431438">Straus et al., 1996</xref>). In a cross-national sample of university students, nearly a third of students report physically assaulting a partner in the past 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511431438">Straus, 2004</xref>), and rates of psychological aggression in young adult dating relationships are much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431438">Gelles, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431438">Katz, Arias, &amp; Beach, 2000</xref>). Like social aggression, psychological aggression aims to hurt the victim through emotional rather than physical methods. Social aggression, however, differs from psychological aggression in that it is used as a means to reduce the victim’s social standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431438">Underwood, Galen, &amp; Paquette, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Given studies that have demonstrated a relationship between social anxiety and less direct forms of aggression in the general peer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431438">Loudin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431438">Loukas et al., 2005</xref>) and romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431438">Bagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431438">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>) contexts, one might expect that social anxiety would predict psychological aggression in dating relationships. It is less certain whether social anxiety would predict physical aggression. On the basis of the findings of the only prior study to include physical and social aggression as independent predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431438">Loukas et al., 2005</xref>), it seems likely that social anxiety would be more predictive of psychological than physical aggression. Exploring the role of gender was considered to be crucial given that social anxiety symptoms are more prevalent among women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511431438">Inderbitzen-Nolan &amp; Walters, 2000</xref>) and men tend to exhibit higher rates of aggression in clinical populations, though more gender parity is found in community samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431438">Dutton &amp; Nicholls, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511431438">Straus, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Another consideration in designing the present study was that overall relationship quality is a strong predictor of dating aggression. For instance, several studies have found that greater amounts of conflict within the romantic relationship predict the use of aggression against one’s partner (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431438">Coleman &amp; Straus, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431438">O’Keefe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431438">Riggs &amp; O’Leary, 1996</xref>). Styles of conflict resolution and coping strategies also predict the use of dating aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511431438">Bird, Stith, &amp; Schladale, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, there appears to be a reciprocal interaction between social anxiety and relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511431438">Vernberg, Abwender, Ewell, &amp; Beery, 1992</xref>). That is, social anxiety leads to poorer relationship quality, but levels of intimacy in close friendships also affect social anxiety overtime. It is possible that social anxiety exerts an impact on overall relationship quality, which, in turn, contributes to the likelihood of dating aggression. With these findings in mind, a robust measure of relationship quality tapping into both positive (e.g., companionship) and negative (e.g., conflict) dimensions was also included. Thus, in a particularly stringent test of social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression, we controlled for overall relationship quality in the models tested.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0886260511431438">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>This study included 412 students (243 women and 169 men) from a large university situated in a suburban community in the northeast. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 23 years (<italic>M</italic> = 19.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.19) and were predominantly White (94.2%), consistent with the ethnic composition of the surrounding community. A majority of students reported that they were currently involved in a dating relationship (61.5%) and most participants reported that they had been sexually active (85.3%). Only scores from the 361 participants (222 women and 139 men) reporting romantic relationships in the past year were used in the analyses.</p>

<sec id="section3-0886260511431438">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Students were recruited from psychology classes and participated in return for extracredit. After completing the informed consent forms, participants were administered a battery of questionnaires in group sessions lasting approximately 90 min.

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260511431438">
<title>Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A)</title>
<p>The SAS-A is a 22-item self-report questionnaire assessing social anxiety. Participants rate how well statements describe them on a 5-point Likert-type scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431438">La Greca &amp; Harrison, 2005</xref>). The SAS-A consists of three factors: Fear of Negative Evaluation, Social Anxiety and Distress in General Situations (SAD-G), and Social Anxiety and Distress in New Situations (SAD-N). On each subscale, higher scores are indicative of greater social anxiety. Adequate psychometric properties for the SAS-A have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431438">La Greca &amp; Harrison, 2005</xref>). The three factor structure, established in a child version of the measure, was confirmed through factor analysis and internal consistencies for the subscales were acceptable (Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .76 to .91). Similar internal consistencies were obtained with the current sample (Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .71 to .91).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260511431438">
<title>Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI)</title>
<p>The NRI is a measure that assesses positive and negative qualities in a variety of relationships; however, in this study only scores pertaining to romantic relationships were analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431438">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985</xref>). The NRI consists of 30 items, each rated on a 5-point scale. The items are summed to compute 10 subscales with 3 items each. The subscales are then combined to form two broadband factors, Social Support and Negative Interactions. The Social Support Factor of the NRI consists of the Companionship, Instrumental Aid, Intimacy, Nurturance, Affection, Admiration, and Reliable Alliance subscales. The Negative Interactions Factor consists of the Conflict and Antagonism subscales. The scale scores for the relative power subscale are not included in the factor scores and were not used in the analyses for this study.</p>
<p>Analysis of internal consistency has yielded satisfactory reliability for the 10 scales with mean alphas equal to .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431438">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985</xref>). In addition, adequate test-retest reliability has been established for the Social Support Factor over a 1-month period (<italic>r</italic> ranging from .66 to .77 across four relationships types, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511431438">Connolly &amp; Konarski, 1994</xref>). In an adolescent sample, Cronbach’s alphas for positive qualities ranged from .94 to .95 and for negative qualities ranged from .83 to .84 for romantic relationships and friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431438">La Greca &amp; Harrison, 2005</xref>). The internal consistencies in the current study were .94 for the Social Support composite and .92 for the Negative Interactions composite.</p>

<p>The CTS2 assesses the frequency of various conflict strategies used in romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431438">Straus et al., 1996</xref>). This 78-item questionnaire includes scales assessing negotiation, psychological aggression, sexual coercion, physical assault, and injury. Participants are asked to report on their own and their romantic partner’s behavior in the romantic relationship over the past year. This study focused on the psychological aggression and physical assault scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431438">Straus et al., 1996</xref>) and only included participants’ reports of their own aggressive behavior.

<title>Relationships Among Study Variables</title>
<p>To examine the relationships among study variables zero-order correlations were conducted for the entire sample and by gender (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431438">Table 2</xref>). As would be expected, the three subscales of the SAS-A were significantly correlated with each other for both men and women and across the total sample. Participants who scored higher on FNE also tended to score higher on SAD-N and in General Situations (SAD-G). Similarly, those who scored higher on SAD-N tended to score higher on SAD-G. With regard to the aggression dimension, men and women who reported more negative interactions in their romantic relationship also tended to report higher physical and psychological aggression. For men only, dating aggression was associated with higher levels of FNE. Finally, physical and psychological aggressions were moderately correlated with each other for both genders.</p>

<p>For the total sample, aspects of the romantic relationship were related to specific components of social anxiety. Notably, individuals higher in FNE also tended to report more negative interactions with their romantic relationships. In contrast, greater social support in the romantic relationship was related to lower SAD-G. Likewise, increased social support was associated with greater psychological dating aggression. None of these associations held when examined separately by gender.</p>

<sec id="section11-0886260511431438">
<title>Social Anxiety and Relationship Qualities as Predictors of Dating Aggression</title>
<p>Preliminary regression analyses revealed that gender significantly interacted with social anxiety and romantic relationship quality variables to predict both physical and psychological aggressions. Thus, all subsequent analyses were performed separately for men and women. To examine the relative contributions of social anxiety and relationship quality to the prediction of psychological and physical dating aggression, four separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. First controlling for positive and negative relationship qualities, social anxiety was entered in the second step in all models. Possible two-way interactions between these variables were entered in the third step.</p>
<p>The first two models tested social anxiety and relationship quality as predictors of psychological dating aggression (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511431438">Table 3</xref>). For the men, the best fitting model included social anxiety, relationship quality, and their interaction. Together, these variables accounted for 36% of the variance in psychological dating aggression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As expected, relationship quality, particularly negative interactions, accounted for the major portion of this variance. When the social anxiety variables were added in the second step, however, the model retained its significance and FNE emerged as a unique predictor (<italic>F</italic> change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Considering the significant interactions, the final model indicated that men with greater FNE and more negative interactions in their romantic relationships tended to exhibit higher levels of psychological aggression than those with lower levels of these qualities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260511431438">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, general distress in social situations interacted with poorer relationship quality such that men with lower levels of distress and negative interactions reported engaging in fewer acts of psychological aggression, whereas lower levels of distress and increased negative interactions were associated with more psychological aggression toward a partner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886260511431438">Figure 2</xref>). For the women, the best fitting model accounted for 36.4% of the variance in psychological dating aggression, but negative interactions was the only unique predictor.</p>

<p>The next two models tested social anxiety and relationship quality as predictors of physical dating aggression (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260511431438">Table 4</xref>). For the men, the best fitting model included social anxiety, relationship characteristics, and their interaction. Together, these variables accounted for 28% of the variance in physical dating aggression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Specifically, relationship quality and FNE emerged as unique predictors, as did their interaction. Men with greater FNE and more negative interactions tended to exhibit greater physical aggression than those with lower levels of FNE and negative interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0886260511431438">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, high FNE, when combined with greater social support, was associated with higher levels of physical aggression, whereas lower FNE when combined with greater social support was associated with lower levels of physical aggression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0886260511431438">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, and inconsistent with expectations, general distress in social situations seemed to protect against engaging in physical aggression toward a partner. For the women, the best fitting model predicting physical dating aggression accounted for 6.4% of the variance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and, as in model for psychological aggression, only negative interactions proved to be a unique predictor.</p>

<p>The links between FNE and psychological aggression for men were hypothesized to be mediated by relationship quality. Mediation analyses were attempted, but because FNE was not associated with negative interactions or social support, the basic criteria for mediation were not met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511431438">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present investigation explored social anxiety as a predictor of physical and nonphysical forms of aggression within late adolescent romantic relationships. A specific component of social anxiety, FNE, was found to contribute to the prediction of both psychological and physical aggressions. Although no gender differences in the absolute levels of the social anxiety or dating variables emerged, the impact of FNE on the aggression variables was found only for men and it remained a significant predictor even after controlling for the effects of romantic relationship quality. Notably, FNE appeared to exert a stronger effect on physical and psychological aggression when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Somewhat unexpectedly, there was no evidence of a mediational role for the relationship quality variables, as FNE alone was not associated with negative interactions.</p>
<p>The observed association between FNE and psychological aggression supports and extends prior empirical research linking other nonphysical forms of aggression and anxiety in peer and romantic contexts. One notable difference is that the association between the two variables was found only for men in the present study. This is somewhat surprising, given that other investigations have either failed to find gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431438">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431438">Loudin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431438">Loukas et al., 2005</xref>) or found that the association held only for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431438">Bagner et al., 2007</xref>). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the present study assessed psychological aggression, whereas these earlier investigations focused on relational aggression. Although psychological and relational aggressions share some features, the intent of relational aggression is to covertly damage a relationship, whereas psychological aggression is more often thought of as a means of controlling a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431438">Linder, Crick, &amp; Collins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431438">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>). The desire for control in one’s relationship has been theoretically and empirically linked to dating aggression, particularly for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431438">Johnson, 2006</xref>). The notion of control seems central to understanding why socially anxious men may be more likely to engage in psychological aggression with their dating partners than their female counterparts. Men who expect their partners to evaluate them negatively may also fear that their partners will ultimately reject them.</p>
<p>A primary goal for individuals who fear negative evaluation is to avoid rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431438">Watson &amp; Friend, 1969</xref>). In more general social situations, this is achieved through avoidance. It is less clear how socially anxious individuals attempt to avoid rejection in the context of their close relationships, and whether relationship maintenance strategies may differ according to gender. Women may react to perceived negative evaluation by their partner by enacting a strategy that involves emotional inhibition and conflict avoidance. In contrast, men may attempt to avoid rejection by shifting the balance of power to themselves through dominance and aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>The idea that men who fear rejection are more likely to engage in dating aggression has found support in the literature on rejection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431438">Downey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431438">Downey et al., 1998</xref>) and adult attachment styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431438">Bookwala &amp; Zdaniuk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511431438">Dutton, Saunders, Starzomski, &amp; Bartholomew, 1994</xref>). Essentially, these studies have found that men who anxiously expect and more readily perceive rejection in their romantic relationships are at risk for engaging in hostile and aggressive behavior toward their dating partner. Such an interpretation is also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511431438">Crick and Dodge’s (1994)</xref> social information processing model, wherein the mere perception that one is being negatively evaluated may result in retaliation through aggression.</p>
<p>Although rejection sensitivity and insecure attachment styles are conceptually related to FNE, they remain distinct constructs. One notable distinction is that socially anxious individuals try to avoid conflict in their close relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431438">Davila &amp; Beck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431438">DeWall et al., 2010</xref>). As such, they may be less likely to use overt, physical forms of aggression. By its very nature, psychological aggression is a more subtle form of aggression than physical aggression. At times, an individual can perpetrate psychological aggression without any direct contact with the victim (e.g., by destroying something belonging to a partner) which can prevent retaliation or confrontation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431438">Björkqvist, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, it may seem appropriate to respond to negative evaluations (or perceived negative evaluations) by a romantic partner with psychological harm (insulting a partner). This may seem to be a more fitting “punishment” for the perceived “crime.”</p>
<p>The observed relationship, even if modest, between FNE and physical aggression was unexpected given our belief that those with social anxiety would avoid direct confrontations with their partners. Psychological aggression is often seen as a precursor to more overt forms of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431438">O’Leary, Malone, &amp; Tyree, 1994</xref>) and perhaps this finding is reflective of such a developmental sequence. It is possible that the relationship between anxiety and physical aggression may become more apparent in relationships that are longer in duration or more committed than those of the young adults evaluated in this study. The weaker relationship could also be explained by lower rates of physical aggression in dating relationships relative to psychological aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511431438">Swahn, Simon, Arias, &amp; Bossarte, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, individual characteristics (e.g., early learning history, exposure to violence) that were not explored in the current study might play a more important role than FNE in predicting physical aggression, thus accounting for the more modest predictive power of FNE.</p>
<p>Given the well-known link between dating aggression and relationship quality, it is remarkable that FNE remained a predictor of both psychological and physical aggression, even after controlling for romantic relationship quality. Nonetheless, relationship quality was found to be a critical contextual variable. The interactions appear to suggest that it is not FNE alone that results in increased aggression, but rather FNE in conjunction with greater perceived negative interactions in the romantic relationship, with similar patterns emerging for both physical and psychological aggressions. This suggests that the risk for aggression may be compounded when men who fear negative evaluation also perceive their romantic relationships to be relatively antagonistic. It is notable that high FNE, in conjunction with lower perceived negative interactions, was associated with lower levels of aggression. Such a finding would seem to suggest that risk for aggression is only evident when individuals extend their FNE to the romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Interestingly, FNE interacted with high social support to predict increased physical aggression. Though not tested in the present investigation, this is consistent with the idea that physical aggression becomes more prevalent in more committed relationships. Perhaps ironically, men who fear negative evaluation may be more likely to use physical aggression in their relationship as the degree to which they are invested in the relationship increases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431438">Downey et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, it is notable the effect of social anxiety on aggression was limited to the specific FNE component. Indeed, general social anxiety seemed to serve as a buffer against engaging in physical aggression toward one’s partner.</p>
<p>Despite its interesting and informative findings, the present study was somewhat limited by its use of a college student sample and reliance on self-report measures. A university sample may not be representative of other populations of interest, such as younger adolescents, older adults, or those with clinical diagnoses. For example, perhaps the demonstrated pattern of increased aggression is more prominent in a sample of individuals who meet criteria for social anxiety disorder. It should be noted, however, that college students are no analogue sample for this area of research. As reviewed, dating aggression is a serious problem in university communities with 1-year prevalence rates for the most severe forms approaching 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511431438">Straus, 2004</xref>). In addition to research with other populations, future studies should move beyond self-report measures and focus on the mechanisms by which anxiety increases the use of aggression. Measures assessing relationship variables, coping styles, and social skills could shed light on what factors increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior in the dating relationships of individuals high in FNE. For example, by observing in vivo communications between partners, the role of interaction styles, conflict, or other relationship variables could be examined more directly. Assessing coping and social skills could help to inform whether socially anxious individuals experience more conflict with their partners or are less equipped to respond appropriately to such conflict.</p>
<p>That socially anxious individuals are capable of forming and maintaining close relationships is well known; however, there is scant information regarding the quality of these relationships or how socially anxious individuals behave once in them. This is surprising given the sheer prevalence of social anxiety in community populations. The information that is available suggests that socially anxious individuals report poorer relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511431438">Cuming &amp; Rapee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511431438">Sparrevohn &amp; Rapee, 2009</xref>), difficulty in expressing their emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511431438">Kashdan, Volkmann, Breen, &amp; Han, 2007</xref>), and problems communicating effectively with their partners, especially during conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511431438">Wenzel, Graff-Dolezal, Macho, &amp; Brendle, 2005</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511431438">Wenzel and colleagues (2005)</xref> found that socially anxious individuals were more likely than controls to engage in maladaptive communication behaviors with their romantic partners, including “put-downs,” “blaming,” and “character assassinations” when discussing problems in their relationship. Although such behaviors seem inconsistent with traditional conceptions of the socially anxious, they are consistent with more recent findings that highlight links between social anxiety, hostility, and aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431438">Bagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431438">DeWall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431438">Kashdan &amp; McKnight, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study adds to this small body of work by suggesting that men who fear negative evaluation are at risk for aggression in their romantic relationships, particularly if they perceive their relationship to be of poor quality. When individuals perceive that they are being negatively evaluated, they may attempt to retaliate with aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431438">Downey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511431438">Muris et al., 2002</xref>). This would be consistent with a “fight” response to an anxiety-provoking situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431438">Moscovitch et al., 2008</xref>). Although our findings may seem inconsistent with traditional conceptualizations of socially anxious individuals as conflict-avoidant and eager to please, it does seem to fit well with the more complex picture of social anxiety that is emerging from recent research linking the construct to anger, hostility, and aggression. Future research is needed to better understand how FNE and use of aggression in romantic relationships are related.</p>
