<p>Economic History had witnessed two important trends in the recent past. One, technological innovation has widely been acclaimed as the <italic>de facto</italic> source of growth. Second, the nations in the world are increasingly becoming integrated in several dimensions, albeit of different degrees. It is evident that national boundaries are getting dissolved for trade and capital flows, but restrictions on the flow of technology is still intact and increasingly being tightened. Subsequently, on the one hand, the concept of ‘Global Innovation Systems’ (GIS) are emerging and on the other hand the strict Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are imposed.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the issue of understanding the modes of technological accumulation, especially for the developing countries is increasingly becoming important. Liberalization of technology flows is indispensable not only for overall economic development but also for mitigating inequalities within and between countries. The book under review is addressing these issues in great detail and depth. The book is an outcome of an International Conference held at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur in February, 2009 that attracted the attention of scholars from all over the globe. Initially, with an initiative to enhance the cooperation amongst the Indian and Russian research community, the conference assumed the international perspective.</p>
<p>The entire book was divided into eight interesting themes. To call them themes would actually narrow the vast area that each individual theme subsumes. The book covers various issues in the vast field. Each individual theme opens a plethora of issues and debates that are looking for resolutions and discussions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0976399613480898">
<title>International Cooperation, Institutions and Policies</title>
<p>International cooperation in science leads to accumulation of a global pool of knowledge by reducing redundancy in doing research. The papers under theme one address these issues in great detail. Kolchinsky made an interesting comparative analysis of the different patterns of academic network in the Soviet and post-Soviet period. Anant and Bali take into consideration the international cooperation in the field of social sciences from the perspective of a developing country like India. On the similar lines, Yusupova had highlighted the international collaboration of Russian and Mongolian researchers. However, a very interesting paper authored by Aggarwal, Lal and Chauhan takes into account the extent of international competitiveness of Indian exports in the increasing globalized and technologically advanced world. Based on an intensive data analysis, the study gave a number of important policy implications. The study would have been more enriching if the authors had analyzed the same firms for over a long period of time and also analyzed the changing pattern of exports for those firms.</p>
<p>The next set of papers involves the issue of institutions and their impact on development. It is evident that institutions play an important part in the process of development. In the past very scant attention has been given to the role of institutions, but they have assumed an important part in the analysis of the development. Yet the understanding of institutions as a concept and more over its relationship with development is somewhat limited. Institutions refers to the rules of game that could be formal or informal. But in every dimension, the role of State is important in the proper implementation of the rules. These broad issues of Institutional liberalization were taken up under theme two of the book consisting of four papers.</p>
<p>The first paper under the present theme is by Yurevich who takes the issue of liberalization in the contemporary Russian science and scholarship. The paper highlighted that the Russian research was more concentrated in the centre than the periphery and lots of initiatives are required for the even spread of the researchers within the country.</p>
<p>The unprecedented progress made by the Chinese in the field of S&amp;T is well evident. It had witnessed a structural transformation towards the high technology intensive production and exports during the past two decades. But Cao had highlighted the problems that the Chinese S&amp;T research had faced after the opening of the economy, like over anxiousness to get quick results, dissention of intellectual property, plagiarism and misconducts in research. Thus, the paper draws the attention towards other aspects of fast moving frontiers of Chinese technological trajectory.</p>
<p>Next, it is evident that public policies have been a major ingredient of national development strategies, especially in the catching up process. From the first industrial revolution to the more recent advancement of East Asian economies, the role of public policies remained pivotal. A separate theme under the title ‘S&amp;T policy and Industrial Interaction’ is included in the book to justify the importance of the issue. All four papers were included in the section.</p>
<p>Jimenez discussed the S&amp;T policy in Latin America since 1950s, but still the paper concludes that there is a need to do a lot more in order to enhance the technological capability in the region. Petrova and Lomovitskaya had taken the issue of discussing the importance of including the scientific elite in the mainstream of policy formation in Post-Soviet Russia that could be beneficial in transforming the structure of the economy from the raw based economy into high technology one. In a somewhat similar perspective, Saha had discussed the role of parliament in framing and implementation of S&amp;T policy in the liberalization period in India. Thus, these papers stressed the importance of constructive and strategic roles that the State should perform for the inclusive development of the economy.</p>

<title>Innovation Systems</title>
<p>The process of economic development involves building capabilities by ensuring research in indigenous universities and public laboratories as a deliberate and creative effort. Often, it is found that the interaction between academia and industry is weak due to various reasons—that needs, to be bridged. Papers by Nath, Sharan, Chandra, Jain and Naik and Kathuria, take the issue of industry-academia relationship in a broader standpoint from the perspective of a developing country like India. These papers found that there is an urgent requirement of ‘need-based’ research in India for enhancing the technological capabilities of the industry in the country. A similar exercise was done for Russia by Ivanova in the section.</p>
<p>The section also included some sector specific studies like the work of Banarjee regarding the strategies of innovation in the biomedical sector in India. Also. Bhattacharya and Lal analyzed the factors that contributed to the structural transformation towards higher end of value chain within the Indian software industry.</p>
<p>In the section, the issue of National Innovation Systems (NIS) in the era of liberalization was also raised. The perspective of NIS for developing countries had been analyzed by Singh and Singh. Various input and output indicators of R&amp;D expenditure had been used for the analysis and suitable policy implication for strengthening the national innovation system in the developing countries had been suggested. The paper is indeed an important contribution in the literature of innovation studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the last couple of decades had also witnessed an intensification of intellectual property rights (IPRs). These are economic and legal institutions that have evolved from national to intra-national in scope. Advanced countries are using IPRs to sustain their competiveness while developing countries are trying to reap the strategic benefit by fine-tuning them according to their specific need. But the issue is a centre of debate and controversy ever since. The papers under the theme ‘Socio-economic implications of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)’ are catering to these issues. The case of IPR and plant molecular biology in India was discussed by Mallick, while Shanker’s study deals with the issue of IPRs and traditional knowledge in India. The case of plants tissue culture is taken up in a profound study by Reddy. All these papers had successfully drawn the attention towards the specific problems and prospects in the respective sectors.</p>

<title>Mobility, Communication and Innovation</title>
<p>The relationship between migration and development is very intricate to decipher. The issue of skilled or unskilled migration, the question of remittances, permanent or temporary migration etc. adds to the complexity of the issue. But the impact of migration of skilled manpower and more so permanent migration has an adverse effect on productivity, employment and overall development of the home nation which is still developing with paucity of resources and human capital. With globalization and advanced means of transportation and communication, the movement of people has increased several folds. Subsequently, there are various institutional norms that obstruct such flows. This broader issue was one of the themes of the book. Gracia took up these issues in a very holistic manner. Asheulova emphasized that the mobility of scientists within nations acts as a source of technological accumulation in the home country, but the issue of brain drain has grave consequences that could have a dampening effect from developmental point of view. Similarly Allakhverdyan had highlighted the problems of increasing migration from Russia after the disintegration of USSR. All these papers highlighted that there is a need to build diaspora networks to deal with the problem of brain drain.</p>
<p>It is a known fact that advances in communication has transversed the path of development. The pace of catching up has increased at an unprecedented level. These issues also found space in the book and Mirskaya had discussed the importance of ICT as a driving force in contemporary Russia while Tyagi took the case of science communication in India.</p>
<p>The scope of the book is too wide to give justice to all the wonderful contributions in a limited space. Thus, an attempt was made to present the flavour of the book in a very concise manner.</p>
<p>This book is definitely a researcher’s delight due to the depth and extensive-ness of the coverage. The book is relevant for not only those who are concerned with the area of sociology of science and technology, but is equally relevant for those who work in the area of economics of science and technology. The editor’s expertise becomes apparent for their successful synchronization of vast issues in a holistic manner. The work would have been more involving and enriching if the discussant’s point of view could also be included in the book while releasing the book in two different volumes. To conclude, I strongly recommend this book for those who are interested in the field of innovation and development. This book introduces one to the vast issues and debates in the field of Sociology and Economics of Science &amp; Technology.</p>
