<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most common complaints about the shoulder is musculoskeletal pain, as it produces physical disability and limits daily living activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512445068">1</xref></sup> An aetiology frequently linked to shoulder pain is tendinopathy. Certain types of electromagnetic radiation such as laser are commonly used as a therapy in this pathology for the purpose of relieving pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512445068">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512445068"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512445068">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another therapy is that using diode light, which consists of light delivered by emitting diodes generated via the process of spontaneous emission. Besides its lower cost, an additional advantage of light-emitting diodes over the current laser sources is that, when implemented in a cluster applicator, the emitted energy can be not only distributed over a larger area of the skin but also delivered in a wide broadband optical spectrum, including many wavelengths. One drawback often attributed to light-emitting diodes is that they emit incoherent light. At this point it is important to note that until the mid-1990s, most of the therapeutic effect of the light was attributed to a feature called ‘coherence’, for which light wave fronts are in phase. Nevertheless, incoherent diode light is currently being tested, and has been shown to produce a bio-modulating response within living tissue with some therapeutic effects in the stimulation of cell function. This type of light has been demonstrated to increase fibroblast proliferation in animal models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512445068">12</xref></sup> to be effective as an anti-inflammatory agent in <italic>in vitro</italic> induced arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512445068">13</xref></sup> and to improve the process of tendon repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512445068">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512445068">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In humans, diode light has been used as a therapy for pain reduction in experimentally induced delayed-onset muscle soreness, and has been reported to accelerate the wound-healing process, to change the sural nerve velocity and to be a positive influence in nerve regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512445068">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512445068"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512445068">19</xref></sup> As a result of these encouraging findings, opinion about the therapeutic action of non-coherent light such as diode light is changing, and nowadays is a matter of discussion.</p>
<p>Superluminescent light-emitting diodes join the high power and brightness of laser device radiation with the low coherence of the emitting diode’s light. They produce amplified spontaneous emissions over a wide range of wavelengths. The optical output and penetration of superluminescent diodes are between that of light-emitting diodes and laser devices and its optical spectrum covers several tens of nanometers. Light penetration depends mainly on wavelength and power. Nevertheless, there is not an exact limit with respect to the light penetration depth in soft tissues. In human tissue, laser light can reach 50 mm, while light penetration from diodes is considerably smaller, about 10 mm, although some researchers have achieved 23 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512445068">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The superimposition of two or more identical light waves results in their mutual reinforcement and generates constructive interference at the points at which they are in phase, resulting in a wave whose amplitude is bigger than the original waves. The purpose of using two active applicators emitting at the same time is to take advantage of the phenomenon of interference, strengthening the intensity of the light at some points deep inside the tissue, that is to say, increasing the effective depth of penetration in comparison with the use of just one applicator as is usually used in conventional treatment. The applicators used in this study combine light-emitting and superluminescent diodes, in a cluster configuration.</p>
<p>A precursor of this therapy was interferential electrical therapy, based on the interaction and superposition of two different alternating medium frequency currents. This technique is still used in physiotherapy to reduce pain. In the electromagnetic range, interferential laser therapy based on the superposition and interference of two lasers has also been used to treat knee and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders, with the same aim of alleviating pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512445068">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512445068">21</xref></sup> However, the same technique using light from superluminescent diodes has not yet been applied as a therapeutic tool according to the MEDLINE database.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to test the safety of diode light therapy using two clustered diode probes and to evaluate the advantages of the simultaneous emission of both combined probes over conventional therapy based in only one active probe of the same characteristics in the relief of shoulder pain and disability caused by shoulder tendinopathies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512445068" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a randomized, controlled and single-blind pilot study. A total of 34 patients with unilateral shoulder pain who met the inclusion criteria were recruited within the period between November 2009 and April 2010 in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service (Unit of Physiotherapy) at Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid (Spain). The study inclusion criteria were patients above 18 years old with acute shoulder pain or chronic patients with an acute episode of recurrent pain from tendinopathy. The diagnosis was alternatively evaluated by ultrasonography, X-ray and magnetic resonance image. Exclusion criteria were patients with shoulder pain associated with radicular cervical spine, implanted prostheses, central neurological aetiology affectation, fractures, tumours, braquial plexus palsy, fibromyalgia, other musculoskeletal shoulder disorders, as well as those undergoing an exercise-based treatment programme within the period of this study. The protocol was previously approved by the hospital’s Ethic Committee Board on Human Research.</p>
<p>Two of the patients screened for eligibility were rejected for exclusion criteria and another two refused to participate before starting the study. For the allocation of the 30 remaining participants, block randomization was made by a computer-generated random number list of elements with two possible random values (1 or 2), prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The selected patients were consecutively assigned a number on the random list when they first came for treatment. Patients assigned with 1 received interferential light therapy (group 1) and those assigned with 2 received conventional light therapy (group 2). To preserve the allocation concealment, the random list was handled only by the non-clinical investigator, who was also responsible for giving the daily sequence of treatments to the physiotherapist. The purpose of the study was previously explained to the patients both orally and in writing and an informed consent was obtained.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215512445068">
<title>Therapeutic procedure</title>
<p>The therapy was applied in all cases with two independent and identical devices (Mettler Electronics Sys Stim 540, Anaheim, CA, USA) equipped with a multi-diode cluster applicator combining seven light-emitting diodes at 660 nm and 12 superluminiscent diodes at 950 nm wavelength, with a peak power of 500 mW and an average power of 310 mW. Diodes were distributed on each applicator in a circular arrangement covering an area of 4.50 cm<sup>2</sup>. The output activation was achieved by using a capacitance switch on the handheld applicator. The optical output power was calibrated using a Gentec-EO Optical Meter b model UP19K-15S-H5-DO; S/N: 163116 (Gentec-Electro-Optics, Inc., Québec, Canada).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215512445068">
<title>Interferential light therapy</title>
<p>In this group, the two applicators were active and placed on opposite sides of the shoulder joint, covering the pain-affected zone. In each session, treatment was applied in two successive applications. After the first application, the pair of applicators were slightly moved a short distance, and a second application was made. The energy delivered in each application was 84 J, 42 J per applicator with a power density of 67 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The resulting energy density at the skin was 10.3 J/cm<sup>2</sup> in all cases. The total energy dose per session (two applications) was 168 J. The accumulated energy delivered during the entire treatment was 1680 J.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215512445068">
<title>Conventional light therapy</title>
<p>For blinding purposes of the study, the procedure was the same as in the interferential group, except that now only one of the two applicators was active, so the total dose per session (in two applications) was 84 J. The accumulated energy delivered in this case during the entire treatment was 840 J.</p>
<p>The treatment technique chosen in both groups was the contact mode, applying the cluster probes and holding them firmly pressed to the skin. Patients were always in a seated position with the shoulder at rest and in medial rotation. The mode selected was pulsed, and the pulse modulation frequency was automatically applied step-by-step by the device along 10 interval values, from 10 Hz to 5 kHz, with a cycle duration of 10 seconds, 1 second at each step. The sessions were given over two weeks, at a rate of five per week.</p>
<p>The patient-blinding procedure consisted in a twofold action. First, the two applicators were applied to all patients, regardless of whether one or both of them were active. Patients wore a pair of goggles that besides giving protection, prevented them from seeing the light spot of the applicator that was switched on. The front panel of the power supply was located behind the patients and outside their visual field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269215512445068">
<title>Outcome measurements</title>
<p>Pain intensity was measured by means of visual analogue scale (VAS) which provides a quantification of pain intensity in a range from no pain (0) to unbearable pain (10). The scale was applied in different situations such as at rest, at night and during voluntary active shoulder movements, such as flexion, extension, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512445068">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shoulder disability was measured by the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512445068">23</xref></sup> In this scale, the final result is given in a range from 1 to 35 (the lowest score, the worst function) by summing and averaging five subscales, namely, pain (1–10), function (1–10), active flexion range (1–5), flexion strength (1–5) and satisfaction (1–5). According to this scale, scores above 27 are considered good or satisfactory while results below 27 are considered poor.</p>
<p>Patients were evaluated immediately before the first session and immediately after the last (tenth) session of the treatment period. Evaluations were performed by a physiotherapist who was not informed about the technique each patient received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269215512445068">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Because of the non-Gaussian distribution of the variables studied, the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> non-parametric test for independent samples was selected to compare the changes in pain level detected after the two treatments. The general software used was the SPSS program (version 18.0), complemented with the STATA program (version 11) to calculate the median differences with 95% confidence interval.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The participants flow diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512445068">Figure 1</xref>. Thirty-four patients were candidates for eligibility. Two of them were rejected by exclusion criteria and another two patients refused to participate before starting the study. A total of 30 patients were randomized, assigning 15 to each group. Two subjects per group dropped out over the six-month period of the study, leaving 13 patients per group to be analysed. The characteristics of the patients classified by groups of treatment are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512445068">Table 1</xref>. At the baseline, there was no significant difference between groups considering all randomized patients (15 per group) with respect to the pain scale scores, age, weight, height and shoulder transversal diameter (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). This result was maintained with only 13 patients per group, after the drop-out of 2 patients per group during the treatment (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). No adverse reactions were seen in patients, neither in those receiving conventional light therapy nor in those receiving interferential treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, interferential light therapy using two multi-diode probes in pulsed mode proved to be safe in clinical application. In the short-term follow-up, this technique performed better than a conventional single multi-diode probe in the alleviation of the pain felt in abduction and external rotation movements, measured by visual analogue scale. No significant difference was observed between the treatments according to the parameters analysed with the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale.</p>
<p>Therapy using light from other electromagnetic sources such as laser emitting has been used in the past to reduce pain and disability associated with musculoskeletal and joint diseases, in tendinosis, tendonitis, rotator cuff disorders, subacromial impingement syndrome, muscle soreness and frozen shoulder, with controversial results, both positive and negative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512445068">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512445068"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512445068">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512445068">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512445068"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512445068"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512445068">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512445068">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512445068"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512445068">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512445068">19</xref></sup> In a previous study, our group used laser therapy in continuous mode in the treatment of shoulder and knee pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512445068">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512445068">21</xref></sup> No differences were found when comparing the treatments, although the variety of pathologies treated could be a detrimental factor to the consistency of the results. Moreover, at that time patients of groups under comparison did physiotherapy exercises during the course of the research. This factor has been eliminated in the present study, in order to avoid a possible bias in results.</p>
<p>In this study, pulsed mode emission was chosen for light application because of a report supporting that pulsed mode has been better than continuous mode in other electromagnetic radiation therapies like low-level laser therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512445068">24</xref></sup> A possible cause of this can be the generation of beating waves in the tissue, due to the superposition of primary pulsed waves, so strengthening the intensity of the light transmitted. The choice of about 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup> of energy density and 42 J of energy dose per applicator with the same output power was made based on previous studies and our own group experience with laser therapy in the treatment of shoulder pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512445068">11</xref></sup> In this study, the doses per session delivered to the patients who received interferential and conventional therapy were 168 J and 84 J, respectively. Using a lower dose than laser therapy would have been non-viable to get an indepth reinforcing effect of the two applicators, given the low penetration of the diode light.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the diode source light is not coherent and the high energy spots (speckles) generation must be low in comparison with the laser light, the results found in this study have been promising in some way and in agreement with the studies previously mentioned in the Introduction. The differences in favour of the interferential treatment found between the groups under comparison can be attributed, besides the interference, to either the mere addition of individual intensities producing a higher energy density inside the tissue, to the creation of standing waves by the two intersected waves of the same amplitude and wavelength or to the beating frequencies produced by the superposition of waves with different frequencies. The fact that the multiple diodes in the applicators were distributed in a clustered configuration and thus with many points of light emission suggests that the intersection of waves of various frequencies will generate a great multiplicity of dark periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512445068">25</xref></sup> The dark period between pulses is a more important parameter than the pulse width and can be another possible factor of influence in the therapeutic results, as has been observed in laser light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512445068">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that the difference found between treatments was shown precisely in abduction may be explained by the therapeutic action on the deltoid middle fascicle and the rotator cuff tendons, located entirely between the two clustered probes during the treatment, and so receiving the combined energy from multiple crossed light beams from both active applicators.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is that the pain relief associated with the interferential treatment may be explained by any of the above causes mentioned and not specifically due to the interference itself. The simultaneous emission of many different frequencies in the cluster probe hindered the therapeutic contribution of each specific frequency. These limitations prevent a better clarification of the causes of pain reduction. Another limitation is the diversity of pathologies treated, although most of the cases are tendinitis and only a few (3 patients) fall under the heading of other pathologies. Finally, the placebo effect has not been controlled in this short-term study.</p>
<p>Further research is needed for this technique to be validated from the clinical point of view. This should include the development of studies with larger samples, evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of diode light in the reduction of pain from other disorders, as well as changing light parameters such as power density, wavelength or pulse repetition frequency. Based on the results of this study, the sample size needed for future two-treatment parallel-design studies of these characteristics should be about 60 patients, given a study power of 0.8 at a two-sided 0.05 significance level.</p>
<p>In conclusion, interferential light therapy using a pair of multi-diode cluster probes working in pulsed emission is proven to be safe as a treatment in the reduction of shoulder pain and, in the short term, was shown to be better than conventional treatment with a single device in the reduction of shoulder pain during abduction and external rotation movements. Nevertheless, the difference found between the two treatments cannot be firmly established due to the low statistical power of this pilot study.</p>
