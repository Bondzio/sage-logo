<abstract>
<p>This paper shares an initiative conducted in Malaysia in terms of knowledge to gauge students’ Reading Age and to inform teachers of their students’ reading progress and learning. Ensuring teachers understand the needs of students’ reading ability and preparing students to read and comprehend texts are the two most fundamental parallel tasks in today’s classroom setting. Consequently, determining students’ Reading Age has become an important endeavour in recent years by many education authorities throughout the world. This study aims at incorporating the Reading Evaluation and Decoding System (READS), to ascertain students’ Reading Age and comprehension skills at macro and micro levels. This study employed a stratified sample of high school students who were in Secondary 1 through Secondary 5. Data was gathered through a generic standardized reading comprehension developed test. With a precise Reading Matrix, ESL teachers can appraise their students’ reading ability at any level by referring to the Performance Standards to distinguish whether their students are at <italic>Meet Reading Age, Below Reading Age</italic> or <italic>Above Reading Age status</italic>. Subsequently, teachers can refer to the Descriptors of Students’ Reading Abilities to find out what the students have achieved so far and what the struggling readers lacked. Accordingly, ESL teachers will be well informed of their students reading ability and accordingly can focus on reading skills development of their students. The ripple effects of READS may enhance students’ reading ability as teachers are now better informed of their students’ reading abilities and thus teachers will be able to prepare reading lessons appropriately according to their students’ reading needs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper intends to provide a fresh avenue in the understanding of secondary school students’ reading ability. This initiative includes the understanding of students’ reading performance, understanding the country’s reading standards, and students’ Reading Age, so that teachers, policy makers, schools and parents are aware of the potency of the Reading Evaluation and Decoding System (READS) which was developed from an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212451803">Abdul Rashidet al., 2010</xref>) for Malaysian English as a Second Language (ESL). The earlier study provides information regarding READS the potency of reading encoder, analyser and decoder system which eventually lead to the benchmarking of the Malaysian secondary school students Reading Age profile.</p>
<p>The focus of this paper is to benchmark the Reading Age of the secondary school students. Primarily, the study assesses the students’ reading standards i.e. to observe whether the students ‘Meet Reading Age’, are ‘Above Reading Age’ or ‘Below Reading Age’ at their educational levels. Reading Age refers to a person’s ability to read, measured by comparing it with the average ability of children of a particular age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0033688212451803">Turnbull, in Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, 2011</xref>). For example, a 14-year-old student with a Reading Age of 17. Additionally, by incorporating READS into the teachers’ assessment culture, teachers will now have a handle on their students’ true reading abilities.</p>
<p>Currently in Malaysia, the culture of test taking has become part of the school agenda. A string of federal mandated tests, state initiated tests, districts additional tests and school generated tests. What we are trying to do is to establish the reading standards based on a fully loaded data driven instrument and to introduce for the first time ever, a national standard reading ability matrix. In order to establish the reading standards, we intend to introduce READS in the Malaysian schools.</p>
<p>We developed READS and attempted to establish the Malaysian secondary school students’ Reading Age. The entire study provides ESL teachers, educators and policy makers with an important data regarding the Malaysian secondary students’ ESL reading abilities. Our study found that more than half of the students who participated in the study are at below grade level in terms of reading ability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0033688212451803">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study is to benchmark the ESL Reading Age of secondary school students’ (Secondary 1 to Secondary 5). The standardized written reading comprehension test assesses the reading comprehension ability of the students. This study does not test the oral reading abilities of the students. What we intend to look for is: What is the respondents’ Reading Age from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0033688212451803">
<title>Reading in Malaysia</title>
<p>In a developing country such as Malaysia, the assessment of reading is not conducted as rigorously as in the West or in the United States. Malaysia is still finetuning its reading corollaries. In the United States for instance; intervals of reading tests are conducted nationally. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a periodic assessment of student progress conducted in the United States by the National Center for Education Statistics. The NAEP assessment covers the areas of mathematics, reading, writing, science, and much more is conducted on representative samples of students at grades 4, 8, and 12 for the main assessments, and on samples of students at ages 9, 13, or 17 years for long-term trend assessments. The data obtained will be made public in a comprehensive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212451803">NAEP, 2010</xref>). Based on the reading scores, the policy makers, curriculum planners and more importantly, the practicing teachers will have a colossal amount of information to assist stakeholders in handling reading related matters. Contrary to our experience in Malaysia, there are test scores but the test scores may not reflect the kind of information needed by teachers and other stakeholders with regards to reading issues and challenges. Our intent is to supplement what was partially available in Malaysia by topping up and building up knowledge regarding reading abilities of the students.</p>
<p>What exactly is new? This study means a whole lot to us as researchers and we hope the ripple effects of using READS will benefit the stakeholders in the business of nurturing reading. Globally, this study will provide an insight into the development of a localized instrument to assess reading abilities for Malaysian learners and eventually we hope this instrument could be used for the ASEAN region. Consequently, the researchers also hope to address the other components of READS, such as the Reading Matrix, the Descriptors of Reading Abilities and Performance Standards documents that will precisely map the true reading abilities of the learners and consequently will benefit the rest of the world so that the West can have a glimpse of what is going on in relation to reading in Malaysia and this part of the world.</p>
<p>In the non-native English speaking countries, there is infinite talk about upgrading the standard of the English language and the importance of literacy to ensure that no one is left behind. This development is also taking place in Malaysia even though English is a mandatory subject in all primary and secondary schools curriculum and officially accepted as a second language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212451803">Ministry of Education of Malaysia, 2000</xref>). Secondary education in Malaysia is from age 13 to 17 (Secondary 1 to Secondary 5). The time allocated for the teaching of English in the secondary schools is 200 minutes per week with the 4 main language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing forming the core of the curriculum.</p>
<p>In the case of Malaysia, many secondary school students after six years of elementary education and five years of secondary education still lack sufficient reading proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212451803">Asha, 1999</xref>). She finds that the ability to read in the English language of many Malaysian students is not within desirable or acceptable levels. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212451803">Holloway (1999)</xref>, reading skills are essential to the academic achievement of lower and upper secondary school students, but many students still lack sufficient proficiency as readers, and many adolescents continue to perform at deplorable levels. Consequently, the role of ESL teachers is getting more complicated and the way they should help these learners improve must change. Our concern, therefore, will be focused on helping educators to understand the learners reading abilities and needs.</p>
<p>In the conventional reading lesson, primarily, the teacher selects a passage for the students to read, and subsequently teachers question students in order to gauge if they have understood the text. How does this lead to increased reading comprehension skills? In terms of teaching reading comprehension skills, most teachers do very little. Teachers do not deal directly with skills development nor do they help students to develop effective reading strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212451803">Croft, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In actuality, teachers must consider and take a paradigm shift to ensure that their students become powerful readers. Education authorities need to re-engineer the evaluation system in order to identify where the students are and where they should be (at what grade level) in terms of reading abilities. Currently, there are still some gaps in the assessment of the English Language Reading test scores. The results are expressed symbolically, generally as grades, with little direction and advice for improvement. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212451803">Arshad (2005</xref>:112), <italic>‘</italic>‘the mere reporting of a letter grade: A, A-, B+ B, B-, C+, C, or C- only provides generalized information and students will not be able to “learn” from this single letter grade<italic>’</italic>. The biggest problem with grades is that, they do not offer any information on how to improve. It would be more practical if a detailed score report is provided for each examination that a student takes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212451803">Oosterhof (2001</xref>) states that one of the main limitations of percentage grades is that they provide only an overall indication of student achievement as against another. They do not indicate the combination of skills that the students have achieved. Students need clear guidance on where they are, what they have to do next, and how to improve.</p>
<p>In such a case, the most sensible course of action to take would be to make use of the process of benchmarking students’ ESL reading abilities and standards since there are a number of factors that are known to influence them. Due to the vital role and the tremendous influence of the students’ reading proficiency in answering the reading comprehension questions, it is important to benchmark the students’ reading proficiency as highlighted by Baguley,
<disp-quote>
<p>using benchmarks as performance targets or goals can be a powerful</p>
<p>and important step on your road to successful performance management</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212451803">Baguley, 2001</xref>: 69).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through benchmarking, teachers will know the areas in which the students are weak and consequently take immediate measures to develop a particular area incrementally in accordance with Krashen’s ‘i + 1 Hypothesis’, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212451803">Blair, 1982</xref>), i.e. providing the input at a level which is appropriate to what the students already possess and then monitoring for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>It has been stated by Allerson and Grabe (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212451803">Dubin et al., 1986</xref>:161), that students who have difficulties in reading, need to be carefully assessed in order to identify the difficulties. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212451803">Stanovich (1986)</xref>, children who encounter difficulty early in the learning process, fall further behind their peers as time passes. Hence, testing to predict concurrent and later reading achievement can identify students who will need extra help in learning to read.</p>
<p>Similar research has been conducted in the United States primarily concerning the need to get reading right for all students, for example, through a programme called ‘Reading Success Where No Child Slips By’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212451803">Hooper, 2002</xref>). This program has the objective of getting reading right among students. The vision was, ‘Every child in the Fourth Bend will read at grade level or above by the end of grade 3’. Based on the programme, the performance standards for reading were identified and they subsequently provided an ideal assessment instrument throughout the year. These performance standards will provide data that is immediately useful in understanding the learning of individual students and also in monitoring trends at the classrooms, schools and district level.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212451803">Caldwell (2002)</xref>, assessment is a four-step process namely:</p>
<list id="list1-0033688212451803" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Identify what to assess.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collect evidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analyse the evidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make a decision based on the analysis.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Caldwell further states that a teacher determines the reading level in order to choose appropriate reading material for a student as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212451803">Block (2000)</xref> believes that instructions that are ineffective may cause many students to fall behind in their ability to comprehend what is being asked of them.</p>
<p>To overcome this problem, READS (developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212451803">Lin, 2009</xref>) was adopted to identify the respondents’ ESL reading abilities so that ESL teachers can plan reading lessons tailored to the needs of the students. READS offers an assessment kit that is able to evaluate students’ reading abilities, analyse the results and decode their reading abilities to provide complete information about the students’ reading abilities. Consequently, the school that we examined can plan an English language reading programme to assist the ESL teachers identify their students’ reading ability in order to meet the needs of the students.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>This is a case study conducted in a semi-urban secondary school in Perak, Malaysia. In total, 1,339 secondary school students from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5 participated in the English Language Reading Programme organized by the English Language panel. The students’ ethnic backgrounds were 83.5% Malay, 2.4% Chinese, 13.8% Indian and 0.3% other races. The participants were from mixed ability, which were a mix of good, average and weak students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0033688212451803">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Specifically, READS was used to identify the reading ability of the students. READS contains three components: the Encoder (Test Instrument), the Analyser (Reading Matrix) and, the Decoder (Descriptors of Reading Abilities).</p>
<p>The main instrument of data gathering was the Standardized Reading Comprehension Test (SRCT). The Test Instrument or Encoder is a generic test which can be used to measure the ESL reading performance of secondary school students from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5 (13-17 year olds). Our test instrument is in line with the typical standardized Malaysian public examination (UPSR level or Elementary School Assessment level, PMR level and SPM level). The test items of the standardized reading comprehension test are 60 multiple choice questions which comprise of literal, reorganization and inferential comprehension questions set at different levels of difficulty i.e. UPSR, PMR and SPM levels. The test was validated by content experts which comprise of experienced examiners and senior university lecturers to determine the content validity. The test reliability was verified using the Kuder-Richardson (KR20). The KR20 of this test was 0.85 which is consistent with Diederich cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212451803">Oosterhof (2001</xref>:74) where the reliability should be between 0.60 and 0.80 if a teacher’s test requires approximately 50 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>The 60 multiple choice questions comprise of 15 UPSR level constituting 25% of the test questions, 30 PMR level constituting 50% of the test questions, and 15 SPM level constituting 25% of the test questions, as stipulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212451803">Mok (2000)</xref>. Subsequently, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212451803">Mok (2000)</xref>, the distribution of the difficulty of test should be 25% easy, 50% average and 25% difficult. In the test, the students respond to different text types such as descriptive texts, dialogue and newspaper reports, mainly expository texts, descriptive texts and narrative texts. Literary texts are not tested in this written reading comprehension test. The time allocated for the standardized reading comprehension test is 70 minutes. The test has been piloted and results show that 70 minutes is the ideal time allocated for participants from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0033688212451803">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The SCRT was administered to all the students in the school to identify respondents’ ESL reading abilities. Students were given 70 minutes to answer the questions. At the beginning of the school year, the students sat for the first set of SRCT to identify their reading abilities. The respondents’ reading scores were matched against the Reading Matrix or Analyser and then correlated to the Performance Standards (to find out if the students ‘Meet Reading Age’, are ‘Above Reading Age’ or ‘Below Reading Age’) and subsequently match with the Descriptors of Reading Abilities (to identify what the students from Band 1 to Band 6 can or cannot do).</p>
<p>The Reading Matrix or Analyser refers to a user-friendly chart which acts as a reading indicator to indicate the reading abilities of the learners at a particular educational level i.e. from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5 where the teachers can match their learners’ test scores with the Performance Bands indicated in the chart as plotted against the educational levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref>). The data from the test scores of students from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5 in a pilot test was gathered to establish the Performance Bands (Band 1 to Band 6). The cut scores for Band 1 to Band 6 tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0033688212451803">Table 1</xref> were developed based on z-score.</p>

<p>The idea of Progression through the levels advocated by the Task Group on Assessment and Testing (TGAT) Report (1988) cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212451803">Horton (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212451803">Masters (2006)</xref> in which the criteria of levels of proficiency and age were taken into consideration in gauging the learners’ progress was adopted to develop the Reading Matrix.</p>
<p>As for the Performance Standards, the four levels of reading performance were adapted from the Prairie State Achievement Examination (PSAE), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212451803">Illinois State Board of Education, 2004</xref>). Other reading standards include the Victorian Curriculum &amp; Standards Framework II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212451803">Board of Studies, Victoria, 2000</xref>), the Curriculum standards for the State of Qatar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212451803">Education Institute Doha, 2005</xref>) and the American National Assessment of Educational Progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212451803">NAEP, 2005</xref>). The Performance Standards could be used as a reference to find out what the students at each level know or do not know. They were specifically developed to fit the Malaysian secondary school students.</p>
<p>The Descriptors of Reading Abilities or Decoder act as indicators to inform the teachers of which sub-skills of reading the learners are able to do or unable to do. These descriptors were developed based on the respondents’ reading performance on the test conducted. North’s ‘Reading Scale for the Council of Europe Framework’ cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212451803">Alderson (2000</xref>: 132-34) was adopted as the model to develop the Descriptors of Reading Abilities. Other reading scales and reading profiles were the Literacy Profile Scales cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212451803">Alderson (2000</xref>). The ESL teachers can refer to the Descriptors of Reading Abilities to gain accurate information of their learners’ reading abilities and consequently plan their teaching instruction and reading materials to meet the needs of the learners.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To benchmark the Reading Age of the secondary school students, frequency counts and percentages were used. The results obtained from the standardized reading comprehension test were entered into the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0033688212451803" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The findings are presented in two sections. First, the Reading Age of the students from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5 are presented, which is then followed by the description of the different groups of performers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref> presents the reading performance of the students from Secondary 1 through Secondary 5. The percentages listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref> disclosed the percentages of students at the various Performance Bands.</p>
<sec id="section9-0033688212451803">
<title>Secondary 1 Reading Performance</title>
<p>Based on the Reading Matrix, the students in Secondary 1 (13 year-olds) ideally should be at Band 2. Students who are at Band 2 were classified as ‘Meet Reading Age’ at Secondary 1 level. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref> indicates that 23.3% of the Secondary 1 students ‘Meet Reading Age’ while 12.1% are at one level above their Reading Age, 11.1% are at 2 levels above their Reading Age and 0.9% of them are at 3 levels above their Reading. It appears that 0.9% of them are even reading at 4 levels above their Reading Age. What is troubling about this data is that 51.7% of the students are considered as ‘Below Reading Age.’ Apparently, the ‘Below Reading Age’ students were having difficulty answering the lowest level questions i.e. the Elementary School Assessment (UPSR) reading comprehension questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0033688212451803">
<title>Secondary 2 Reading Performance</title>
<p>Based on the Reading Matrix, the students in Secondary 2 (14 year olds) ideally should be at Band 3. Students who are at Band 3 are classified as’ Meet Reading Age’ at Secondary 2 level. This implies that the Secondary 2 students should have a Reading Age of 14 or higher. However, only 12.7% of the Secondary 2 students are categorized as ‘Meet Reading Age’ and 15. 0.2% of them are reading at 2 levels above their Reading Age. It is worthy to note that 1.5% of the students are apparently reading at 3 levels above their Reading Age. However, 23.0% were reading at one level below and 47.0% were reading at 2 levels below their Reading Age respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0033688212451803">
<title>Secondary 3 Reading Performance</title>
<p>Looking at the students in Secondary 3 (15 year olds), students should ideally be at Band 4 level. Students who are at Band 4 are categorized as ‘Meet Reading Age’ at Secondary 3 level. This indicates that Secondary 3 students should have a Reading Age of 15 or more. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref>, it was noted that only 15.9% are classified as ‘Meet Reading Age’, 7.2% were reading at one level above their Reading Age, and 5.7% are reading at 2 levels above their Reading Age. However, 10.9% are reading at one level below their Reading Age, 14. 21.5% are reading at 2 levels below their Reading Age, and 13. 39.3% are reading at 3 levels below their Reading Age respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0033688212451803">
<title>Secondary 4 Reading Performance</title>
<p>Students in Secondary 4 (16 year olds) should be at Band 5 level. Students who are at Band 5 are classified as ‘Meet Reading Age’ at Secondary 4 level. This indicates that Secondary 4 students should have a Reading Age of 16 or higher. From the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref>, only 6.9% are at Band 5 and categorized as ‘Meet Reading Age’ and 5.6% are reading at one level above their Reading Age. It appears that a majority of them are reading below their Reading Age. For example, 15.5% are reading at one level below their Reading Age, 15. What’s more 6.4% are at Band 3 level, meaning that they were reading at 2 levels below their Reading Age, 14. The results also show 22.3% are at Band 2, meaning that they are reading at 3 levels below their Reading Age, 13. In addition, 43.3% are at Band 1, meaning that they are reading at 4 levels below their Reading Age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0033688212451803">
<title>Secondary 5 Reading Performance</title>
<p>Accordingly, students in Secondary 5 (17 year olds) should be at Band 6 level. Students who are at Band 6 are classified as ‘Meet Reading Age’ at Secondary 5 level. However, only 9.4% are categorized as ‘Meet Reading Age’. Apparently, 13.3% are reading at one level below their Reading Age, 16. The data show 24.3% are reading at 2 levels below their Reading Age, 15; 12.7% are reading at 3 levels below their Reading Age, 14; and 18.1% are reading at 4 levels below their Reading age. It is disturbing to note that 22.2% are as a matter of fact reading at 5 levels below their Reading Age.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, it was evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0033688212451803">Table 2</xref> that a majority of the students in this school are reading below their Reading Age. The findings indicated that most of the students did not meet the reading standard at their assigned education levels (Secondary 1 to Secondary 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0033688212451803">
<title>Profile of ‘Above Reading Age’ Performers</title>
<p>Those who are ‘Above Reading Age’ are readers whose performance surpass the objective of the syllabus set for their respective educational level, which translated to them having acquired the skills and sub-skills of reading for that particular level. Students who are categorized as ‘Above Reading Age’ are the students whose performance in the standardized reading comprehension test surpasses the standard set for students in the Malaysian English Language Syllabus (skimming and scanning for specific information, extracting main ideas and details, discerning sequence of ideas, getting the explicit and implicit meaning of the text, predicting outcomes, making inferences and drawing conclusions) for that particular grade level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0033688212451803">
<title>Profile of ‘Meet Reading Age’ Performers</title>
<p>Students who ‘Meet Reading Age’ are readers whose performance achieve the objective of the syllabus set for the particular educational level, which means these students have acquired the skills and sub-skills of reading for the said level. Those who ‘Meet Reading Age’ would be students whose performance in the reading test meets the standard set for students in the Malaysian English Language Syllabus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0033688212451803">
<title>Profile of ‘Below Reading Age’ Performers</title>
<p>Students performing ‘Below Reading Age’ are readers whose performance did not achieve the objective of the syllabus set for the educational level, which means they have not acquired the skills and sub-skills of reading for the designated level. Students have gaps in reading at their educational level, partially or not meeting the requirements specified in the Malaysian English Language Syllabus.</p>

<title>Identifying Individual Student’s Specific Reading Ability</title>
<p>Teachers can conveniently refer to the Descriptors of Students’ Reading Abilities to identify their students’ reading ability. For example, Secondary 4 students who are in Band 5 are categorized as ‘Meet Reading Age’, those who are in Band 6 are categorized as ‘Above Reading Age’, and students who are in Bands 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively are categorized as ‘Below Reading Age’. Next, the teachers can refer to the Descriptors of Students’ Reading Abilities to find out what their students know or do not know at the different Performance Bands. For example, from the descriptors, teachers will know that students in Band 1 are those who have difficulty locating the main ideas and supporting details when answering the literal comprehension questions. Consequently, most of the students in this category merely guess the answers. It appears that they also have difficulty reading and understanding the cause and effect relationships in passages. They are unable to acquire the meaning of words by using contextual clues, unable to draw conclusions in simple texts and make inferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0033688212451803" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The test scores obtained from the standardized reading comprehension test are categorized into Performance Bands (Band 1 to Band 6). From the benchmarking results, the students are categorized into their various performance standards. At the micro level, the ESL teachers can match the students’ performance to the Reading Matrix to figure out whether the students are ‘Above Reading Age’, ‘Meet Reading Age’ or ‘Below Reading Age’. Consecutively, the teachers can refer to the Performance Standards to find out what the students at each level of reading performance are able to do or not able to do. Finally, the teachers can also refer to the Descriptors of Students’ Reading Abilities to get a more in depth understanding of the specific reading ability of each student.</p>
<p>The findings revealed that many of the students do not ‘Meet Reading Age’ at their educational levels. It is not unanticipated to note that the teachers do not know what their students can do or cannot do because there are no indicators provided together with the curriculum or test instruments to be mobilized as a guide to indicate the students’ specific reading abilities. It would be very helpful if the teachers are provided with clearly defined sets of Reading Performance Indicators in which teachers can measure and assess students’ reading performance. This is where the developed set of indicators is able to serve the purpose of providing explicit information about what the students are able to do at each Performance Band.</p>
<p>While at the macro level or group level, the ESL teachers can find out the reading achievement of a specific group of students. Though there are students who failed, i.e. they were ‘Below Standard’ or below their Reading Age, there were no indicators to inform the teachers about which sub-skills of reading this group of students had difficulty getting to grips with. Therefore, by benchmarking the students’ reading abilities, teachers can track students’ achievement and make adjustments to their teaching instruction. From the findings, the researchers came up with the profile of the different groups of performers i.e. ‘Above Reading Age Performers’, ‘Meet Reading Age Performers’ or ‘Below Reading Age Performers’. The profile of these performers can be used as predictors to forecast which groups of students are performing, which groups of students are failing and which groups of students need immediate help.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0033688212451803" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We can now tell how well the ESL students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5 in the selected school are performing. By examining the students’ reading abilities at macro and micro levels, the English Language teachers can now plan their teaching instruction and materials to meet the needs of their learners. Furthermore, the District or State Education Departments and policy makers can plan what needs to be done to improve the English Language reading standard in general.</p>
