<abstract>
<p>Concerns about youth gang violence and offending have occurred in developed societies across the globe, and a plethora of youth justice sanctions have arisen in response to this. This article is focused upon an empirical study of 20 young men from socially deprived areas of the west of Scotland, whose involvement in individualized offending emerged from their earlier participation in gang violence. The article explores the impact of curfews and electronic monitoring on the social strains, support and capital experienced by the young men and their families. The findings indicate that the sanctions had some limited success in reducing anti-social capital in the young offenders’ lives, particularly when they were complemented by mechanisms for rehabilitation and care. However, when used in isolation the sanctions often failed to build pro-social capital and, in some cases, functioned as an additional social strain conducive to further criminal offending. The article ends with some suggested implications for future youth justice policy decisions, and calls for wider research into the impact of criminal justice sanctions on young offenders and families.</p>

<title>Introduction: Urban Youth Violence and Gang Culture</title>
<p>Over the last 20 years, there has been an increasing tendency in the UK, Europe and the wider world to associate the concern about young people’s apparent social disengagement with a growth in the presence of urban youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811425540">Barker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811425540">Bjork, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811425540">Kelly, 2003</xref>). Prior to the 1990s, the phenomenon of the urban street gang was traditionally seen as uniquely American in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811425540">Hallsworth and Young, 2008</xref>) but, in recent years, a proliferation of gang membership across the world has become widely assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811425540">Bullock and Tilley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811425540">Decker et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811425540">St Cyr and Decker, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research in the USA has consistently illustrated that being a member of a gang tends to be associated with engaging in violence and crime centred around territorial behaviour and involvement in the drug trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811425540">Jankowski, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811425540">Klein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425540">Thrasher, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895811425540">Whyte, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811425540">Yablonsky, 1966</xref>). In Britain, there has been a recent explosion of media reports documenting the territorial and violent nature of the country’s most deprived urban communities, and reports suggest that there has been an increase in possession of weapons among young males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811425540">Bennett and Holloway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>). In Scotland, the national newspapers have led us to believe that there is a gang epidemic, with at least 300 organized street gangs and anything between 130–170 in Glasgow (Scotland’s largest city) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>But, the word ‘gang’ is often used loosely within the contemporary context of insecurity and concern about youth disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811425540">McNeill, 2009</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811425540">Hallsworth and Young (2008</xref>: 182) cite the outcomes from the 2004 British Crime Survey that reveal that the majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by individuals as opposed to gangs; they argue that journalistic devices are often at play in constructing a ‘gang myth’. Hence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811425540">Hallsworth and Young (2008</xref>: 191) call for a wider understanding of the phenomenon of urban violence that goes beyond the ‘gang gaze’, and takes account of the wider social factors that stimulate it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425540">Anderson’s (1999)</xref> pioneering ethnographic study into urban street life in Philadelphia, USA, highlights that the inclination to violence emerges from the circumstances of life among the ghetto poor, characterized by unemployment, the dominance of the drug trade and general feelings of alienation and marginalization. The most profound casualties adopt a ‘code of the street’, which amounts to ‘a set of informal rules governing interpersonal public behaviour, particularly violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425540">Anderson, 1999</xref>: 33). However, in addition to the need for asserting reputations for aggression and violence as a means of gaining individualized social recognition and respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry, 2006</xref>), young offenders seek out ‘running buddies’ or ‘homies’ – those who can be depended on to watch their back ‘in a jam’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811425540">Anderson, 1999</xref>: 73).</p>
<p>It is this model of individualistic offending linked to the need for protection and support via the ‘family’ that young, marginalized people find on the streets that provides the context for the research in this article. We acknowledge the contested nature of the term ‘gang’ and the problems that can arise from associating urban youth violence exclusively with gang culture. However, we also recognize that a minority of young people are drawn to the ‘code of the street’ from a young age as a result of a myriad of social phenomena, and often rely upon the social support they find on the streets of urban neighbourhoods as a means of accessing opportunities for offending and enhancing their sense of status and social recognition.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we draw upon an operational definition of the word ‘gang’ within a Scottish context, based upon accumulated insights gathered from the author’s own empirical research and those accrued from earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425540">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811425540">Patrick, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811425540">Thrasher, 1927</xref>). Thus, a ‘gang’ is conceptualized as a group of young people who rely on each other to support them in their engagement in ‘conflict’ associated with ‘attachment to local territories’ or cultures and characterized by violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>: 56). At the same time, we also recognize that urban youth violence goes beyond the parameters of the gang phenomenon and that some young people who may initially self-identify with gang membership (as we have defined it) may subsequently become more strongly associated with individualized offending as a result of a multitude of personal and social factors.</p>

<sec id="section2-1748895811425540">
<title>Social Causes of Urban Violence and Youth Justice Strategies</title>
<p>Social support theories of offending and crime are premised on the fundamental principle that involvement in such activity is inversely related to the presence of protective factors which generate supportive resources and enmesh young people in positive relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen at al., 1999</xref>). Such ideas about social support provide the central thesis underpinning General Strain Theory (GST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>), and emerge from earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811425540">Merton (1938)</xref>.</p>
<p>According to GST, social strains such as stressful life events (poverty, unemployment, separation, death or absence of parents and/or health problems), neighbourhood problems (vandalism, drug abuse or other forms of crime), goal blockage (lack of opportunities for employment, failure to achieve monetary success or – in young men – masculine status), challenging relationships with adults or abusive peer relations can all conspire to bring about negative emotional reactions and attraction to delinquent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811425540">Aseltine et al., 2000</xref>). In some cases, young people may experience a complex blend of social strains and, because of particular issues of emotional vulnerability, may interpret them as being so high in magnitude that they become compelled to cope with them in a criminal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been argued that, in such cases, efforts to control crime with an exclusive focus on punishment and ‘law and order’ principles may, in reality, increase the likelihood of further crime by producing additional strains such as anger and frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811425540">Cullen and Gendreau, 2000</xref>). In terms of GST, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew (2006)</xref> argues that a reduction in juvenile offending can only be achieved by eliminating or altering strains conducive to crime or altering young people’s perceptions and goals so that they are less likely to view certain strains as severe and unjust.</p>
<p>In spite of the academic arguments for reaffirming the ‘rehabilitative ideal’, the last three decades have witnessed the emergence of a correctional system focused on ‘getting tougher’ in many parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811425540">Cullen and Gendreau, 2000</xref>: 161). For example, in spite of the rhetoric of youth crime prevention and social inclusion in Britain, increasing numbers of youth justice sanctions have emerged in recent years. In this article, we will explore the nature of two of these sanctions – curfews and electronic monitoring (EM) – through an analysis of empirical data emerging from a small-scale study of young men in the west of Scotland with a history of offending that was first stimulated through gang involvement (as we have defined it). We will explore the relationship between the young men’s experience of these sanctions and their exposure to and perceptions of social strains, support and capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811425540">Cullen, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>The Impact of and Reasons for Compliance with Curfews and EM</title>
<p>Spatial and temporal restrictions such as curfews can be imposed as a condition of bail, as a stand-alone sentence or when offenders are released early from prison under Home Detention Curfew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2009</xref>). As far back as 1989, previous and existing ways of monitoring these restrictions by human means were extended to include EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425540">Killias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2004</xref>). In such cases, a Personal Identification Device (PID) (or ‘tag’) is attached to the offender’s leg that continuously emits a signal to a receiver unit connected to a central supervision office, thus allowing the offender’s whereabouts to be monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425540">Killias et al., 2010</xref>). EM has thus been described as a ‘punishment based on a technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2011</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>In Scotland, EM-curfews became a national scheme (for adults) from May 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811425540">Lobley and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811425540">Smith, 2001</xref>). The use of these sanctions for under 18s was subsequently endorsed via the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811425540">Scottish Executive, 2003</xref>). Further, the introduction of Intensive Support and Monitoring Services (ISMS) a community-based alternative to secure accommodation, blended care and surveillant forms of control by imposing on young people a Movement Restriction Condition (MRC – in essence, a curfew) alongside intensive support services for up to three months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811425540">Khan and Hill, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is mixed evidence as to the effectiveness of curfews and EM. Some research suggests that these sanctions are effective in reducing the likelihood of reoffending, while others suggest limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895811425540">DiIulio, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425540">Killias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811425540">Padgett et al., 2006</xref>). Some reports have highlighted the pressure on parents, families and carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811425540">Gibbs and King, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811425540">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811425540">Smith, 2001</xref>); the ethical issues surrounding enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2009</xref>); and the temptations that arise as a result of the ‘watching others’ effect, where offenders see friends and family members do things that they cannot do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2009</xref>: 46). There are also collateral consequences outside the home associated with bracelet effects in the use of EM: while some offenders may feel ashamed about wearing the tag, others may view it as a badge of honour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811425540">Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811425540">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research has focused on the reasons underpinning adult compliance with stand-alone curfews and EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2009</xref>). Drawing upon typologies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811425540">Bottoms (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811425540">Nellis (2006)</xref>, <italic>instrumental-based</italic>, <italic>incentive-based</italic> or <italic>threat-based</italic> compliance occurs where offenders weigh up the costs and benefits of their behaviour, and realize that the disincentives outweigh the incentives (or rewards) of non-compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2009</xref>). However, it has also been argued that such compliance can result in additional social strain and contribute to a range of negative relationships which generate anger, despair or resentment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811425540">Colvin et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Normative-based</italic> compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811425540">Bottoms, 2001</xref>) is based on moral obligation, commitment or attachment to ‘significant others’ in the offender’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2009</xref>: 253). It has been argued that the emergence of these social attachments can foster responsibility and trust, reduce subjective social strains and thus result in reduced risk of criminal coping behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811425540">Colvin et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The Research, Its Theoretical Framework and Methodology</title>
<p>The current research (funded by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland) was focused on 16–21-year-old offenders. It was concerned with exploring their experiences of curfews and EM and whether such restrictions enhance or diminish a capacity for building social support as a means of transmitting social capital and allowing young people to cope better with social strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811425540">Cullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>). Although social capital is still a contested concept, many believe that it has networking at its heart, as a stimulus for generating feelings of trust, cohesion and social reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811425540">Leonard and Onyx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811425540">Putnam, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811425540">Ruston, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al. (1999)</xref> highlight that, as social capital is transmitted via helpful supportive relationships, the negative consequences and perceived severity of social strain may diminish, thus reducing the risk of criminal involvement.</p>
<p>However, several authors have noted that some forms of social capital can be harmful to individuals and communities, and that certain kinds of social networks can foster criminal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811425540">Crawford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811425540">Putnam, 2000</xref>). In referring to such circumstances, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby (2008</xref>: 56) has adopted the term ‘anti-social capital’. Territoriality is fundamentally linked to the accumulation of such capital since young gang members may gain a sense of social bonding, status and identity associated with their attachment to, and defence of, significant places through violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811425540">Relph, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>The common argument is that criminal justice interventions need to be aimed at decreasing levels of anti-social capital by ‘reducing offenders’ links with situations, people, places and networks correlated with their offending’ while also improving levels of pro-social capital by encouraging offenders to reconnect with positive influences and realign their interpretations of the severity of social strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>The current study focused on the impact of curfews and EM-curfews on young offenders in the west of Scotland whose involvement in individualized offending emerged from an earlier association with gang culture. The study was framed within the naturalistic research paradigm and was conducted within the interpretivist theoretical framework. This framework is focused on determining participants’ perspectives on the meaning they attach to particular aspects of their social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895811425540">Taylor and Bogdan, 1998</xref>). In keeping with a constant comparative method of data analysis, in-depth interviews provided a rich data set which was analysed to detect salient patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811425540">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing upon data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2006 (SIMD), three communities with particularly high proportions of multiple deprivation were identified: one in the east end of Glasgow, one in the western suburbs of Glasgow and one in the south-west corner of Scotland. Early in 2010, initial contact was made with local gatekeepers, such as social workers and youth workers. The gatekeepers facilitated contact with young people and families in the local communities whose lives had been affected by gang culture and offending and who had had some experience of curfews and/or EM.</p>
<p>Since both gang violence and youth offending in the west of Scotland tend to be predominantly a male pursuit and there are many more young men exposed to spatial and temporal restrictions than young females, the youth participants accessed for the study were exclusively young men. Arrangements were made to meet these young men and members of their family members or carers in social work offices, youth organizations or within their own homes. These initial visits were co-ordinated around the hours of imposed curfews and enabled the researcher to make informal contact, build trust and seek voluntary participation in interviews.</p>
<p>Thereafter, semi-structured interviews were conducted between March–June 2010 with 20 young men between the ages of 16 and 21 across the focused communities, all of whom were either currently assigned to a curfew (whether monitored by human or electronic means) or had been assigned to one in the past two years as a result of offences that were initially stimulated by gang involvement. Additional interviews were conducted with members of young offenders’ immediate support units, such as parents, carers or partners. The interviews explored the impact of the sanctions on the young men’s personal sense of social identity and perceptions about social strains and on their relationships with family members and carers.</p>
<p>Data were coded using NVivo software and intensive analysis conducted, leading to the creation of theories derived from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811425540">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>). In the sections that follow, the themes emerging from this analysis will be presented and key quotations that were seen as being representative of participants’ views highlighted.</p>

<title>Gangs, Offending and Police-Monitored Curfews</title>
<p>All of the young men interviewed talked about the violence that they had become caught up in as a result of the territorial gang rivalries within their housing estates. While some of the young men cited peer pressure as the main cause of this, others had clearly suffered from social and structural disadvantages such as poverty, unemployment and a history of drug abuse and/or crime within the family – thus clearly reflecting the social strains outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew (2006)</xref>. In many cases, involvement in street violence based on territorial aggression and ‘postcode pride’ had led the young men to more serious criminal acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811425540">Earle, 2011</xref>: 138). Their convictions included breaking and entering, robbery, serious assault and attempted murder, and the young men clearly felt that their involvement in these activities had been stimulated by social disadvantage:</p>

<p>‘It was just boredom … and another thing, it was seein’ all the older people wi’ all this money, you know what I mean? I started gettin’ into it, stealin’ motors, sellin’ drugs, fuckin’ batterin’ people for money.’ (Al, 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Strathclyde Police’s Gangs Task Force is a specialist unit established in 2008 with a remit to break the cycle of violence by identifying and arresting gang members involved in violence and crime. On its website, the Task Force highlights that curfews have the potential to make a ‘very positive impact on communities that need respite from anti-socials, who are the groups who hang about the shops, nobody can get near’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811425540">Strathclyde Police, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several of the young men who participated in the study were currently on curfew as a result of their gang activity and related convictions, while others had been on curfew within the previous two years. In almost all cases, the conditions imposed consisted of the requirement for them to remain in their houses between the hours of 7pm and 7am and curfews were typically monitored via random visits by police officers to see if they were at home. A minority of parents and carers felt that the sanctions had a positive impact on family life, since they got to spend more time with the young person who was under curfew and talk to them more and also felt reassured in the knowledge that they were in the house and therefore less prone to getting involved in violence:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since he has been on the curfew we talk more because when he was out all the time he was out with pals and … I wouldn’t see him, he wouldn’t see me … but we talk a lot more now than we did then because he is in the house all the time. (Marilyn, mother)</p>
<p>If he’s in at 7 I always feel a wee bit safer and that he’s up the stair and he’s safe, but I’m no’ just saying that he’s safe, somebody else is safe n’all – cause he’s no hurtin’ anybody else and nobody is hurtin’ him. (Joe, father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a few cases, young men began to get into new routines with romantic partners as a result of the curfew and this resulted in more positive perceptions about the social support they had access to:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I just stay in, have a drink and watch telly … my girlfriend comes down most nights … I’ve got somebody to talk to, to be there … to have some company.’ (Stevie, 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, in many cases the young people admitted that their dependency on alcohol and drugs worsened while they were on the curfews. For some young men, substance abuse was used as a coping mechanism to deal with the perceived strains associated with restrictions of liberty:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just used to deal with it by gettin’ mad with it and takin’ all sorts of drugs. (Jamie, 19)</p>
<p>I was drinkin’ a lot, because I was sittin’ in all the time. I was drinkin’ myself sometimes. (Stewart, 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many young people and their families talked about the additional strain that the curfew placed on family life. For example, one mother and son recalled their joint experiences of curfew sanctions. The anger and frustration associated with the sanctions led the young man to increase his alcohol consumption, which in turn led to physical damage and violence in the house:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He’d be comin’ in here at 7 o’clock and he’d be paralytic … and he would start gettin’ dead angry, punchin’ holes in the doors and punchin’ walls … total frustration. (Lorna, mother)</p>
<p>I argued wi’ her that year more than I’d ever argued wi’ her … I was annoyin’ her and she was annoyin’ me … just ‘cos I was in the hoose and I’d rather be oot … I just fuckin’ went mental. (Jamie, 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants described the tensions that could emerge when the police arrived at the door to check up on them during unsociable hours:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They came to my hoose at twelve o’clock one week and I was in my bed and they started banging on my windae and I had to open the windae. ‘I’m in, fuck off!’ I said. (Cal, 18)</p>
<p>A lot of the police were not really helpful, you could see that some of them were actually aware of what would set Keith off. (James, father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further, the erratic nature of the police visits often opened up opportunities for young men to breach the conditions of their curfews, and their anger and frustration sometimes led them to re-offend:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You’re just sitting about … and it’s sunny and you’re missing all the things your pals are doin’… I was in myself and I just got dead angry. (Stewart, 17)</p>
<p>The polis didnae come round every day, they were meant to but they came round three times or somethin’. So I just went oot every other night … the door had a lock on it and my sister had the keys, and I … kicked her door in and took the keys from her … I’d stay out for nights and nights … eventually I got charged with a serious assault. (Al, 16)</p>
<p>(The police) just started coming round twice a month … basically I would just stay out … gang fightin’ again. (Nick, 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In one young man’s case, the constant breaching of his curfew led to a level of frustration and tension in the house that became unbearable. His father described the way in which he attempted to restrain the young man physically but reached the point where he was unable to manage his behaviour:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He used to try and break the windows to go out and he would shout on his pals to come in and get him and rescue him and things like that, and they would be outside drinking. One time I had to wrap my arms in blankets and I would hold him and he would spit on me … I realized that I wasn’t able to restrain him anymore so I had to let him out. (James, father)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, the curfew sanctions brought about some limited short-term benefits to a minority of young offenders and families in terms of reducing anti-social capital and re-building positive social relationships within family homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>). However, in many other cases the nature of the curfews, which were characterized by an exclusive focus on criminal punishment, created additional strains such as anger, frustration, resentment, relationship difficulties, increased domestic violence and substance dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>). The inconsistent way in which the curfews were monitored by police officers led to breaching and additional offending, and parents and carers often felt like unpaid wardens, having to police and patrol the young men’s adherence to the sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield, 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1748895811425540">
<title>Electronic Monitoring and Family Life</title>
<p>Several of the young men in the sample had had experience of being on curfews that were electronically monitored. For some youngsters and families, EM was seen to provide more of a deterrent and a reason to comply with the conditions of the curfew:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think a couple of his other friends … were all on curfews at the same time, but they used to just wait till the police came and then go oot but Davie couldnae do that because he had the tag and its electronic. (Teresa, partner)</p>
<p>If you break that you’re straight back (to prison) – you’re called for straight away, but if you break a curfew you can get away wi’ it. (Stu, 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, as in the case of police-monitored curfews youngsters found that tensions arose within the home because of EM, as a result of their increased feelings of anger and frustration. Some young men admitted to going out and breaching their curfew quite blatantly, with some youngsters even going to the lengths of cutting off the tag as a means of escaping from the perceived feelings of oppression that it brought about:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just got a big kitchen blade and cut it off, man, and fucked it in a bush. (Jack, 16)</p>
<p>It didnae bother me at first, because I wasnae allowed to go oot anyway, but after a couple of weeks, I just wanted to go oot all the time, so I pulled it off. (Sam, 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some young men talked about the physical discomfort they felt while wearing the tag, and the stigma they felt while having to wear it in public. Conversely, one young man summed up the views of several participants when he described the way in which wearing the tag gave him a sense of pride that came from the knowledge that people would look at him in public places:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I’d wear shorts n’all that … just the buzz of people starin’ at you. I liked people looking at you. I’d get trains and buses n’all that just so people would look at me.’ (Al, 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>EM, then, had some benefits in terms of creating instrumental compliance, which was mainly motivated by fear of being caught and (to a lesser degree) by fear of subsequent punishment, such as imprisonment. As such, some young people weighed up the pros and cons of breaching and re-offending and realized that the disincentives outweighed the incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>). However, as in the case with police-monitored curfews, this type of compliance also produced anger, frustration and alienated social bonds and eventually drove some young men to breach their curfews. Experiences of EM also generated a range of collateral consequences associated with the wearing of the tag. In some cases, they led to subjective negative evaluations of the perceived social strains associated with criminal labelling or, in other cases, an increased tendency to identify with the social recognition gained from viewing the tag as a badge of honour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811425540">Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811425540">Richardson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Intensive Support and Monitoring Services (ISMS)</title>
<p>Some young men who were under the age of 18 had been referred to the Children’s Hearing System – the mechanism in Scotland for dealing with children and young people who commit offences, as a means of avoiding prosecution through the courts. For those who had committed crimes that were deemed serious enough to warrant them being kept in secure accommodation, there was the option for them to be offered support under the ISMS Scheme alongside the issuing of EM sanctions. The support offered to the young people and their families included opportunities to access social services for support with addiction and anger management as well as structured educational provision. It also included the provision of a 24-hour telephone service, whereby families could access support at any time.</p>
<p>Youth participants and family members who had been supported by the ISMS service during periods of curfew talked highly about the experience; while some felt that the flexibility for going out with support workers reduced the sense of oppression they felt, others highlighted the reassuring feelings associated with knowing that someone was at the other end of a telephone:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You used to go oot a run wi’ your worker, and he’d take you oot for somethin’ to eat. I don’t know, they just spoke to you about things. I think they’re probably the best thing … I stayed oot the jail for seven month. So obviously somethin’ must have been goin’ right. (Stewart, 17)</p>
<p>They were very good – I mean, they came and sat down with both of us and told us everything, you know, and there was always somebody at the other end of a phone. (Melanie, mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several of the young men and their family members highlighted the quality of the support offered to them by social workers within the ISMS initiative. For instance, one young man highlighted the way in which his social worker helped him to comply with curfew orders more readily and desist from crime, at least in the short term:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Just because o’ Tim … Tim ended up helping us oot. I wasnae in trouble for a year and then as soon as he stopped working wi’ us that was me … back oot again.’ (Cal, 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Family members highlighted the multi-agency support they had received, but also the way in which things became more difficult for their siblings once they had entered the adult justice system and the ‘safety net’ associated with the Children’s Hearing System was removed. For instance, one young mother who had recently seen her son return to prison at age 18 summed up the frustrations of several participants:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Since he’s been up here he’s no’ had any (support) … obviously he’s too old now … being under 18, there’s lots of support for the families then the minute you hit 18 there’s nothing.’ (Melanie, mother)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So it was apparent that the blend of enforcement alongside rehabilitation and care had the potential to alter the perceptions of both young people and their family members so that they were less likely to view the strains associated with criminal justice sanctions as severe and unjust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>). This was largely due to the pro-social capital that emerged as a result of exposure to social workers, telephone helplines and support groups. However, it was evident that the increased feelings of trust, reciprocity, self-esteem and self-efficacy was not enough to bring about longer-term desistance from offending, particularly when the rehabilitation mechanisms were removed as soon as offenders reached adulthood at the age of 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811425540">Cullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811425540">Leonard and Onyx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811425540">Ruston, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion of Findings</title>
<p>The evidence in this article suggests that, for some young men living in deprived communities in the west of Scotland, the opportunity to experience a sense of status, identity and agency is difficult to come by, given the complicated blend of social strains that they experience. These strains include negative and stressful family situations, peer pressure associated with local territorial divisions and the presence of noxious stimuli associated with local alcohol and drug sub-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>). In such circumstances, youth gangs provide these young men with a source of social recognition and compensatory social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811425540">Bassani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811425540">Deuchar, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811425540">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that the onset of more persistent criminal offending may be linked to particular deficits in conventional forms of social support that coincide with the emergence of emotional vulnerability. In young people, such emotional vulnerability can lead to negative interpretations about the magnitude of social strains within their immediate environment and the strong need to develop a sense of identity and reputation among delinquent peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>). The young men in our sample clearly suffered from structural constraints that led to deficits in social capital, and they felt devoid of status, identity or power from a young age. Thus, the accumulation of a bad reputation was preferable to no reputation at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry, 2006</xref>). For the most vulnerable, sensitive and impulsive youngsters, the desire to gain wider social recognition and respect among their peer group combined with the negative emotions that exposure to gang violence provoked led them to seek out additional means of criminal coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811425540">Cullen and Agnew, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, involvement in recreational violence associated with gang culture progressed to serious convictions and repeat offending.</p>
<p>It has been argued that responses to persistent violent offending need to move beyond an exclusive focus on punitive interventions and include efforts to build supportive social arrangements, transmit pro-social capital and enable offenders to better cope with structural social strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811425540">Cullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>). Hence, it is important to explore the potential value added by sanctions such as curfews and EM in building such social support and capital.</p>
<p>Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811425540">Walter, 2002</xref>) suggests that curfew orders provide adult offenders with an opportunity to break away from activities and peer groups linked with their offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811425540">Killias et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811425540">Walter, 2002</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby (2008</xref>: 66) highlights the way in which stand-alone EM curfews can facilitate ‘habit breaking’ and disconnection from criminal networks. This was clearly the case for a minority of the youth participants in our study. In such cases, the curfew orders provided the young men with an opportunity to move away from their involvement with delinquent peer groups during the time the curfew order was active, thus reducing anti-social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">2009</xref>). In some cases, normative compliance occurred as a result of new social routines and attachment to ‘significant others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811425540">Bottoms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2009</xref>: 253). Accordingly, the sense of social cohesion, trust and collective efficacy within families and support networks was temporarily improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811425540">Ruston, 2002</xref>). However, the research was unable to explore the longevity of any changes.</p>
<p>In spite of these encouraging short-term repercussions, for a sizeable number of participants the experience of curfews was associated only with negative family and individualized impact (echoing findings with adult offenders by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield, 1997</xref>). For many, the curfew orders created increased dependency on alcohol and drugs as well as tension, friction and alienated social bonds within the home as a result of the anger that the young men experienced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew (2006</xref>: 33) highlights that anger can increase the likelihood of crime, since angry individuals are less likely to ‘accurately assess their situation’ and are ‘more likely to believe that crime is justified’ as a means of addressing a ‘perceived wrong’.</p>
<p>Our findings in this article corroborate this: in some cases, the anger that the young men experienced as a result of the loss of liberty that exposure to curfews brought about led to increased relationship problems and even violence within the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield, 1997</xref>). Police-monitored curfews were particularly challenging for families; the interactions between the young men and the officers on duty were often characterized by competitive machismo, which led to further strains within the home and increased anger. In some cases, it seemed that these negative experiences combined with the erratic nature of the police visits made the young men less inclined to comply with the conditions of their curfews (echoing findings among adult offenders on stand-alone curfews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby (2008)</xref>). Breaching was seen as a means of escaping from the sense of oppression that the young men felt while on curfew, and opened up opportunities for regaining a sense of freedom, autonomy and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811425540">Barry, 2006</xref>). As angry young men, they were less concerned with the costs of crime and more likely to believe that their criminal acts were justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The young men who were exposed to EM clearly experienced the same ‘pains’ associated with the restrictive conditions, and for some the process of having to wear the tag in public was clearly stigmatizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811425540">Payne and Gainey, 1998</xref>). Several of the young men clearly felt that the likelihood of being caught was far greater because of the surveillance aspect attached to the sanctions. In such cases, instrumental, threat-based compliance occurred, and some youngsters were clearly more able to accept the remote, impersonal authority associated with EM than the personalized authority associated with the police visits (confirming earlier speculative observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield (1997))</xref>. However, compliance with EM was also often accompanied by resentment and frustration and increased sensitivity towards social strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811425540">Bottoms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811425540">Nellis, 2006</xref>). Several admitted that this eventually led them to breach the EM-curfew and, ultimately, to re-offending, thereby coping with their strains in a criminal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>). A small minority of the young men clearly gained an added sense of positive identity and self-esteem from wearing the tag, due to the criminal reputation that went with it (echoing previous sentiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811425540">Hunter (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811425540">Richardson (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811425540">Whitfield (1997)</xref>).</p>
<p>Those young men and their families who experienced the services offered by ISMS alongside the implementation of EM-curfews seemed to benefit most (confirming earlier evidence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811425540">Khan and Hill (2007)</xref>). The multi-agency approach that was a feature of the service enabled participants to gain access to support groups, education provision and a range of social services. The intensive support offered via social work helped to challenge anti-social attitudes in some young people, enable them to view curfews as less severe and unjust and thus alter their perceptions about social strains and criminal coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>). However, in spite of the short-term increased sense of trust and social reciprocity the young people experienced, several of the family members highlighted the way in which young men reverted back to criminal behaviour once the rehabilitation mechanisms were removed at age 18.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In her research with adult offenders exposed to stand-alone EM curfews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby (2008)</xref> found that the sanctions had the potential to break offending-related habits and reduce anti-social capital through severing the participants’ links with situations, people, places and networks associated with their offending. At the same time, her research highlights that curfews had a more variable impact on pro-social capital; while some offenders found that curfew orders provided them with an opportunity to reduce or stop their substance use, others found that the sanctions led to increased dependencies and that the quality of their family relationships worsened as a result of the time spent confined to the home.</p>
<p>The evidence from our small-scale study illustrates that similar issues arise within the context of juvenile offenders. For the most vulnerable young men who have resorted to criminal coping as a result of a myriad of challenging social phenomena, curfews and EM clearly have some limited potential for reducing anti-social capital by providing them with opportunities to disengage with offending lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811425540">Hucklesby, 2008</xref>). In a minority of cases, our youth participants clearly drew upon these opportunities and complied with the curfews, thus temporarily leaving offending behind. However, these positive repercussions were most likely to occur when curfews were used in conjunction with mechanisms for rehabilitation and care, and where multi-agency approaches created opportunities to build social support around the young men as well as inflicting punishment on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811425540">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Most crucially, our evidence suggests that, used in isolation, curfews often fail to build pro-social capital in the lives of marginalized young men who have turned to criminal offending as a source of social identity, status and recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew (2006)</xref> argues that, used in isolation, punishment does not deter individuals from engaging in further crime since the punishment itself often functions as a social strain <italic>conducive</italic> to crime. For the young men in our sample, even where threat-based compliance did occur, the strains associated with curfews and EM led to anger and frustration which, in turn, led to negative family relationships, increased alcohol and drug dependency and even domestic violence. In turn, these negative emotional responses led the youngsters to view their social situations and the criminal sanctions they were exposed to as even more severe and unjust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study has been confined to a small sample of young men and their families in two local communities in the west of Scotland, and no universal generalizations can be made. However, our small-scale evidence has the potential to inform future considerations in the development of youth justice policy in Scotland. Our findings suggests that community-based sanctions such as curfews and EM, when used in isolation, may deplete the social support and capital present within the lives of young offenders more than they build it. By increasing negative emotionality and low constraint within these young men, they may also make them more sensitive to social strains and more likely to continue to cope with these strains in a criminal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>More research is needed into the comparative punitiveness and impact of these and other types of youth justice sanctions on young offenders and their families. In particular, research needs to focus on the ways in which we can create an appropriate blend of criminal enforcement, rehabilitation and care which will most effectively build social capital and alter the nature of social strains so that they are less likely to be seen as severe and unjust and to foster the ‘social learning of crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811425540">Agnew, 2006</xref>: 178). It is hoped that the insights from this article might stimulate such research.</p>
