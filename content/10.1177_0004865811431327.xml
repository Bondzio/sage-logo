<abstract>
<p>Drawing on survey and focus group research completed in New Zealand in 2009 this article examines young peoples’ perspectives on graffiti and tagging. The results further demonstrate that graffiti writing is an activity invested with considerable cultural meaning by many of those engaged in it and that their understanding of graffiti is considerably at odds with prevailing political, media and policy discourse that sees it purely in terms of criminal damage and antisocial behaviour. While graffiti can be conceptualised as an alternative way of ‘reading’ urban space, the results of this study show that writers recognised that graffiti had damaging consequences and was inappropriate in some contexts. Graffiti was not simply nihilistic destructive behaviour but one in which perceptions of criminality were leavened by aesthetic judgements and the allure and excitement of potential local celebrity.</p>

<p>As a form of expression graffiti has a long history and has been traced back as far as Elizabethan England, the early modern period and other ancient cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>: 78). Contemporary graffiti, which has its origins in New York and Philadelphia in the 1960s, has become a distinct part of the popular cultural expression of hip hop and youth cultures. Although hip hop provided the impetus for contemporary forms of graffiti, this form of expression has and does exist outside hip hop cultures, such as in political activism for example. Graffiti is often associated with subcultural activity outside of dominant hegemonic norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann, 1988</xref>). As such, tensions exist between graffiti writers and those seeking to eradicate it from public and private space. Much of the general media, political and policy debate surrounding graffiti frames the phenomenon almost solely in terms of damaging vandalism that has a negative impact on crime and quality of life issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865811431327">Ministry of Justice and Local Government New Zealand, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865811431327">Ministry of Justice, 2008</xref>). Dominant criminal justice approaches to graffiti have understood it as a pre-eminent signal crime, carrying a disproportionate negative impact on blighted communities. However, an emerging body of research has emphasised that graffiti is a culturally meaningful activity that can be understood as a distinct reading of urban landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). Surfaces are marked by weather and rust and damaged by atmospheric conditions such that no area is pristine or unchanging and invulnerable to graffiti and these surfaces can be altered by anyone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young (2006)</xref> found that ‘negative urban spaces’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865811431327">1</xref></sup> are identified as sites for writing in ways that form an alternative visual reading of the city. Therefore, graffiti writing can be seen as a way of connecting to the city, an alternative way of communication, with pride taken in the recognition gained in this alternative community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). Making a mark on urban cityscapes was noted as especially important for marginalised groups such as young homeless people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811431327">Luna (1987</xref>: 73) argues that ‘graffiti contains profound social psychological and cultural information worthy of serious attention’ and that the graffiti of homeless youth draws attention to their feelings about homelessness, safety, abuse and anger at the way they are ignored in society. These perspectives reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431327">Deleuze and Guattari’s (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431327">1987</xref>) argument that urban space ought to be conceptualised as fluid and contested. Such ideas reveal an illuminating way of thinking about graffiti that is considered further in the discussion below. Graffiti writers often want to express resistance to corporate ownership of city spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan, 2000</xref>). The UK graffiti artist Banksy noted that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… twisted little people … go out everyday and deface this great city. Leaving their idiotic little scribblings, invading communities and making people feel dirty and used. They just take, take, take and they don’t put anything back. They’re mean and selfish and they make the world an ugly place to be. We call them advertising agencies and town planners. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431327">Sliwa and Cairns, 2007</xref>: 78)</p></disp-quote>Graffiti writers and authorities are juxtaposed such that writers value urban spaces as a potential blank canvas to be brightened up with colour and design – a perspective that local government and other agencies seek to thwart through eradication efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431327">White, 2001</xref>). These tensions are exacerbated by the new and varied meanings involved in graffiti writing that are often ignored in crime prevention and policy strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008a</xref>). There is a growing literature around graffiti that highlights the diversity of graffiti writers which argues that this diversity needs to be taken into account both by researchers in the field and by policy makers (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431327">Sliwa and Cairns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008a</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan (2000)</xref> argues, those who object to graffiti and adhere to ‘law and order’ discourses focus only on the idea of vandalism and not on graffiti as ‘art’. Graffiti is therefore seen ‘always already in the order of a “problem”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>One of the interesting debates to have emerged about graffiti in recent years refers to its position as ‘art’ and the commercialisation of graffiti. Writing about graffiti in the 1980s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann (1988)</xref> notes that the appropriation of ‘subcultural artefacts’ denies subcultures’ ‘legitimacy as alternative social orders’ (1988: 232) and sees this as one of the ways in which the dominant order attacks subcultural expression. The proliferation of corporate advertising graffiti that mingles with ‘real’ graffiti throughout urban spaces also challenges the idea that graffiti remains ‘a subcultural form of expression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811431327">Alvelos, 2004</xref>: 181), although as graffiti writers are familiar with each other’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann, 1988</xref>) it could only be ‘outsiders’ who cannot distinguish the ‘real’ from the ‘manufactured’. Thus those with subcultural capital still remain part of an authentic, rebellious subculture that challenges dominant notions of power in urban spaces.</p>
<p>In being part of a rebellious subculture the thrill of graffiti writing is much noted – an element of deviant behaviour re-discovered by cultural criminologists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431327">Presdee (2000)</xref> who argued that many forms of exciting and risky activity have increasingly become subject to techniques and technologies of regulation. Ex-graffiti writers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431327">Ferrell’s (1993)</xref> research stated that they missed the excitement of writing and that the associated adrenalin rush was enhanced by the efforts of the authorities to ‘get tough’ through stronger penalties and powers. The ‘cat and mouse’ game of evading police added to writers’ fame or celebrity, although such games could end in police violence against graffiti writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431327">Lindsey and Kearns (1994</xref>: 11) found that participants were often motivated by the ‘thrill of seeing their name displayed’, even if their tag was a pseudonym. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431327">Schacter (2008</xref>: 41) conceived of graffiti as performance involving production, through the physical challenge of pieces ‘without authorisation, without permission in such prominent urban locations’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell (1995)</xref> emphasised status and identity among graffiti writers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431327">Lindsey and Kearns (1994)</xref> noted that graffiti writers can form a community developed through co-production, and mutual reliance in insecure night-time spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). Graffiti writing is often seen as a way of seeking ‘fame’ or ‘celebrity’, and there is some debate within the research about how central this idea is to those engaged in graffiti writing. Some researchers suggest that ‘seeking fame and notoriety has always been a major motivating factor for graffiti writers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008a</xref>: 484). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann’s (1988)</xref> respondents ‘fame’ was central to their involvement in graffiti writing, with intense competition to be the ‘king’. Others argue that pleasure in graffiti writing is equally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). The consensus appears to be that some desire for celebrity or recognition is important in engaging in graffiti writing, especially recognition and status within the community of graffiti writers themselves.</p>
<p>The perceived link between graffiti and other antisocial activities often forms the basis of policy interventions to eradicate graffiti. The ‘broken windows’ approach to crime and disorder has often transferred to policy initiatives and this has been continued into reassurance policing focused on quality of life issues beyond straightforward law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865811431327">Wilson and Kelling, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431327">Innes, 2004</xref>). Public anxieties surrounding incivilities and disorder are argued to contribute to a fear of crime, a phenomenon that appears to be increasing, even while crime rates appear to be in decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431327">Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865811431327">Zimring, 2007</xref>). Graffiti and tagging epitomise the concept of ‘signal crimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431327">Innes, 2004</xref>): communicative of risk, disorder and the erosion of social capital in ways that are unrelated to their apparent minor status in terms of financial damage or legal consequences. This communicative capacity has underpinned the situational crime prevention frameworks that have characterised the response to graffiti and tagging in countries such as the UK and New Zealand in recent years. In the US anxiety exists about graffiti being a gang related activity. While many gangs do use graffiti to mark territory, research has also found that graffiti crews could be an alternative to gang membership and a protective factor amongst young people in terms of gang activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>). Graffiti writers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811431327">Snyder’s (2009)</xref> study also stated that being involved with graffiti kept them away from drugs and alcohol. Furthermore, being recruited by gangs to inscribe graffiti on their behalf meant graffiti writers gained gang benefits and protection without having to engage in violence or criminal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann, 1988</xref>). In a New Zealand context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431327">Lindsey and Kearns (1994)</xref> found that graffiti is often an activity carried out by young people and therefore the established adult gangs such as the ‘Mongrel Mob’ and ‘Black Power’ have no interest in such territorial markings, preferring visible gang patches and gang presence in particular areas instead. In terms of antisocial behaviour and crime, research refutes the conventional stereotype of the graffiti writer as a destructive vandal, with writers stating that their reasons for engaging in this behaviour are that it is a pleasurable experience for them ‘unrelated to deliberate, anti-social, or negative motivations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>: 281). The relationship between one kind of offending behaviour and another is complex and as Halsey and Young note ‘ … such a relation usually proves to be anything but causal in a linear fashion’ (2006: 290). A distinction also needs to be made between crimes committed in order to carry out graffiti writing and other crimes committed by those who are graffiti writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). Therefore, whether a relationship exits between graffiti writing and other forms of criminal behaviour is a complex issue that should not be oversimplified.</p>
<p>Numerous studies about graffiti writing approach the subject from a variety of perspectives. Our study was commissioned by the Ministry of Justice in response to their ‘STOP’ (Stop Tagging Our Place) strategy for dealing more severely with graffiti. We decided to focus on the perceptions and opinions of young people as their voices seemed to be absent from these law and order debates around graffiti. The study suggests that some forms of graffiti, in some contexts, might not be communicative of a decline in community cohesion in the ways that crime prevention policy appears to take for granted. The findings presented provide further evidence that graffiti is a culturally meaningful activity for many young participants. These findings reinforce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431327">Millie’s (2008)</xref> argument that antisocial behaviour more generally is a highly contested category shaped by, among other things, aesthetic interpretations that are themselves spatially and temporally contingent.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0004865811431327"><title>Graffiti and tagging in New Zealand</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate young peoples’ attitudes towards graffiti and tagging in New Zealand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431327">Lindsey and Kearns (1994)</xref> noted that studies tend to focus on tags not on taggers: this study sought to fill that gap by focusing on the attitudes of young people, some of whom are taggers or graffiti writers, towards graffiti and the policy responses to it. There is relatively little New Zealand research into graffiti and tagging; the available material also shows a focus on crime prevention rather than the graffiti writer’s viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>: 166). Graffiti is an issue of significant cost to governments in New Zealand and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431327">Ministry of Justice, 2006a</xref>). Local government in New Zealand spends considerable sums on graffiti removal: in 2006 Auckland City Council spent approximately $5 million on graffiti eradication, and it was estimated that in 2007 Manukau City Council spent $1 million on its Graffiti Management Strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865811431327"><italic>Police News</italic>, 2008</xref>). Despite these efforts, as sites are cleaned up by councils, they are often quickly re-targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431327">Craw et al., 2006</xref>). Such rapid removal of graffiti can lead to the illusion that the problem has abated, as the general public do not see evidence of offensive tags or graffiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431327">Craw et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Problems relating to graffiti and tagging in New Zealand have had a high profile in recent years. Attention has been focused on cases<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865811431327">2</xref></sup> where property owners have used disproportionate force against taggers leading to debates about the extent to which private citizens are entitled to directly intervene to protect their premises. Steps taken by courts, police, local government and parliament to introduce more effective intervention strategies reinforce perceptions that graffiti and tagging are growing problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865811431327">3</xref></sup> In 2008 the Napier court sentenced several teenage taggers to jail, partly, according to press reports, to deter others from contributing to a growing problem in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431327"><italic>Dominion Post</italic>, 2008</xref>). In the same period, Wellington police adopted a high visibility response that required offenders to wear fluorescent pink vests while cleaning up graffiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431327"><italic>Dominion Post</italic>, 2008</xref>). Legal controls on the sale of spray paint were tightened by the Summary Offences (Tagging and Graffiti Vandalism) Amendment Act 2008, and changes to the 1961 Crimes Act established a maximum tariff of seven years imprisonment for intentional property damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431327">New Zealand Government, 2008</xref>). A range of other responses is included in the STOP (Stop Tagging Our Place) strategy that was introduced by the Ministry of Justice in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865811431327">Ministry of Justice, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While a broadly-based agenda has been developed to respond to graffiti and tagging, it continues to be the case that little is known about the perspectives of young people in general, and participants in particular. This article is based upon a study conducted in 2009 that explored perspectives on graffiti in the urban environment in terms of the processes and dynamics of writing, and attitudes toward desistance and crime prevention interventions. It is shown that graffiti and tagging are culturally meaningful activities, valued partly in terms of their liminality but also aesthetically and in relation to technical sophistication and style. Following an overview of the methodology used in the study the article explores young peoples’ perspectives on the nature of graffiti and tagging in general terms, and attitudes towards participation, the selection of venues for writing and the importance of the transgressive nature of graffiti.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0004865811431327" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The research adopted a mixed methods approach to understand offender motivation and general attitudes of young people towards tagging and graffiti. The study was funded by the Ministry of Justice and conducted by the authors in conjunction with the Ministry of Youth Development (MYD). Although social scientists disagree about what counts as mixing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431327">Bryman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865811431327">Cresswell and Plano Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431327">Gilbert, 2008</xref>), this study combined qualitative and quantitative methods: an online survey and focus groups. The survey was designed to get a ‘broad brush’ view of graffiti and to elicit perspectives on deterrence-based strategies to stop graffiti in public places. The focus groups examined issues related to graffiti such as its diversity and complexity in more detail, with several different groups of respondents making up the focus group discussions.</p>
<p>The results presented in this article offer an opportunity to examine the contexts in which graffiti and tagging take place, as well as the meanings attached to these behaviours by graffiti writers. This follows in a tradition of ‘appreciative studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431327">Matza, 1969</xref>) of deviant subcultures that seek ‘to understand and appreciate the social world from the point of view of the individual or category of individual, with particular reference to crime and deviance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865811431327">Jupp, 2001</xref>: 12). Developing an appreciation of the meanings and motivations of graffiti writers is important in generating effective strategies to prevent graffiti vandalism and also provides a critical rejoinder to dominant discourses focused upon criminal damage and links with harmful drug and gang subcultures.</p>
<p>The online survey was established on the MYD website, using the Survey Monkey web-tool. The survey comprised 23 questions relating to general perceptions of tagging and graffiti, the deviant and criminal status of tagging and graffiti, factors that might influence desistance, and any relation between this and other forms of problematic behaviour. Respondents had various opportunities to add ‘free text’ comments and some of these are presented in the following discussion. The survey was hosted on the MYD website in May and June 2009, during which period 773 people completed it. Participants in the survey were self-selected. Although a relatively large number participated it is not clear that the sample is representative of the broader population. There are a number of reasons for this, including that those who are disinterested might be less likely to participate in the survey than those actively engaged in graffiti. As graffiti is an under-researched topic in New Zealand there was insufficient information about graffiti writers as a population to develop representative sampling techniques. Researching those involved in criminal or deviant activities has many challenges, not least the recruiting of respondents. The sample was ‘open’ as its purpose was not to represent a particular population but to keep the collection of data as unconstrained as possible given the specific challenges associated with accessing offenders and young people.</p>
<p>Twenty-one focus groups were conducted in locations around New Zealand in April and May 2009. Fourteen of these were facilitated with the help of MYD staff. Another series of seven groups were conducted with young people engaged to various degrees in tagging and graffiti behaviour. Focus group participants were recruited via MYD networks. Some groups incorporated youths engaged in alternative education and mentoring programmes. Further participants were recruited through graffiti clean-up and community groups; others were members of youth panels that inform policy development across a range of government sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0004865811431327">4</xref></sup> Participants were aged between 14 and 24 years of age; no demographic data was recorded for these participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0004865811431327">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The extent to which respondents were or had been engaged in writing graffiti was not always clear. Ethical and logistical considerations prohibited access via the criminal justice system to those who had been arrested and convicted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0004865811431327">6</xref></sup> In discussing illegal behaviour with young people a direct approach focusing on personal behaviour is not appropriate, as this may cause respondents to ‘shut down’ such that little data is forthcoming. Therefore the approach taken was to ask for the opinions of focus group respondents around a series of issues relating to graffiti and tagging. Seven of the focus groups contained respondents thought to be directly involved in graffiti and tagging. The other 14 groups contained respondents who may have been involved in graffiti and tagging (some respondents from these groups referred to their own illegal activities), and those who were not directly involved in graffiti and tagging. Researchers needed to remain cognisant that graffiti is embedded in youth culture, so many respondents had detailed knowledge about graffiti and tagging and used slang terms such as ‘bomb’ and ‘wackie’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0004865811431327">7</xref></sup> They also often referred to peer group, as well as their own, behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<p>Participants responded in complex ways that often celebrated graffiti and tagging but retained a normative moral framework that valued, among other things, a sense of ‘respect’ towards artistic creativity and property that is not considered a legitimate site for writing. A review of the literature reveals that it is important to clarify the terms ‘graffiti’ and ‘tagging’, which are not synonyms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>). A tag is usually considered as a ‘simple, stylised self-elected name or signature written in public’, while graffiti is referred to as ‘markings on a surface’, definitions which are not mutually distinctive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431327"><italic>Tearaway</italic>, 2009</xref>). Recent debates have focused on the extent to which ‘graffiti’ extends to other forms of non-figurative street art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008b</xref>). For the purpose of this discussion ‘tagging’ and ‘graffiti’ are used synonymously but it is recognised that writers themselves often attach considerable significance to specific terminology.</p>
<p>The survey asked some introductory questions about graffiti. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811431327">Table 1</xref> indicates a broad distribution of views in relation to the status of graffiti as ‘vandalism that should not be tolerated’, with almost equal proportions of respondents selecting each category. A significant minority of respondents (39.0 per cent) strongly agreed or agreed that graffiti is vandalism that should not be tolerated. Conversely, the survey also showed a high level of agreement (81.9 per cent agreed or strongly agreed) that graffiti is an urban art form that should be valued in some circumstances. Both responses suggest that no distinct perspective was articulated about the nature of graffiti in general terms.

<p>The diverse nature of graffiti writing was highlighted in additional comments made by survey participants:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a line that defines graffiti and tagging. Graffiti art is different to tagging. That needs to be established.</p>
<p>There are two types of graffiti. One, vandalism and two, the creative artistic side. Understand this.</p>
<p>I strongly disagree with tagging, I’m sure you understand this but taggers are also a problem for graffiti artists. They tag our artistic work also making it go from respectable art to a hideous mess.</p></disp-quote>Such distinctions and definitions reflect findings from other researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431327">Ferrell (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young (2002)</xref> who noted that defining ‘graffiti’ can be problematic, and that there is tension between ‘graffiti’ and ‘tagging’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan’s (2000)</xref> respondents noted that tagging over a finished piece is considered disrespectful. Usually graffiti writing that had been marred in this way was quickly painted over by other writers due to competing demands for space in certain areas. As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan (2000: 112)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some basic graffiti yard etiquette. Go over a piece with a better piece. Go over messed up pieces before those that haven’t been damaged.</p></disp-quote>Respondents to the current study similarly referred to informal rules surrounding the location of graffiti writing and noted that some venues were deemed inappropriate for ‘genuine’ graffiti writers. Those who broke these informal rules were seen as engaging in vandalism and highly disapproved of in ways that suggest that graffiti and tagging is not simply nihilistic. These internal rules that operate among graffiti writers demonstrate the importance of a hierarchy of respect for other writers and for more sophisticated pieces that was also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431327">Austin (1998)</xref>. One focus group participant summarised the informal criteria surrounding the location of graffiti thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are rules, you know, even the graffiti guys have rules – so when someone breaks them it’s the pits. You know, the OG<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0004865811431327">8</xref></sup> writers don’t tag churches or private property, schools. But people break those rules, most of the time it’s just hooligans.</p></disp-quote>Focus group participants established a binary hierarchy between graffiti as art and tagging as vandalism. The distinction was often cast in terms of an artistic judgement, as the focus group excerpts below indicate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Art. It is just expressing yourself.</p>
<p>If you are professional, it is art.</p>
<p>To other people it is vandalism, but to us it is art.</p>
<p>Vandalism is when it is on someone’s property.</p>
<p>If it is graffiti then it is art, if it is tagging then it is vandalism.</p></disp-quote>Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens (2008a)</xref> described the emergence of ‘post graffiti’, a style that entails ‘breaking the unwritten graffiti rules to create new graphic forms and images outside 3-D and wildstyle lettering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008a</xref>: 473–474). This diversity can be problematic when trying to examine attitudes towards graffiti. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young (2006</xref>: 283) found, graffiti writers used ‘an extensive vocabulary to describe their activities’. Their respondents justified graffiti writing along three dimensions; skill, intent and aesthetics. Time spent developing the skill to do large pieces warranted a label of ‘art’. Tagging, on the other hand, was seen as unskilful and so regarded as vandalism – or less than art – by graffiti writers. Art in graffiti writing was associated with intent; using time in a productive way to express a particular viewpoint was seen as ‘art’, while marking surfaces in a meaningless way was seen as vandalism. In terms of aesthetics graffiti writing that was pleasing to the eye was seen as ‘art’, although graffiti writers acknowledged that this was a subjective judgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>: 284).</p>
<p>To explore this diversity, participants in this study were asked to respond to various positive and negative statements attributed to graffiti. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811431327">Table 2</xref> ranks these items according to the percentage of respondents who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with the list of problems and benefits. These results reinforce the complex perceptions of graffiti and its impact. While a clear majority agreed to some extent that ‘graffiti is an art form’ there was also a strong agreement that ‘graffiti damages property’ and some agreement that it impacts on perceptions of neighbourhoods.

<p>Focus group discussions often reinforced these quantitative findings. In particular, distinctions were drawn between legitimate graffiti and vandalism. One focus group participant reflected the ambiguity of distinguishing graffiti art from vandalism, noting that graffiti is ‘vandalism. Well, I reckon it’s art, but in the law it is vandalism’. The distinction between art and vandalism was sometimes couched in narrow legal terms (‘if you are allowed to do it [it is art]’) but the difference between the two was articulated in terms of the content and style of what was written. Some reflected on the impact that graffiti has on audiences, and suggested that this influenced whether it should be considered as art or vandalism. Participants were asked what elevates some forms of graffiti into art, common reflections included:
<disp-quote>
<p>when it looks good (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>if it is an expression of who you are – that is art. But if it is a message, something written on a wall just to say ‘I wrote something on a wall’, that is vandalism. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>some people have a real passion for it, to express their feelings and also for the story. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>it is an outlet of your emotions so depending on how you feel at the time. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>I reckon it is just mindless: ‘there’s a good spot so let’s just hit it’. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>graffiti is an element of hip hop so it is not anything negative. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>Much media and political comment regards graffiti and tagging as gateway offending that becomes associated with other illegal and problematic behaviour. Focus group participants reflected this complexity by providing mixed perspectives on the extent to which tagging and graffiti are linked to deviant behaviour. While some respondents noted an association with other illicit youth activity, others suggested that more dedicated writers avoided alcohol and drugs in order to focus on graffiti, or even that writing is an alternative to these activities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alcohol and drugs sort of put you in that … mood. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>No, I know heaps of people who do it just for fun. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>Instead of taking drugs or getting drunk they tag. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>Some survey respondents also highlighted that ‘to damage something’ or ‘to destroy something’ was an unpopular reason for doing graffiti and were highly critical of the researchers for including it as a category. More on the relation between illegality and graffiti follows later in this article.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0004865811431327"><title>Writing graffiti and tagging</title>
<p>Respondents were asked about their (non)participation in general terms, and also about the type of writing they had done: the survey found participation in graffiti varied by gender, age and ethnicity, and also that different forms of graffiti were pursued to different degrees. For example, 55.4 per cent of male respondents agreed that they had written graffiti, at least occasionally. In contrast, 75.5 per cent of females reported that they had not written graffiti. While this finding requires further research it might reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811431327">Macdonald’s (2001)</xref> argument that graffiti subculture is closely bound up with the expression of particular forms of masculinity. The valorisation of physical risk-taking and the expression of defiance might be gendered in ways that help to understand the finding that males were considerably more engaged in graffiti than females. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431327">Synder (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann (1988)</xref> also refer to gendered barriers in entering into graffiti subcultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann’s (1988)</xref> respondents refused to mentor female ‘toys’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0004865811431327">9</xref></sup> and the particular challenges associated with the negotiation of the night time street for women is highlighted by Synder in commenting that ‘the street is in many ways a place of maleness’ (2009: 9). Although there was variation in the extent of participation, respondents who engaged in some form of graffiti were most likely to identify their activity as ‘graffiti art’. Males reported that they engaged in different types of graffiti at a greater rate than females, although graffiti art was the biggest category selected by those who participated of both genders. Of those who have written graffiti 24.9 per cent (n = 192) reported that they had done ‘graffiti art’; those who ‘sometimes’ participated also selected this category above the others, although only 19.4 per cent (n = 150) chose it. Exceptions to this trend were the youngest age cohort (under 14s) who were more likely to have tagged (18.2 per cent, n = 141) or done stylised writing (9.1 per cent, n = 70), Māori (who were more likely to have tagged, at 23.3 per cent, n = 180, than to have done graffiti art) and Pacific Islanders (who were more likely to have done stylised writing).</p>
<p>Focus groups elaborated types and styles of writing and that consideration in these terms informed perceptions of legitimacy. Fine gradations existed between ‘scribbles’, ‘tags’ and ‘bombs’, for example, which are forms of relatively unsophisticated writing that require no particular skill and were often associated in group discussions with vandalism. More complex pieces which were valued by young people could, they noted, be subject to degradation by being tagged: such that graffiti itself was sometimes vandalised. One focus group participant expressed the distinctions between different forms in the following terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a difference between tagging and bombing. We have that in south Taranaki. A lot of areas where the community youth get together and done a cool bomb on the wall. And yet when it is done like that and the youth are proud of something they have done, they don’t tag it, like we don’t see tagging as much. We get the youth involved in making bombing. It is still a problem but it is not as bad as it used to be. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>The survey found that ‘creative expression’ was the most significant reason why respondents wrote graffiti with 47.2% (n = 146), reporting this as the reason they engaged in graffiti. Only small proportions reported that they were motivated by a ‘sense of danger’ (1.6%, n = 5) or the desire to ‘damage something’ (1.9%, n = 6). The youngest cohort, those under 14, was most likely to report that they were motivated by group culture and a desire to damage something. Older cohorts, who answered in small numbers, were more likely than others to suggest that their participation was related to protest of some kind. Few survey respondents reported that they were attracted by a sense of danger, excitement or by a desire for celebrity (‘to get my name up’), although these themes did emerge from focus group discussion with graffiti writers. Similarly qualitative comments included in survey responses sometimes reflected the range of motivations for writing graffiti. The comment below illustrates something of this, as well as the distinctions drawn between different types of writing:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are two types of graffiti artist, the bad type and the good type. The good type just want to express there [sic] art, the thrill of getting ur [sic] piece up for a couple of people to admire before it is removed, it’s addictive. But there are the bad ones that ruin it for the good ones. They tag because of the group of people they hang out with and the competition they have with each other. The art they do doesn’t express any meaning. (Online Survey respondent)</p></disp-quote>It was clear that many respondents had complex reasons for engaging in graffiti which has implications for deterrence-based strategies. Online survey respondents felt that graffiti was a central part of their lifestyle and an important form of expression.
<disp-quote>
<p>I do it because I like it, why I like it is complicated but mostly has to do with being able to take control of my environment. (Online Survey respondent)</p>
<p>Stopping me from doing it? That would be impossible. Graffiti is already part of my lifestyle and doing it is like therapy for me. (Online survey respondent)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An older respondent who no longer wrote stated that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Young people will stop tagging when they feel they matter and have purpose and hope. Tagging is not the issue, the society and families that they come from are. (Online survey respondent)</p></disp-quote>Other studies have suggested graffiti writers see their activity as bringing colour and life to drab urban environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431327">White, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431327">Schacter, 2008</xref>), a view endorsed by some respondents:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t like tagging but love murals and big pieces of aerosol art in public spaces, legal or not! It certainly brightens the dull and lifeless cement and is more stimulating to look at than advertisements as big as 10 storey buildings! … And is your city pretty anyway? (Online survey respondent)</p>
<p>Without graffiti there would be no glittering bright spots in our decaying trash riddin [sic] inner cities. The colours can inspire a little happiness to the darkest of places. (Online survey respondent)</p>
<p>’Cos they think the city is ugly. They want to make it beautiful by writing their name all over it. Colourful. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>Viewing graffiti writing in these terms, as bringing a different and colourful perspective on the city was common amongst respondents and echoed in other graffiti research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811431327">Halsey and Pederick, 2010</xref>). Advertisers in contrast were seen as defacing the cityscape without asking permission, ‘ … you have got to put up with big advertisements and whatever. No one ever rang me up and asked me if that could be there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811431327">Halsey and Pederick, 2010</xref>: 93)</p>
<p>Creative expression, expressing sentiments and sharing opinions were reasons for doing graffiti writing that were highlighted by the online survey respondents.
<disp-quote>
<p>I find it an easy way to express how I am feeling about current economic time and the current government. (Online survey respondent)</p>
<p>Why stop expressing myself? I do it to share an opinion or art, not to destroy. (Online survey respondent)</p></disp-quote>The idea that graffiti writers (re)appropriate public space emerged from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431327">Schacter’s (2008)</xref> finding that graffiti writers considered that corporate businesses had ‘taken over’ urban spaces. Graffiti writing was a protest at this ‘corporatisation’ and an attempt to engage with the urban landscape in a way that represents more than private commercialism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865811431327">Young (2005)</xref> noted that even authorized visual imagery and signage present in the urban landscape is contested in terms of planning regulations and civic by-laws. Unlike graffiti though, such challenges do not tend to lead to calls for the ‘eradication’ of all ‘legitimate’ signage.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting on their own participation, respondents were asked to rank reasons why people write graffiti in general terms. Survey respondents who stated that they wrote graffiti were asked to rank a series of possible causal factors for their own writing (between 1, ‘most important reason’, and 6, ‘least important reason’). Similarly those who did not write were asked to rank causal reasons for graffiti in general terms, using the same scale. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0004865811431327">Table 3</xref> combines these findings. On that basis, the creativity of graffiti again emerges as an important causal factor and the desire to cause damage as the least significant factor. This is also supported by the online survey respondents who stated that expressing themselves creatively was an important reason for graffiti writing.

<p>Focus group participants noted that graffiti writers in general often participated for pleasure, enjoyment and to achieve a measure of local celebrity:
<disp-quote>
<p>They wanna get famous. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>No, they do it ’cos it’s a fact that you get noticed by other people. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>For some people it is the only thing they are good at. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>All survey respondents, whether they reported that they wrote graffiti or not, were asked whether they felt the illegal nature of writing made it more attractive. A majority of respondents, whether they wrote or not, tended to agree that the illicit nature of graffiti made it more exciting. Analysis of the survey results showed no differences in terms of age, gender or ethnicity. Agreement was strongest among those relatively involved in graffiti activity: with 22.9 per cent of those that said they wrote ‘strongly agreeing’ that illegality made it more attractive. However, all groups (writers, ‘occasional writers’ and non-writers) broadly agreed that the transgressive nature of graffiti added to the excitement. A majority of writers (61.0 per cent), ‘occasional writers’ (55.7 per cent) and non-writers (60.8 per cent) strongly agreed or agreed that illegality made writing graffiti more attractive. Online survey and focus group respondents cited the ‘thrill’ of illicit activity by stating that they stopped because of:
<disp-quote>
<p>Not feeling the buzz to hit up anymore. (Online survey respondent)</p>
<p>Yeah, you get a buzz but not because it is exciting. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>It’s exciting. If you see a cop and you haven’t finished your piece you got to get away. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The attraction of the illicit nature of graffiti was apparent in focus groups discussion. Many respondents spoke about the adrenalin rush associated with graffiti and tagging activity and that this would be muted in legitimate sites. Others reported that being caught would change attitudes towards potential future offending. The following excerpts reflect these views:
<disp-quote>
<p>I reckon it would be just the same [if graffiti were legalised] … you would see much more than what there is today. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>Depends on whether you’ve been caught or not. Before you get caught it is exciting but after you have been caught then you just don’t wanna get caught. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>You don’t get a rush from something you are allowed to do. (Focus group participant)</p>
<p>It would still be exciting if it was legal but it would be way reduced. (Focus group participant)</p></disp-quote>It has often been found that graffiti writers are motivated, in part, by the thrill of engaging in illicit activity in a climate of increasingly severe penalties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann, 1988</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young (2006</xref>: 292) argue that ‘only very rarely do writers mention the thrill accompanying <italic>the breaking of the law</italic> as their <italic>primary</italic> motivation’ (emphasis in original). Our findings would appear to demonstrate that the illegality of graffiti is a strong motivating factor, although in common with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young (2006)</xref> it is not the <italic>only</italic> factor associated with graffiti writing.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0004865811431327" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The results presented above have myriad implications but three themes of general significance emerge: first, it is clear that graffiti writers do not form a group wholly distinct from non-graffiti writers in terms of their attitudes towards graffiti; second, graffiti is a meaningful cultural and social practice made more attractive by its illegality; and third, for some, graffiti writing is associated with a desire for local celebrity. Each of these is discussed in turn, and policy implications are highlighted.</p>
<p>The findings provide little evidence to suggest that graffiti writers are a distinct sub-group with perceptions of graffiti different from the wider population. Although graffiti writers were less likely to report that graffiti was ‘always a bad thing’ both participants and non-participants shared a contextual view that recognised negative consequences of graffiti in some circumstances. Similarly respondents to the survey tended to ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ that graffiti is a creative art form. They also tended to agree that it had negative attributes in terms of property damage and affect on residents’ perceptions of their neighbourhood. Attitudes toward graffiti were shaped by nuanced judgements relating to the perceived legitimacy of the venue, the physical challenges overcome to write on that location and the aesthetic value of the graffiti itself. Even those who engaged in graffiti writing and appreciated it as an artistically worthwhile activity tended to report that some venues, such as schools or maraes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0004865811431327">10</xref></sup> were not appropriate sites for graffiti. Other taboo places for graffiti are considered by some graffiti writers to be people’s cars and fences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811431327">Halsey and Pederick, 2010</xref>: 93). Responses to graffiti writing that cast participants as antisocial criminals are unlikely to coincide with young people’s perceptions and attitudes towards graffiti and tagging, which seem to conceptualise property in terms of use rather than ownership.</p>
<p>These findings have implications for theoretical debates that cast graffiti writing, and other criminal and deviant behaviour, as ‘edgework’ inherently liminal and celebratory of social and cultural margins. While the work of Jeff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431327">Ferrell (1993)</xref> and Mike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431327">Presdee (2000)</xref> echoes through much of the above discussion, it is notable that there was considerable synergy between the perspectives of writers and non-writers and also that those who wrote graffiti reported attitudes and values that were not wholly distinct from those expressed in conventional public discourse. Respect for property and disdain for criminal damage were evident even among graffiti writers, suggesting that their marginal status is complex and negotiated. This finding might be an artefact of the research method – perhaps the young people, anonymity notwithstanding, were disposed to express attitudes and values that they felt most appropriate to present. It could also be, though, a reflection of the ‘schizophrenia’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431327">Deleuze and Guattari (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431327">1987</xref>) identify in public spaces. Just as place can be striated and controlled or smooth and open-ended, depending upon its temporal and spatial location,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0004865811431327">11</xref></sup> so too might the inhabitants who make those spaces offer complex perspectives on their environments.</p>
<p>A second key finding from the study is that participants understand graffiti writing as an activity that is meaningful in cultural and aesthetic terms. Young people invest intensely in activities such as graffiti that have myriad meanings to them. Those involved in graffiti writing see it as meaningful and intend to continue writing. The informal codes that deem some sites as valid for graffiti while defining others as unacceptable are themselves mediated by aesthetic judgements about the content of graffiti and tagging. More than 80 per cent of respondents (strongly) agreed that graffiti is an art form and it was apparent from focus groups that it is an activity imbued with cultural meaning greatly valued by participants. Artistic meaning is evident in the careful distinctions made about different forms of writing and the relative merit of highly crafted conceptualised ‘[master]pieces’, which are ranked as more significant than ‘bombs’ (stylised writing), which themselves compare favourably to ‘tags’. Focus group discussion showed that graffiti is understood by writers as an engaging physical event, something that happens and is corporeal: it connects the writer to the urban landscape. For non-writers – willing or unwilling consumers, viewers or spectators – it is a product: a material outcome that signifies criminal damage or trespass of some kind that may not be judged in aesthetic terms. Writers have very different relations with graffiti and value the skill, imagination and audacity – and perhaps the collaboration – that has been invested in the production of a piece. This contrasts vividly with the relationship of the passive viewer to the finished product. The pleasure and enjoyment that participants derive from writing graffiti is associated not with the damage to property that preoccupies owners – which graffiti writers recognise as they report that they would be unhappy were their own property targeted – but with the physical challenge of producing complex artistic forms in difficult circumstances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431327">Schacter (2008)</xref> argued that excitement is linked to the production of graffiti and that a powerful facet of writing is the performance that production involves. This is not only related to illegality but also to the physical difficulty of producing it ‘without authorisation, without permission in such prominent urban locations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431327">Schacter, 2008</xref>: 41). The ceremony and sanctity of writing was noted by Schacter and also in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young’s (2006)</xref> study. While graffiti writers often work together out of a sense of mutual safety in deserted night-time spaces, this also reflects that they are engaged in shared, meaningful peer activity. This study certainly found that the pursuit of peer group recognition was an important attraction for writers, although clearly the camaraderie of the process of doing graffiti was also significant.</p>
<p>The illegality of graffiti is an important dimension of the excitement (often described in focus groups and online surveys as the ‘adrenalin rush’) associated with writing, and many respondents spoke of the fun associated with evading authority. The importance of illegality in understanding graffiti is further complicated since it is also apparent that graffiti is not always easily equated with criminal damage or vandalism, although it often incorporates damage to property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431327">Craw et al., 2006</xref>). Graffiti artists do not necessarily engage in other forms of vandalism, or in crime related to gang activity or drug and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). While graffiti writers’ defence of their activities in aesthetic terms might seem a disingenuous response to concerns about crime and damage to property, it is not without parallel, and similar subjective judgements have been made in other contexts about the artistic merit of work that might otherwise be charged as obscene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865811431327">Young, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431327">Presdee (2000)</xref> noted that ‘artistic merits’ have influenced debates about work that might otherwise be considered as paedophilic, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811431327">Kidd (2003)</xref> explored similar debates relating to the ‘culture wars’ over the work of artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe. That graffiti contests established notions about what messages and forms of art can be legitimately conveyed in public is also apparent in claims that graffiti is an authentic challenge to the commercialisation of public property. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell (1995)</xref> noted that young people and urban spaces are increasingly regulated and controlled and so graffiti writers refer to their activities as a ‘war of the walls’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>: 83).</p>
<p>The findings show that graffiti writing is imbued with meaning derived from an appreciation of aesthetic merits combined with evaluation of the effort and risk involved in its production. Focus group respondents spoke about graffiti as a craft that requires dedication and learning as practitioners develop from informal scribbles and tagging to pieces that required greater technical skill and an appreciation of artistic and cultural reference points associated with the art form. Some of these techniques and conventions were learnt and developed through association with more established practitioners in ways similar to conventional apprenticeships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431327">Lachmann (1988)</xref> found that novice graffiti writers were taken under the wing of experienced mentors and taught the rules of the subculture and the skills needed to progress from tagging to murals or masterpieces (1988: 234). However, not all those who do ‘throw ups’, ‘bombs’ or ‘stompies’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0004865811431327">12</xref></sup> will develop the necessary talent and application to progress to more aesthetic pieces worthy of greater respect. Policy makers need to understand the cultural meaning and value attached to many forms of graffiti and to move beyond simplistic dichotomies between art and criminal damage. One of the key findings of this research is that young people recognised harm caused by graffiti writing but that the artistic merit associated with complex sophisticated pieces was held to outweigh problems of crime and property damage. This perspective also raises questions about programmes based on the prompt eradication of graffiti. Largely based on an epidemiological approach that assumes the presence of graffiti encourages imitative behaviour, removal programmes effectively contest territory in ways that exacerbate the risks and challenges that attract writers in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1995</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431327">Ferrell and Weide (2010)</xref> noted attempts to remove graffiti from the urban landscape simply changed the type of graffiti in particular spots (2010: 54). More skilful pieces that took time to finish were replaced with throw-ups or tags that could be completed quickly, highlighting the irony that ‘ … attempts to prevent graffiti writing often overproduce the very forms of unsophisticated graffiti most offensive to those who would stop it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431327">Ferrell and Weide, 2010</xref>: 54). Strenuous efforts to remove graffiti and to wage war on graffiti writers has simply resulted in ever more cunning ways to evade detection and apprehension (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865811431327">Iveson, 2010b</xref>) and has also spurred on the development of new types of graffiti, or post-graffiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008a</xref>) that are quicker to put up, such as stencils.</p>
<p>A third key feature of the findings is the importance of celebrity and local fame associated with graffiti writing. The gaining and sustaining of respect through graffiti was clearly an important motivator for young people, and even those who did not participate in writing spoke about reading local tags and graffiti in these terms. Pursuing peer group credibility might take other forms among other sections of society, but it is not an activity pursued only by youth subcultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>: 281). Indeed graffiti and tagging might be considered a form of micro-celebrity not wholly divorced from other forms of media in contemporary society. The proliferation of websites and social media that celebrate graffiti tend to reinforce the idea that this form of recognition be considered on a spectrum with other more apparently legitimate avenues to secure respect through recognition. The increasing salience of hip hop culture, from which much graffiti culture emerged in the United States in the late 1970s and 1980s, within mainstream TV, music, film, internet and gaming media underpins the blurred boundaries between celebrity status that can be gained from illegal graffiti and legitimate cultural forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431327">Ferrell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2006</xref>). However, the extent to which street art has been appropriated by dominant cultural authorities has led some to proclaim the ‘death of graffiti’ as an anarchic counter-cultural phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811431327">Dickens, 2008b</xref>). While gaining respect was an important facet of writing for many respondents to this study, this was sometimes tempered by the need to protect identity in order to avoid detection. An attractive part of the subterfuge associated with writing is the distinction between securing recognition for tags or particular graffiti style and the maintenance of individual anonymity. This might have consequences in terms of crime prevention and detection since efforts to collate databases of prolific local taggers serve to reinforce recognition and cement writers’ reputations for renowned high-profile work.</p>
<p>What is clear from this study is that while graffiti means different things to different writers – ‘ … for some it was strictly art, for others a vandalistic thrill, for others a means to communicate one’s worth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431327">Synder, 2009</xref>: 9) – the diversity of graffiti urgently needs to be addressed by policy makers. For policy makers this involves considering how to address the negative impacts on the community while retaining those aspects of graffiti that have positive impacts on the communities in which they appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431327">Docuyanan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431327">Halsey and Young, 2002</xref>). In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431327">Iveson (2010a)</xref> argues, perhaps what is needed is a new way of viewing graffiti as <italic>adding</italic> and <italic>contributing</italic> to the urban environment, as part of the mapping of the city and an exploration of the voices of those who live there. Additionally, just because graffiti writing is an alternative way of utilising city spaces does not necessarily mean it is a bad or invalid way of doing this. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865811431327">Young (2010)</xref> notes Melbourne’s graffiti alleys are key tourist attractions and marketed as such by the city authorities. Therefore the implications of this study for policy responses to graffiti and tagging are many and various. Key among these is that young people expressed a wide range of perspectives on graffiti and tagging, and that those who admitted some degree of participation did not always differ greatly from those who did not participate. Young people had nuanced views such that some forms of writing were valued for their artistic content and the risks overcome, as well as the skill required in producing pieces. Only a small minority of young people suggested that vandalism and criminal damage were primary motivations. Even those who admitted participating in graffiti and vandalism maintained that there were areas and types of property that were not acceptable sites for writing and that these should not be subject to the damage and ‘disrespect’ sometimes associated with such activity. The cultural and artistic merit associated with some forms of graffiti suggests that its status as a signal crime communicative of antisocial behaviour needs to be rethought.</p>
