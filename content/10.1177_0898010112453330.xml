<abstract>
<p>Providing spiritual care is recognized as a significant aspect of nursing practice. This pilot study was designed to determine if simulation is an effective method for instructing nursing students in the provision of spiritual care. Fifty-two students participated in a simulation exercise that introduced concepts of spiritual care. Simulation was successful in improving students’ attitudes toward patient spirituality, assessment of spiritual needs, ability to refer patients to the appropriate spiritual caregivers, and communication skills. Incorporating spiritual care instruction into curricula may prove to be valuable in increasing students’ awareness of spiritual care for patients and incorporation of such care into their practice.</p>

<title>Spiritual Care in Nursing</title>
<p>Spiritual care has become an integral component of nursing care. Florence Nightingale perceived spirituality in nursing as presence in the form of love, admiration, reverence, and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112453330">Macrae, 2001</xref>). When nurses and nursing students respond to patients on such a personal and intimate level, they are truly providing holistic nursing care. Holistic nursing takes into consideration the totality of humans by recognizing the interconnectedness of body, mind, spirit, environment, society, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112453330">American Holistic Nurses Association, 2010</xref>). As the biomedical field becomes increasingly laden with technological and pharmaceutical advances, provider–patient relationships have weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112453330">van Leeuwen, Tiesinga, Post, &amp; Jochemsen, 2006</xref>). The complexity of the health care needs of patients often places their spiritual needs on the back burner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112453330">Harrison, 1993</xref>). As patients seek meaning in their lives and illnesses, nurses may enable the spiritual journey to occur because they are most intimately connected with patients. The concept of spirituality has commonly been associated with religion. Although the two are closely related, spirituality also has other meanings, such as hope, personal journeys, interests, and relationships. A broad definition of spirituality is more inclusive for all people. Such a definition is necessary for the holistic care of nonreligious patients, who also have spiritual needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112453330">Burnard, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Although patients expect their nurses to be educated in spiritual caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112453330">Taylor, 2007</xref>), nurses often do not meet spiritual needs in the manner in which patients expect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453330">Clark, Drain, &amp; Malone, 2003</xref>). The Joint Commission in 2009 made spiritual support a standard in the core areas of assessment, planning, and coordination of care, treatment, and services to patients. In spite of an agreement that nurses must be competent in providing spiritual care, there seems to be a lack of true instruction to prepare nurses. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of simulation as a method of instruction for nursing students in providing spiritual care to their patients.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, the study team defined spirituality as persons’ sense of purpose in life and the connectedness to that purpose, which they find meaningful. The methods we chose for this study combined instruction with spiritual care practice in the simulation laboratory, as evaluated by the Spiritual Care Competence Scale (SCCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453330">van Leeuwen, Tiesinga, Middel, Post, &amp; Jochemsen, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Many authors have recognized the importance of spiritual self-awareness across the health care and nursing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453330">Catanzaro &amp; McMullen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112453330">Hoffert, Henshaw, &amp; Mvududu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112453330">Lovanio &amp; Wallace, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112453330">McEwen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112453330">Taylor, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112453330">Chism and Magnan (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112453330">McSherry (1998)</xref> reported that practicing nurses believed they needed more education in spiritual caregiving, bringing to light that instruction is required. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112453330">McSherry, Gretton, Draper, and Watson (2008)</xref> revealed that nursing students believed they <italic>should</italic> be taught about spirituality. Despite the importance of spiritual care in nursing, there are very few published studies whose investigators evaluated methods of teaching about spiritual care in nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453330">Lemmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112453330">Loviano &amp; Wallace, 2007</xref>). According to these authors, faculty members who presented educational interventions on spirituality assisted their students in increasing their knowledge of spiritual care and comfort in performing spiritual assessments. Clinical experiences that expose students to opportunities to provide spiritual care are also beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112453330">McEwen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453330">Mitchell, Bennett, &amp; Manfrin-Ledet, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Because students in nursing may not have opportunities for these experiences in the field, faculty can use the simulation laboratory to provide that realistic experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112453330">Jeffries, 2005</xref>). Its effectiveness derives from the ability of faculty to alter clinical situations of varying complexity. In a debriefing session, students can observe themselves on monitors and discuss their thoughts and feelings in a safe, nonthreatening manner. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112453330">Jeffries (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453330">Mitchell et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that the chance for teamwork skill building is increased through the possibility of role-playing.</p>

<sec id="section3-0898010112453330">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>A theoretical model that strongly supports the use of simulation in nursing education is the theory of learning developed by David Kolb. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112453330">Kolb (1984)</xref> posited that learners integrate knowledge through a spiral of learning that includes concrete experience and observation. These are followed by reflections on concrete experiences. Learners then form abstract concepts based on the reflections, test new concepts, and repeat the sequence until achieving mastery of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112453330">Kolb, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112453330">Kolb and Fry (1975)</xref> argued that learning should be viewed as a continuous cycle and that learning can begin at any one of the four points. In the simulation settings, students have the opportunity to observe, reflect, and practice until they attain their desired comfort levels. The students in our nursing program attend simulation sessions several times each semester. They have opportunities to discuss and provide spiritual care with each scenario and patient encounter in the simulation lab. Simulation lab staff or faculty play the role of patient advocate, and the patient’s voice is that of the high-fidelity mannequin.</p>

<title>Study Design, Setting, Subjects, Instrument, and Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>A convenience sample of 52 students in a maternal–child health class participated in the study. The study team used a quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest design to determine whether instruction would increase nursing students’ perceived competence in providing spiritual care. This pilot study took place in the simulation laboratory of a small, private liberal arts college in the Northeast. The subjects of the study were a convenience sample of nursing students enrolled in a maternal child health course who participated in a 2-hour simulation laboratory session. These students were informed of the study and given the opportunity to choose whether or not to participate. The college’s institutional review board granted approval for the study.</p>
<p>To assess the students’ competencies prior to and after the intervention, faculty used the SCCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453330">van Leeuwen et al., 2009</xref>). The SCCS includes Likert-type scale items covering six aspects of spiritual care. The areas measured by the tool in this study included “Attitude toward patient spirituality,” which refers to nurses’ personal feelings about spirituality, whereas “communication” refers to communication between nurse and patient. “Assessment and implementation of spiritual care” deals with nurses’ abilities to determine their patients’ spiritual needs. “Referral” indicates obtaining professional assistance with spirituality (e.g., from a chaplain). “Personal support and patient counseling” cover performing nursing interventions and “professionalization and improving the quality of spiritual care” deal with spirituality quality assurance and policy development. Twenty-five questions from the original SCCS tool were included in the pre- and posttests. Two questions were omitted because they included testing that was outside of the scope of practice for the student nurse. The original SCCS Cronbach’s alpha indicated high internal consistency. The subscales had a “strong construct validity and internal consistency” and good test–retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453330">van Leeuwen et al., 2009</xref>, p. 2864). The revised tool had Cronbach’s alpha of .90, indicating high internal consistency.</p>

<title>Class Format</title>
<p>As is our standard, the students received the scenario mapping a week prior to their simulation session. The simulation typically began with a prebriefing. As students arrived for class, they were provided with written information about providing spiritual care to patients based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453330">Joint Commission (2009)</xref> recommendations. Case study examples of nurses providing spiritual care were reviewed. The students already had the details of the simulation scenario. The scenario was of a young single mom who had just given birth without support at the bedside. She had also experienced the death of her 18-month-old a year prior who had fallen out of the window in her apartment. She was now homeless and living in a shelter and her family was not supportive and had not been in contact with her for over a year. There was much discussion with the nursing students about her situation, as nurses must be mindful of their own biases that they bring to their patient encounters. The information about providing spiritual care was infused throughout the prebriefing scenario. Together faculty and students explored the cultural considerations, and students were encouraged to move beyond the boundaries of their personal religious backgrounds to provide spiritual care to patients with a variety of cultures and beliefs. Faculty gave students ideas for questions they could use to elicit information about the patient’s general spiritual needs, such as “What gives you meaning in your life,” in order to determine what each patient finds meaningful. Faculty also gave students information on how to elicit specific information, such as “Do you find any religious or spiritual practice helpful in times of stress”? Students were encouraged to incorporate these strategies when providing care to their patients. The class took place in the college’s simulation laboratory. The scenario was acted out in role-play by students and faculty.</p>
<p>Specific questions we reviewed came from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453330">Joint Commission (2009)</xref> recommendations for spiritual assessment, for example:</p>
<list id="list1-0898010112453330" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Who or what provides the patient with strength and hope?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the patient use prayer in her life?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the patient express her spirituality?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How would the patient describe her philosophy of life?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What type of spiritual/religious support does the patient desire?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the name of the patient’s clergy, minister, Imam, chaplain, pastor, rabbi?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does suffering mean to the patient?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does dying mean to the patient?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the patient’s spiritual goals?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a role of church/synagogue in the patient’s life?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does your faith help the patient cope with illness?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the patient keep going day after day?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What helps the patient get through this health care experience?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How has illness affected the patient and his or her family?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The faculty told students that they could be expected to describe how to elicit the information from the patient and to support the patient’s needs. They were given strategies for how to respond to patients to best meet their needs by use of nonjudgmental questions designed to elicit information about their spiritual needs. Discussion included the role of the chaplain, and students were encouraged to use the chaplain in the scenario if necessary.</p>
<p>The students were exposed to the same unfolding scenario and had an opportunity to share their feelings during the group debriefing that followed the simulation. Overwhelmingly, the students reported feeling much more comfortable in discussing spirituality with their patients after engaging in the simulation exercise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112453330">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Data were collected via the pre-and posttests. Data analysis was completed using SPSS 18.0, and the tests were applied according to subscale. The data were not normally distributed, so the study team used the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test to determine statistical significance. An alpha of <italic>p</italic> = .05 was set for statistical power. There are some limitations to this study. Students completed the pretest at the start of the lab session and the posttest immediately after the simulation exercise. It might have been beneficial to allow for a greater amount of time between the pre- and posttests in order to decrease any test–retest bias. In addition, the sample size was small and limited to students in nursing from one institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010112453330">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of the participating students was 26.4 years. The majority (66%) held previous college degrees, and 22.6% were traditional undergraduate students. More than 37% had never taken a course on spirituality. Approximately 67% indicated an affiliation with the Christian faith. None of these factors were demonstrated to have an effect on the students’ scores or on their responses on the SCCS. However, the inclusion of the simulation intervention did make a significant change in the students’ pre–post scores on the SCCS. Following the class, there were positive changes in students’ attitudes toward patient spirituality (<italic>p</italic> = .001), in obtaining referrals (<italic>p</italic> = .000), in assessment of spiritual needs (<italic>p</italic> = .000), and in support (<italic>p</italic> = .000). The students reported that discussing spirituality during the session helped them think more about this dimension of care. Many students stated that following the simulation exercise, they were more aware of spirituality being a part of patients’ experiences in many and varied situations and that they will be more attuned to discussing this topic during their interactions with patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112453330">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings reveal a statistically significant increase in student nurses’ spiritual care perceived competency scores after the instruction session. Recommendations for future research include repeating the study with a nonrandom control group as well as recommending a time delay in implementing the posttest in future studies. Additionally, investigators conducting future studies should examine the relationship between spiritual education and spiritual care in the clinical environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898010112453330">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Proving spiritual care has recommended as one of the standards of nursing care. Nurses must have the ability to provide spiritually competent care to their patients. Our patients expect this of us. As educators, we must go beyond the initial inclusion of spirituality in our nursing fundamentals course. Spiritual care education should be discussed at all levels of instruction and across the life span. Including spiritual care concepts into simulation scenarios is a useful and easy way of incorporating this important concept into the educational programs for our future nurses.</p>
