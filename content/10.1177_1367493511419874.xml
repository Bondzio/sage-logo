<abstract>
<p>In Australia, Community Child Health Services (CCHS) is the primary health care service which seeks to strengthen and support families, prevent illness and manage risks. Several nursing models of care exist within CCHS, and limited research has investigated which is the best way to provide child health surveillance and parenting support during the early years. This study qualitatively explored the everyday lived experience of parents and child health nurses involved with an open-access (appointment-free, parent-led) group child health surveillance clinic. Findings showed that participants considered the open-access clinic provided a helpful and supportive way of delivering child health surveillance and parental support to families with infants aged 0–18months, without identified risk factors. The perspectives of multiple parents, nurses and other health workers found it effective, flexible and parent-directed, which may be in contrast to some traditional individual appointment child health surveillance methods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The health of a society is directly linked to the health of its families:<disp-quote>
<p>The family, as the fundamental group in society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493511419874">OHCHR, 1989</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote>Supporting families as they adjust to early parenting can be a difficult and stressful time and has been described as living in a new and overwhelming world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511419874">Nystrom and Ohrling, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the early years of a child’s life strongly influence their competence in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511419874">Hertzman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511419874">Keating and Hertzman, 1999</xref>). How health professionals work with families to support them through this transition and maximise children’s health potential in these early years requires a strong evidence base.</p>
<p>There are a number of titles for child and family health care services in community settings in Australia, and in Queensland, where this study was conducted, they are known as Community Child Health Services (CCHS). CCHS seek to strengthen and support families, prevent illness and manage risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511419874">Barnes and Rowe, 2007</xref>). Several nursing models of care exist within CCHS and while research has affirmed the effectiveness of intensive nursing support to improve the health of vulnerable families to reduce child abuse and neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511419874">Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>), a paucity of research in relation to the needs of the universal population, and how best to provide child health surveillance services to this group exists. Furthermore, it is unclear which child health service approaches are valued and perceived as helpful by the families that use them.</p>
<p>Traditionally, universal child health nursing services have been offered to families as individual consultations with a child health nurse (CHN) via a clinic-based appointment system at which infant growth and development assessments are conducted. However, due to the increasing volume of resource-intensive programmes (such as home visiting for vulnerable families), innovative models of care delivery, such as group-based approaches, have been implemented in some services.</p>
<p>Group approaches to health promotion provide a resource-efficient alternative to solely individualised care and have been found to be effective in the management of a variety of health conditions, such as obesity, smoking and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511419874">Baldwin, 2006</xref>). Advantages to the group approach, when compared to individual appointments, include provision of thorough health care information and education, skill development and peer support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511419874">Baldwin, 2006</xref>). Three studies were identified in a search of the literature which investigated group approaches to well-child health surveillance.</p>
<p>In the United States of America, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511419874">Rice and Slater (1997)</xref> examined an alternative method of well-child consultation in a group setting and compared it to the traditional appointment method. Their analysis revealed that the group method was at least as good as the individual method in addressing parental learning, recognition of maternal depressive symptoms, perceived maternal support, and conveyed infant care, growth and development. However, this study was based on child health supervision provided by paediatricians as opposed to CHNs, which makes the findings difficult to generalise to a nurse-led setting. In the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511419874">Lee et al. (2003)</xref> assessed a group approach to 2-year-old developmental assessments. Eighty-four families participated and interviews were also conducted with the nursing staff. Overall, the authors concluded that the group approach was practicable and workable and that overwhelmingly parents preferred it to the individual appointment approach due to the discussion with other parents and sharing of issues. The study limitations included a relatively small sample size, with purposive sampling, and exclusion of any other child health surveillance activities or alternate age assessments. The authors recommended a larger study to investigate group approaches and their economic use of time and staff, as well as the social benefits to parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511419874">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another English study examined a group-based 18-month- and 3-year-old developmental assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511419874">Brooks et al., 1993</xref>). The group approach was commenced in response to heavy caseloads and the introduction of a new framework which specified an approach to child health surveillance incorporating health promotion, parental involvement and professional judgement based on normal patterns of development, rather than checklist assessments. Most parents preferred the group approach and key findings were that it allowed health visitors to draw upon parental expertise; parents were exposed to a range of normal development as demonstrated by the numerous toddlers playing together; and parental reassurance and areas for concern was highlighted. Also, attendance uptake rates were comparable in both group and individual appointment approaches. While these findings are useful to inform practice, they are limited by the small size and age of the sample, and by the fact that it was an English service operating quite differently to those in Australia.</p>
<p>There is limited research available to inform the use of group programmes within child health care, and, in Australia, research into how best to deliver child health surveillance services to the universal population has not been conducted, and neither parental nor health professional experience has been explored.</p>
<p>The setting for this study was a child health surveillance clinic in South-East Queensland, Australia in which a group-based approach was implemented as an alternative to the traditional one-to-one appointment-based model. Known as the Open-Access Clinic (OAC), the service is appointment-free, and parents may ‘drop-in’ for brief consultations with the CHN to discuss maternal/child health issues, such as breastfeeding difficulties or infant growth and developmental assessments, at a time convenient to them. The OAC also incorporates appointment-free immunisation and breastfeeding clinics and a first-time early parenting group, which operate alongside it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1367493511419874">
<title>Study purpose</title>
<p>This study was the second phase of a larger study to investigate the efficacy, quality and perceived value of an Australian open-access child health surveillance service: the OAC. The first phase compared attendance rates and outcomes pre- and post-OAC implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511419874">Kearney et al., 2008</xref>) and the final phase was a prospective cohort study of attendees. The purpose of this phase was to understand what the OAC means to those involved with it, and to gain insight into their everyday experience of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367493511419874">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Phenomenology has been described as a philosophy which may be used to underpin qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511419874">Fleming et al., 2003</xref>). Essentially, its goal is to understand the nature of a phenomenon from the perspective of those directly experiencing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511419874">Connelly, 2010</xref>). It involves the study of lived experience, description of experiential meanings, and the search for what it means to be human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511419874">Connelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493511419874">Wojnar and Swanson, 2007</xref>). Each approach within phenomenology advocates intense reflection on the phenomenon – the hallmark of phenomenology – to ‘determine the nature of things themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511419874">Caelli, 2000</xref>: 375). Since the intention of this study was to explore the nature of the OAC, it employed North American phenomenology, which focuses on the exploration and description of everyday experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511419874">Dinkel, 2005</xref>). Analysis enables the description of lived experiences within the context of a participant’s culture rather than searching for universal meaning, and negates the need to conduct an extensive analysis of the impact culture may have had on this experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367493511419874">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>A purposive sample of stakeholders, with first-hand experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511419874">Streubert Speziale and Carpenter, 2007</xref>) of the OAC was obtained. It was comprised of clients (mothers; <italic>n</italic> = 12), and providers of the service: CHNs (<italic>n</italic> = 14), early intervention parenting specialists (<italic>n</italic> = 3), midwives (<italic>n</italic> = 9), and others whose role required their occasional engagement with the service: allied health professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 9), Australian Breastfeeding Association members (<italic>n</italic> = 4), general practitioners (<italic>n</italic> = 2), paediatricians (<italic>n</italic> = 2), pharmacy baby clinic nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and Department of Child Safety officers (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Participants were selected on the basis that they had a significant involvement with the OAC and were knowledgeable about it.</p>
<p>Data were collected from November 2006 through to June 2007. Participants were interviewed using a range of methods: individual face-to-face interview, individual telephone interview, and focus groups. Although, traditionally, individual interviews are used most often in phenomenological inquiry, time constraints in relation to the number of participants, did not allow this. Furthermore, the busy lives and tight appointment schedules of some participants necessitated the use of telephone interviews. Focus groups are an effective method of collecting data and have been used previously in phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511419874">Conneeley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511419874">McDonald and Brown, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were asked to respond based upon their personal experiences. On average, one-to-one interviews took around 30 minutes and focus groups lasted up to one hour. Both were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Consistent with the phenomenological approach used, data were analysed thematically to recover themes embodied in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367493511419874">Van Manen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethical approval was granted for the study by the district Human Research Ethics Committee (4/05N) the university ethics board. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493511419874">National Health and Medical Research Council (2007)</xref> ethical guidelines were adhered to throughout and all participants provided voluntary consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367493511419874">
<title>Findings and discussion</title>
<p>Analysis of the data revealed several themes, each reflecting the perceptions and experiences of the participants. Verbatim responses are used to illustrate the participants’ personal experiences and these are discussed in the context of published literature.</p>
<sec id="section6-1367493511419874">
<title>Purpose of the OAC</title>
<p>The OAC’s purpose was described by many participants and varied according to their individual background and experience. Some participants described it as ‘a kind of triage process’, inferring that it is designed for relatively quick, straightforward consultations, and if more than that is required by a family, then it is their first ‘port-of-call’ on their way to linking with other services. Another role of the OAC was supporting well babies and their parents, with general parenting needs. One first-time, young mother described her experience:<disp-quote>
<p>And they give me regular check-ups on him. You know the weigh-in and that, and you can sort of keep an eye on things … so that helped me a lot.</p>
</disp-quote>The mothers shared experiences of the nurses enquiring about their own needs, demonstrating that the purpose of the OAC was not just to cater for the baby’s needs.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think I was shocked the first time I got asked how I was ... she said, ‘How are you?’ and I thought, ****, I can’t answer that question. I don’t think I know how I am … because I hadn’t thought about me for a long time …</p>
</disp-quote>The OAC was not perceived by the participants as a service ‘just to weigh babies’. It was not just simple measurements that clients came for, but rather holistic support in their parenting. Some CCHS are providing ‘self weigh’ facilities, which would not reflect what parents in this study have identified they want from a child health surveillance service. In addition to this the literature has demonstrated that uninformed weight monitoring without any targeted support can have detrimental effects, both on population and individual breastfeeding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511419874">McKie et al., 2006</xref>). Yet, what the participants in this study were stating was that ‘getting the baby weighed’ was often simply an avenue for parents to seek more holistic parenting support, reassurance and referrals to other services, for more specific needs, such as psychosocial support or developmental concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511419874">Flowers (2008)</xref>, also found that parents valued accessible child health support to ‘touch base’ for brief consultations with a trusted carer. While Flowers’ (2008) study explored child health nursing practice in pharmacy baby clinics, rather than community child health clinics, this similarity confirms that this ‘drop-in’ informal style may be sufficient to meet the health support needs of some parents. However, the advantage of the OAC, in comparison to the pharmacy baby clinic was the immediate and well-linked referral options. While the past 10 years have seen a strong focus on targeted services to families at-risk, and subsequently limited resources for the universal population, recent Australian government reports reflect a shift, and are now recommending universal child and family health services ‘provide a schedule of core contacts to allow for engagement with parents, advice and support, and periodic health monitoring (with contacts weighted towards the first three years of life) ... and support for parenting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511419874">Australian Government, 2009</xref>: 20). This paradigm shift appears to be supportive of the important role which child health services play in supporting families to achieve the best start possible.</p>
<p>The current recommendations by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493511419874">National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (2002)</xref> are that infants receive routine weight monitoring at birth, at 6–8 weeks, and at 8–12 months, as part of standard clinical care. At present, there is a lack of strong evidence supporting or negating the validity of routine weight monitoring outside these times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493511419874">NHMRC, 2002</xref>). This is where it is essential to have health professional supported growth monitoring clinics, to assist parents in the <italic>interpretation</italic> of the infant’s growth and development.</p>
<p>The OAC was described as one part of the overall service, which CCHS offer to support families with young infants and children. Yet very limited literature is available investigating which services are effective, or if there is a mismatch between services offered and services required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493511419874">Oberklaid et al., 2003</xref>). In light of this, it was important to understand what meaning the OAC service has to those accessing it. Therefore, this theme has highlighted the value mothers in this study placed on the accessibility of qualified CHNs, with whom they could ‘just drop in’ and talk to regarding their infant’s growth and developmental needs. However, parents deemed the service just as valuable in terms of their own care, appreciating the support and reassurance they received from the CHNs. It was also important to note that individual services were still valued by the health professionals interviewed in this study and the wider literature has supported that some parents also value this individual care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511419874">Kruske et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, while the OAC has reduced lengthy waiting times for individual consultations, consideration for varying needs and parental preferences for more private or individualised care remain important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367493511419874">
<title>Adjusting to parenting</title>
<p>Many mothers and fathers experience a difficult and challenging transition to parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511419874">Nystrom and Ohrling, 2004</xref>). The mothers participating in this study shared similar experiences. One first-time mother, who experienced significant post-natal depression stated:<disp-quote>
<p>… he would not stop crying at all ... So, all those thoughts of ‘I can’t do this’…</p>
</disp-quote>Another new mother was very expressive when sharing her experience of coming home, and conveyed some of the stress and difficulty she experienced once at home with the new baby:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was overwhelming to just go home … I didn’t shed one tear in labour, but all the tears with cracked nipples and all those sort of [post-natal] things …</p>
</disp-quote>Many of the mothers identified a strong need for reassurance that they were ‘doing the right thing’ with their children.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was just nice to come here and know that she wasn’t totally abnormal, you know … and that there’s another parent out there.</p>
</disp-quote>Support is significantly related to confidence in infant care practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367493511419874">Warren, 2005</xref>) and key relationships, particularly with partners and parents, have been identified as crucial to increasing a mother’s confidence and competence in parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511419874">Nystrom and Ohrling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367493511419874">Warren, 2005</xref>). From the everyday experiences of these two mothers it is clear that the early weeks of parenting are emotionally and physically difficult, and this can be interpreted as reflecting a lack of parental confidence in their own resource and ability. This adjustment to parenting is a crucial time for health professionals to offer accessible, meaningful and helpful support. A recent Australian study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511419874">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>), found that few first-time mothers felt well prepared for the demands of parenting, thus suggesting that current approaches to parenting preparedness are not meeting maternal needs. The authors suggest a move away from content driven antenatal education to mother-to-mother support, in an environment which places the woman as the expert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511419874">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>), and which subsequently would see the health professional as a partner in the learning process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367493511419874">
<title>Nurse–client relationship</title>
<p>The clients shared many experiences of the impact that nurses’ comments, advice, listening and availability had on their parenting. The importance of a therapeutic relationship between nurses and their clients is well documented across many spheres of nursing practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511419874">Hawes, 2005</xref>). One mother, with a ‘high-needs’ infant shared the significance of her relationship with a particular nurse:<disp-quote>
<p>… just everything, Olivia [the CHN] was my life saver … literally with [my daughter] Alice, it was really good just to come here and go, yep everything’s good, but … I don’t think I could have got through the first 12 months, literally, without her.</p>
</disp-quote>The importance of a continued relationship with the client was evidenced in the following quote from a very experienced CHN:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve also found that having the same people, you know I can tell when someone is not quite themselves, that something is going on with them because you’ve had so many visits and I feel that you do create a good relationship, so you can say, ‘Hey, you’re not yourself today, what’s going on?’ and often they will tell you.</p>
</disp-quote>Several nurses drew attention to the fact that time constraints in the OAC may affect the quality of the rapport with clients. As one nurse explained:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>And that’s where you’ve really got to be open and friendly and hopefully not too rushed and pushed to get that rapport instantly with the client. And if you don’t, well you don’t. And you just have to learn to next time do it better, try again, explore issues. And a lot of it depends on how busy we are, whether we’ve got the time or the energy …</p>
</disp-quote>However, the clients did not always perceive that nurses felt pressurised or rushed. In fact, it was often the opposite:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She [the nurse] makes you feel like you’re the only person to see, and there might be 10 people around. She may say, ‘Your hair looks great today’ and you’re like, ‘Oh, thanks!’ Just those little things make you feel like someone’s taking an interest in you</p>
</disp-quote>Parental self-confidence has been associated with improved health status, for example in increased breastfeeding initiation and duration rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511419874">Dennis, 2006</xref>). Therefore if parents’ confidence is enhanced through attendance at the OAC, an expected link would be seen in the improved health status of the infant and family as a consequence.</p>
<p>This support should not be undervalued. A recent Scandinavian study demonstrated that when parents were not well supported or treated as equal partners in care within child health clinics, parents were not provided with effective support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367493511419874">Tammentie et al., 2009</xref>). This Scandinavian study found support for postnatal depression inadequate by CHNs if there was a lack of individuality with care, a lack of a continuing relationship with the nurse, or a lack of confidentiality, and that the individual CHN’s personality was the crucial factor in obtaining good nursing care. This affirms the value of having consistent staffing within the clinic, to ensure a continuing helpful relationship is established between parent and nurse. While mothers with postnatal depression highly valued the good support they received, so too did the vast majority of well mothers who participated in the focus groups. There is significant evidence in the current literature on the benefits of continuity of care, including improved patient satisfaction, immunisation attendance, reductions in emergency room attendance and hospitalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511419874">Benson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511419874">Christakis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511419874">Jee and Cabana, 2006</xref>). This study found continuity of care consistently important amongst the participants, similar to the wider literature in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1367493511419874">
<title>Complex situations, pressure and time</title>
<p>The OAC was designed for relatively straightforward client consultations. However, due to the ‘drop-in’ style of the service, one CHN commented that this was not always the case: ‘Even though it’s a well baby clinic, they’re not always a well baby, and that can be difficult’.</p>
<p>Nurses frequently described experiences that demonstrated their ability to handle complex, delicate, and unpredictable situations. However, difficult cases can increase time management pressures and this may have implications relating to workload. Australian nurses have identified heavy workloads, high work-stress and difficulty completing their work in the available time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511419874">Hegney et al., 2006</xref>) and similar issues were identified by some CHNs in this study. The nurses identified that having the ‘back-up’ of another nurse as absolutely essential. However, management of high workloads was sometimes difficult due to limited staffing. While the nurses felt the pressures of workloads the mothers did not perceive this to be so, and it did not appear to impact on their impression of the care they received:<disp-quote>
<p>... they don’t feel the pressure … Yeah, so at least they’re doing the right thing. And if you’ve still got more questions they will continue on offering more solutions, so I think that that’s really good.</p>
</disp-quote>At the time of introduction of the OAC there was a 6–8-week waiting time for a CHN individual consultation. Anecdotal evidence from colleagues suggests that this remains the situation in many universal community child health services throughout south-east Queensland, Australia. This results in limited accessibility, and may lead to compounded parenting difficulties. Since the introduction of the OAC at the study site, the waiting time for individual appointments has significantly decreased.</p>
<p>Nurses identified that first-time mothers with a young infant required a longer consultation time. The early weeks of parenting (especially first-time parents), is a time when support has been widely identified as invaluable and necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511419874">Mercer and Walker, 2006</xref>). This has subsequent implications as to whether the OAC is the best method of servicing first-time parents in the early weeks. Possible specific early parenting groups (targeting first-time parents with young infants) could run alongside the OAC to take the pressure off the nurses and also provide increased time to support parents, with the opportunity to develop parent-to-parent meaningful relationships. Specially designed new parent groups have been researched within Australia and found to play an important role in child and family health services, specifically in the areas of mother-to-mother support and psychosocial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511419874">Guest and Keatinge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511419874">Kruske et al., 2004</xref>). This would also relieve a significant proportion of the workload from the CHNs working in the OAC.</p>

<title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>The participants experienced the OAC with positive regard and perceived it as a helpful and supportive way to deliver child health surveillance and parental support to families with infants aged 0–18 months, without identified child protection risk factors. The perspectives of multiple parents, nurses and other health workers were thematically analysed, based on their actual everyday experiences of the service and found it effective, flexible and parent-directed, which may be in contrast to some traditional individual appointment child health surveillance methods. This finding is especially important with respect to resources available for CCHS in Australia (both fiscal and human) because the OAC model provides an economically advantageous alternative to traditional individual services, whilst maintaining a high standard of service delivery. This may have national and international clinical implications, yet due to the context specific, qualitative nature of this inquiry, it is not intended that the findings display generalised meaning regarding open-access care delivery methods. However, the study does generate important insight into the health needs and values of parents with young infants, which may inform thoughtful examination of the appropriateness of current service models within contemporary child health care.</p>
